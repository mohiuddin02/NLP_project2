PITTSBURGH â€” A long list of schools have been struck by violent student attacks in recent years. Officials say to prevent killings at schools, students should be taught alternatives to violence. Mental-health services, such as counselors, should be made more available.

But officials say limiting school violence has been held back by a lack of money. At the same time, school-safety programs haven't worked. Schools have failed to properly train teachers and students, they say.

"We're 15 years after Columbine, and you'd have thought we would have solved that problem," said John Matthews, who runs the Community Safety Institute in Texas. He's referring to the 1999 rampage at Columbine High School in Colorado. In that attack, seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fatally shot 12 students and a teacher. Then the two killers took their own lives.

A new Vanderbilt University study suggests teaching younger students "conflict-resolution skills." Such skills would help kids to think before they act. The study found this could have more success than other methods for reducing violence.

## "Starting In Preschool"

Manny Sethi, a Vanderbilt professor and doctor, was involved with the study. He said it may be necessary to teach those problem-solving skills before high school.

"At that point, it's very hard to kind of change behavior," Sethi said.

Conflict-resolution skills may very well help. Yet, demand also is growing for improved mental-health services in and out of school.

"There's a lot of hurting kids in our schools," said Beverly Kingston. She runs the Center for the Study of the Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Like Sethi, Kingston said the earlier that kids are helped, the better. "We need to put in place social-emotional learning programs, starting in preschool," she said.

After the mass stabbings at Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pa., Gov. Tom Corbett spoke about the need for mental-health services. But mental-health professionals in Pennsylvania schools say cuts in money recently have reduced the number of school counselors.

## Many Measures Tried

Steven Berkowitz is a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He said politicians often follow school killings with speeches about dealing with mental-health problems. The problem is they don't follow up with laws or get around to paying for them, he said.

U.S. Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania has been encouraging Congress to fix mental-health services. He's pushing for a new law called the Helping Families in Crisis Mental Health Act. If passed, it would make mental health help available to kids through their regular doctors.

Violent acts in schools are rarely done in the heat of the moment, Murphy said. Many had "been developing over a long period of time." He says this offers opportunities to step in to fix the problems before they become a crisis.

Schools have embraced a variety of measures to keep schools safe. They've tried everything from anti-bullying and zero-tolerance programs to metal detectors and programs that allow students to report threats.

But some programs simply don't work, Sethi said. The Vanderbilt team first reviewed 27 school-safety programs nationwide. His team picked one that seemed best and tried it in a Nashville middle school known for violence problems.

## "Understanding Conflict"

Before the study, the students completed a list of questions regarding their beliefs about violence and ability to manage explosive situations. Over several weeks, students tried role-playing exercises. The idea was that they learn how to avoid violence at heated moments. They worked through scenarios including when one student calls another a name, or hits on someone's girlfriend.

Sethi said the exercises helped students in "understanding conflict and how it progresses and how to get yourself out of it."

After the exercises, students filled out a second list of questions. Students reported that they were less likely than before to be a target of bullying, and less likely to hit or push others. They were also less likely to cheer if a fight broke out and more likely to try to prevent a fight.

Schools may be able to identify students who seem troubled. Yet, even then students often don't get the help they need, especially not regularly and for a long enough time, Matthews said. He said Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people and himself during a 2007 shooting rampage at Virginia Tech, received care and monitoring at home.

"When he went to college, that was all out the door, and you saw that downward spiral," Matthews said.
