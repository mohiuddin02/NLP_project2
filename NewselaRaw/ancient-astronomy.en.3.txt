A shoebox-size chunk of bronze called the Antikythera Mechanism has scientists and people who study math excited.

It was pulled from an ancient shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera in 1901. Back then, it did not attract much attention. Archaeologists had their hands full with other things found on the shipwreck, including life-size statues of warriors and horses.

But now, more than a hundred years later, scientists say the bronze chunk was the biggest treasure of all.

## "The Amazing Thing"

The device is made up of a series of gears. The gears fit together. They were designed to predict eclipses, or when the moon's shadow moves across the Earth. People using the device could also figure out the positions of the sun, moon and planets as they moved across the sky.

The machine was built 2,000 years ago. Nobody had thought that people knew enough to make something like it that long ago. Some scholars describe the Antikythera Mechanism as the world's first analog computer.

"The amazing thing is the mechanical engineering," says James Evans. He is a scientist and historian. Evans is a member of an international group working to figure out the device's origins and purpose. Evans recently suggested the device came from 205 B.C. That would make it as much as a century older than previously believed.

If he's right, it is likely that the Antikythera Mechanism was inspired by the work of Archimedes. He is a legendary Greek mathematician.

It would also mean the device was built when scientific traditions from many cultures were coming together. They were mixing to form a new view of the stars and planets.

"Pushing the date back is exciting," Evans said. "It could change the picture of the development of Greek astronomy."

Scientists think the ship sunk around 60 B.C.

## Gears, Dials And Writing

Greek sponge divers stumbled across the wreck of the Roman ship in 1900. Divers dug up items from the wreck the next year.

French explorer Jacques Cousteau visited the site in the 1950s and 1970s. He used an underwater vacuum to uncover buried objects.

Archaeologists eventually identified more than 80 pieces believed to be part of the Antikythera Mechanism. They included a shoebox-size piece. It had dials and gears clearly visible on the surface.

The real breakthrough in understanding came in 2005. Then, a team of scientists used X-rays to reveal the layers of gears inside the crust-covered metal. Other methods yielded the first sharp images of the writing on the dials.

The studies revealed at least 30 gears. Researchers believe the device held at least two dozen more.

The gears were housed in a wooden box. It was operated by a hand crank. Elaborate dials traced the movement of planets and stars. Meanwhile, special gears mimicked the fluctuating speeds at which the moon crosses the night sky. This is more amazing because the ancient Greeks did not know anything about the moon's curving orbit.

One dial plotted the four-year cycle of Olympic Games. Another one predicted the timing of eclipses of the sun and moon.

That was the dial that Evans and Christian Carman focused on for their new study.

## Looking At Eclipse Dates

Previous estimates said the device was built between 150 and 100 B.C. The estimates were based on the style of the Greek lettering on the device. But Evans and Carman looked at the device like scientists who study stars and planets. They compared eclipse dates on the device to historical records of when eclipses happened.

They concluded that the "start date" for the eclipse predictor was 205 B.C.

That doesn't prove the device was built then, but Evans thinks it was.

The 205 B.C. date is important. It means the device was built around the lifetime of Archimedes. He was the Greek genius who revolutionized geometry and invented compound pulleys. Archimedes was killed in 212 B.C. during the Roman conquest of the Greek city state of Syracuse in Sicily.

But the famous inventor died seven years before 205 B.C., and there's no way to link him to the Antikythera Mechanism.

"People should be leery of trying to associate it with any one particular person," Evans said. "But you would have to think that whoever built this must at least have made use of what Archimedes had done, or came out of a tradition that started with Archimedes."
