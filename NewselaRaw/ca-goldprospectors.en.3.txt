KERN RIVER CANYON, Calif. — Gold hunter David Fiori stood waist-deep in the Kern River. He stuck his shovel in the river bottom. As he tossed the muck downstream, his eyes wandered to a spot across the water.

A perfect place for finding gold.

He couldn't get to the spot. Not on this day. The water was too deep and too fast — but soon. California is in the third year of a severe drought. According to a study, 2013 was the driest year since the 1500s. The drought has lowered the level of rivers and creeks. So a new wave of gold hunters are able to get to spots that haven't been reached in years.

"That's where I'm going next, as soon as I can," Fiori said, nodding toward the other side of the river. "Another couple months, this thing will be down to a trickle. It's going to be amazing."

## Wading In The River

This summer is expected to be hot. Many jobs have been lost and there won't be much water for raising crops.

But for gold prospectors, it's a great year for hunting for gold.

Gold prices are high. Gold costs more than $1,250 an ounce. Mining supply stores have seen a big increase in sales. And many people are signing up for gold prospecting class. The gold bug is even spreading to dry areas.

During the real gold rush in the mid-1800s, about 300,000 people came to California looking for gold. There was more gold then. Prospectors were sometimes able to bend down and pluck gold nuggets off the ground.

What's going on today is less like a rush. It's more like a fever.

"It's not the normal, that's for sure,"  said Farris Farnsworth. "If somebody was to walk up and see us down here, they'd probably think we were a little nuts."

## Straining The Muck

Most days, you wouldn't find anyone around here. But on this morning, nine people stood shoulder to shoulder in the middle of the river, panning for gold. The shore was littered with buckets, mining pans and shovels.

"Not all that long ago, this would have been underwater," said Jeanne Nelle.

The opening to the river was a mud bath, and people climbed back to land by grabbing onto overhead branches.

"It's not for everybody," Farnsworth said. "If it was easy, everybody would be doing it."

Prospectors strained muck from the bottom of the river through large metal trays. They were trying to get the "black sand," the stuff close to the river bottom. Gold is heavy. It is eight times heavier than sand and 19 times heavier than water. It sinks to the bottom of the muck.

"The gold just sits there and waits for somebody to get it — like me," said Adolph Lostaunau.

## Sifting The Black Sand

The black sand was taken to the river banks. There, it was sifted, handful by handful. It was swirled with water until the prospectors could "see color." That's what they call tiny flakes of gold.

Prospectors see gold just about every time. But actual nuggets are almost never found. Typically, the luckiest prospectors find a "picker." That's what they call a gold flake heavy enough to make a tiny ping when it lands in a mining pan. But they always have hope they'll find a big one.

"I (once) found one that big," said Jay O'Dell. He held up a small pebble. O'Dell has been panning for gold for about 40 years. He made a pendant out of his nugget.

Today, the gold in his pan wouldn't earn enough money to pay for gas to get home. But you never know when you'll find a big one. And that hope is what has drawn prospectors to these rivers for a long time.

"Grab a pan, man, and jump in," Farnsworth called over his shoulder. "You never know — you might get you a big old nugget."
