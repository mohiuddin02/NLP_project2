LOS ANGELES â€” A new study is telling older people to just get up and move.

It's not enough for older people to exercise to stay healthy, the study found. Researchers say it's also important not to spend too much time sitting down.

In fact, for people over 60, every extra hour of sitting nearly doubles the risk of health problems. That stays true no matter how much exercise they got. The study was published Wednesday in the Journal of Physical Activity &amp; Health. Researchers came from four universities and a government group called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

People who do even 30 minutes of light exercise can improve their health, researchers said. They found that too much sitting was linked to problems like heart disease.

## Health And Habits Survey

Many people think they need to exercise 150 minutes a week to stay healthy. This is based on a U.S. government suggestion.

Apparently not so.

Experts have thought that people spend too much time sitting because they don't exercise. The researchers wanted to see if sitting itself causes health problems.

The researchers studied 2,286 people who were at least 60 years old. The information about them came from a national health survey. It included information about their health and habits. Researchers collected information about their activity levels.

The people in the study spent almost nine hours a day sitting down. This is out a total of 14 hours spent awake. Many of them reported health problems. A small number of them had trouble moving. These problems included getting in and out of bed, getting dressed and being able to walk around the house.

Researchers discovered many things about people who sit too much. Older men sit more than women. Sitters tend to be more educated and with less money. They are more likely to smoke and be in bad health.

## People Should Sit Less ...

Sitting has been getting a lot of attention lately. There's even a new saying: "Sitting is the new smoking." The study's authors say that everyone should sit less. They suggest that people exercise while watching TV and at work. People also should take walks and stand at their desks.

"The real problem is that we are raising ([inactive](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity)) children," said Pamela Semanik. She is one of the researchers. She teaches at Rush College of Nursing in Chicago.

Semanik's coworkers have changed their ways. They are now on their feet more, she said. They know problems that come from too much sitting. Semanik has sold her car and reads articles while walking on a treadmill.

Up to 5 million deaths each year may be linked to too much sitting.

So how much couch potato time is OK?

That's the big question, Semanik said. "We don't know how much is OK." But movement breaks does reduce the harm caused by too much sitting.

## ... And Move More

This is the first study that links sitting to health problems.

The researchers say people just need to to get up and move. It doesn't matter what they do once they're up. Getting older adults off the couch may be easier than getting them to exercise. This is especially true for people who already have health problems, like heart disease.

The researchers are not saying exercise is useless. It's a cheap way to be healthier. It also saves money on health care. But the study looks at very different questions, Semanik said: How can people stay out of nursing homes for elderly people? How can they take care of themselves?

A lot of daily exercise is good. And more moving and less sitting is even better.
