NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” A new government study shows that obesity is still going up among American adults. Obesity means being very overweight. The government has been trying to fight obesity for 10 years, but obesity keeps increasing.

Also, more women are obese now than men.

For the past several years, experts thought obesity had stopped increasing. Now, government health experts have put out a new report. It said that obesity was up in 2013 and 2014. Nearly 4 of 10 adults were obese, the report said.

The study seems to say obesity is getting worse, said Dr. William Dietz. He is an obesity expert. He teaches at George Washington University.

Another expert was not so sure. He is Barry Popkin from the University of North Carolina. He said to be careful when looking at the report. Popkin said people in the study could be different from other people in the country.

Experts said they did not know why more people were obese.

## New Study Actually Weighed People

The report also found more women than men were obese. Obesity rates for men and women had been nearly the same for about 10 years. The new report says many more women were obese than men.

Obesity means not just overweight. It means seriously overweight. Obesity is thought to be one of the nation's biggest health problems. It can lead to several diseases.

The new information comes from a regular government survey. The government studies about 5,000 people each year. The study is considered the best for measuring obesity. The reason is that people in the survey are actually weighed. They are not just asked what they weigh. When people are only asked about their weight, they usually say they weigh less than they really do.

## Government Urges Exercise, Eating Better

The government has been trying to fight obesity for years. It has been trying to get people to eat better and exercise. Also, people have been drinking less soda. Soda has a lot of sugar in it. Fast-food restaurants have also been offering healthier food.

The difference between the number of men and women who are obese is getting bigger. The change seems to be because of what is happening among blacks and Hispanics, said Cynthia Ogden. She wrote the study.

Obesity rates in white men and white women remain very close. The rate for black women has jumped, though. More than half of black women are obese. Only about one-third of black men are obese. The difference is also widening among Hispanic men and women.

The report also looked at obesity in children. It did not see much change. For young people ages 2 to 19, it has not changed for 10 years. About 2 in every 10 children are obese.

Health officials have been especially worried about obesity in kids. First lady Michelle Obama started a plan called Let's Move in 2010. She is trying to get kids to exercise more.

A government report last year found one possible hopeful sign. Obesity was falling among children ages 2 to 5.
