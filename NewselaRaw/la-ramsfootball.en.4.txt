HOUSTON, Texas — Los Angeles, California, does not have its own football team. The city has not had one for 21 years. 

Now the wait for a team is over. Football is coming back to Los Angeles. 

On Tuesday, team owners gathered together. Each owner owns a football team. The teams are all in the National Football League (NFL). 

The owners voted to let two teams move to Los Angeles. One is the St. Louis Rams. They will start playing later this year.

The San Diego Chargers will most likely be the second team. They have not said for sure they are coming.

## Racetrack To Become New Stadium

The teams' new home will be in Inglewood. Their new stadium will be at the old Hollywood Park racetrack. It will be the NFL's biggest sports building. Most likely it will open in 2019.

The new stadium will have 70,240 seats. It will be 175 feet tall. 

There will be a roof over the playing field to keep out rain. The roof will be see-through. 

The stadium will be open on the sides. Air will be able to come in that way. It will feel like being outside.

## Sharing A Field

The Rams will need another stadium until the new one is finished. For now they will play at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 

The Chargers would need a stadium too. There are a few places where they might play. One is Angel Stadium. Another is Dodger Stadium.

Both teams will play at the Inglewood stadium after it is finished. Builders will start working very soon.

Right now there is only one NFL stadium used by two teams. It is in East Rutherford, New Jersey. One of the teams is the New York Giants. The other is the New York Jets.
