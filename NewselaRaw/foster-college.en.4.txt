SEATTLE — Almeisha Robinson was in danger of not graduating from high school. She was having trouble with math and science. Her home life was difficult.

Robinson was in foster care. She lived with her aunt, because her parents were having problems. Many foster kids have trouble in school. Almost half of them do not graduate from high school.

Her parents never cared about her school life, Robinson said.

When she was in high school, a group called Treehouse made a huge difference in her life. The group was started in 1988 to help foster kids. Treehouse has a program called Graduation Success.

## Getting Confidence

Treehouse helped Robinson graduate. Now Robinson is turning 19 and she is looking to the future.

When she was a sophomore, Robinson began meeting with Mike Schloss. He worked with Treehouse. He became Robinson's coach, helping her figure out her goals and how to achieve them.

Schloss said that Almeisha really wanted to do well, but she did not have the confidence to reach her goals.

Robinson wants to work in the music industry. She would like to be a singer or own a music studio. She was inspired by her older brother who wanted to be a rapper. He was killed when Robinson was 7.

Robinson writes song lyrics and poetry and she plays the guitar and keyboard, She received the instruments from Treehouse.

With coaching from Schloss, Robinson was able to plan her life better. She knew she wanted a different path than her siblings and parents. Her siblings "just work," she said. They work 9 to 5, or more, just trying to survive. "Not like a real career," she said.

## A Hard Path

As a foster kid, Robinson faced a difficult path. Her childhood was tough. Her mother had problems with alcohol. She had trouble managing the house and it was always a huge mess. Robinson said it was "unlivable."

Eventually, Robinson got tired of the serious problems at home. She decided to stay with her aunt for a while. She would go back when her parents cleaned up the house. One day, officials from the state said she could not return home. Now she had to live with her aunt.

Most teenagers are excited for their first day of high school, but Robinson was worried.

She had planned to stay with her aunt for a year. But it became five years.

A stable home life is important for students. Without it, they are much more likely to drop out. Robinson said she was mostly worried about her parents, not school or her own life.

Around her junior year, she realized she was not on the right track. She did not have enough classes to graduate. And she was having trouble in math and science.

## "I Really Enjoy School"

Schloss and Robinson looked at the skills she would need to own a business like a music studio.

Robinson saw that "classes she didn't like, like math and science, were necessary for her to get what she wanted," Schloss said.

Her senior year, Robinson met with Schloss more often. She took an online class to make up the missed credit. Treehouse paid for it. Robinson also concentrated on the classes she had a harder time with.

In the end, Robinson graduated. She went to the prom, and Treehouse paid for her ticket. She even got a scholarship — money for college — for foster students. The Governor's Scholarship will pay up to $4,000 a year for her college education.

Now, Robinson is in her first year at college. She attends Seattle Central College. Robinson is taking classes in math, English and — of course — music.

"I really enjoy school right now. I'm really enjoying my classes and my teachers and just really enjoying the learning and taking advantage of what I have," she said. "I'm learning, I'm having fun. This is great."
