Heading the ball in soccer can be dangerous. If a player heads the ball too hard, they could damage their brain and suffer from a concussion. Most people thought heading the ball was the most common way a soccer player got a concussion. Now scientists think other activities in soccer matter more.

A new research study shows that most of the concussions in soccer occur when players bang into each other and play roughly. The study was published by a magazine for doctors and scientists. It was based on information reported by high school soccer coaches from 2005 to 2014.

The scientists found that heading the ball was still the most common single activity that led to a concussion. However, most concussions were caused by other forms of physical play. This rough play includes crashing into another player while defending, chasing a loose ball or receiving a pass.

## Don't Limit Heading, But Make The Play Safer

Only about a third of boys' concussions and a quarter of girls' concussions happened while heading the ball.

Dawn Comstock is a health scientist at the University of Colorado. She says stopping people from heading the ball will help lower head injuries in soccer. However, she thinks it is more important to make the game safer overall.

She says referees need to make sure dangerous play is not allowed. She also says referees must try to reduce the amount of rough play between athletes.

## Girls At Higher Risk Of Concussions Than Boys

The scientists made another finding. Female athletes were more likely to get head injuries than males. For example, in sports like soccer and basketball, girls and boys usually play by the same rules. They also use the same equipment. Comstock found a higher number of head injuries in girls in these sports.

No one is sure why this is the case. Experts have some theories though.

Perhaps girls have less neck strength than boys, so their brains get more shaken by a bang to the head, Comstock said.

Girls may be more likely to notice a head injury and report it to their coaches. Coaches and referees may be looking out for their female players more than their male players, too.

## Many More Students Are Playing Soccer

The number of students playing soccer is rising. Around 800,000 high school students played on school soccer teams in the United States in 2014. The players were both male and female. In 1969, the number of players was just 50,000. Back then they were all male.

As the game has become more popular, it has also become more dangerous. The number of head injuries has risen for both male and female players. Soccer matches have become rougher over time.

Comstock says the best way to decrease head injuries is to try to stop the amount of rough play between athletes.

"We don't have to allow soccer to turn into football," she said.

Roger Blake leads the group that governs high school sports in the state of California. He agrees that safety must come first too.

## Officials Need To Be Sure That Game Play Is Safe

"The rules are there," Blake said. "The game can be physical, but the officials have to make those calls to keep it from getting overly rough."

Parents can play their part too, Comstock said. Every kid should be encouraged to play soccer if they want. However, parents need to make sure their kids are playing for a coach who does not allow rough behavior. Kids should also play in a league that hires referees who will stop play when the athletes are too tough on each other.

Although there are risks in playing soccer, Comstock says, soccer is still good for kids.

Kids who do not play sports are more likely to suffer from health problems. "We want more kids to play sports more often," Comstock says. "We just want to keep them as safe as possible while they do so."
