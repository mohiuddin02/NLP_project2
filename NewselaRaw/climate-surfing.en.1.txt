SANTA CRUZ, Calif. — On a summer day in 1885, three Hawaiian princes surfed at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz, California. They used crudely constructed surfboards made from coastal redwoods. The Hawaiian trio introduced surfing to the North American mainland.

Modern surfers wear wet suits to stay warm and check satellite weather forecasts on their smartphones before heading to legendary surf spots such as Steamer Lane and Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz. But the newest and biggest transformation to surfing could come in the next century: the waves themselves may be changing.

A rapidly changing global climate will likely affect famous surfing spots worldwide. In California, the forecasts for Monterey Bay's famous big waves are far from certain — and far from good.

"It definitely worries me," said big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt, who has already noticed changes in water temperature and weather patterns during the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.

## Surfing Spots Could Vanish

Many of California's surfing waves come from storms out in the open ocean that send swells — sets of waves — toward the California coast. By 2100, these storms could shift, sending the swells parallel to the coast instead of toward it. The change in swells, and a dramatic rise in sea levels, could wipe out many of today's surfing spots.

To look almost 100 years into the future, scientists used global climate models. These complex computer-based predictions used past conditions, current trends, and expected greenhouse gas emissions (from burning fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas) to forecast our climate future.

Recently, researchers began to use the models to study how a warming world might affect waves, said Li Erikson, a coastal engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey in Santa Cruz.

Their findings surprised both scientists and surfers. Both groups assumed a warmer and stormier future might push more waves to the coast.

"Well, I thought so, too," Erikson said with a laugh. But storms on land may not mean higher waves along the coast, she said.

## "We'll Roll With It"

Prime surfing conditions come from a perfectly timed combination of different factors: swells of waves forming in the deep ocean, local winds, and storm fronts — all sent in just the right direction against the coast to push up perfect waves. Climate change may upset this balance.

"We'll roll with it," mused Pete Ogilvie, a Monterey Bay surfer for more than three decades. He is facing the seemingly unavoidable change with a laid-back Surf City vibe.

Climate change may affect waves in several ways. As the ocean warms and polar ice caps melt, sea levels along the Northern California coast are expected to rise between 1 1/2 and 6 feet by the end of the century. Higher sea levels will change when, where and how waves break against the coast.

"As we increase sea level … those same size waves won't break over those nice bedrock ridges in the same spots that they used to," said Curt Storlazzi, a geologist and oceanographer, with the USGS office in Santa Cruz. "They're going to break much closer to shore."

## Barriers May Do More Harm Than Good

Some communities around Monterey Bay have built barriers to protect homes and infrastructure from rising seas. In these areas, rising sea levels will eliminate low-tide surfing spots — areas where waves are best when water levels are low.

The barriers could prevent new low-tide spots from opening up.

John Dee, who has been surfing in and around the bay for 20 years, is concerned about losing the area's low-tide surf spots.

"If there's a 3-foot tide, everyone's out here," he said recently as he headed out to surf Steamer Lane. "If there's a 5-foot tide, nobody's out here."

These barriers may also contribute to beach erosion and cut off access to surfing spots.

Climate models predict larger storms and waves on the high seas, but the North Pacific swell — which creates many of the Monterey Bay's major winter waves — is expected to shift.

"As the temperature rises, especially in the Arctic, the big winter storms are moving farther north," Storlazzi said. "So areas along California are going to become less impacted from waves."

That's a bummer for local surfers — many of the bay's best waves come from North Pacific swells.

## Always A Wild Card

There is also a wild card in wave prediction. It's called El Niño, and it is nearly impossible to forecast over the long term.

El Niño brings warm and high waters to the Pacific coast. These conditions are ripe for strong storms, waves and winds to slam California directly from the southwest. That could improve surf conditions around Monterey Bay, at least temporarily.

"They hammer the shoreline," Storlazzi said. "They're the biggest and best waves."

If the predictions are true, Monterey Bay could close the 21st century with poor surfing waves. Still, the shifting climate and rising seas could create better surfing conditions along other stretches of the California coastline — there are too many variables to pinpoint where.

This mixed and uncertain future may leave some surfers grasping for hard answers. But others are taking a different view.

"When waves die in one spot and pick up in another, you move to that spot," Ogilvie said.
