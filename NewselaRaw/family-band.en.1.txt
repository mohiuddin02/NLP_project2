CHICAGO, Ill. â€” The family of young musicians took the train to downtown Chicago, lugging their instruments on their backs.

They set up their small orchestra at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Randolph Street. And for two hours on a warm weekday evening, the delicate music they played softly flowed in the bustle of rush-hour traffic.

## Surprising Sight, Cool Sounds

Passers-by stopped to listen or to snap a picture. Many were surprised by the unfamiliar sight of a group of young African-Americans playing a harp, a cello and four violins.

A bus driver, stopped at a red light, opened his door and leaned from his seat so he could better hear. A street beggar took a dollar bill from his stash and dropped it in an open violin case lined with cash. Occasionally, the musicians broke their intense concentration to offer a courteous smile to the onlookers.

Playing music for donations one or two days a week was their summer job.

By the time they boarded the train back home, the group had collected $240, which would come in handy for the family of 17.

## "Music Is Our Sanity"

With the oldest six children grown and out of the house, 11 people cram into the three-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath apartment that the family owns.

Inside the Kellys' home, music fills the small rooms, drowning out the noise from their inner city neighborhood.

"Music is our sanity in the madness," said La Shone Kelly, who is the mother of the family. "When we make music, everything is OK."

The father of the family, Jonathan Kelly, grew up in the building, where he learned to play the violin. It was his idea to introduce music to his children, he said, so that they could experience the joy and discipline it can bring.

"I know that music is best learned at an early age," Jonathan Kelly said. "Then it becomes something you can do your whole life. When we get together and sing and play, we do it for ourselves. If others enjoy it, that's a good thing."

## Personal Instruments

The children said they were given instruments based on their personality.

"I enjoy playing sad songs. I chose the cello because it's deep," said La Shone.

For Joseph, the harp was a natural fit.

"The first time I played the harp, the teacher told me to close my eyes and play whatever I felt. I just started doing it," he said. "It sounded magical to me."

La Shone Kelly admits that she was worried when her husband suggested the children start taking music lessons in 2009. That was a tough year financially, because her husband was suddenly without a job, and the family's income was at its lowest.

They spend about $1,300 each month on music lessons and renting instruments. Some of the adult siblings, including a son in the Navy, help out, but the family has had to give up a lot.

## Tremendous Financial Sacrifice

The house is in need of repairs, and the walls could use a fresh coat of paint. They shop for clothes at thrift stores, and they used to have a 15-passenger van, but now they take two cars.

La Shone Kelly said the family has made a tremendous financial sacrifice to enable their children to learn the instruments. "The children understand that if we're going to shell out that kind of money, they have to take it seriously. They have to practice."

On the second floor of the Garfield Park Fieldhouse, in a West Side neighborhood full of crime and poverty, children as young as 3 years old are learning the art of the violin. The program is Chicago West Community Music Center, and the Kellys are also enrolled.

During the school year, 50 young people from the neighborhood get an introduction to music they might otherwise never hear. They get to play music from the classical composers Bach, Vivaldi and Strauss, but also Motown, jazz and blues.

## Kids "Have A Gift"

On Saturdays, professional instructors come from across the city to teach violin, viola, cello, guitar and harp. The lessons only cost $100 a month, but the majority of the students, including the Kellys, receive scholarships to cover some costs. The only requirement is that the parents must be present.

For La Shone and Jonathan Kelly, that means a full-day commitment. But they say it has been worth it, because their children have developed a love for music.

Darlene Sandifer, who began the program with her husband, Howard Sandifer, said that music changes the heart and mind, and helps people find calm. "I am convinced that if our children had access to these kinds of opportunities, they wouldn't be running around with guns trying to kill each other," she said. "These kids on the streets have a gift. They just need someone to channel them in the right direction."

## "See The Possibilities"

Over the summer, the older students held several performances at public parks, but they drew the biggest crowd at the final performance on the last day of camp. La Shone showed off her singing voice, and her backup band included two siblings on the violin, and a third on the bass guitar.

As Jonathan and La Shone Kelly cheered their children on, they said that their sacrifice was worth it.

"We just want them to see the possibilities," their father said.
