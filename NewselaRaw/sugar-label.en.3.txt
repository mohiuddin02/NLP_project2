WASHINGTON â€” The government would like to make a small change to food labels.

The plan was announced by First Lady Michelle Obama last year. The idea is to add a line to labels on food products. The new information would say how many teaspoons of sugar have been added to each food item.

The plan has stirred up a surprising amount of protest. Candy companies and soft- drink makers are not the only ones not happy with the labeling.

The governor of Massachusetts begged the government to rethink the idea. The governor of Wisconsin also protested. Australia's government warned that the plan could break international agreements.

## Sugar Secrets Will Get Out

The opposition to the labeling shows how much extra sugar is added into even the most unlikely foods. It also shows how worried food makers are that people will find out.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering the plan. It has received 287,889 public comments on it, many of them are from large food companies and food industry groups.

Groups supporting the plan want companies to stop putting so much sugar in food. They hope that by telling people how much sugar is in a food, they will not buy it.

Food makers know this will have an impact on "how people choose their products, and that terrifies them," said Renee Sharp. She works for the Environmental Working Group. It is one of several groups trying to get the extra sugar added to food labels.

## Who Says Sugar Is Sugar?

Food industry officials say the plan is not necessary. Right now, food labels give the total amount of sugar in a product. The number includes the sugars naturally present in a food and the amount that is added. Sugar is sugar, they say. There is no evidence that shows that one type of sugar should be labeled separately.

Andrew Briscoe is the president of the Sugar Association. He wrote that science does not show a good reason for the added-sugar labeling. He said it sets a bad example.

For the government, too, the issue has become very important. Healthy eating is a huge issue for President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle.

Many food makers oppose the label change, not just candy companies.

## Cranberries Might Not Count

The cranberry industry is sounding the loudest alarm. Over the summer, it won the support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. The governors wrote to the FDA. They said that forcing food makers to say how much sugar they add to cranberry products would be unfair. Unlike other fruits, cranberries are so bitter that they would taste terrible without extra sugar.

The Campbell Soup Company made a different kind of argument. It said that letting people know how much sugar its adds to every soup can could make Americans fatter.

The information could confuse people, it wrote to the FDA. It could make them stop thinking about cutting calories. Too many calories make people gain weight, but so does too much sugar.

The Roman Meal Company, which makes whole-grain breads, has asked the FDA to drop the plan. The American Nutrition Society also joined the fight. Its members include Kellogg Company, Coca-Cola and Dannon, the yogurt maker.

## Does The Turkey Know About The Sugar?

Supporters say unhealthy amounts of sugar are secretly added to foods.

"That one line on a label seems like a small thing," said Deborah Bailin of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "But not having it covers up a very big fact that the food industry does not want people to know."

She added, "Things they want you to think are healthy are full of sugar."

The Environmental Working Group studied 80,000 food products. It found that nearly 3 out of 5 had extra sugar added. That included most deli meats on supermarket shelves.

"I was shocked," Sharp said. "I mean, it's turkey. Why is there sugar in it?"
