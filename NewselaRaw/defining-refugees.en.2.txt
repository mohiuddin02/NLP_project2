RICHMOND, Va. â€” Asein Ta followed his uncle on a dangerous three-day journey through mountains to leave his home in Myanmar. He and his uncle, hobbling on one leg, headed for a refugee camp in Thailand. Ta was not even a teenager when he had to leave his native country, also known as Burma, in Southeast Asia.

"He said there was good out there, something different," said Ta, now 21. Ta's mother sent him away so he could escape the persecution his family and other ethnic Karens faced in their native land. She died shortly after he left.

Five years later, Ta was on a plane to Virginia, helped by the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program. It is operated by the U.S. government with help from states and local charities. In nearly 35 years, the program has helped some 13,000 children from Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America escape from war and natural disasters.

The program lets the children stay in the United States and matches them with foster parents.

Ta was clearly a refugee. The question now is whether children crossing into the United States alone from Central America are refugees as well.

## Border Agents Are Overwhelmed

Some see URM as a way to help some of the unaccompanied Central American children who have been surging across the U.S. border with Mexico. In 2014, 44,000 children crossed the border alone. Fewer than 4,000 did so in 2011. There are too many incoming children for the U.S. agents at the border to handle safely.

The United Nations has argued that the Central American children are refugees who should be able to move to safety in other countries. Some have been victims of violence, kidnapping or other crimes.

The U.S. government disagrees and does not consider the children to be refugees. Getting that label would help the incoming children use the URM program to settle in the United States.

There is also the question of the program's limits. URM served 3,828 children at its peak in 1985, but today it only serves about 1,800. It is unclear whether the program could be expanded to help many of the Central American kids if they were considered to be refugees.

## What Difference Would A Label Make?

Some argue that labeling the Central American children refugees would be the surest way to get them the help they need. Kimberly Haynes works for Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, a charity that works with URM. She said there is little difference between the Central American children and refugees from other parts of the world who have used the program in the past.

Haynes says that it is scary to recognize that both the Central American children and children that have used URM in the past face the same kinds of difficulties. "The situations are pretty horrific."

The federal government pays for URM, but gives the money to states and charity groups to run it since they have most experience providing services like foster care and housing aid. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia run their own URM programs.

Through URM, states and charity groups provide health care, legal aid, education and housing to refugees.

More children have used the program in recent years. In 2011 there were 1,409 children in the program, but by 2013 there were 1,850.

## Figuring Out Their Home Country

According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement's 2012 report to Congress, one-third of the children in the program were from Latin America. Many were from the countries of Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.

The way to determine if someone is a refugee, and can use URM, is to investigate the situations in their home countries. The federal government has plans to do that more in the near future.

President Barack Obama opened the door for some children to be treated as refugees earlier this year. He said that some of the Central American children might apply in certain cases.

He cautioned, however, that being considered a refugee "is not granted just based on economic need or because a family lives in a bad neighborhood or poverty." Obama also said that it is better for people to apply to be refugees in their home countries before making the trip to America.

## Times Are Tough In Many Places

It is difficult for many of the Central American children to qualify for the URM program. Finding those who might be without family entirely is even more challenging, said Kristyn Peck of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. "They're not necessarily going to come forth and say, 'I'm a refugee, help me,' " she said.

People who think the Central American kids are not refugees are fine with that, said Jessica Vaughan. She is a researcher at an organization that wants to limit how many people move to America.

"People feel sorry for them, and there's no question that times are tough in these countries," she said. However, widespread crime in a country "has never before been an excuse for designating people as refugees."
