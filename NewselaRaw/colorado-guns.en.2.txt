COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. â€” Two lawmakers who helped strengthen Colorado's gun laws were voted out of their jobs on Tuesday. Both Colorado Senate President John Morse and state Senator Angela Giron lost a close-run recall vote, after a nationally watched debate on gun control.

Democrats Morse and Giron were vital figures in turning the strict gun legislation into law. But opponents of these restrictions campaigned to have them removed from office. By June, the campaigners had collected enough signatures to force the recall vote, which was held on Tuesday.

Morse was defeated, with 51 percent of the votes against him and 49 percent in his favor, while Giron lost 56 percent to 44 percent. They will both now be replaced by Republicans who opposed the gun restrictions. Colorado Springs City Councilman Bernie Herpin will take Morse's job. Former Pueblo Deputy Chief of Police George Rivera will take Giron's seat.

This election result was historic. It was the first time that Colorado politicians had lost their jobs through a recall vote. Morse and Giron passed sweeping gun control measures last winter after several mass shootings in 2012. These included a school in Newtown, Connecticut, and a movie theater outside Denver. Colorado was also the scene of the Columbine High School massacre in 1999.

## Recall Results Ripple From Rockies

The new Colorado laws limit gun magazines to 15 rounds. They also require background checks on every gun owner. The restrictions were passed without a single Republican vote, and some gun owners felt that their opinions had been ignored. The laws, which took effect July 1, remain in force in the state despite Tuesday's vote.

After losing the vote, Morse said he would continue to fight. He then told his supporters that in a democracy, being a citizen is more important than being Senate president. He said, "There's nothing citizens can't accomplish when they put their minds to it."

He continued, "We made Colorado safer from gun violence." He added that losing his job was worth the sacrifice to achieve this. "If it cost me my political career, that's a small price to pay," Morse said.

Giron told her supporters that "this will make us stronger." The former senator said that she had no regrets about voting for the stricter gun laws. "I'm a fighter," she said. "We will win in the end, because we are on the right side."

These results will be noted well beyond the Rockies. Both sides of the gun debate invested heavily in the campaign, knowing that the outcome of the vote would send a message to the rest of the country.

## Gun Fight Grabs National Spotlight

Morse said that the restrictions were a measured, common-sense response to gun violence. Colorado has a long and important tradition of gun ownership.

His critics claimed the legislation damaged personal freedom. They accused Morse of pushing the laws through without enough public views on the matter. Grass-roots activists launched the campaigns against Morse and Giron even before the new law was actually signed.

What began as a local effort quickly gained national attention. Advocates on both sides of the gun control debate hoped to either frighten or strengthen lawmakers around the country who might be considering similar laws.

On one side, the National Rifle Association and its allies campaigned to have the politicians recalled. On the other side, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg supported Morse and Giron.

Both sides poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the campaign and fought fiercely in the days leading up to the vote. The_ Denver Post _reported last week that the NRA spent $361,703. The same newspaper said in August that Bloomberg had donated $350,000 to help the state senators.

## Efforts To Overturn Gun Laws Can Be Blocked

Groups with other political interests invested heavily as well. This turned the contest into an intense debate in Colorado and across the United States.

With the loss of Morse and Giron, the Democratic hold on the Colorado state Senate has shrunk to just one seat. But the party has enough support in the state House to block any efforts by Republicans to overturn the gun laws.

Gun control opponents are hoping to organize another vote in 2014 that would do away with some of the provisions. A group of sheriffs has also filed a lawsuit to overturn the gun laws.

The results of Tuesday's vote pushed forward Morse's retirement date. He was first elected in 2006 and would not have been allowed to serve after 2014. Giron, a freshman lawmaker, would have faced re-election in 2014.
