PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Ros Choun sits in a dirty bar down a back alley. He's in the Cambodian capital. It's not easy for him to explain how he got there.

"They took my whole life, and there is nothing I can do about it," he said.

Choun looks like a Cambodian, but he doesn't feel like one. He is 35 years old. And he thinks of himself as American. He spent almost his entire life in the United States. His family escaped to America after war broke out in his homeland. Cambodia was in ruins. Nearly 2 million people died.

"I was 6 months old when I left this country," he said. His voice was filled with anger. "I'm American. But no one told us if we go to prison we could get deported back to Cambodia."

## Cannot Come Back

Since 2002, hundreds of men and women who were born in Cambodia have been sent back. They are being deported, which means they cannot come back to the U.S.

After the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, lawmakers made an agreement. It allowed the government to deport any Cambodian found guilty of a serious crime who hadn't become a U.S. citizen.

The Cambodians who arrived in the U.S. in the late 1970s and 1980s knew they were allowed to live in the U.S. But they didn't know that was not the same as being a citizen.

"I didn't know anything about any of this until 2011," said Aun Khoy, 51. He first came to the U.S. as a teenager. He was sent back to Cambodia two years ago for a crime that happened more than 10 years ago.

The number of deportees has jumped since 2009. The total number is now thought to be 400.

"It's averaged about 10 deportees a month between 2009 and now," said Keo Sarith. He directs a support center set up to help American returnees. It is based in Phnom Penh.

## Arrive With Few Clothes, Little Money

Another 2,000 Cambodians in the U.S. are on the deportation list because of their criminal records. They could be picked up at any time.

Choun was picked up three years ago from his family's home in Atlanta. His crime? As a 16-year-old he had fired a gun at school to scare a group of bullies. He spent seven years behind bars. On release he thought he could put it all behind him.

"For a decade after I was released, I had no issues with the law. Ten years working, paying taxes and not even a traffic ticket," he said, shaking his head.

Choun said there are other people who are even worse off. "We have a 72-year-old grandfather here. He hit his son for joining a gang in 1986," he said. "He was a teacher and now he drinks his life away. You can't get a job here if you are 70 years old."

Most of the deportees arrive in Cambodia without anything. They have few clothes and little money. Many spend their first few weeks in one of the small rooms above the support center's office. After that, they must make a new life in a country where most people are poor.

## Unless The Law Changes ...

Ken Touch arrived in Cambodia just over a year ago. It was the first time the 39-year-old had left the U.S. since coming from Cambodia as an infant.

In 2000, Touch was involved in a bar fight and shot someone in the thigh. After 10 years in prison and another year in an immigration jail, he arrived in Cambodia.

"I knew after being released I would get deported. The whole time I was in prison I had that hanging over my head," he said.

Unless the law changes, Touch will never be allowed back into the U.S., even for family events or funerals.

"Those who get sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. at least get to see their families, and if someone dies they take you to the funeral," he said. "If my parents pass away, I won't even get to attend their funerals."
