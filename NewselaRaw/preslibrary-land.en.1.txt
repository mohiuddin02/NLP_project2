CHICAGO — President Barack Obama is expected to choose the site for his library in less than two months. Chicagoans were engaged in a bitter fight over a proposal to place it in a public park. But it was not the first time that a presidential library was at the center of a land dispute.

In rural College Station, Texas, residents fought Texas A&amp;M University over plans to move a pig farm to make way for the George H.W. Bush presidential library.

Residents in Atlanta, Georgia, tied themselves to trees and lay down in front of bulldozers. They opposed the city's plan to build a two-lane highway through a public park leading to President Jimmy Carter's library.

The University of Chicago got into a similar dispute over its plans to build Obama's library on 20 acres in either Washington Park or Jackson Park on the South Side.

## "It's Often Tricky"

Last week, the Chicago Park District approved a plan devised by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel that authorizes the transfer of parkland to the city's control if the University of Chicago is chosen to host the library.

The University of Chicago was seen early on as the front-runner in the competition to get the library. However, its decision to submit plans to build the library on land it did not own had some library observers wondering if the university blew its chance.

"It's often tricky finding real estate and making it all work," said Benjamin Hufbauer, associate professor of art history at the University of Louisville and author of "Presidential Temples: How Memorials and Libraries Shape Public Memory."

The university's quest to use parkland isn't unique. It's just the latest in a long and complicated history of land fights involving presidential libraries, Hufbauer said.

The two most recent presidential libraries built — for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — faced long and expensive court battles over eminent domain. Eminent domain is a legal concept that the government can take over a property if it deems there is a more important use for it.

## Those For And Those Against

According to University of Chicago officials, the library building would take up 3 to 5 acres of the parkland. The rest would be preserved as open space. If the university is selected to host the library, the Obamas would decide whether to build it in Washington Park or Jackson Park in Woodlawn.

Disagreement over the proposal involved different groups. Park preservationists threatened to sue the city to stop the transfer. Residents of the Washington Park and Woodlawn neighborhoods embraced the plan as a means of bringing economic revitalization.

The dispute placed the university in a controversial light. It gave steam to what the university considers to be its biggest rival, Columbia University in New York. The University of Illinois at Chicago remains in the running to build the library on the Near West Side, as does the University of Hawaii, which wants to build it in Honolulu.

The park board approved the future transfer of 20 acres from whichever park is chosen by the Obamas to the city. The transfer would take place only if the University of Chicago is selected to host the library. The land would then be leased to the Barack Obama Foundation, which is charged with building the library. If the University of Chicago does not win the bid, the Park District would retain control of its land.

## How Do You Define Park?

In Little Rock, officials battled over the definition of a park. The city's plans to build the Clinton library in a decaying warehouse district on the edge of downtown sparked a court battle that lasted nearly five years. The city argued that it could acquire the private land for a park and then build the library in that park.

But landowner Gene Pfeifer refused to give up his 3-acre riverfront property in the middle of the proposed library site. In the end, the state Supreme Court allowed the city to acquire the property through eminent domain.

Chicago's 350-acre Washington Park was designed by legendary landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. But Chicago isn't the only city where a fight has been waged over an Olmsted park.

When Carter was about to build his presidential library in the 1980s, a controversy developed over a decades-old plan to build a roadway through Olmsted Linear Park in Atlanta. The two-lane highway, then called "Presidential Parkway," would wind through the park and encircle the Carter library, which sat atop the hill where Union General William Sherman watched Atlanta burn during the Civil War.

"The original plan would have completely ruined the park," said Jennifer Richardson, an Atlanta resident who participated in the protests. "It gave President Carter a black eye, but he never spoke about it or returned any of the letters we wrote to him. But he never backed down."

The case was in the courts for more than 12 years. In the end, the Carter library was built, but the highway ended at the park.
