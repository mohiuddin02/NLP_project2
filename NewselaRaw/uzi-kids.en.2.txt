TUCSON, Ariz. — The accidental death of a shooting instructor at a gun range has set off a national discussion about why a child was allowed to fire a high-powered weapon.

But those who enjoy and teach firearms have a different question: What's the proper way to teach children about guns?

The instructor was killed Aug. 25 while teaching a 9-year-old girl to fire an Uzi submachine gun at the Last Stop range. The large, powerful Uzi was invented to be used by soldiers fighting in Israel and has also been used by the U.S. Secret Service.

Butch Jensen is a firearms instructor at a different shooting range, the Southeast Regional Park Shooting Range outside of Tucson, Arizona. Whether a child should be shooting any sort of gun is a decision for each family to make, he said.

## An Uzi Is Not For A Beginner

The key, Jensen said, is training. A gun is a tool, and like any tool — be it a circular saw or a kitchen knife — it requires proper instruction.

"It was clear that she was a beginner, and you don't start a beginner in that type of firearm," said Jensen.

Charles Vacca, 39, was shot at the outdoor shooting range in White Hills, Arizona, about 60 miles south of Las Vegas. Vacca was showing the girl how to fire an Uzi when she lost control of the weapon and accidentally shot Vacca in the head. The names of the girl and her parents have not been released.

The Mohave County Sheriff's Office has said it will not file charges.

The range where Jensen works does not rent firearms and does not allow full automatic fire. A firearm on full automatic fire shoots bullets in a steady stream while the trigger is pressed. The Uzi the 9-year-old was shooting was on full automatic fire at the time of the accident.

## "Safety Is No Accident"

There is no age limit for shooting at Jensen's range, and children seem to visit it most weekends. Children under 16 must be closely supervised by a legal guardian or parent, Jensen said.

There were no children present Thursday morning at the outdoor, desertlike range, where people fire toward a large ridge of dirt. A marksman, Blake Carrington, took aim at a paper target with the black and blue outline of a person. Brass bullet casings bounced back behind him. Above him was a sign: "Safety is no accident."

Carrington, who serves in the Air Force, has taught his 10-year-old daughter to shoot a .22 rifle.

"I personally would never give my child a fully automatic weapon," he said. "I feel terrible for that little girl having to live with that."

Carrington said he was torn about whether gun laws should be stricter for children. "That's the thing about guns," he said. "They will do exactly what the human tells them to do. Poor decision making is what gets us."

## No Federal Law About Children Shooting Guns

Federal law does not allow children under 18 to possess a firearm. However, there is no federal law that prevents children from firing guns.

Arizona is one of 21 states that allows children under 18 to fire guns, as long as there is adult supervision, said Lindsey Zwicker. She is a lawyer with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Currently, 28 states and the District of Columbia have laws about children's access to firearms. Connecticut forbids children under 16 from handling a machine gun at a shooting range. The law was passed after an 8-year-old Connecticut boy died at a gun show in 2008 after he lost control of the Uzi he was firing.

"When things like this happen, we do draw our attention to the law," Zwicker said. "People are talking and looking to see where there are weaknesses in the law, and there is discussion on what can be done to prevent this in the future."

Standing near Carrington at the Southeast Regional Park Shooting Range was Tom. He did not want his last name used in the article. He worries that the accident will provide another argument for outlawing guns.

Tom said he shoots as a sport and also to exercise his Second Amendment rights. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects peoples' right to have guns. "I don't think you should keep kids away from firearms," he said. "This shouldn't keep people from taking their kids to the range."

## "Not A Good Idea"

Still, Tom said he could not understand  why adults allowed the 9-year-old girl to shoot an Uzi. "I don't know what they were thinking," he said. "My personal opinion is someone under 15 years of age playing with a submachine weapon is not a good idea."

Across town at the Marksman Pistol Institute I, instructor Sean Yeandle said he had never seen an Uzi shot there by anyone under 21. "I don't see us or any of the Uzi-rated instructors ever letting anyone under the age of 18 use that," he said.

Children have to be 10 or older and be supervised by a parent to shoot at the indoor range at all, Yeandle said.

He said the instructor makes sure to stay behind the shooter for safety and to keep control of the gun. The gun tends to recoil, which means it moves backward after it's shot.

As for teaching a child to shoot an Uzi, he said, "the value doesn't outweigh the risk."
