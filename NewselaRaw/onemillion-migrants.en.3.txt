GENEVA, Switzerland — Just over 1 million people came to Europe this year, migration experts said Tuesday. The number of migrants set a record. They fled their home countries because of war, poverty and unfair treatment.

As of Monday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said 1,005,504 people had entered Europe. The number was more than four times as many as last year. Almost all of them came by sea. More than 3,500 people drowned trying to come. European officials have promised to make the migration routes safer.

William Lacy Swing is the head of the IOM. He urged European governments to make migration safer.

Swing said there is no way to stop migrants from coming. Migration is necessary and a good thing. He added, "Migration must be legal, safe and secure for all — both for the migrants themselves and the countries that will become their new home."

## Many Refugees Were Not Counted

The IOM gets its migration numbers from governments in Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Spain, Malta and Cyprus, spokesman Joel Millman said. The actual number of people entering Europe may be even larger. Officials have trouble getting an accurate number. So many have entered Europe in such a short time.

Most people came to Europe from Greece, which took in 820,000 people this year. Nearly all of them crossed from Turkey by boat across the Aegean Sea. Another 150,000 came into Italy across the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa. Smaller numbers crossed from Turkey by land into Greece and Bulgaria, which are on Turkey's borders. Even fewer arrived by boat to other countries around the Mediterranean.

Not all the migrants are included in the IOM total. Some crossed into Europe from other places. A few thousand people rode by bicycle from Russia to Norway.

## War In Syria Plays A Big Role

About half of the people entering Europe were Syrians, the IOM said. About one out of five were Afghans. A much smaller number came from Iraq, which like Syria is in the Middle East.

Many migrants fleeing war and unfair treatment likely will be allowed to stay in Europe. Others who came simply to find work could be sent back.

The war in Syria has had a big effect on migration. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the war, and millions have fled to other countries. European governments do not agree on how to handle the crisis. They have argued whether to welcome the refugees and how best to care such large numbers of people.

## Hungary's Fence Angers Neighbors

Over the summer, some Eastern European countries opened and closed their border. It caused confusion and frustration. Hungary, in particular, angered its neighbors by building a fence to keep people out. Migrants began rushing to find ways through other countries, which were unable to handle so many people. A more organized system began in the fall.

Germany and Sweden have welcomed the largest numbers of refugees. About 1 million migrants arrived in Germany this year.

Winter has made the journeys more dangerous. The number of migrants has slowed, but people are still showing up in Greece. IOM said more than 4,100 people arrived on the Greek islands on Monday alone.
