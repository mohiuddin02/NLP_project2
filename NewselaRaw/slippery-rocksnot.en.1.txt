BALTIMORE — Algae is a type of very simple plant, lacking roots, stems and leaves. Found in lakes and ponds, it provides nutrition for fish. When it becomes too abundant, however, algae can crowd other plants and cause fish to die off.

For years, those who monitor East Coast waterways have been concerned about one particular algae, known as didymo. Fishermen have faced bans on felt-soled boots, which algae stick to, and urgings that they scrub their gear to combat the spread of the pervasive algae.

A recent Dartmouth College study could turn such thinking on its head, however.

## It's Not Exactly A Newcomer

Didymo, which produces threadlike stalks called "rock snot" blooms, has long been considered an invasive threat to bodies of water across the nation. The fear has been that it is spreading rapidly into new bodies of water.

According to the new Dartmouth study, however, the algae is far from being a rapidly spreading newcomer. Indeed, it is largely native to those areas where it has been seen.

The team of researchers found that cells of the algae had been present in rivers around the globe for centuries — in some cases, even thousands of years.

On the other hand, the team also found that the environmental conditions that trigger rock snot blooms were rare or absent in the past.

"A lot of the response to didymo has been, 'How can we keep it from spreading?'" study leader Brad Taylor said. "Our work suggests that in a lot of areas, in the areas just up the road in Pennsylvania and just south of Maryland and Virginia, didymo has been there at least 50 years. In some cases, in the case of Pennsylvania, it's been there thousands of years."

The team began the study in the summer of 2012, when Max Bothwell, a researcher for the Canadian government, visited Taylor at a field site in Colorado.

"I told him that didymo has always been in these rivers — we've known that for a long time — and it only blooms in some of them," Taylor said. "We started talking more about perhaps didymo is native and just had gone unnoticed in large parts of the world … It's been found all over the world and for a long time, not just the past 10 years."

## Climate Change Has Played A Role In Its Growth

The extensive growth of rock snot blooms witnessed over the past several years hasn't resulted from its spread from river to river, as widely believed. Instead, Taylor said, it is caused by a shortage of phosphorous — a mineral plants depend on for healthy development — along with other factors resulting from [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).

"When phosphorous concentrations are extremely low, didymo produces this stalk to push itself up into the water column to access nutrients," Taylor said. "It's very similar to beanstalks; if you're going to grow a bean plant … when you starve the plants of light, they grow tall and spindly."

Blooms of rock snot, so named for its mucus-like appearance, harm salmon and trout populations by clogging ponds and lakes. In addition, the insects the fish feed on burrow into the stalks, making it harder for fish to get at them.

The research team is now trying to determine how humans are contributing to the growth of rock snot blooms, Taylor said.

"We spew nitrogen out of our cars and coal-fired power plants, and then that rains down and fertilizes systems with just nitrogen," he said. "You then have plants that are fertilized by nitrogen but not phosphorous, and so that results in a decrease in phosphorous going into lakes and rivers."

## Maryland Takes A Stand

Additional environmental factors resulting from climate change also deprive didymo of phosphorous, Taylor said.

Among the factors are "a shift toward earlier growing seasons and an earlier pulse of springtime stream flows," Taylor said. "Those occur earlier in the year, and the rivers are basically starved of phosphorous later in the year."

Taylor said the team's discoveries indicate that multimillion-dollar algae eradication efforts won't prove to be effective in combating rock snot blooms.

In 2011, in hopes of stopping didymo's spread, Maryland became the first state to ban felt-soled wading boots; algae can nestle into felt fibers and be deposited in other bodies of water. Maryland's Department of Natural Resources also set up wader washing stations where those fishing on the river could wash their gear.

"If it's already there, it's not going to do any good to try and stop the spread of it, obviously," Taylor said. "So the action might be better put into figuring out what's causing it to bloom."

Once that's understood, he said, the focus should then be on "ways to regulate that or ways to simply adapt to it and deal with it."

Poisoning the algae, Taylor added, "is one I think isn't going to be doable, and it's probably not going to solve the root problem."

## More Environmental Changes To Follow

Didymo, Taylor said, could prove to be a valuable case study into climate change's effects on native species.

The algae "may be really sensitive to the climate-induced changes and environmental conditions," he said. "So it may be a good canary in the coal mine" or, in other words, be a good indicator of "other changes that are going to happen in rivers."

Didymo is a "native species that's being affected by changing environmental conditions and is causing a nuisance," Taylor said. That kind of problem, he added, is "something I think we need to be more aware of in the future, and it may be more common."
