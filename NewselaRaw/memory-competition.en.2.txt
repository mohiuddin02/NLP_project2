NEW YORK — Every morning when he wakes up, Brad Zupp sits at his desk, and shuffles a deck of playing cards. He puts on noise-canceling headphones and a pair of goggles, the lenses blacked out except for tiny peepholes that keep each eye focused downward. He has 70 seconds to memorize the order of the deck.

Zupp then sets a timer and grabs another deck. He is about to see how fast he can reproduce the order of the shuffled cards.

His fastest time so far: 65 seconds.

"I don't do anything bizarre," said Zupp, who performs this drill at least 10 times a day.

But what's normal to Zupp and other competitors on the Memory Championship circuit can seem strange to others. Many of us habitually forget to buy milk at the store, zone out on names at parties and don't remember birthdays or anniversaries until the day has passed.

We don't meet a man named John and see a toilet, or kill time on the exercise bike memorizing every U.S. ZIP Code. We don't carry lists of 200-digit numbers and practice memorizing them while in line at the grocery store.

Memory competitors do.

## Hours A Day Practicing

On a rainy Saturday in March, 65 of them gathered in a Manhattan office tower for the 17th USA Memory Championship, one of several such contests held each year around the world. For nearly eight tense hours, they scrambled to rearrange playing cards, match names with faces of strangers, and recall random numbers. They had to memorize a 25-line poem and write it down word for word, with the exact punctuation and line breaks.

There were dentists, students, nurses, teachers, writers and magicians. They ranged in age from 16 to 50. They seemed to have little in common beyond their passion for memorization and their difficult training routines, which usually involve sitting in isolation for several hours a day practicing.

Most assign visual images to just about everything and create places in their minds to store those pictures, which serve as memory triggers.

Sue Jin Yang, a nurse in San Francisco, calls it the cookie crumb method.

"I imagine that I am walking a pathway … stopping at distinct locations, dropping off 'cookie crumbs' of visual images," said Yang, 32, who was competing in New York for the third time.

## Picking Up Cookie Crumbs

When Yang needs to recall something, she envisions walking the path, which she models after a familiar place. In her mind she stops at particular locations to pick up the correct cookie crumbs.

Yang's system associates numbers with sounds and letters. That nudges Yang to remember her chosen images, which tend toward famous faces. For example, three is associated with "m," one with "d."

"So when I am given a digit such as 31, I see actor Matt Damon," Yang said. "Sixty-two is Sean Penn."

She sees Brad Pitt in the nine of spades and Oprah Winfrey in the six of clubs.

Images, when tied together, can lead to fantasy-like pictures.

Lance Tschirhart, 25, a competitor from Texas, explained how the number 141251213 is embedded in his memory: 141 brings to mind a dart; 251 is an electrical outlet; 213 is a nutmeg.

"So I can imagine throwing a dart into an outlet and sparks shooting out around a nutmeg," Tschirhart said during a break between drills in the competition.

## "Use Your Imagination"

Contestants nodded knowingly. Spectators looked baffled.

"You have to use your imagination," Tschirhart said.

Tony Dottino, a business consultant, started the contest in New York after he had drinks with a friend who told him about a memory competition in London. Dottino, 66, always was intrigued by the mysteries of the brain. He coaches people, most in the health care industry, on the value of adopting ways to improve memory. Nurses who can recall patient details — whether they fear needles, for example, or have hard-to-find veins — lead to greater patient satisfaction, Dottino said.

The first New York contest, in 1997, drew 18 players. The winner was Tatiana Cooley, a secretary who joined the competition minutes before it began. Last year, Ram Kolli, a business consultant from Los Angeles, beat the reigning champion, mountaineer Nelson Dellis, who had won the previous two years.

Other winners have included Ron White, a war veteran who won twice and who has memorized the name and rank of every U.S. service member killed in Afghanistan; and Scott Hagwood, who competed after doctors warned that radiation treatment for his thyroid cancer could hurt his memory. Hagwood won four years straight from 2001 to 2004.
