LOS ANGELES — Scientists who study planets dream of sending a geologist to Mars to inspect its rocks by hand. Until then, they have to settle for examining meteorites — chunks of the Red Planet that land on Earth after hurtling through space.

Though a little banged up after their fall through the atmosphere, these meteorites provide a lot of information. But it can be hard for geologists to interpret what they see when they can't agree on how old a rock is. And scientists disagree by quite a bit — up to 4 billion years — for certain rocks.

Mars itself isn't much older than 4 billion years. So the question is: Do these rocks tell the beginning, or the end, of Mars' story?

Recently, an international team of scientists sought to sort this out for a particular group of meteorites known as shergottites.

## Young, As Martian Rocks Go

Martian space rocks tend to be very old, but shergottites are generally thought to be remarkably young. Most scientists believe they were formed as a result of volcanic activity about 150 to 250 million years ago. This would mean they formed during Earth's Jurassic period, when dinosaurs roamed the land.

If so, shergottites are a sign that Mars might have been geologically active fairly recently. That in turn means it might still have been friendly to some form of life, said planetary geochemist Munir Humayun.

But some scientists have estimated that shergottites are actually about 4 billion years old. If this were true, scientists would have to change the way they think about Mars' history.

"Most of us understand that if there is ... life on Mars, it's not going to be roaming on the surface. ... but it could be thriving underground with the heat energy provided by [volcanoes]," Humayun said. However, "if there hasn't been [volcanic activity in] 4 billion years, ... it would be very difficult to believe there was life left on Mars."

To settle the question, researchers examined a meteorite known as Northwest Africa 5298. They looked at very tiny deposits within it called baddeleyites. These tough, zirconium-rich minerals are "10 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair," said geochemist Axel Schmitt.

## Rugged Microscopic Minerals

Researchers generally measure certain radioactive elements in rocks to figure out how long a rock has been around. But when the meteorites slam into Earth, that melts the rock down and can erase the evidence.

That's why scientists picked the tiny baddeleyites: Once they form, they are durable little minerals. It's not easy to melt them down. By looking at the radioactive uranium and lead in this tough rock, the scientists found that it formed sometime around 187 million years ago. This proved that the baddeleyites were young.

The scientists could also see evidence of the damage done to the meteorite by whatever event sent it shooting off the Martian surface around 22 million years ago. The shock had muddled up the mineral structure inside, though the chemicals themselves were mostly unchanged. The result was something like shaking up a sealed gift box of chocolates.

"It looks good on the outside, but all the pieces are dislodged on the inside," Schmitt said.

The study further shows that the shergottites weren't old rocks, Humayun said. But that was what he had expected. "If they had found that it was 4 billion years old, I would eat my hat."

The researchers say they can use their method of dating these rocks to study other Martian meteorites. Their hope is that they will discover new information about our neighbor, the Red Planet.
