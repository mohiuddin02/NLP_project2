Neanderthals were a type of early Stone Age man. They lived in what is now Europe and Asia 50,000 years ago. Scientists say that people today are part Neanderthal. They also say that how well some people's bodies fight disease has to do with how much Neanderthal they have in them.

Scientists believe that ancient humans walked out of Africa and into Asia and then Europe. Along the way, they met Neanderthals and had children with them. Today a small amount of the DNA in most people comes from both Neanderthals and ancient humans.  

DNA tells a person's body how to grow and work. It is the body's instruction manual. DNA is passed on from parents to children. Scientists are trying to find out how the Neanderthal DNA affects people today.

In a science magazine, two groups of scientists recently wrote about work they did with Neanderthal DNA. Both say that the DNA that protects against pathogens probably came from Neanderthals. Pathogens are germs that cause disease.

## DNA Affects Our Allergies

Scientists say that the DNA also seems to affect allergies. Janet Kelso is a scientist in Germany. Sge says that strong pathogen protection might make the body confuse other things with pathogens.

Not everyone with Neanderthal DNA inherited the same kind. The DNA that protects against pathogens seems to be more popular than others. Scientists found that this type of DNA is in half of the people in the groups that they studied in Asia and Europe. "That's huge. It came as a big surprise to us," says Lluis Quintana-Murci, a scientist in France.

All of the scientists noticed three types of genes, units of DNA that give the body directions. These genes help the body fight germs. They are already in some people when they are born.

These genes can destroy a pathogen before a person even knows that he or she is sick. Quintana-Murci says that this has helped generations of people stay strong.

## Fighting Germs By Getting Used To Them

Another way that the body fights disease is by getting used to the germs. People get sick or are given a small amount of a disease on purpose, and the body gets used to it. 

All of the scientists say that Neanderthal DNA helps people to stay healthy. However, the two groups have different things that they are interested in studying.

Quintana-Murci's group wants to know how tiny pathogens affect human genes. The spread of disease has killed many people through history. Therefore, protective genes must spread through natural selection. Natural selection is when only those who adapt to the world live to pass their genes to future generations.

## Looking At Genes' Protection

Quintana-Murci and his team examined 1,500 protective genes in people. Then they matched them up with a map of Neanderthal DNA in humans. The team figured out how much Neanderthal DNA was in protective genes and how much was in other genes. They found that protective genes had more Neanderthal DNA in them.

Kelso's group is interested in ancient genes like those from Neanderthals. It wants to find out what happened when ancient humans and Neanderthals had children. The scientists studied the genes in thousands of people living all over the world today. They looked for DNA that was like Neanderthal DNA. Kelso says that is how they found the three protective genes.

## Why Is Neanderthal DNA Helpful?

Scientists say that they want to figure out exactly how Neanderthal DNA helped ancient humans. They know that having children with Neanderthals passed the DNA to new generations. They still want to know why the Neanderthal DNA is so helpful.

Peter Parham is a professor in California. He says that Neanderthal DNA helped human ancestors because it is still around today. Parham says that if the DNA were not valuable, it would have been washed out of human DNA.
