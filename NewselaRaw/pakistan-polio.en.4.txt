PESHAWAR, Pakistan â€” In the north of Pakistan, two battles are going on. One is a war with guns and bullets. The other is a fight against polio, a serious disease.

The Pakistani army has been fighting the Taliban for a year. The Taliban is a violent group battling the government for control of the country.

The war against the Taliban is actually helping the fight against polio. As the north becomes safer, more health workers can get in to give polio vaccines to people. A vaccine is a shot that can prevent a disease.

This year, there were six cases of polio in the north of Pakistan. There were 56 last year.

## Health Workers Face Dangers

Polio is caused by a virus. It mainly affects children. In serious cases, victims cannot move their legs or other body parts. It can even cause death. The disease was common around the world in the early 1900s. It affected thousands of children every year.

In the 1950s, a vaccine that could prevent polio was introduced. The polio vaccine helped to wipe out the disease in all countries in the world except three: Pakistan, its neighbor Afghanistan, and Nigeria.

To fight polio in Pakistan, health workers travel to the north to give people in villages the polio vaccine.

The Taliban does not want the health workers to come. They make it dangerous for the health workers. The workers have to travel with armed guards. Even so, dozens of health workers and their guards have been killed by the Taliban.

Hafiz Gul Bahadur is the leader of one Taliban group. In June 2012, he stopped allowing the polio vaccine in his area. He said that as long as the United States was dropping bombs from airplanes inside the country, he would not allow the vaccine.

## More Children Are Now Protected

Fighting the Taliban has made some areas safer. More health workers are now able to get in.

In October last year, medical workers were not able to reach 250,000 children. In May, that number was down to 47,000.

Aziz Mermon works for a charity group called Rotary International. He runs PolioPlus, a program to fight polio in Pakistan.

Mermon said health workers are finding it easier to work in the north of Pakistan.

Yet fighting continues in some areas. Health workers cannot go to those places now, he said. Mermom hopes they will be able to travel there soon.

Most of Pakistan is free of polio. It still remains in a few parts of the country: the north, and Karachi, Pakistan's largest city.

Around the world, there is an effort to wipe out polio once and for all. It is called the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Out of the 24 polio cases reported this year, 23 have been in Pakistan, according to the Initiative.
