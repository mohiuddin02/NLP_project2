CHICAGO, Ill. â€” The Kelly family took the train to downtown Chicago. The young musicians carried their instruments on their backs.

They set up their small orchestra on a busy street corner. For two hours on a warm weekday evening, they played music together.

## Surprised, And Delighted!

People stopped to listen or to snap a picture. Many were surprised, and delighted, to see the black youngsters playing a harp, a cello and four violins on the street.

A bus driver stopped at a red light. He opened his door and leaned from his seat so he could hear better. A street beggar dropped a dollar bill in an open violin case. From time to time, the young musicians looked up to smile at their audience.

## Summer Job

This is their summer job. They play music for money one or two days each week

By the time they take the train back home, the group had collected $240. The family, which has 15 kids, can really use the money.

Eleven people live in their three-bedroom, one-and-a-half bathroom apartment. The oldest six children are grown and do not live at home.

Inside the Kelly's home, music fills the small rooms. It drowns out the noise from their neighborhood, which is filled with crime.

## With Music, "Everything Is OK"

"When we make music, everything is OK," said La Shone Kelly. She is the mother of the family.

It was the father's idea to introduce music to his children. He wanted his children to experience the joy and self-control music can bring.

"I know that music is best learned at an early age," said Jonathan Kelly. "Then it becomes something you can do your whole life. When we get together and sing and play, we do it for ourselves. If others enjoy it, that's a good thing."

## "They Have To Practice"

La Shone Kelly was worried when her husband suggested the children start taking music lessons. He had lost his job, and the family did not have much money.

The Kellys spend about $1,300 each month on music lessons and renting instruments. They have had to give up a lot to afford it.

La Shone said that her children understand that if the family is going to spend that much money, they have to take it seriously. "They have to practice," she said.

The Garfield Park Fieldhouse is in a Chicago neighborhood that is poor and filled with crime. On the second floor, children as young as 3 years old are learning the violin. The Kellys take music lessons there also.

## Musical Saturdays

On Saturdays, teachers come from across the city to teach music. In summer, there is a music camp. The lessons cost $100 a month. Most of the students, including the Kellys, get help to pay for it. While the children are taking lessons, their parents must be there too.

For La Shone and Jonathan Kelly, the time has been worth it. Their children all love music.

Darlene Sandifer started the music program with her husband, Howard. He used to be a musician and teacher.

## More Choices In Life

"Music changes your heart and mind. It helps you find calm," Sandifer said. She believes that if children from poor areas could take music lessons, they would get into less trouble. "These kids on the streets have a gift," she said. They just need someone to help them use it.

The students gave a musical performance on the last day of summer camp.

Jonathan and La Shone Kelly cheered their children on. They said that all the money they spent was worth it.

The parents want their children to see that they have many choices in life.
