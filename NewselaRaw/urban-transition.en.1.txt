SEATTLE â€” Curtis Morrison was homeless, had legal problems and needed medicine when he arrived in Seattle after moving there from the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana.

He says The Chief Seattle Club helped ease the sometimes difficult transition from living on the reservation to life in a large city. He's sober now and credits the club's Urban Indian Legal Clinic with helping him find a home and obtain the medicine he needed for his depression.

"Other places didn't know what I was talking about, and nothing would happen," said Morrison, 45. "It was hard, but I have opportunities and a new beginning."

Morrison isn't the only so-called "urban Indian" to reach out to the Urban Indian Legal Clinic for help.

## A Big Move To The Cities

The clinic provides free advice and referrals for a wide range of legal issues to Native Americans. It's available to all [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american), no matter their income or if they are members of the club.

Seattle has one of the highest populations of urban Indians in the country, and the clinic provides a much-needed service for an often overlooked community, organizers say.

"It's about providing everyone that comes through the experience of understanding and knowing their rights," said Olive Lefferson, clinic coordinator and member of the Blackfoot Indian Tribe.

About seven of 10 Native Americans, or 2.8 million, live in urban areas such as Seattle, according to government data. More than 1 million American Indians and Alaska Natives moved to metropolitan areas in the past 30 years.

Nearly 40,000 people in the Seattle area say they are American Indian or Alaska Native, according to the government. A quarter of the population lives in poverty, compared with one of 10 in the general population. Indians also have more unemployment and three times the likelihood of being homeless, says the Urban Indian Health Institute.

## Many Urban Indians Live In Poverty

Lefferson said the troubles of Native Americans can be worse in urban areas, far from their families and tribes. Those who have lived in both worlds say city poverty is different from reservation poverty, mostly because of the lack of a support system that's common on reservations.

Twice a month, American Indians and Alaska Natives can come to the Chief Seattle Club and get help from lawyers. About half the cases are related to Native issues, including inheritance problems or trouble crossing over from the reservation.

When it's a criminal case, the clinic can send clients to a criminal attorney.

The lawyers come from different backgrounds but have one thing in common: They have knowledge of Indian law and the Indian experience.

"For them to come to a safe place, with someone who has worked with Natives, is important," Lefferson said. "Otherwise, they might think someone won't understand them."

The idea began at the end of 2006, according to Lael Echo-Hawk, who was president of the Northwest Indian Bar Association at the time. The group wanted to provide a service to a population that keeps to itself and doesn't trust other mainstream opportunities. The Chief Seattle Club was a logical place, said Echo-Hawk, a Pawnee.

## Isolated From Family And Tribe

"As urban Indians, we know where to go and we know who the staff are," said Echo-Hawk, a Seattle lawyer. "Let's face it, if you have to meet with a lawyer, you are in a situation you don't want to be in, and it's uncomfortable. We wanted to help people solve problems."

Ralph Forquera, the Seattle Indian Health Board executive director, said he sees Native clients with long legal records. That often stems from poverty. Their crimes didn't happen because they chose a life of crime, said Forquera, who comes from the Juaneno Band of California Mission Indians. Instead, it could be petty theft or public drunkeness.

An urban area also lacks the support base common on a reservation. Growing up on the Fond du Lac Reservation of Northern Minnesota, Dunlap said, he never knew his family was poor. Lefferson's family didn't have running water on the Blackfoot Reservation, she added, but everyone was poor on the reservation.

"In reservation poverty, you always had an auntie to feed you," Dunlap said. "Urban poverty for Natives is different."

Along with isolation, the move to the city can shock a Native person who has lived before in an area where health care and education may be easier to reach. In the reservations, the government provides those services under treaties, said Chris Stearns, a Navajo lawyer who specializes in Indian law. In Seattle, those services are harder to find.

## A Sidewalk For A Bed

"When you come to the cities or urban areas, they're not there," said Stearns.

The legal clinic was one of the first in the nation, Echo-Hawk said. The clinic is self-sustaining and has been able to continue without as much involvement from other organizations.

Dunlap said the Chief Seattle Club and the clinic are an example for the rest of Indian Country to follow.

"There's no other place like this in Indian Country," Dunlap said.

As Dunlap and Lefferson spoke at the club, a member with a beaded necklace and long gray hair walked in. Dunlap asked him how he'd slept the night before.

He said he slept good, but his back hurt. His bed had been a concrete sidewalk.
