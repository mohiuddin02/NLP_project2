ANCHORAGE, Alaska â€” Pacific walrus can't find sea ice to rest on in Arctic waters. As a result, record numbers of walrus are coming to a beach in Alaska.

About 35,000 walrus were photographed there Saturday. The beach is about 5 miles north of Point Lay.

Point Lay is an Inupiat Eskimo village. It lies 700 miles northwest of Anchorage, Alaska's biggest city.

The enormous gathering was spotted by researchers. They were looking at the area by air. Researchers check on the Arctic sea animals every year.

## A Warmer Summer

Walrus were first spotted on Sept. 13. They have been moving on and off shore. Observers last week saw the remains of about 50 dead walrus on the beach. The animals may have been killed in a stampede. Officials were putting together a team to find out how they died.

"They're going to get them out there next week," said Andrea Medeiros, who works for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Pacific walrus spend winters in the Bering Sea. Females give birth on sea ice. They also use ice as a diving platform to reach clams and snails and worms on the shallow continental shelf.

Unlike seals, walrus cannot swim all the time. They must rest. Walrus use their tusks to pull themselves onto ice or rocks.

Temperatures are getting warmer in the summer. Sea ice is melting. As a result, the edge of the sea ice has moved north. Females and their young ride the edge of the sea ice into the Chukchi Sea, the body of water north of the Bering Strait.

Water near the coastline is shallower. But over the past few years, sea ice has moved north into the Arctic Ocean water. There, the water is more than 2 miles deep. Walrus cannot dive to the bottom.

## Shoulder-To-Shoulder

Large groups of walrus were first spotted on the U.S. side of the Chukchi Sea in 2007. They returned in 2009. In 2011, there were about 30,000 walrus along more than a half mile of beach near Point Lay.

The walrus gather nearly shoulder-to-shoulder on the beach. Stampedes can happen if the walrus get scared. This is especially dangerous for young walrus. Stampedes can be set off by a polar bear, human hunter or low-flying airplane.

More than 130 walrus died during a stampede in September 2009. The stampede happened at Alaska's Icy Cape. Most of the dead walrus were young.

The World Wildlife Fund works to protect wildlife. It said walrus have also been gathering in large groups on the Russian side of the Chukchi Sea.

Margaret Williams runs the World Wildlife Fund's Arctic program. She said the walrus gatherings are another sign of what happens when sea ice melts. The Arctic is changing very fast, she said.

"It is time for the rest of the world to take notice and also to take action to address the root causes of climate change," she said.

Scientists measure the sea ice's lowest point every year. This summer, that point was the sixth lowest since satellite monitoring began in 1979.
