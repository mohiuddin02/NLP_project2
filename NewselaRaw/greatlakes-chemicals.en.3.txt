DETROIT — The Great Lakes are in worse shape than anybody realized, according to a recent study. Medicines known as pharmaceuticals, along with caffeine and chemicals added to toothpaste have all been found far from shore. And at disturbingly high levels.

The alarming new study was released last month. It was the first to carefully test the Great Lakes for pharmaceuticals and personal care products — together called PPCPs for short. Personal care products are things like soap, makeup, shampoo and toothpaste.

Professor Rebecca Klaper is one of the leaders of the study. She and the other researchers were surprised how easy it was to find PPCPs. They had assumed it would be hard because there is so much water in the Great Lakes. Lakes Michigan and Huron, for example, together have 2 quadrillion, or 2,000 trillion, gallons of water. The two lakes are connected.

The fact that it was so easy to find PPCPs means there are more of them in the Great Lakes than scientists thought. And they were found further from shore than ever before.

## Water Worries Surface

Among the pharmaceuticals found in Lake Michigan were a diabetes medication and a hormone used in birth-control pills. Scientists are worried that such products might harm fish, birds and other wildlife.

If the PPCPs are causing damage, Klaper said, we'll need to try to get rid of them. This would be done through water treatment — that is, by filtering the water. Right now, though, scientists aren't sure what would be the best way to remove the PPCPs.

Klaper and her team looked for 54 PPCPs and hormones in Lake Michigan. Testing was done over two years.

The researchers looked for PPCPs near Milwaukee's two main wastewater treatment plants. Such plants are supposed to clean up wastewater — that is, water from sewer pipes feeding into the lake. Sewage contains a lot of feces and urine, as well as things poured down the sink. Thus, it also contains a lot of the chemicals humans swallow and use. These are found in everything from soda to medicine.

Researchers also wanted to see how far from wastewater treatment plants they could still find PPCPs. If they found them far from the plants, that would be more proof that there were a lot of them.

## A Shopping List Of Personal Care Products

Thirty-two of the PPCPs were found in Lake Michigan's water. And 30 were found in the lake's sediment — that is, its mud. The most frequently found PPCPs were seen as far out as two miles from the wastewater treatment plants. These included:

—Metformin, a diabetes medicine.

—Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, soda and energy drinks.

—Sulfamethoxazole, which is used to treat various infections.

—Triclosan, which is added to many products, including toothpaste and soaps.

Fourteen of the PPCPs were found in concentrations that posed a medium or high risk.

The threat to the health of the Great Lakes is significant, the report states. It is particularly severe for fish, birds and other wildlife living near the shore.

The study looked only at Lake Michigan. But, according to Klaper, PPCPs most likely are also building up in the other Great Lakes.

It's alarming that the chemicals were found that far from shore, said Olga Lyandres. Lyandres works for the Alliance for the Great Lakes, which is trying to protect the lakes.

People always knew you had check for PPCPs near where treated water is released, she said. But they assumed that because the lake was so large, PPCPs couldn't be "affecting the lake as a whole."

## A Bigger Problem Than Thought

The number and variety of PPCPs found is also making people worried, Lyandres said.

"There are some questions that are still unanswered," she said. "You can study one chemical at a time, but in reality, we're exposed to a chemical soup."

Another study led by Klaper last year revealed some of the damage PPCPs can cause. The study exposed minnows to low levels of two PPCPs: linuron and DEHP. After 28 days the PPCPs had lowered levels of testosterone in male fish. This hormone is needed for reproduction.

PPCPs are widely considered potentially harmful. But not much is known about what effect very low levels may have. This has meant that little to nothing is done about them when it comes to water treatment.

"We don't do anything specific for them," said Dave Johnson of the Muskegon Wastewater Management System. "We have our treatment that's in place" for sewage "and that's all they get."

Researchers should now concentrate on figuring out which PPCPs are most important to remove, Klaper said. And also, how best to remove them.
