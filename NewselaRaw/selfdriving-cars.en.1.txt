WASHINGTON — A General Motors executive said technology that could lead to driverless cars is improving steadily. But, people will still need to drive motor vehicles for many years to come.

Mike Robinson, GM's vice president of sustainability and global regulatory affairs, told the U.S. House's Highways and Transit Subcommittee that for the "foreseeable future" drivers will "still need to be engaged and in control."

He said, "For the most part, people assume than an autonomous vehicle will take you to your destination without any personal involvement." Robinson says this idea is still a ways off.

The subcommittee called the hearing to discuss the technical advances. Many people believe that self-driving vehicles could be on the market in the near future, and have concerns about their safety. The committee noted that Google Inc. has said it had logged hundreds of thousands of accident-free miles in autonomous vehicles, though it has announced no plans to sell self-driving vehicles.

## A Liberating Technology

Nissan Motor Co. CEO Carlos Ghosn has said he wants the company to produce an "affordable, autonomous-drive vehicle" by 2020, according to Andrew Christensen, senior manager of technology planning at Nissan Technical Center in Michigan.

Christensen acknowledged that the company hasn't determined what the exact goals would be for that vehicle. But, he said that it would have "some level of clear autonomous capability with the driver."

As the subcommittee noted in a report, function-specific automation — including automatic brakes and parallel parking — is already available in some cases. Integration of those technologies with throttle and steering control "will begin to reduce the need for driver control of the vehicle."

Ultimately, autonomous vehicles will navigate the road without human input, using electronic sensors and optical cameras to react to well-defined lane and curb markers. Officials said vehicles could move more smoothly and maintain a constant distance between vehicles. The benefit is potentially a traffic system that is less congested and safer. It could also reduce fuel costs.

"This is technology that is going to be liberating," said Robinson.

## Will Drivers Want Driverless Cars?

Earlier this year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued plans for research on autonomous vehicles. It proposed to look into connected-vehicle technology that would allow self-driving cars to communicate via wireless radio signals. That would allow for transmitting information on speed, lane departure and other data.

NHTSA head David Strickland said his agency is looking closely at self-driving vehicle technology. But, he said that a fully autonomous vehicle is "far off in the future."

Several of the officials said one issue to getting self-driving vehicles on the road will be "social acceptance." Will customers be willing to buy expensive automobiles that don't require as much interaction with a driver?

Robinson said some autonomous technology, such as helping a vehicle maintain lane control, could be "brought to market before the decade ends." Congress should continue to let automakers develop new features to compete for customers, he said. And it should work to block any move to create state-by-state "patchwork" requirements for vehicles.

Kirk Steudle is the director of Michigan's Department of Transportation, but he also testified on behalf of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. He said there is a need to accelerate testing across the country and not one state at a time.

## Safety First

Last week, Michigan's state Senate approved legislation that would allow for testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads, mirroring measures taken in a handful of other states. The legislation would still need to be approved in the Michigan House before becoming law in the state.

At the hearing Tuesday, there were also suggestions that the federal government could help protect automakers from lawsuits while the technology is developing.

Asked about how much autonomous vehicles could cost consumers, Robinson said that's not GM's concern right now.

"We're not looking at what we're going to price 10 years from now. We're looking at what we do today that can add value," he said.

Strickland said as the research continues, federal regulators will have to work on processes to make sure the technology is safe.

While the first headline, he said, is about what any technological leap promises, "the second headline is if one of these technologies doesn't perform as expected."
