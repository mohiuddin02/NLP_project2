After four weeks of ferocious fighting, the guns of Gaza fell silent Tuesday with a 72-hour truce in place. Talks to follow in Egypt are being planned. They'll be aimed at forging a lasting agreement between Israel and Palestinian militants who rule Gaza.

The Palestinians are seeking their own country. They and the Israelis have been negotiating — and fighting — over the land for decades. The recent fighting was touched off after the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank. Israel blamed Hamas, arrested Hamas fighters and clamped down on the organization's activities. Hamas responded by launching rockets from Gaza, leading to Israel's air and ground offensive.

With the cease-fire in place, Gazans ventured out for supplies. Others made their way toward ruined districts cut off by earlier fighting. Though several previous cease-fires broke down in violence, some expressed cautious hopes that this might be the beginning of the end of the war.

"It's not just bread to eat," said Abdullah Mustafa, a father of seven who was buying hot loaves at a bakery in Gaza City surrounded by damaged buildings. "Finally, God willing, some air to breathe."

## Heated Talks Expected

Before the halt in hostilities began at 8 a.m. local time, Israel pulled the last of its ground troops out of the narrow seaside strip. Israel deployed its troops in what it described as "defensive positions" on Israel's side of the border fence. Overnight, Israeli forces finished blowing up 32 militant-dug tunnels its forces had located, said military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner.

By midafternoon, the truce appeared to be holding. In Gaza City, families on foot, in rusty automobiles and in donkey-drawn carts began leaving shelters. They began the trek back to bombarded neighborhoods in the northern and eastern part of the territory.

Firing continued up until almost the moment the truce took effect. Militants in Gaza sent a volley of 20 rockets toward Israel. Most of the rockets were destroyed by the Iron Dome antimissile system or fell harmlessly.

Talks to be held in the Egyptian capital of Cairo looked to be heated. Hamas seeks a lifting of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Gaza has been fenced in for years, limiting Gazans' movement and ability to do business.

## Many Died In The Fighting

Israel is reluctant to lift the blockade. It sees removing the blockade as rewarding Hamas. Israel considers the Islamist movement responsible for violence in the run-up to the war. Egypt, which controls the border crossing to southern Gaza, has a government hostile to Hamas which has controlled Gaza since 2007.

The fighting has exacted a heavy toll: nearly 1,900 Palestinians reported dead, with the toll likely to rise when bodies are recovered from previously unreachable areas. Israel says as many as 900 of those are fighters from Hamas or allied militant groups such as Islamic Jihad. On the Israeli side, 64 soldiers and three civilians were killed.

Israel began its air strikes on July 8. On July 17, it widened to a ground incursion in response to weeks of heavy rocket fire. Once operating inside Gaza, Israeli forces uncovered a network of "attack" tunnels. Many lie directly under densely populated areas.

Israel has come under heavy international criticism for failing to take sufficient steps to protect civilians. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in turn has repeatedly blamed Hamas for civilian loss of life. Israel charges that Hamas deliberately positions rocket launchers and tunnels in densely populated areas. Israel says Hamas does so as to put civilians in harm's way.

## Israelis And Palestinians Wary

Both sides remained wary as the calm extended into midmorning. Israel "will respond if it is attacked, and if there are strikes against us," Lerner said. On the Israeli side of the fence, residents of southern communities that have suffered the bulk of rocket and mortar fire said they still did not feel safe.

"We live in constant fear and anxiety," Yankale Argentaro, who lives in a kibbutz near the Gaza boundary, told Israeli TV. He spoke while watching the military disarm a mortar bomb fired from Gaza just before the truce took effect.

The Gaza conflict's ripple effect continued to be felt in the West Bank and Jerusalem. A security guard was stabbed Tuesday at the entrance to an Israeli West Bank settlement. The attacker fled in the direction of a nearby Palestinian village, officials said.

Israeli authorities have blamed other scattered attacks in Jerusalem this week on anger stemming from Palestinian deaths in Gaza.
