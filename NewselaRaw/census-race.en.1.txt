WASHINGTON — For many Americans, checking the right box on the U.S. census form is a reflex, whether it's marking "black," "white," "Hispanic," "Asian," "American Indian" — or all of the above.

But for Americans of Middle Eastern and North African descent, or "MENA," it's a real head-scratcher. They range in shade from pale to deepest ebony, and come from 22 different countries, from Iran to Egypt to Morocco. Most are Arabs, but many are Iranians, Turks and others. And yet, for more than 100 years the MENA community has been lumped into the "white" category on the census form.

Every 10 years, the census is mailed to U.S. homes, asking a range of questions about Americans' lives and their backgrounds.

Today, members of the MENA community are asking the Census Bureau to create a separate "MENA" category for the 2020 count. "White," they argue, renders them invisible in official population counts. Without correct data, they say, cities and states cannot properly fund educational and health programs, track discrimination or staff hospitals with enough translators. Census data has a direct impact on how more than $400 billion in federal funding is spread around the country.

## Counted As White, But "Without The Privileges"

Census data also affects voting results. For example, after the 2010 count, the Census released a list of 248 areas across the country that are required to provide language assistance to voters, most for Spanish-speaking citizens.

"Education is obviously a key point," said Sarab Al-Jijakli, a Brooklyn, New York, community organizer and the president of the Network of Arab-American Professionals. About 25 percent of public schoolchildren in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge may be of Arab descent, he said. "Are the services being given in that school really serving the local community?"

Additionally, some argue that being classified as "white" prevents the MENA community from receiving benefits targeted to minorities — including government programs that assist minority-owned businesses.

"When they pigeonhole us into the 'white' category, it's as if we don't exist," said Samer Khalef, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. "We're counted as 'white,' but we're not treated as 'white.'" As a result of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the MENA community is added to "no-fly" lists on airlines. He says they're "subjected to heightened security wherever we go. We are considered 'white' without the privileges of being 'white.'"

## Race Can Be Diverse And Complex

Since 1980, the Census Bureau has collected data on the growing Arab-American population from an ancestry question on the form. According to responses to that question, there are about 1.6 million Americans of Arab descent. But the Arab-American Institute says that the "ancestry" question results in an undercount of the MENA community. They estimate the number of Arab Americans to be 3.7 million. Counting non-Arab groups such as Iranians, Turks, Chaldeans and Armenians would bring the MENA population up to 5 million, says Helen Hatab Samham, of the Arab-American Institute.

"We have a very diverse and complex identity," she said. "More of us would identify as people of color. The kind of strict racial options that we have right now don't fit."

Currently, the Census breaks down the population into five racial categories — black, white, Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and one ethnic category, Hispanic. Like the MENA population, Hispanics can be of any race.

Some cities and states have chosen to track their MENA populations. Michigan has done surveys to determine why Arab-American infants were dying at a rate 40 percent higher than white babies. Since 2002, the city of San Francisco has held hearings on post-9/11 discrimination against Arab, African, Middle Eastern, Muslim and South Asians. California has the largest MENA population.

## Evolving And Changing Races

Race is an ever changing idea in America. From the 1890s through the 1930s, an African-American with a mixed-race background, for example, could be classified as everything from "quadroon" to "mulatto" to "black" or "Negro." Meanwhile, the "East Asian" category separated into selections for Koreans, Filipinos, Japanese and "Hindus," or South Asians. The stakes were high: Except for freed slaves granted citizenship in 1864, non-whites were not eligible for citizenship for many years.

In 1909, George Shishim, a policeman living in California, fought to claim U.S. citizenship. Because he was born in Lebanon, the United States considered him to be of "Chinese-Mongolian" ancestry and therefore ineligible for citizenship. The Syrian-Lebanese community rallied behind him and hired a lawyer. Ethnographic studies were done to prove that the Arab population is "white." A judge agreed, and Shishim was sworn in as a citizen.

Today, "white" is defined by the government as "any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa."

## A Tedious Process

The process of getting a new category on the census form is a long one, according to Shelly Hedrick, a Census spokeswoman. The bureau is planning to test a new category in 2015 and 2016.

"'White' is a made-up category, 'black' is a made-up category. Categories shift over time," says Akram Khater, director of the Lebanese-American Studies program at North Carolina State University. "(Race) is part of this American reality and it's how people are negotiating their ethnic identities. Those who are Arab- and Iranian-American are starting to construct this community called MENA that is as real or as false as everything else in this country."
