WASHINGTON â€” Republicans and the White House are still fighting over the government shutdown. But the next battle is already coming.

There is a limit to how much the United States can borrow to pay for its spending. The limit is called the debt ceiling. It is set by Congress. The government says that the limit will be reached around Oct. 17. After that, the government may be unable to pay its bills.

Congress gets to make laws. Those laws require money. But later it says the government can't borrow the money. Sounds like a strange system, right? Well, the Founding Fathers made it that way.

## Constitution's Checks And Balances

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to make laws. Congress also gets the power to raise money.

But the Constitution also says the president carries out the laws passed by Congress. It also says he can run a government that is as big as Congress approved.

That is the problem. Congress passes laws that cost money. The president has to make sure the money gets paid. Those two goals don't always match.

This has caused conflicts many times before, said D. Andrew Austin. He wrote a history about the debt limit.

The Constitution set up the fights between Congress and the president as part of a system called checks and balances. The whole purpose of that system was to stop one branch of the government, say Congress, from ruling like a king.

## World War Leads To Borrowing Limit

The legal limit on just how much debt the federal government can borrow didn't start until 100 years ago. That is when Congress let the Treasury sell Liberty Bonds.

Before then, Congress had sometimes allowed the Treasury Department sell bonds to raise money for special projects. People buy bonds because the government promises to pay them back. The government also pays them extra money, called interest.

The Liberty Bonds changed things. Congress approved them so that the government could pay less to borrow as it entered World War I. In 1919, the debt ceiling was about $43 billion. But the government only actually owed about $25.5 billion. Congress did not want to borrow all that was approved.

The U.S. debt ceiling was $45 billion at the start of World War II, Austin said. Then the costs of the war hit. The debt ceiling soared. By 1945, it was $300 billion.

The debt ceiling actually fell after the war. It got down to $270 billion. It stayed there until about 1954. The Korean War was paid for through higher taxes, not more debt. The debt limit didn't return to the World War II level again until March 1962.

## Debt Ceiling Becomes Political Weapon

There were 69 changes to the debt limit from 1962 through the end of the 2007-2008 accounting year. The largest single increase was $984 billion in May 2003. America was borrowing to pay for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq then. It was cutting taxes at the same time.

There was short break from linking politics with the debt ceiling in the 1980s and early 1990s. Lawmakers were tired of passing spending increases and then voting against raising the debt ceiling. It made voters think they were saying one thing and doing another. The vote later to allow more borrowing looked bad, too.

In 1979, the House said that any final vote on a budget automatically raised the debt ceiling. The budget is the country's spending plan.

Both parties liked the rule. They didn't need to take the politically costly vote to raise the debt ceiling. But it did not last. Senators changed the budget passed by the House. So it had to come back to the House for another vote. That was just like voting to raise the debt ceiling.

In 1995, Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich became House speaker. He saw an opportunity to use the debt ceiling to get what he wanted. His party would not agree to raise the debt ceiling, unless it got some things it wanted from the White House in return.

Since then, the party in control of Congress has generally used the debt ceiling to try to get its way.
