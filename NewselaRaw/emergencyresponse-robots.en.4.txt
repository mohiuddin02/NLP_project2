Robots are machines that can do some things people do. Sometimes, they can help when something goes wrong, like a fire or a car crash. Other times, robots are not much help at all.

Robots cannot move very well. Most of them can do only one thing at a time.

## Robots Were Not Much Help

Four years ago, some robots were sent to help workers in Japan. Something bad happened at a nuclear power plant. That is a building that makes energy. The energy makes the electricity in homes. The power plant was hit by a big wave. Everything was destroyed. Radiation was sent into the air.

Radiation is very dangerous and can make people sick. The robots were supposed to go where it was too dangerous for people. But the robots could not help much. They mostly sat around. People had to do the unsafe work.

Since then, robots have become more advanced. Now they are able to do more things.

## Who Will Have The Best Robot?

Next month, we will be able to see some of these new robots. They will compete with each other. The best robots will win prizes.

The robots will have to do all sorts of things. People will pretend something bad has happened. Then the robots will be sent in to fix things. People will make it hard for the robots to do their jobs well. That is what happens when something really bad occurs.

Whoever wins the prize, robots still have a long way to go. It will be a long time before they can really make a difference when something bad happens like in Japan.
