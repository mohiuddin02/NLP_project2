ANKARA, Turkey â€” Ahmet Guvener, a Christian pastor in Turkey, got an exemption to keep his daughter from taking Islamic religion classes required by her school. But the alternatives the school offered her were more religious classes.

His daughter had to choose from three electives: the life of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, a study of Islam's holy book, the Quran, or basic religious knowledge. Without that class, she would fail the year.

"It seriously damaged my child's psychology," said Guvener, who heads the Protestant Church in the city of Diyarbakir, in southeast Turkey. He accuses the school of forcing religious education on the students, but the teachers union denies that claim.

Guvener said the school told him it only offered religion classes because there was no demand for any other electives. He could not believe that, out of 900 students, not one asked for an elective in math or English. The school offered her an astronomy class after he spoke to the media about her case.

Many parents, teachers and students in Turkey are complaining that the government is adding more religion to the country's schools. Thousands of people have protested in the streets recently, asking the government to stop trying to impose Muslim religious ideas in the schools.

## Turkey's Secular Tradition

Turkey, a country between Europe and the Middle East, has long followed the secular, non-religious ideals of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the first president of Turkey. The country is majority Muslim, but the schools are not all religious. Just until recently, the education system had banned Islamic headscarves in schools and made schoolchildren begin the day reciting a pledge of allegiance to Ataturk's legacy.

Now, supporters of that secular tradition claim President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is taking a new path. They say Erdogan, a Muslim whose wife wears a headscarf in public, is building an Islamic education system. They point out he has stated his goal is to raise "pious generations." That is, he wants the Turkish people to be more religious.

The government has loosened the headscarf ban, increased the number of religious schools and stopped the pledge of allegiance. It said student freedom was the reason for bringing back headscarves, but at same time, the schools have banned tattoos, body piercings and dyed hair. Traditional Muslims ban tattoos and piercings, and they insist women must cover their hair with headscarves.

President Erdogan's political group, the Justice and Development Party, insists it is only following majority rule in a conservative country. It says the education measures mean to pull back restrictions on religious education that were imposed in 1997. At the time, the military, which saw itself as the guardian of Ataturk's secular values, was strong enough to pressure the Islamic-led government out of power. In what became known as a "soft military coup," the military also moved to close down vocational religious schools.

## "Education Is An Ideological Tool"

"Education is an ideological tool," said Sakine Esen Yilmaz, secretary-general of the Education and Science Laborer's Union, a liberal group that opposes the increase of religion in schools. Education is now being used "to raise an obedient generation that will serve the government."

In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, thousands of people demonstrated to support secular education. They urged the government to stop what they saw as a campaign to impose the Sunni faith, the Muslim sect followed by the majority of Turks. They also demanded respect for the rights of students from the Alevi Shiite sect that makes up Turkey's largest religious minority.

Hundreds of pro-secular and Alevi students and teachers boycotted school to protest the government's religious education stand. Thousands marched in several Turkish cities holding up banners calling for a secular and science-based education system.

Police used water cannons to disperse thousands of people who marched in Izmir, the third-largest city in the country. Reports said at least 10 people were detained in five Turkish cities for organizing the boycott.

The country's national education advisory council has recommended more measures to add religious education and start at younger ages. This could be a hint of more things to come, because the council is dominated by a pro-government teachers union.

President Erdogan is strongly backing a proposal to add required Ottoman language classes at high schools, but the proposal was later limited to religious schools only. Ottoman is an older version of Turkish, written in Arabic script. The language was abandoned after Ataturk introduced the Latin alphabet in 1928 to make Turkey more Western and modern.

Educators who support the government say Turkey is going back to its cultural roots.  Education was going against Turkish culture and civilization, said Ali Yalcin. He's the deputy head of the pro-government teachers union which proposed many of the recommendations.

Yalcin denies schools are trying to force religion on students through elective classes. What schools are trying to do, he said, is open up religious education to students according to the wishes of the Turkish people.

## Should Schools Have Religion Classes Or More Facilities?

Critics say the government is focused on adding religion in schools, but it ignores the Turkish education system's serious failings. According to a report, Turkish students have done poorly in reading, mathematics and science. Turkey ranked 44th out of 65 countries in those subjects.

Yilmaz, the secretary of the teachers union, said the real problems in schools are being brushed aside. He said teachers have classes with 50 to 60 students. Schools have no labs, libraries or sports facilities, he added.

Religious education does not mean students will grow more religious, said Abbas Guclu, an education expert. After taking their religion classes, young people will spend more time online, watching TV or on social media, he explained.

"It's not possible to control the youth of today," he said.
