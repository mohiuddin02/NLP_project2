TOKYO — Calling it an "injustice" that 62 million girls around the world are not in school, first lady Michelle Obama joined forces with Japan's first lady Thursday. Together, they promised to promote education for girls in developing countries.

Meeting with young women from Japanese universities and high schools, Obama discussed her own journey from a working-class neighborhood in Chicago to Princeton University. It is one of the best colleges in the United States. She encouraged them to pay attention to education and dream big, too.

## Let's "Change The World"

"I'm sitting here with my good friend in Japan (and) with all of you, and we have the opportunity to change the world," the first lady said. "You can do that, too, and so can the 62 million girls out there who aren't getting their education."

Obama was sitting in a circle with the students, as well as with Akie Abe, the wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy. To earn her master's degree, Akie Abe wrote her thesis on education in Myanmar in Southeast Asia.

Japanese women are among the best educated in the world but often struggle to work their way up the career ladder. The country values long days at work and long nights of drinking with colleagues, making it difficult for women to balance work and family. The Abe administration has made increasing female participation in the workforce a key part of its plan to strengthen the Japanese economy and create new jobs.

Obama's solo trip — her first visit to Japan — was part of her effort to promote the Let Girls Learn initiative, which she and President Barack Obama announced earlier this month.

## Brainstorming In Bloom

The women selected to meet Obama Thursday sat nervously in a guest house decorated with elaborate flower arrangements. They waited to discuss ways to promote education with the first lady. She soon put them at ease, bursting out laughing when realizing, after a lengthy introduction, that she had forgotten to wait for her remarks to be translated into Japanese

In a country where students and office workers dress in dark suits, Obama stood out in a bold flowery red-and-white skirt suit.

The first lady was joined on the trip by Michelle Phan, a popular YouTube makeup artist who is also an entrepreneur, a person who creates and runs a business and assumes the risk of whether the company succeeds or not. Phan has a huge following in Asia. She was chronicling the trip on social media.

"Who agrees it's time to help more girls around the world get the education they deserve?" Phan tweeted before the event in a message that was retweeted and favorited hundreds of times.

In another tweet, Phan posted a picture of herself and the American first lady with the caption: "2 Michelles. 1 cause. #LetGirlsLearn #dreamers"

## Educating Girls In 11 Countries

To support the Let Girls Learn program, the president asked Congress for $250 million in new and reallocated funds in his 2016 budget request. Japan, one of Asia's richest countries and the largest donor of aid to other countries in the region, has pledged $340 million for girls' empowerment and education.

For the U.S. part, Peace Corps volunteers will work with local leaders and families in developing countries to help girls go to school and stay in school. The Japanese equivalent of the Peace Corps — the Overseas Cooperation Volunteers — will do the same.

Eleven countries will initially be targeted, including Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in Asia. Obama traveled there Friday night to meet Bun Rany, the wife of the Cambodian prime minister. This was the first trip to Cambodia by an American first lady while her husband, the president, was still in the White House. Obama will also hear from high school students about how they have been helped by community programs.

## Time For An Attitude Adjustment

In many countries, the barriers to girls getting an education were usually considered to amount to an economic issue. Families could not afford to send girls to school or needed them to work to support the family. Yet Obama said there were other reasons and that it was "also about attitudes and beliefs."

"It's about whether fathers — and mothers — think their daughters are as worthy of an education as their sons. It's about whether communities value girls simply for their bodies, for their household labor, their reproductive capacities, or whether they value girls for their minds as well," she said. "And if we're being honest with ourselves, we have to admit that these kinds of challenges aren't just limited to the developing world."
