FRESNO, Calif. — It's been the driest winter in many years in California. And state water officials are being accused of killing salmon and destroying farming, endangering shorebirds, threatening drinking water and quite possibly raising the crime rate.

The officials are not doing any of this personally, of course, but through decisions on how to use the scarce water.

From all over California, farmers, wildlife groups, cities and even the Fresno County sheriff have posted their thoughts on the website of the State Water Resources Control Board. It is a storm of protest, and no one sounds happy.

"This year is a whole new level of crazy," said Ara Azhderian with the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority. The group represents many farmers who are expected to get zero water this year.

## Main Water Supply For Farming

Besides fear, exactly what is setting everybody off?

Mostly, the discussion is about river water allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. It's an old California argument.

The Sacramento and the San Joaquin are the state's two longest rivers. They flow into a network of smaller rivers in the delta. The rivers are the main water supply for 3 million acres of farmland and also supply water to 25 million people.

But it's a balancing act. The fresh water from the rivers must continue to flow out into the Pacific or salt water from the ocean will flow into the delta area. If salt water flows into the delta, that would spoil the water for people, farms and wildlife.

San Joaquin Valley farm groups say too much water has been allowed to escape to the ocean. They feel the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry is being robbed of water.

On the other hand, environmental and fish-farming groups say agriculture is using the drought crisis to get too much water from the river. They worry that the fish will suffer.

The argument spilled into the spotlight in February and March. This may be, oddly, because rain began hitting the state after a sunny, dry December and January.

The February and March storms caused the water levels to rise. And the fight over the extra water was on.

## Rallies And Press Releases

Farmers held massive rallies and pressured lawmakers. They pointed to huge increases of water flow both months. Fishing groups and environmentalists wrote passionate media releases. They criticized officials who let more water be pumped out of the rivers.

In a state defined by water wars, this year stands out.

"This is a big one," said Les Grober. He is the assistant deputy director at the State Water Resources Control Board, which decides questions about California water rights. "We get many issues before us, but this is a very dry year. People are very worried."

Nobody disputes the need. But the storms in February and March caused the outflow of water to peak more than three times higher. Grober said the delta needed a good flushing to push out the salty ocean water from the dry months. Pumping did not greatly increase.

So how much water should flow to the ocean and how much should go into the south delta?

That depends on tides and the presence of federally protected fish, such as salmon. It also depends on rainfall and drought, scientists say.

"Should that balance be 80-20 — 80 percent going out and 20 percent being pumped?" asked Azhderian. "That was the split in February and March."

Valley farmers who rely on water say they do not have enough water to farm. They will not be able to plant hundreds of thousands of acres this year.

Last Friday, the state announced it would allow farmers and cities to take 5 percent of their allocation from the State Water Project. Farms and cities are each allowed, or allocated, a certain amount of water they are able to use. The decision was made because of the February and March storms.

Environmentalists say the picture is much bigger than river flow through the delta. It should include water captured and stored at huge reservoirs.

## Fish, Farm And Crime?

The water in storage may help in the future. But it still can't flow out to the ocean, said conservation biologist Jon Rosenfield. He is with the nonprofit Bay Institute in San Francisco.

The fish versus farm debate dominates headlines, but people commenting to the state board raised many other issues.

In the delta, people are extremely concerned about their communities as water cutbacks continue, said Janet McCleery. She lives in Discovery Bay, a community in the delta.

"We're just trying to protect our home and life," she wrote, "and trying to save the salmon and local delta farmers while we're at it."

In Fresno County, drought and a zero allocation of Northern California river water will mean unemployment rates could climb to 50 percent in some towns, Sheriff Margaret Mims wrote to the water board. Crime could become a bigger problem as a result, she said.

"There is a clear link between unemployment and public safety, and thus between water shortages and public safety," Mims wrote.
