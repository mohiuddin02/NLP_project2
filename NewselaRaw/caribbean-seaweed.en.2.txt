KINGSTON, Jamaica — The beaches that visitors to the Caribbean expect to be picture-perfect are not looking so good these days. Increasingly, the smooth, white sands and blue, sparkling waters are being fouled. The problem is seaweed — lots and lots of seaweed.

Piles of decaying seaweed that smell like rotten eggs are popping up everywhere. To make things worse, the seaweed is attracting sand fleas with a nasty bite.

Clumps of the brownish seaweed known as sargassum have long washed up on Caribbean coastlines. However, researchers say much more sargassum than ever before has been showing up in recent years. This year appears to be another record-breaker. A number of shorelines have been so severely hit that some tourists have canceled summer trips. Lawmakers on Tobago have called the seaweed piles a "natural disaster."

## Emergency Cleanup Planned

From the Dominican Republic in the north, to Barbados in the east, and Mexico's Caribbean resorts to the west, officials are planning emergency cleanup efforts. Much work will be required to clear the stinking mounds of seaweed. In some cases the sargassum has piled up nearly 10 feet high on beaches. It has choked scenic coves and cut off moored boats.

The Caribbean is the globe's most tourism-dependent region. With the start of the main tourist season just a few months away, some officials are calling for an emergency meeting of the 15-nation Caribbean Community. They are worried that the worsening seaweed situation could become a recurring, long-term problem.

"This has been the worst year we've seen so far. We really need to have a regional effort on this," said Christopher James, chairman of the Tobago Hotel and Tourism Association. "This unsightly seaweed could end up affecting the image of the Caribbean."

## Climate Change A Possible Cause

There are various ideas about what is causing the seaweed boom that scientists say started in 2011. Some researchers blame climate change. They say warming ocean temperatures are helping sargassum bloom, while changes in the ocean currents are sending the seaweed toward the Caribbean. Others believe the explosive growth is primarily due to an increase in the quantity of sewage waste and fertilizers used in farming being dumped into waters. Both would help the seaweed grow faster and more abundantly.

Seaweed expert Brian Lapointe says sargassum washing up in normal amounts has long been good for the Caribbean. However, severe inflows like those seen lately are harmful. They can cause fish kills, beach fouling, tourism losses and even coastal dead zones.

"Considering that these events have been happening since 2011, this could be the 'new normal.' Time will tell," Lapointe said.

## Some Drifts All The Way To Africa

The mats of drifting sargassum have become so numerous in the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean they are even drifting as far away as West Africa. They have been piling up fast along the coasts of both Sierra Leone and Ghana.

Sargassum is one of a group of simple plants known as algae. It is brownish in color and covered with berry-like sacs. Having no real roots, it simply drifts where the currents take it. Sargassum generally blooms in the Sargasso Sea, a 2-million-square-mile body of warm water in the North Atlantic.

However, some scientists believe the sargassum washing up on a growing number of beaches may not actually be from the Sargasso Sea at all. They say the huge pileups are due to blooms in the Atlantic's equatorial region. They suggest these blooms are caused by fertilizers and sewage waste dumped into South America's Amazon and Orinoco rivers. Both of those rivers feed into the Atlantic.

## Shoreline Mess Can Kill Baby Turtles

Whatever the reason, the massive sargassum flow is becoming a major challenge for tourism-dependent countries. In large doses, the algae harms coastal environments. It even causes the deaths of baby sea turtles, who get tangled up in the seaweed after they hatch. Cleanup efforts by work crews using heavy machinery may also damage beaches.

Mexico plans to spend about $9 million cleaning up seaweed mounds that have built up along that country's Caribbean coast. Part of the money will be used to test whether the sargassum can be collected at sea before it reaches shore.

Some tourists in hard-hit areas are trying to prevent their summer vacations from being ruined by the stinking algae.

"The smell of seaweed is terrible," German tourist Oliver Pahlke said during a visit to Cancun, Mexico. "But I'm enjoying the sun."

Anne Alma, a Canadian tourist in Barbados, said friends had warned her about the rotting seaweed mounds. Still, she did not let them discourage her from visiting the Eastern Caribbean island.

Earlier, she had watched crews truck away big piles of the stuff. Since then, yet more of the mats had drifted to shore. She could not help wondering what Mexico would do with all the sargassum being removed from beaches.

"I just wonder where the seaweed is going to go," she said.
