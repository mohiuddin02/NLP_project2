TRENTON, N.J. — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday he "reluctantly" signed a bill that prohibits attempts to convert children from gay to straight.

Christie said he is reluctant to limit parents' choices when it comes to the care and treatment of their children. But he said that in weighing medical experts' positions on the controversial practice of gay conversion therapy, he decided to sign the bill into law.

He cited the American Psychological Association, which has found the treatment can lead to depression, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts.

"I believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate," Christie wrote in a statement.

## Christie Running For Re-election

The ban of conversion therapy comes as Christie runs for re-election in New Jersey this year and sets himself for a possible presidential campaign in 2016. His past comments set him apart from the more conservative wing of the Republican Party, which holds that homosexuality is a sin. The conservative wing also holds that people choose to be homosexual and are not born gay.

When asked about the bill signing at a political event on Monday morning, Christie did not answer, and let the written statement speak for itself.

In addition to the signing statement, Christie's office also distributed a 2011 clip of the governor being interviewed about homosexuality by CNN's Piers Morgan.

Morgan asked Christie if homosexuality is a sin and the governor, who is Catholic, responded that his religion says it is.

"But for me, I've always believed that people are born with the predisposition to be homosexual," Christie said in the interview. "And so I think if someone is born that way, it's very difficult to say then that's a sin."

## "Government Should Tread Carefully"

The bill won broad support in the New Jersey Legislature. But supporters of the conversion practice said it infringes on the rights of parents.

Christie said he was concerned about that.

"Government should tread carefully into this area and I do so here reluctantly," he wrote. "I have scrutinized this piece of legislation with that concern in mind."

The legislation prohibits licensed counselors — including psychologists, social workers and therapists — from attempting to change a child's sexual orientation.

During committee hearings, witnesses described brutal childhood experiences in which they were forced to undergo conversion therapy efforts.

"Studies and personal testimony have shown this practice creates irreparable harm on young people struggling to come to terms with their sexuality," Assemblyman Tim Eustace said in a statement Monday. He was one of the bill's sponsors.

## Vetoed Same-Sex Marriage Bill

The legislation passed the Assembly by a 56-14 vote in June with seven legislators declining to vote one way or the other. The Senate approved it by a vote of 28-9 that same month.

Garden State Equality, a group that supports gay rights, made a statement Monday praising Christie's decision to sign the bill.

"It is our truest hope that the Governor will realize as the majority of the legislature and a super majority of the New Jersey public have realized, that the best way to ensure our LGBT youth are protected from the abuse of being ostracized, is to provide them with full equality," the group said. LGBT is an abbreviation for lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender.

Christie has mostly earned only criticism from gay advocates. He vetoed a bill last year that would have allowed same-sex marriage in New Jersey. He insists that the measure should be put to the voters instead. His opponents argue that same-sex marriage is a civil right, and such rights should not be decided by popular vote.
