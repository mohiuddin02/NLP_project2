If Chester Nez spoke his Navajo language in school, he was punished right away. First, he had to scrub his tongue with a toothbrush. Then, he had to wash out his mouth with soap.

So, Nez was interested when Marines showed up in 1942: They were seeking young men like him who knew both English and Navajo.

That day, Nez was invited to join a new top-secret group. The group later became known as the Navajo code talkers.

The original group was made up of 29 men. Together, they developed a military code based on the Navajo language. The code was unbreakable.

The men risked their lives in the fight against the Japanese in World War II. They sent and decoded highly important military messages. They helped win victories and save lives.

## A Warrior

He didn't have to volunteer. [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American) were hardly considered citizens back then. But Nez's pride in his people was strong. "I reminded myself that my Navajo people had always been warriors, protectors," he wrote years later. "In that there was honor. I would concentrate on being a warrior, on protecting my homeland."

Nez was the last of the original 29 code talkers still living. He died Wednesday at 93.

Nez was born in 1921 in Two Wells, New Mexico. His mother died when he was about 3. When he was about 9, his father sent him off to boarding schools to learn English.

The Marines showed up at his high school in the spring of 1942. The recruiters did not say why they needed Navajos. However, the promise of adventure appealed to the teenager.

"The Navajo feeling is to go to the top of the hill and see what's on the other side," he said in 2001.

## A Coder

Nez and the others were sent to Camp Elliott in San Diego. It was there that they learned just how challenging their task would be.

The Japanese had already broken every code. As a way to outwit them, the military had decided to try using the Navajo language.

Nez and the others were kept in a room for 13 weeks. Their task was this: to come up with Navajo words that stood for the letters A to Z. They also had to figure out code words for military terms.

At first "everybody thought we'd never make it," Nez recalled.

The men finally came up with a clever code, however.

"Wol-la-chee," the Navajo word for "ant," represented A.

"Na-hash-chid," the word for "badger," was B.

"Moasi," the word for "cat," was C, and so on.

For important military words, they came up with easy-to-remember code names. So, for example, "a-ye-shi," the word for "eggs," meant "bombs." "Ni-ma-si," or "potatoes," meant "grenades."

## A Marine

The first message Nez sent was at Guadalcanal in November 1942: "Enemy machine gun next on your right. Destroy." The Allied forces blasted the target.

After Guadalcanal, Nez never stopped moving. He was at the Battle of Bougainville in New Guinea in November 1943. He was at Guam in July 1944 and Peleliu and Angaur in September 1944. Everywhere he went, he sent and received top-secret messages.

Navajo code talkers were particularly important for one battle: the attack on Iwo Jima. In the first 48 hours, they sent and decoded 800 messages. "Were it not for the Navajos," wrote Marine Major Howard Conner, "the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima."

"I worried every day that I might make" a mistake "that cost American lives," Nez said a few years ago. "But our code was the only code in modern warfare that was never broken. The Japanese tried, but they couldn't" do it.
