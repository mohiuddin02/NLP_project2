You may want to hold your nose before reading this: Doctors have found a way to put healthy people's poop into pills. And these pills are now being used to cure serious gut infections.

Canadian researchers tried this new treatment on 27 patients. They cured them all.

Yes, it's a gross topic. But it's also a serious problem. Half a million Americans get Clostridium difficile, or C-diff, infections each year. And about 14,000 of them die. The germ causes upset stomachs, cramping and terrible diarrhea.

Our bodies need good bacteria to digest, or break down, food. The problem is, sometimes harmful bacteria grow inside our gut. This messes up our digestion and makes us sick.

## "These People Are Not Eating Poop"

C-diff is one of the nastiest of these harmful bacteria.

There is a very strong and expensive medicine that can kill C-diff. But it also destroys the good bacteria that help keep us healthy.

Recently, scientists discovered something interesting: Poop from a healthy person can be used to regrow good bacteria in a sick person.

But the ways doctors have been doing this are expensive and uncomfortable. Sometimes they send poop through a tube stuck far up a patient's rear end. Other times they use a throat tube. Another method they use doesn't always work and is also uncomfortable. They pump liquid poop up the rear.

Now Dr. Thomas Louie has come up with a better way.

It works like this: Healthy poop is collected, usually from a relative. Then the good bacteria is removed from the poop. It is cleaned and packed into pills.

There's no poop left, just bacteria, Louie said. "These people are not eating poop." There are no smelly burps, because the bacteria aren't released until they're well past the stomach.

## But Patients Have To Swallow A LOT Of Pills

Patients need to swallow between 24 and 34 pills, one after the other. The pills make their way to the large intestine, or colon. Healthy bacteria are released and begin growing.

On Thursday, Louie described 27 patients he had treated. All had suffered at least four C-diff infections. None got sick again after taking the poop pills.

One patient was 69-year-old Margaret Corbin. She had a C-diff infection that lasted for two years.

"It was horrible," she said. "I thought I was dying. I couldn't eat. Every time I ate anything or drank water I was into the bathroom. I never went anywhere, I stayed home all the time."

She took pills made by Louie two years ago. "I've been perfectly fine since," Corbin said.

For now, Louie's treatment must be made fresh for each patient. The reason is that the pills gradually dissolve at room temperature. Their water content breaks down the gel coating. But Minnesota doctors are experimenting with freezing the poop. This doesn't kill the bacteria, so the pills could be stored and shipped anywhere a patient needed them.

Other researchers are trying to find which bacteria most help fight off C-diff. Those might be grown in a lab dish and given to patients. Then the patients would not have to take all the different bacteria found in normal poop.

Dr. Louie thinks the poop pills might have other uses besides curing C-diff infections. They may also help people with different kinds of gut bacteria problems. "So," he said, "it's not just about C-diff."
