WASHINGTON â€” People in Ferguson, Missouri, have been protesting for more than a week. The protests started after a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager. Police officers arrived at the demonstrations in armored vehicles and pointed powerful rifles at unarmed protesters. The officers wore camouflage, the type of clothing soldiers wear in combat.

The photos of the police have stirred a big question. Are police departments getting too much military-style equipment from the U.S. government?

Politicians who are usually on different sides agreed that the response in Ferguson was wrong. U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder called it "unnecessarily extreme displays of force" by police.

## Questions Are Being Asked

The debate fits into a larger pattern. There was a huge increase in violence in the 1970s and 1980s. Tough-on-crime laws across the country followed. Things have improved over 20 years in most places. Now, policies such as long, automatic prison sentences and more police spying are being questioned.

The use of military-style equipment is the latest tactic to be questioned.

Since 1995, the Defense Department has given out $5.1 billion in extra military equipment. Police departments have gotten sleeping bags, cameras and office equipment. But they have also received more heavy-duty equipment. A Defense Department spokesman said assault rifles, helicopters and vehicles that can drive over explosives are also being given away.

This year, the Defense Department program is being reconsidered. Normally, there would have been little argument about continuing it.

Now, things are different. Carl Levin is the Michigan Democrat who heads the  Senate Armed Services Committee. On Friday, he said the program needed to be reviewed. Congress needs "to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended," he said.

## When Free Becomes Expensive

Local police departments need extra money. Meanwhile, we live in an age of mass shootings and terrorist threats. Faced with this environment, police chiefs face a huge temptation to accept federal freebies, said Jim Bueermann. He is president of the Police Foundation and a former chief in Redlands, California.

"Just because we can get the equipment, it doesn't mean we should use it," he said.

In some cases, the problems become obvious quickly.

Last year, the small police department in Banning, California, ordered an 18-ton tank. A police sergeant was assigned to pick up the tank and transport it home. Along the way, a tire blew out on Interstate 10 in southern Arizona. The vehicle slid across the roadway, wrecked a pickup truck and knocked out the windshield of another vehicle.

No one was injured, but the accident cost Banning $42,000. Angry city officials and residents demanded to know why police needed a tank.

In other cases, departments have received equipment they could not afford to maintain. "A tire can cost $10,000 or $12,000" to replace on some vehicles, said Mark Lomax. He is executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association. The nonprofit group trains special police groups called "SWAT" teams.

SWAT teams were created in the 1960s. Los Angeles Deputy Chief Mike Downing oversees counterterrorism and other special operations. He said in a recent report that police SWAT teams have become military units.

## Learning To Use The Equipment

Police departments often begin using heavy equipment for mainly simple missions, Downing said. He called the practice "dangerous and unnecessary."

Departments need to ask, "Do we need the type of weapon they are offering?" said Chris Nanos, chief deputy of the Pima County Sheriff's Department in southern Arizona. "A 14-ton armored vehicle? I don't know what you would do with that."

Lack of training and leadership can be as big a problem as overpowering equipment, said Ron McCarthy. The former Los Angeles police SWAT team supervisor now advises police departments. "If you're not going to provide the appropriate training, you shouldn't have the equipment," he said.

Other police experts said that military-style gear has an important role. However, it needs to be used properly.

Eugene O'Donnell is a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. He said police sometimes need to use force.

"This week's story is police overreaction. Next week's story is going to be police underreaction," O'Donnell said.
