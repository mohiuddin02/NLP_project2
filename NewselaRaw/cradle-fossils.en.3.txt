The two men were cavers. They enjoyed the challenge of exploring dark and possibly dangerous caves. One day in September 2013 they set out on a particularly difficult route.

The men were exploring one of a group of caves in South Africa known as Rising Star. Their goal was an unexplored chamber deep underground.

## The Long And Winding Search

Most people believed the cave had already given up most of its treasures years ago. American scientist Lee Berger thought otherwise. He asked the men to keep their eyes open for ancient bones.

The men first had to feel their way along the cave's winding passages. Then they had to crawl on their stomachs through an opening less than 10 inches high. Next, they climbed a rough wall, then crossed a narrow ledge known as the "Dragon's Back." They then had to wriggle sideways through a narrow crack, heading down 400 feet. Finally they arrived at their goal, the hidden chamber. The chamber was 30-feet-long and probably between 2 million and 3 million years old.

What they found that day amazed them. The chamber they entered contained more than 1,500 bones and teeth buried in ancient clay. The remains looked almost human, but clearly were not.

## New Discovery, Old Human Relative

After the big discovery, Berger led a further month of digging. The bones and teeth that were removed were carefully studied for two years.

On Thursday, Berger was finally ready to announce what had been found. The remains the two men discovered belong to a previously unknown type of human relative, he said.

The new discovery has been named Homo naledi. "Naledi" means "star" in Sesotho, a South African language. The word was chosen because of the name of the caves.

The fact that so many bones were found is very useful, Berger said. It gives scientists a very clear idea of what Homo naledi looked like.

Berger and his fellow scientists say Homo naledi may be one of the earliest members of the genus Homo. Today's humans also belong that same genus, or group of animals.

## "Surprising" That They Buried The Dead

"Homo" is the Latin word for man. Today's humans are known as Homo sapiens. All the different types of animals that belong to the genus Homo are known as hominids, meaning manlike creatures.

Parts of at least 15 different bodies were found in the chamber. The bodies were those of men, women, children and babies. What surprised scientists the most was that the bodies seemed to have been put there purposely after death. It did not seem as if the creatures had died there in an accident, or were killed together. Instead it looked as if they had been carefully buried by other members of their group. Scientists had not thought such ape-like creatures would do something like that.

"It's enormously surprising," Berger said. "To see it in a small-brained hominid is completely surprising."

## Ape-Like Traits Mixed In

Homo naledi is an unusual mix of the ape-like and the modern human, the scientists said. Its brain was no larger than a baseball. Its fingers were long and curved, allowing it to climb and swing from the trees. Its shoulders and chest were apelike. At the same time, its wrist bones show that it used tools. Its long legs and feet were almost exactly the same as those of modern man. They allowed it to walk upright and to travel for many miles at a time.

"We had never seen a creature like this before," said scientist John Hawks.

Berger says he is certain the remains are more than 2.5 million years old. Homo naledi is therefore among the earliest relatives of modern human beings. It could even be the earliest member of our family tree, he said. Perhaps we are all descended from Homo naledi.

Berger said he and his team plan to return to the chamber.

"This chamber has not given up all its secrets," he added.
