PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti â€” A few years ago, a group of Haitian high school students made up a project for the final exam on their physics class. They wanted to fix the broken traffic light down the street. They studied traffic lights, made a machine that operates on batteries and ran a cable from their classroom to the street. A few weeks later, the traffic light on the corner came alive.

Difficulties help make things better, said Guy Etienne, the school's chemistry teacher and principal. Adversity can help students learn how to think critically and solve problems.

"What we are developing in students' minds is that when you are confronted with a challenge, go find a solution; don't just cross your arms and say you can't because it's difficult," he said.

That idea has made College Catts Pressoir one of Haiti's most famous schools. It also has given Etienne the biggest honor yet of his 34-year teaching career. He is one of 10 finalists for a $1 million prize for the world's best teacher. To place in the top 10, Etienne beat more than 5,000 teachers from 127 countries. The prize, awarded by the Varkey Foundation, was started by Indian businessman Sunny Varkey.

## Haiti's Pride And Joy

Etienne said a lot of parents did not agree with him over the years, but now the world does and it keeps him going.

"This is a great honor, not just for me but for the country," said Etienne. "What makes me proud is that every Haitian is identifying him or herself with this honor."

The education minister, Nesmy Manigat, isn't surprised by the honor. He picked Etienne to join a group working on new class plans. Manigat wants to fix Haiti's schools by improving the curriculum and changing how courses are taught; last year, half the students who were going to graduate failed their final exams.

Manigat called Etienne a role model. He wished other teachers would follow his example and improve Haiti's schools.

For Etienne, the nomination for the teacher prize is the latest of many honors.

Soon, he will travel to Denmark to collect another prize. The LEGO Foundation named Catts Pressoir one of 10 champions in its Re-imagine Learning Challenge. The prize honors the school for helping students build skills and making a community better.

## Helping Haiti With Science And Tech

Catts Pressoir has long been known among Haiti's middle class as a good school. It is recognized for the students' clever science and technology projects as well as for its teacher training. Last year, students created a street security camera, which they offered to Haiti's National Police and the government.

When he isn't teaching, Etienne is in his office on the second floor, looking over the basketball court. His walls are decorated with awards and students' photos.

Etienne said his dream has always been to make Haiti famous with his teaching. He could have made more money working as an engineer, but he says teaching is his life.

It hasn't always been easy. After taking over the school, Etienne picked lessons based on science and technology.

A lot of parents didn't agree, Etienne said. The good schools back then were teaching children grammar and the history of Haiti. Students learned by memorizing and repeating facts.

Everything the students learn now applies to helping Haiti.

Today, parents like the school's modern ways and small class sizes. Classes have 20 to 39 students, with enrollment totaling only 700 students. The quality is as good as an American or French school, said well-known Haitian playwright and author Gary Victor, as he dropped his children off at school.

Catts Pressoir is unusual in Haiti, where most schools don't have qualified teachers, Victor said. This school allows students to express themselves and encourages them to develop their talents.

## Crumbling Books, A Missing Floor

It's hard to keep the school open; it must keep borrowing money, Etienne said. Students in chemistry class share books. The shelves are full of worn books with pages that are falling apart. The school's third floor has been missing since 2010, when the earthquake struck Haiti.

Etienne wants to use the prize money to help more students take online classes at the school. He would love to buy each student a tablet computer. But the money is not important, Etienne said.

"The money comes in and it must go out so that we can improve the education we are giving the students."
