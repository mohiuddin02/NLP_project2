LOS ANGELES â€” Marcquees Banks has been taken out of class twice in the last three years. Both times he had been fighting with other students. He was even sent to another school.

Something different happened the third time Banks got into a fight. This time a counselor pulled Banks and the other teen aside. He told them to talk to each other.

The counselor is named Joseph Luciani. His works at Augustus Hawkins High School in South Los Angeles.

## Restorative Justice

Luciani asked the teens to explain why they had fought. He also wanted to know how they felt.

Luciani was using something called restorative justice. The idea is to get students to work out their differences. The goal is to avoid suspending students.

Banks said that talking to the student he fought with helped.

"I realized we had a lot of similarities," he said. Banks said his father is in a gang and his mother has no job.

The new approach has led to big changes. Things are very different at Augustus Hawkins than they were five years ago. Many fewer students at Augustus Hawkins get suspended.

## We Need To Talk

Teachers and students are now encouraged to talk to each other. They gather in circles each week to talk about their problems.

One-on-one circles are formed when students get angry at each other. Parents and counselors are invited to those talks.

Not everyone is sure restorative justice really works, though.

Some are worried it could make teachers afraid to suspend anyone, no matter what they do. They think some students might act up even more.

So far, restorative justice seems to be working at Augustus Hawkins. The school was opened in 2012. It is located in a poor and rough part of Los Angeles.

At first, the school's principals suspended a lot of students.

## Trusting Each Other

Then the school hired Joseph Luciani. Over the summer, Luciani trained teachers to use restorative justice in the classroom.

Luciani taught teachers how to make students and teachers trust each other. Once a week, teachers gathered students together. They asked questions about the students' lives. Students talked about relatives who have been killed or forced to leave the country.

Students are no longer suspended right when when they cause trouble. Teachers try to handle the situation in class. If that does not work they send the student to a counselor. Students who still cause trouble are sent to the principal. If necessary, they are suspended.

## Learning To Change

However, some wonder: Are the students who are not suspended learning that what they did is wrong? Or are they just getting away with misbehaving?

Howard Zehr is an expert on restorative justice. He says students do learn that what they did is wrong. They learn it when they talk to the students they harmed.

Banks said he has begun thinking differently about his future. He said he always thought he would end up in jail. Everyone around him thought that would happen, so he did too.

Now, he wants to be a counselor.
