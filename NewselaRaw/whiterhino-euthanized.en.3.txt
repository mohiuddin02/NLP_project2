There are now just three northern white rhinos left on Earth. Nola, the only white rhino in the United States, was put to sleep by the San Diego Zoo. She was 41 years old. Her already bad health had become worse. With Nola's death, there are only three of the huge, two-horned animals left in the world. 

The park announced it was stunned by the loss but will "fight even harder to end extinction." 

The northern white rhino is a close relative of the white rhinoceros that once lived across many parts of Africa. They are among the largest land animals on Earth. Only elephants are bigger. The northern white rhino can run at speeds of more than 30 miles an hour, and their horns, tough skin and huge size mean they have no natural predators.

However, they have unnatural predators. Humans hunt them for their valuable horns. 

The rare breed have also been destroyed by civil wars. Their natural surroundings have been ruined. Between 1960 and 2015 the number of northern white rhinos dropped from 2,000 to five.

## No Northern White Rhinos Left In Wild

This year, that number fell to three. 

No northern white rhinos have lived in the wild since 2008.

The three northern white rhinos left live at Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a wildlife preserve in Kenya, Africa. All three rhinos are too old or too unhealthy to breed. When these animals die, the northern white rhino will be gone from the world. Their only chance is if scientists can solve the problem.

The northern white rhino "disappeared right in front of our eyes and we didn't realize it until it was too late," Kathleen Garrigan said. She works for the African Wildlife Foundation.

## Close Relative Saved From Extinction

The southern white rhinoceros is a close relative of the northern white. It has done much better. According to the group Save The Rhino, more than 20,000 of the creatures are alive in the wild. They were almost wiped out. Back in 1900 just about 20 of the rhinos were alive.  

The numbers of southern white rhinos went up for several reasons. They were protected by law, and scientists worked to breed them. In addition, hunting them has been controlled. Still, the World Wildlife Fund said a record 1,215 white rhinos were killed in South Africa in 2015. Now, officials are using new ways to save them. For instance, microchips are placed in rhino horns to track them.

The northern rhinos left in Kenya are guarded 24 hours a day. Still, no one expects their numbers to grow. The lone male is too old to mate. The two females cannot carry a baby until birth.

Yet scientists are hoping they can make a miracle happen.

## Zoo Plans Program To Reproduce Animals

Veterinarian Barbara Durrant works for the San Diego Zoo. She and other scientists have a new plan. They have reproductive cells from 12 northern white rhinos. Using the stored cells the scientists hope an embryo will grow in the lab. An embryo is a cluster of cells that grow into a baby. The plan is to use southern white rhino females as surrogate mothers. A surrogate carries a baby for another mother. The surrogate southern white rhinos would carry and deliver northern white rhino babies. The experiment is still in the testing stage. Durrant said it's only been done twice. Both times the cells failed to grow properly. 

The San Diego Zoo has set aside $2 million for the new plan. 

Meanwhile, workers at Ol Pejeta in Kenya have been rushing to save eggs from the last two living female northern white rhinos.

Richard Vigne is the head of the Ol Pejeta preserve. "It's kind of a race against time," he said in June. "Those remaining females could all die tomorrow." At the time, there were still four northern white rhinos alive.
