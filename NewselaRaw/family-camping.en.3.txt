KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” The Minter family had just spent the day outdoors in Weston Bend State Park in Missouri. They were there as part of Missouri State Parks' Learn2 Camp. The family had gone hunting for bugs and other fun activities. Their car hadn't even left the park when Tessa, 8, and Isaac, 6, began begging to go back.

They wanted another night to roast marshmallows. They wanted to sing "I've Been Workin' On The Railroad" around a campfire again.

That is exactly what Missouri State Parks wants to hear.

Not as many people buy permits to camp in Missouri's parks nowadays. Fewer people have been staying overnight in parks across the country since the 1980s. Visitors are choosing the comfort of nearby motels instead.

## A Test Run With A Tent

Learn2 Camp helps families without camping experience learn about the outdoors. They are brought to a park for a weekend. The program gives them camping gear and arranges activities, said Stephanie Deidrick. She is a spokeswoman for Missouri State Parks.

They are taught lessons like how to pitch a tent. They are taught how to cook over a campfire, too. Deidrick hopes the lessons will make families more willing to camp on their own in the future.

Getting kids into camping early is good. It increases the chances they will camp as grownups, Deidrick said.

The program was exactly what Kelly Minter wanted.

Her kids had been begging for a camping trip for a long time. The family had set one up at Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park for the end of June.

After the camping trip was planned, Kelly Minter got worried. Would they know enough about setting up a tent? Or starting a fire?

This year's Learn2 Camp at Weston Bend was the perfect test run.

With the help of park workers, Ron Minter figured out how to put up a huge six-person tent. Isaac and Tessa learned how to pick out different trees, insects and animal tracks. Ron Minter was taught to use sticks to start a campfire. No more lighter fluid and starter logs for him, his wife hopes.

"I think we might be camping more," Kelly Minter said.

## Big Drop In American Campers

Each year some Americans are asked about their camping experiences. A camping group asks the survey questions. Then it puts all of their responses into a report called "American Camper." It said 40 million Americans went camping in 2013. That was down about 424,000 from 2012 - and down 6 million from 2009.

The National Park Service said that national parks had nearly 12 million overnight visits in 1981. By 2000, that number had fallen to about 9 million.

Jeffrey Olson is a spokesman for the National Park Service. He said the way Americans experience parks changed in the last 30 years. The number of visitors reached an all-time high last year. They just did not spend the night.

Now visitors can stay overnight in nearby towns.

"They have a lot more in the way of services for visitors, like motel rooms and seats in restaurants. Some people love to spend the night near national parks and then get up and go after breakfast in the morning," Olson said.

The drop in camping may also be because Americans today spend more time at work.

In 2014, "American Camper" asked campers some survey questions. One out of every 7 said if they had "more free time or vacation time" they would continue camping.

## Get Them When They're Young

The Learn2 Camp program does try to take advantage of one positive fact.

The 2013 "American Camper" report found that 8 out of every 10 campers took their first trip before they turned 16. After that key age, any chance of a person going camping falls quite a bit.

Missouri State Parks knows this. It is why they want to introduce children to camping when they are younger. It could start an outdoor tradition they will pass down to their own kids someday, Deidrick said.
