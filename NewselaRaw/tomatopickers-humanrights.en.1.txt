IMMOKALEE, Fla. — Lucas Benitez, 17 and newly arrived from Mexico, was staking a row of tomatoes on a scorched southwest Florida farm. Sweat drenched his long-sleeve shirt and soaked his thick black hair. Quick on his feet, Benitez finished ahead of his co-workers, then stopped to wait for the others to catch up.

Benitez recalled how his supervisor drove a pickup closer to confront him. He wanted Benitez to help unload a truck instead of taking a time-wasting break, and even more than that, he wanted to show him who was in control.

Benitez, 120 pounds, insisted on staying put. Why should he be punished for his speed, when he was accomplishing the same tasks as the rest of the crew? The 200-pound boss threw a punch, but the teen blocked it with one hand, a tomato stake in the other, ready for a fight. He looked the boss in the eye and saw wide-eyed shock.

"It was the first time anyone had said anything to him," recalled Benitez, now 40.

## 20-Year Effort For Dignity, Fair Pay

Not long after that incident, Benitez became one of the leaders of a new farmworker-led movement.

Most Americans do not realize it, but almost every Florida tomato they eat comes from fields surrounding the impoverished Florida town of Immokalee.

The workers who pick those tomatoes have spent more than 20 years on a campaign for dignity and fair pay. Against incredible odds, they have succeeded in getting some of the biggest corporations in the country to recognize their plight.

A bloodied shirt became a symbol that helped awaken the movement.

The shirt came to represent the story of Edgar, a 16-year-old tomato worker from Guatemala, who asked his boss for a water break and was refused. When Edgar went to get water anyway, he suffered a savage beating and a broken nose.

## Attack On Teen Launched A Movement

Benitez spread news of the assault, waving the bloodied shirt at a rally in sleepy Immokalee in 1996\. "When you beat one of us, you beat us all," he told the crowd.

Benitez and seven other workers, mostly young men like himself, formed the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. Soon, they would come to be known as one of the most successful farmworker organizing groups in the country.

In the 1990s, tomato workers were paid about 30 cents for picking a 32-pound bucket of tomatoes, the same wage they earned in 1975\. Workers earned no more than $10,000 a year for back-breaking, dangerous labor. 

Most of the workers were immigrants from Mexico and Central America, and many were teenagers. They were often treated brutally, were sometimes kept in almost slave-like conditions, and were frequently exposed to dangerous chemicals.

## Seeking Support From Food Giants

The coalition soon began asking farm owners for a pay increase, but all but a few refused to pay anything more.

Then workers had an idea: Why not skip over the farmers and approach the food giants directly? Why deal with landowners when it is really the large corporations that have the power, as they buy enormous quantities of tomatoes for their grocery shelves and restaurants?

The workers decided to start with Taco Bell, which was known for buying massive quantities of tomatoes at bargain-basement prices. 

After writing Taco Bell and getting no response, the workers decided to organize a boycott. If they could get enough people to stop buying Taco Bell's products, the company would have to listen.

The workers turned to students for help, and soon a Student/Farmworker Alliance was organized to help support the boycott campaign.

## After 4 Years, Taco Bell Agrees

Alliance members began organizing a series of Taco Bell protests in 2004\. The students got 22 high schools and colleges to "Boot the Bell" and cut school-cafeteria contracts with the fast-food giant. 

After four years, coalition supporters finally succeeded in getting Taco Bell to do the unthinkable: The corporation agreed to pay a penny more per pound of tomatoes, with the extra money going directly to workers. It also signed on to the Fair Food Program, which bound it to buy only from farms that treat workers decently.

The coalition soon launched campaigns against other big companies, many of which quickly signed on to the Fair Food Program. McDonald's signed on in 2007, and Whole Foods, Burger King and Subway followed in 2008\. Chipotle and Trader Joe's signed on in 2012, while Wal-Mart joined in 2014 and Fresh Market in 2015.

However, there still are two major food companies that refuse to sign the agreement — Wendy's and Publix.

The coalition has primarily focused on Publix because it controls about half of the South Florida grocery market. 

## Fair Food Program Idea May Spread

In 2012 Benitez and fellow Immokalee workers staged a six-day fast in front of Publix headquarters. Their protest appears in an Academy Award-nominated documentary called "Food Chains," which actress and activist Eva Longoria helped produce.

The penny-a-pound premium is making a huge difference in workers' lives. It amounts to as much as $100 extra a week, lifting a farmworker's salary from about $10,000 to $17,000 a year. 

The Fair Food Program, which now covers 90 percent of Florida's tomato farms, has also brought huge improvements in work conditions.

The coalition believes the Fair Food Program provides a model that can be applied to other parts of the country and to other kinds of farmworkers.

"The dream for us is to create a new agricultural industry in this country," Benitez said, in which farmworkers "receive the same treatment as an office worker for an honest, hard job."
