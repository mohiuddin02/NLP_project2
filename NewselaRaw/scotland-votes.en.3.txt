EDINBURGH, Scotland â€” Voters in Scotland decided on Thursday to remain part of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is a group of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The vote against independence prevented a breakup of Scotland's 307-year union with England.

Scots voted 55 percent to 45 percent against independence, with a greater portion of people turning up at the polls than ever before. The vote brought relief to politicians in the United Kingdom's capital, London.

The First Minister of Scotland is Alex Salmond. Independence for Scotland has been a cherished goal of his for a long time. He put all his energy into the campaign for a new state. However, a larger number of voters felt it was a safer choice to stick with the United Kingdom.

Salmond accepted the results. "We know it is a majority for the No campaign," he said. He called on his fellow Scots to accept the results of the vote as well.

Even though he was defeated, he said the vote was a win for the democratic system.

## New Powers Promised To Scotland

Salmond had argued that Scots could go it alone because Scotland is rich in oil and has smart, educated people. He said Scotland would do very well on its own, free of interference from any London-based government.

Nonetheless, Salmond came close to winning independence. His campaign made London politicians so nervous, they promised to give new powers to Scotland.

Many saw it as a "heads versus hearts" decision. On the one side were cautious older Scots who worried that independence was something Scotland couldn't afford. On the other side were younger Scots who fell in love with the idea of building their own country.

The no vote saves British Prime Minister David Cameron from going down in history as a defeated leader.

The prime minister before him was Gordon Brown, a Scot. Brown crisscrossed Scotland in the final days before the vote. Brown told his fellow Scots that independence was not the patriotic choice. He argued that Scots could love Scotland but still proud of their place in the United Kingdom.

"There is not a cemetery in Europe that does not have Scots, English, Welsh and Irish lined side by side," Brown said in his final speech before the vote. "We not only won these wars together, we built the peace together."

## Cameron's Party Hated In Scotland

Cameron is part of the Conservative Party. The Conservatives are widely hated in Scotland. The prime minister begged voters not to use a vote for independence as a way to insult his party.

The vote against independence keeps the United Kingdom from losing a big part of its territory. It also prevents them from losing its oil supply. Without Scotland, the United Kingdom would need to find a new place to store its most powerful weapons. Losing Scotland could have hurt the United Kingdom's role within the European Union and the United Nations.

Some had predicted that if Scotland broke away, the United Kingdom would face hard times for a long while.

The United Kingdom had feared losing Scotland forever. In return for staying in the union, Scots have been promised new powers by the British government. It is still somewhat unclear what those powers will be.
