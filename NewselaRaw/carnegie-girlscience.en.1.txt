PITTSBURGH — Over the past decade, the Carnegie Science Center (CSC) has worked hard to be a leader in the area of science education for girls. The museum's programs for tween and teenage girls have included science sleepovers, workplace tours of successful scientists and a website, CanTEEN.

So CSC was quite surprised to come under attack for its sole offering for the Girl Scouts. The program, called "Science With a Sparkle," teaches girls how to become a "cosmetic chemist."

The controversy began when part of a page from the museum's Explore brochure appeared online. The page showed a long list of serious science programs for the Boy Scouts, such as chemistry, engineering and astronomy, and only a single offering for Girl Scouts, the workshop about makeup.

## The Firestorm Began

The next day, websites and blogs such as Jezebel and Wonkette started to take up the cause. "Marie Curie may very well rise from her grave to gnash her teeth," Jezebel wrote, noting the famous scientist who became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics.

"At a time when one of the biggest topics in science education is how to make science interesting to girls, and careers in Science, Technology, (Engineering), and Math (STEM) more attractive to young women, you're offering MAKEUP?" Wonkette wrote. "Look, we won't even ask you to join the 21st century all at once — but could you at least try to emerge from 1958?"

Scores of comments appeared on Carnegie Museum's Facebook page as well, calling the museum "shameful" and "ridiculous."

The Science Center responded last week with long posts explaining the thinking behind the program. It said it had tried other programs to appeal to Girl Scouts in the past, such as engineering, chemistry and robotics. However, it "struggled when it comes to enrollments" for everything except museum sleepovers and Science With a Sparkle.

The response also said that "any child — boy or girl, Scout or not — is welcome to join any of its programs."

## Working Together To Create Programs

The Girl Scouts also responded through social media. It noted that Science With a Sparkle is not an official Girl Scout program. The science museum advertises the program to Girl Scouts, like many other organizations, but the Girl Scouts did not create or authorize it.

The Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania does currently run STEM programs, including "It's Your Planet — Love It" and "Find the Fire." The scouting organization has partnership with local groups such as The Phipps Conservancy, a botanical garden in Pittsburgh, said Melissa Cooper, regional Girl Scouts vice president.

The Girl Scouts and the Carnegie museum are now working together to create programming for girls, she said.

"They're a fantastic location for us and I'd love to partner with them," Cooper said. "A tremendous opportunity exists, and this got a conversation started, to say the least."

## One Program Among Many

As for Science With a Sparkle, the program has been around for about five years, said Linda Ortenzo, director of STEM programs at the science museum. It was actually named years ago by a research panel that presented a group of girls with a few different options. "They picked that one," Ortenzo said.

She defended the program, noting that it teaches real chemistry using cosmetics as an entry point.

"Really, it's a larger discussion about what we offer for girls, and what we know works," she said. "With girls, presenting them with real-world problems is a natural way to get them interested in STEM."

Furthermore, she said, Science With a Sparkle was just one program among many. The bottom of the brochure page, which didn't appear online, featured the "Tour Your Future" program, taking girls to businesses such as Schell Games, an educational game company, and Valspar, which makes paints. Popular science museum programs such as camps and after-school activities are also open to girls, she said.

"There is not one particular avenue for engaging people in STEM — there are many," she said. "The most important thing is that girls get the message early that STEM is for them."

## Always A Silver Lining

Heather Arnet is the CEO of the Women &amp; Girls Foundation of Western Pennsylvania. She has worked with the science museum for years on issues involving gender equality and programming for girls. For her, the backlash against the Science Center was surprising, given its "long historical commitment to the issue of engaging girls in STEM."

But in all the negative words directed toward the Center, she also saw a silver lining.

"What I think was really great was the parent response all over social media," she said. "You saw mothers and fathers really engaged in this passionate conversation about the need for girls to have equity in STEM offerings and to be engaged in STEM, and that's a good thing for everyone."
