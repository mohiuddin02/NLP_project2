HACKENSACK, N.J. — When he was 3 years old, Mohammad Abdelhamid told his mother he was going to be a basketball player when he grew up. Like many professional players, Mohammed said he would buy a mansion.

His mother, Azza Abdelziz, took his dreams to heart — at least the basketball part —and raised him to be an athlete. Now a high school student, he plays soccer, basketball and baseball at Fort Lee High School. He also plays with a private soccer club that travels all over the region.

On a recent Sunday, Abdelziz was in the stands cheering her son as he took on another team in a basketball tournament. Also there were relatives, friends and college recruiters, scouting for future players for their teams. The crowd took in the action on the court.

## Parents Make It Happen

Abdelziz deserved as much applause as her son.

She and other parents in the crowd have made huge sacrifices to help their children fulfill their dreams. Abdelziz said over the past 10 years, she has spent less time with her relatives because of her son's game and practice schedule. She has also stuck with her job as a school bus driver. The work hours are better for taking her son to and from practices and games.

Jocelyn Picache is the mother of another Fort Lee player. She said basketball is not even the most demanding of youth sports. She estimated her family spent more than $100,000 taking her eldest daughter around the country for weekly gymnastics competitions. Her daughter, a talented gymnast, could have made the U.S. Olympic team. The girl had to give up the sport, though, after a serious back injury.

Her family could have nearly bought a house with the money they spent on gymnastics, Picache said.

But Picache and other parents are full of pride in their children, not bitter over their sacrifices.

## The Sacrifice Is Worth It

Howard Breindel's son plays basketball for Tenafly High School. He said making sacrifices for your children is what parenting is all about.

"You have kids so you can support them through these years," he said.

Plus, he said, young athletes learn important life lessons through sports. They learn about teamwork, respect, sportsmanship and focus. Parents watching the tournament said sports will help their children succeed in the classroom and in life.

Then there is the glory of playing basketball in college. Kevin Goodson, another father, said that was a dream for everyone on his son's team.

## Playing In College Isn't Easy

Few make it that far, though. According to 2013 estimates from the NCAA, just 3.3 percent of high school boy basketball players go on to play on a college team. For soccer, that percentage is 5.7 percent of high school players, 6.5 percent for football and 6.8 percent for baseball. Just 3.7 percent of girl high school basketball players go on to play the sport in college.

Only 0.03 percent of high school boys basketball players make it as a pro, or just 3 out of every 10,000 players.

Breindel thinks that by the time kids get to high school and see all the talented athletes out there, they realize that their chances of playing college ball are low. That is fine, Breindel said, because there is so much else to do in life. His son, for example, has been accepted into college to study how write screenplays for movies.

## "These Kids Are Like My Kids"

While high school sports last, Abdelziz and Picache are going to make the most of it. The two women live on different floors of the same apartment building. They see each other most often, though, at their sons' sporting events.

"All these kids are like my kids," Abdelziz said as she cheered alongside Picache. She said she especially enjoyed road trips to out-of-town games. All the players and family members go out to dinner together and stay at the same hotel.

For Picache, attending the games helps her relax after a long day of work.

"Once I go to the game, it takes the pressure off," she said. "I forget about everything."
