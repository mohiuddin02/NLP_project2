LONDON, England — British actor Alan Rickman has died at the age of 69\. Known to millions as professor Severus Snape in the "Harry Potter" films, Rickman also played many other unforgettable parts. He appeared both in films and on stage.

Rickman died early Thursday in London after a battle with cancer.

## Good Voice For A Bad Guy

Daniel Radcliffe, who played the part of teenage wizard Harry Potter, expressed his sorrow at the news. Radcliffe said Rickman was "undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with." The two actors appeared together in eight "Harry Potter" films. 

Rickman was born in London in 1946, and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Throughout his career Rickman was often cast as the bad guy. He used his rich, unhurried speaking voice to make evil seem strangely fascinating.

Some of Rickman's best-known film parts include the evil Hans Gruber, who torments Bruce Willis in 1988's "Die Hard;" a dead lover who comforts his heartbroken partner in 1990's "Truly Madly Deeply" and a straying husband in the 2003 romantic comedy "Love Actually."

## Best Known As Severus Snape

Rickman was probably best known for playing Snape in the "Potter" films. Snape is a teacher of the dark arts and a master of potions. He is either an enemy or an ally — or possibly both — of young Harry Potter.

Radcliffe said that during the making of the films, Rickman was one of the first to treat him like a grownup. Working with the older, experienced actor at such a young age was "incredibly important," Radcliffe said. "I will carry the lessons he taught me for the rest of my life and career."

Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling tweeted that "there are no words to express how shocked and devastated I am to hear of Alan Rickman's death. He was a magnificent actor (and) a wonderful man."

## "A Gloriously Nasty Character"

Emma Thompson, who starred alongside Rickman in films including "Sense and Sensibility" and "Love Actually," also paid tribute. She praised Rickman's "humor, intelligence, wisdom and kindness" and called him "the finest of actors."

"I couldn't wait to see what he was going to do with his face next," she said.

Another person who recalled Rickman's greatness as actor was Mohammed Saghir, the present-day Sheriff of Nottingham. Rickman played Robin Hood's famous foe, the wicked, original Sheriff of Nottingham, in "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" in 1991.

"His sheriff was a gloriously nasty character who it was easy to love to hate," Saghir said. Rickman "appeared to have great fun playing" the part.

## A Galaxy Of Acting Roles

Indeed, Rickman's villainous parts were unforgettable. Among them was an Emmy Award–winning turn as "mad monk" Rasputin in a 1996 biographical film.

However, Rickman did not only play evil characters. Indeed, his screen parts were remarkably varied. They included the virtuous Colonel Brandon in 1995's "Sense and Sensibility" and the Irish leader Eamon de Valera in 1996's "Michael Collins."

Rickman also had a sideline in comic science-fiction. He appeared in 1999's "Galaxy Quest" and supplied the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" in 2005.

Rickman worked not only in movies, but in the theater as well. He was highly praised for his performances in the plays "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" and "Private Lives."

## "The Animal In Me"

Rickman was also a filmmaker. He directed and co-starred opposite Kate Winslet in the 2014 film "A Little Chaos." Seventeen years earlier, he had directed Emma Thompson and her mother Phyllida Law in "The Winter Guest."

Rickman was frequently charming in person. However, the need to get a part right sometimes won out over normal politeness. During the filming of "Harry Potter," he kept in character as the nasty Snape even off-camera.

"The animal in me takes over," Rickman said in 2011.

"You're as polite as possible, but it's not always possible."

Rickman is survived by his wife, Rima Horton. Funeral details were not immediately available.
