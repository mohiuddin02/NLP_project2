BOSTON — Inside South Station, Boston's main transport hub, grumpy commuters wait to see whether their trains will be canceled or delayed. A snowy winter has paralyzed the city's transportation systems, and patience is wearing thin.

Just weeks ago, Boston beat out other cities to make the U.S. bid for the 2024 Olympic Games. Also in the running were Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington.

## "We're Already Crazy"

But now Bostonians are wondering: if their city can't handle a snowy winter, can it handle hosting the 2024 Olympic Games in just nine years?

Nor'easters — strong storms that can bring blizzards and flooding — have hit the city hard this winter and frustrated Bostonians. The disruptions to transportation are another argument against holding the Olympics in Boston, joining concerns over the costs and the difficulty of planning a large event in one of the nation's smallest major cities.

"We're already crazy," said Debbie Jones, an executive assistant whose 45-minute commute to work had been taking 2 1/2 hours. "I can't imagine the Olympics, with 10 times more people."

Eventually, winter will end. The snow will melt, but Olympic supporters wonder if residents' cold feelings toward the city's planning skills will thaw with it.

## "We Don't Need The Olympics"

Boston's icy reception to the Games may show something deeper about the city that likes to call itself the Hub of the Universe.

Local residents say Boston is already a leader — in medicine, higher education, biotechnology — and in sports. The city is full of sports fanatics and successful sports teams like the world-champion New England Patriots football team and the Red Sox baseball team.

Boston does not need to be highlighted on the world stage, the way Atlanta or Sochi, Russia, might, residents say.

"We don't need the Olympics to do that," said Pat Shaughnessy, who was also awaiting a train. "People already know where Boston is."

Some doubt of the Olympic bid comes out of fear of another large, multibillion-dollar project after one has just recently finished. The Big Dig was a major transportation project that tore up central Boston for more than a decade to build highways, bridges and tunnels, and ran billions of dollars over the amount it was budgeted to cost.

## Big Budget, Shrinking Support

The Olympics' $4.7 budget would be covered by private money, organizers promised, and Boston taxpayers would not be stuck with the bill. The federal government would pay for the $1 billion to $2 billion cost of security. Organizers say the state had already planned to spend $5.2 billion on transportation projects.

In a February survey, 44 percent of Boston voters supported bringing the Olympics to the city, and 46 percent opposed it. Other cities that have hosted the Games have had much stronger local support: as much as 70 or 80 percent. Still, Boston is two years away from the final bidding process.

## Olympic-Sized Challenge Ahead

The bid to bring the Olympics to Boston is being led by a group of business leaders. They know they have a challenge ahead of them.

In the past, voters in Denver, as well as in Munich, Germany, and Krakow, Poland, have rejected hosting the Olympics in their cities.

A U.S. city has not hosted the Summer Olympics since Atlanta in 1996. If Boston backers can overcome people's doubts, the city could have a chance when the International Olympic Committee chooses the 2024 host in 2017.

"There's a real appetite, a real hunger from the IOC members I've talked to for the United States to get its act together and have the Games again," said Ed Hula, editor of Around the Rings, a website that writes about the Olympics. Hula said Boston's main competition to host the games would come from Europe.

## Something Smells Fishy

Richard Davey is chief executive of Boston 2024, the private group behind Boston's bid to host the Olympics. He says the city can save money by using college and university sites to host events. The Games could be "the most walkable in history," Davey said.

However, the definition of walkable is loose. Early rounds of baseball, soccer and basketball could be held as far away as Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York.

The plan also includes building a $400 million temporary main stadium in an area that is currently one of the least walkable in Boston: an area filled with meat and fish processing plants and warehouses.

It is hard to imagine 80,000 fans flocking to a spot that is now covered in mounds of gray snow and stinking of seafood.

## 400th Birthday Present?

Still, Olympic organizers see an opportunity to develop an underused piece of the city and tie together the neighborhoods around it.

Mayor Martin Walsh said the Olympics would allow the city to start making improvements that would be done in time for Boston's 400th anniversary in 2030.

It would leave an incredible legacy, Walsh said.

Some opposition to the games was caused by accounts of other countries that spent far more than they had planned, Walsh said.

Indeed, some experts say that Olympic supporters in Boston are underestimating how much it will cost to host the Games.

"My concern is whether it will make enough money to repay what we put into it," said Suzanne Scanlon, a 53-year-old office worker headed home on a recent evening.
