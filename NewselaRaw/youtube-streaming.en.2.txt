Some of the biggest stars on YouTube are hardly recognizable to most adults. If you are older than 30, chances are you have never heard of PewDiePie, Lily Singh and the Fine Bros.

These homegrown YouTube celebrities are perhaps more famous than some Hollywood stars. Even though they appear mostly in online videos, many of these stars have handsome advertising and sponsorship deals. 

Despite their successes, it is now looking like there is a limit to stardom on YouTube.

## Red's Subscribers Go Ad-Free

Five weeks ago, YouTube launched a new subscription service called YouTube Red that costs $9.99 a month. Right now, subscribers get ad-free YouTube videos, music and content created by the site's Internet stars that cannot be found anywhere else. Some experts think Red is not signing up people fast enough, because YouTube is already looking to add more videos from other places.

YouTube has begun talks with television networks and Hollywood movie studios about buying new content to stream on Red. The added content would include TV shows, movies and other material. YouTube is trying to make Red more popular and add more subscribers. 

YouTube Red is the company's attempt to compete with services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Those services also stream video to subscribers.

## Possibly Rethinking Red

The fact that YouTube is thinking about adding new content suggests it is changing its game plan. Some experts think YouTube is struggling to get people interested in Red. 

"When YouTube first announced Red, it was going to be a place to get exclusives and the best of YouTube stars," said Jim Nail, a business expert with Forrester Research. "But clearly that's insufficient to justify the $9.99 price."

YouTube declined to comment on the issue. However, several major TV studios said they have been talking to YouTube about streaming special content. 

If YouTube adds hit television shows and movies, it would mean that Red is turning into a different product than was originally planned. 

YouTube Chief Business Officer Robert Kyncl said earlier this year the company had no intention of doing that. He said that he had no plans to spend heavily to buy expensive content like NFL games or TV shows like "Seinfeld."

"To us, what is important is we are not doing what everyone else is doing, competing for the same sources of material, the same creative elements," Kyncl said. Instead, he said, they are looking for people who already have YouTube-proven popularity.

## What's Wrong With Free Content?

But not doing what everyone else is doing could be a risky choice for YouTube. The company faces competition, especially from rivals like Netflix, Amazon and HBO. Those companies have had recent successes making and streaming their own content. Shows like "Orange Is the New Black," "House of Cards" and "Game of Thrones," which stream on those services, have been very popular. Those shows are aimed at older audiences, while YouTube content is more geared toward the average viewer. 

PewDiePie, a Swedish YouTube star, is a big hit with younger audiences. He produces video-gaming blogs, called vlogs. Young viewers, like his fans, usually watch entertainment online, mostly on cellphones and tablets.

The differences in how younger and older audiences watch content could be damaging to YouTube Red, said Alan Wolk. He is an expert at a media research company. 

"Most of Red's audience needs to get their parents to pay for the subscription," Wolk said. Many of these parents, he said, will ask their kids why they can't just watch the ads and get the content for free.

## Homegrown Stars Might Not Be Enough

Netflix and other streaming services are different from YouTube in a few ways. A key difference is that YouTube's competitors have a large catalog of movies and TV shows. This stockpile keeps subscribers paying month after month. 

Yet YouTube has its own advantages. It has a wide global audience. YouTube is also owned by Google and has advanced streaming technology. It is easy for people to use YouTube from most places around the world.

YouTube users can also currently get popular content. Recently released movies can be rented for $4.99 or bought for less than $20. The site streamed Sony Pictures' comedy "The Interview" last year after theaters refused to show the film. Many were scared off because of security threats from North Korea. The movie made fun of North Korea's leader.

YouTube Red was built on the idea of making original content with YouTube's homegrown stars. The goal was to allow them to get creative and develop their own material. 

The company has sketched out some ideas for original content. Yet even those ideas involve partnerships with hit shows. Among the shows planned was a teaming of PewDiePie and the creators of "The Walking Dead." YouTube also planned a Fine Bros. project called "Sing It!", which pokes fun at TV programs such as "American Idol" and "The Voice."
