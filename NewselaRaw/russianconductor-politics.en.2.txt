NEW YORK — On a recent freezing night in New York City, Ukrainian activists shivered on the sidewalk outside the Metropolitan Opera. They waved banners reading "GERGIEV supports WAR in UKRAINE" and "DON'T PLAY PUTIN'S TUNE."

Gergiev is Valery Gergiev, the well-known Russian conductor. That night, he had conducted Tchaikovsky's "Iolanta" and Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle."

Gergiev might be the most famous and respected Russian artist of our time. But he is also the most controversial because he supports Russian President Vladimir Putin's policies in Ukraine and Crimea.

Putin has allegedly moved Russian soldiers into parts of eastern Ukraine. There, pro-Russia separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces. Ukraine and other countries have protested Putin's support of the separatists.

## Opera, Ballet — And Protests

Gergiev and Putin have had a long friendship, and that has led to some artists refusing to perform with the conductor, and German festival banning him. Still, Gergiev insists he is a busy musician with no time for politics.

Gergiev travels all over the world. In Russia, he leads the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg along with the White Nights and Russian Easter festivals and the International Tchaikovsky Competition. Elsewhere, Gergiev is finishing his time as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra. Next, he will move to the Munich Philharmonic. He has even more festivals on the calendar — in Finland, Sweden, Holland, Israel and China. He guest-conducts other orchestras frequently.

Last week, Gerviev finished a month in the United States. His visit included opera, ballet and orchestral performances with the Mariinsky in New York, Florida and Michigan, as well as guest-conducting at the Metropolitan Opera.

Protesters met him wherever he went, and one managed to reach the stage of the Met with a banner as Russian singer Anna Netrebko took her final bow. Netrebko, who starred in "Iolanta," has also been a vocal Putin supporter.

Gergiev says he is fine with protesters expressing their opinions outside, but that it's not appropriate inside the theater.

"People come to hear music," he says, "not to hear shouting. And to go on stage and scare Netrebko, how can the Met let this happen?"

## A Grand Vision

In 1990 Valery Gergiev had just turned 37. At the time he had just become the artistic director at a theater called the Kirov (now the Mariinsky). The fact that he was given such a big job was surprising and daring. Before he was promoted, he was an unknown assistant conductor of the orchestra.

Still, he had a grand vision. Before he started working at the Kirov, Russia was still part of the Soviet Union, a collection of countries that included Ukraine. When the Soviet Union fell apart and Russia became its own country, Gergiev wanted to take another look at Russian culture.

Russia, he said, needed to know itself to become a meaningful new nation. As part of that, he intended to return the Kirvov to its former glory.

He began to revisit operas that had been forgotten during the Soviet era. He focused on the works of Russian composers such as Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky.

Gergiev accomplished his first goals and much more: he built a concert hall for the Mariinsky Orchestra and a second opera house. He became an international ambassador for Russian culture. He had help — financial support from the Russian government.

"All the major cultural institutions in Russia need state support," Gergiev explained.

## A Friend In City Government

In St. Petersburg, he found a friend in city government — an assistant mayor who actively supported culture: the future president Putin.

Putin is not shy about using his office to support fine arts like the orchestra and the ballet. When other world leaders visit, he almost always takes them to the ballet or to a museum.

Along with showing off Russian culture, Gergiev has also become an advocate for the environment. In the early 1990s, Gergiev started a small festival in Mikkeli, Finland. In the Finnish forests he discovered lakes where the water is clean enough to drink.

"It was unthinkable in Russia that any lake be full of drinkable water," he marvels, "or trees be healthy or the air clean."

Gergiev worked with his conductor friend Esa-Pekka Salonen to start the Baltic Sea Festival in Stockholm to promote environmental issues. Gergiev was one of the first famous people in Russia to push for laws that would help the environment.

## Anger Toward Gergiev

Gergiev also argues that it is an artist's responsibility to provide humanitarian support whenever possible. He has appeared at hot spots around the world to perform charity concerts.

Still, anger toward Gergiev has been building as Putin has become more and more unpopular in Europe and the United States. Many saw it as the last straw when Gergiev said he agreed with Russia taking Crimea away from Ukraine.

"It's a long story," he says, explaining that people outside of the region have trouble understanding how deep-rooted the issues are. For this, Gergiev says you have to go back to the history of Ukraine and its relationship to Russian culture.

"The Crimea issue is not something from five years ago or three years ago. You have to go back 200 years, 100 years," he says.
