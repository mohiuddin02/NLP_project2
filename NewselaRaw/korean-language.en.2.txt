When Olivia Hernandez was in middle school, she became hooked on K-wave â€” South Korean pop music, television and culture. She taught herself the Korean alphabet and learned a few phrases.

This year, as a student at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Hernandez jumped at the chance to take a beginning Korean language class. She and other students are learning grammar basics and the proper way to address elders and bosses. As a sweetener, the class usually watches a Korean rock music video. Once, she might have appreciated it only for the melodies and dancing.

"Now I understand what they are saying. Now it makes sense," said Hernandez. She is a psychology major who wants to use her Korean language skills when she becomes a therapist.

## Gaining Popularity On Campus

According to a recent national study, the number of people signing up for Korean language courses at U.S. colleges and universities is growing faster than sign-ups for any other foreign language. The Modern Language Association reported that Korean language enrollment rose 45 percent from 2009 to 2013. Overall, language studies declined 6.7 percent during that same period. Interest has dropped for many popular foreign languages, including Spanish, French and German.

The number of students in Korean classes nationwide is 12,230. Far more students take Japanese, Chinese and Arabic. Currently, just 154 colleges offer Korean, but that is 70 percent more than a decade ago.

"There's no doubt that Korean popular culture in film and music has captivated the minds of young people," said Rosemary Feal. She helps lead a group called the Modern Language Association.

She said colleges lack the money to offer as many foreign languages as they used to. Also, students are feeling pressure to focus on career-oriented classes. Students are taking science and business classes, for instance, at the expense of humanities, like history and languages. Knowing a second language can be helpful. People who know foreign languages, for example, earn more money.

## Complicated Honorifics

According to university officials and professors, some of the interest in Korean is coming from the children and grandchildren of Korean immigrants. However, non-Koreans fascinated with K-wave are leading the trend.

Some are drawn by the K-wave dance moves of Psy in his 2012 international video hit "Gangnam Style" or by the TV series "Queen of Housewives." Others want to speak Korean so they possibly work at Korean companies after graduation.

At UCLA, enrollment is up significantly in both in the beginner courses and in the so-called heritage classes. The heritage courses are intended for Korean-Americans who grew up learning a little Korean but often do not know much grammar. Professors report waiting lists for the classes.

Los Angeles "is a great place to study Korean," UCLA humanities dean David Schaberg said. He is a Chinese language and literature expert. Students can visit Korean institutions, restaurants and stores in Koreatown and other parts of town.

In a recent heritage class, lecturer Jane Choi ran her students through some of the complicated honorifics. These are ways to address people politely, like Mr. or Mrs. in English. She used illustrations from the "Calvin and Hobbes" comic strip to show how Korean teachers and children would speak to each other.

## Grammar With Akdong Musician

Andrew Hahn is a senior at UCLA. He said his first language at home was Korean but that he did not get much beyond a childhood level.

"As a Korean-American, it is only right to learn my native tongue and become comfortable with it. And it is a way to connect back with the culture," said Hahn, who is in the heritage class.

Learning Korean, he said, will help him in what he hopes will be a career in law.

Recently, in a beginner class, a K-wave music video of Akdong Musician eased students into a grammar lesson.

Instructor Jae Eun Im wrote sentences on the board and the class repeated them aloud.

They included Korean translations of "The food is cheap but it doesn't taste good," and "It is winter but it is not cold."

Non-Korean students say that learning the alphabet is easy. Mastering honorifics and pronouncing some consonants can be difficult.

## "It Was So Enticing"

Freshman Michelle King grew up in Salinas, California, not knowing anyone whose family was Korean. She became a fan of K-wave boy band Super Junior and the group Big Bang.

"It was so enticing, so different from American pop culture," she said.

Now majoring in East Asian languages, she said she hopes to become fluent in Korean.

She and other members of a campus club of K-wave fans recently visited Koreatown. They shopped at a music store, ate at a Korean restaurant and sang in Korean at a karaoke club.

Although it's still hard for her to read Korean song lyrics fast enough, she is learning another important lesson. Learning another language, she said, "breaks down barriers between people and teaches them to look beyond surface level."
