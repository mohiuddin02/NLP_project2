For most of the past 15 years, people in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, took their questions about growing plants and raising animals to Seth Wilner.

Wilner was an educator with the University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension, his state's version of a century-old, national effort to spread the latest livestock and agricultural knowledge to farmers.

"Used to be, someone in my county called up and said, 'I have a llama and two goats, can you come out and look at my pasture?'" Wilner said.

New Hampshire legislators cut the extension's budget 23 percent in 2011, and the university revamped it.

Today, Wilner works out of an office in Sullivan County but travels all around the state advising farmers. He and the other field specialists drive to farms to build relationships. They also rely on technology like Google Chat and Skype and offer online tutorials and webinars.

## Fewer Farmers, Rural Residents Today

The Cooperative Extension Service was created in 1914 to share university research on agriculture, home economics and rural energy. Back then, more than half the U.S. population lived in rural areas, and 30 percent of the workforce farmed.

Today fewer than 2 percent of Americans farm for a living, and only 17 percent live in rural areas. The extension service remains active in nearly all of the nation's 3,000 counties, but the shift has forced major changes in how it does business.

State cooperative extensions are adapting in a time of smaller budgets, fewer farmers, a changing population and modern technology.

The extension service now relies on nearly 3 million trained volunteers and its website to share information. The full-time workforce dropped from 17,009 in 1980 to 13,294 full-time workers in 2010.

Extension still shares scientific research aimed at making farms and ranches more profitable. Now, it also works on other issues, like the environment, food safety, natural disasters, energy independence, personal health and workforce development.

Daryl Buchholz, associate director of extension at Kansas State University, said extension programs will stay useful "by focusing on the problems people have in our states."

## Agriculture Is Still The Backbone

For many states, agriculture remains the backbone of extension. Oregon extension brings together vineyard managers, winemakers and students in person and online. Wine grapes are now the 17th-most important crop among 220 in the state, according to A. Scott Reed, extension director at Oregon State University.

Virginia Cooperative Extension has trained more than 300 farmers in Virginia, the Carolinas and Kentucky on food safety regulations.

In many states, extension is expanding its mission. In southwestern Kansas, extension has started 4-H clubs that use Spanish and English for the large immigrant population there.

The goal was to create one Spanish- and English-speaking club of up to 30 youths and their parents. Soon there were four clubs with 90 youths and hundreds more on the waiting list.

"These people come here because they want to work and get ahead in life," said Steve Irsik, owner of Royal Farms Dairy in Garden City, whose 60 workers are from Central and South America. "If we don't help them, we're holding them back."

## Finding The Funds

Last year, the Delaware and Maryland extensions developed a training program to help consumers choose health insurance. That program has spread to 30 states, said Michelle Rodgers, director of University of Delaware Extension.

Extension services have worked for years on helping individuals get healthier. Future efforts will engage the community on improving the environment for health, such as school lunch and restaurant menus, Rodgers said.

Extension is turning increasingly to foundations and corporations to help pay the bills. The Spanish-language 4-H project was practically cost-free to the counties and Kansas State University. That's because Irsik, the dairy owner, wrote a check for $30,000.

"Extension back in the day was funded about one-third federal, one-third state and one-third county," said Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. "That model has frayed quite a bit."

Federal money for extension flows to states by formula, based on rural population and other factors. Then state governments match the federal money. Each university makes up a budget through a mix of state and local funds and grants, gifts and fees.

Federal funds account for only about 10 percent of current extension budgets. The other 90 percent is split equally between states and from counties and cities, said Jimmy Henning, chairman of extension's national governing board.

Many states also pursue federal grants and form partnerships with nonprofits and corporations. Texas recently hired its first employee with partial funding from a health care company after cuts from state funding.

## Spreading The Word On Extension's Makeover

Yet, states and counties still have had difficulty raising money.

"Extension, as it looks to the next 100 years, has to find ways to make up the reductions in state and county funding," said Douglas Steele, director of Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service.

As grants become more common, however, some worry about the strings attached to outside funding.

"There's a greater fear that the search for money may lead to funders who don't share the mission of extension," Henning said.

In New Hampshire, residents were initially doubtful about extension's reorganization, but eventually people changed their minds.

"I have not heard any widespread or in-depth complaints," said Lisa Townson, assistant director of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension. "People say programs are more focused and better quality." However, she admitted, "It's a challenge letting people know what we are doing."
