SAN FRANCISCO â€” Chris Borland is a star player for the San Francisco 49ers football team. On Monday night, his team made a surprise announcement: Borland will be quitting football for good.

Borland is worried about his health. He fears that blows to his head may damage his brain.

The chance to be a star was not enough to change Borland's mind. The chance to earn piles of money didn't either.

Borland is retiring at the young age of 24.

## Not Taking Any Chances

Borland said he wants to do "what's best for my health."

Football players are often hit on the head during games. Bad hits to the head are called concussions. Over time, all of those hits can cause damage to their brains. Players can start to forget things. Their thinking can become confused.

Borland said he did not want to take any chances. Right now, his thinking seems pretty much the same as always, he said. However, he does not want to wait until it is "too late."

Trent Baalke manages the 49ers. He said the team was surprised that Borland wants to leave football. Still, the team supports him if that is what he wants to do, Baalke said.

## "More Work To Do"

The National Football League (NFL) also said that it supports Borland. However, it added that "football has never been safer." New rules and new helmets have made things much safer for players, the league said.

Jeff Miller is an NFL vice president. Things have gotten much better for players, he said. There were fewer concussions last year than usual, he added.

"There is more work to do," Miller admitted. The league will keep on trying to make football a safer sport, he said.

Baalke said Borland had talked to him about leaving football. He could tell that Borland "put a great deal of thought into this," he said.

Borland was "a very well-respected member of our team," Baalke said.

"We will always consider him a 49er and wish him all the best," he added.
