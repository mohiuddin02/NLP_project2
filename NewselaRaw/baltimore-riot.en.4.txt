BALTIMORE, Md. â€” On April 12, a black man named Freddie Gray was badly hurt after he was arrested by police. A week later, Gray died. He was 25 years old.

On Monday, angry people began protesting in Baltimore after Gray's funeral. A total of 144 vehicles and 15 buildings were set on fire, according to the mayor's office. About 200 people were arrested.

Baltimore police said 15 officers were hurt. Some of them were treated in the hospital early Tuesday. The police were hit by bricks, stones and glass bottles.

No officers were charged with a crime in Gray's death. He died after his backbone was badly hurt. Police have said very little about what happened that day. Black Baltimore citizens are concerned that the police are hiding something. Many African-Americans in Baltimore already do not trust the police.

## Teenagers Steal From Shopping Mall

Thousands of people attended Gray's funeral on Monday. Afterward, people began throwing rocks. By 7:30 p.m. more than 100 people broke into a local shopping mall. Many of them were teenagers wearing hoodies. They stole PlayStations, piles of shoes and clothing.

Police helicopters hovered overhead.

By late Monday, angry protesters spread from one end of the city to the other.

## City Puts Out Fires, Cleans Up Mess

On Tuesday morning, city workers and citizens began slowly cleaning up the mess. They hauled away burned cars and swept up broken glass. They also put out a huge fire that burned through the night.

Much of the city was shut down. Schools and many offices were closed, and streets were blocked off.

## Police Come From Other Cities To Help

Officers from other police stations were sent to help in Baltimore. As many as 5,000 police officers also arrived from other cities. Some of them came from as far away as Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.

Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, said the violence will not happen again.

Stephanie Rawlings-Blake is the mayor of Baltimore. She said buses and trains would soon be working. She also said she would make sure the Baltimore government would keep working.

Rawlings-Blake spoke Tuesday at a West Baltimore drugstore. It had been set on fire. "What happened last night means that more people are struggling," she said.

As of Tuesday morning, no decision had been made about a baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox. The game was canceled on Monday night because of the violence.

The extra police officers were supposed to arrive late Monday and Tuesday. Anthony Batts is in charge of the police in Baltimore. Batts said the added police officers would help Baltimore police get control over the city.

## Leaders Are Upset About Violence

Batts said he was upset that Baltimore's teenagers were stealing and burning.

Batts praised one woman. She was filmed hitting her teenage son on the head for throwing things at police. "I wish we had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight," he said.

Loretta Lynch is the head of the United States Department of Justice. She is also the first African-American woman to serve as the country's top law enforcement officer. She spoke out against the violence in Baltimore.

She promised to work with community leaders to protect the safety and rights of all citizens. Justice Department officials are looking into Gray's death.

Lynch said that the violent protests hurt Gray's family. They also are not fair to peaceful protesters who want to help their community, she said.
