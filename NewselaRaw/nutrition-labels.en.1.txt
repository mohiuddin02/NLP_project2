The update emphasizes calorie information, including the amount of added sugars. It also revises serving sizes to reflect how people really consume food.

The revision is aimed, in part, at addressing serious public health issues. These include [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) — the condition of being extremely overweight — and other long-term diseases, such as diabetes. Administration officials believe the new labels could lead consumers to make more healthful food choices. They also claim they would encourage the food industry to reformulate some products, particularly those with high amounts of added sugar.

First lady Michelle Obama was scheduled to announce the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposal at the White House, together with top administration officials. She has made better nutrition a focus of her "Let's Move!" campaign to battle childhood obesity.

"Our guiding principle here is very simple: that you as a parent and a consumer should be able to walk into your local grocery store, pick up an item off the shelf, and be able to tell whether it's good for your family," she said in a statement.

## Calorie Counts In Larger Typeface

Thursday's announcement began a 90-day period for public comments on the proposal. The administration plans to release a final set of rules within the next year, although there is no deadline.

Given the costs tied to revising nutrition labels, found on about 700,000 products, the FDA is proposing an implementation period of two years.

The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents more than 300 companies, promised to work with the FDA, saying "the time is right for an update," and calling the proposal "a thoughtful review." But the organization also said: "It is critical that any changes are based on the most current and reliable science. Equally as important is ensuring that any changes ultimately serve to inform, and not confuse, consumers."

On the proposed new labels, the calorie count would appear in larger, bold typeface. The updated labels would also include a separate entry in the sugar section to distinguish between added sugar and natural sugar.

Administration officials said that would help consumers comply with dietary guidelines recommending Americans decrease added-sugar intake. But Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University, predicted that the move could prompt pushback from large food companies. Such companies have a powerful Washington lobbying operation with influence on lawmakers.

"The food industry is really eager for people to not know how much sugar there is," she said.

## Focus On Added Sugars

Still, some public health advocates said that the added-sugar category doesn't go far enough. The FDA should also display the amount of sugar as a percentage of recommended daily intake, argued Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. "So many people consume far too much," he said.

Jacobson noted that the American Heart Association recommends women consume no more than 25 grams of added sugar per day and men no more than 35 grams per day. One can of soda alone contains about 40 grams.

To ensure compliance with the proposed requirement, companies would have to keep records of added sugar for FDA inspection.

The FDA proposal would also revise serving sizes to reflect the most recent data on consumer habits. The serving size for soda, for example, is currently 8 ounces. This number is meant to equal the quantity of soda people usually drink at one time, on average. However, consumers often drink soda in 12-ounce cans or even larger bottles.

The current rules allow manufacturers to use a larger serving size, as some soda makers do. But the proposed rule would require the serving size to be at least 12 ounces.

With the update, the serving sizes set in 1994 would increase for some products, such as ice cream, but would decrease for other products, such as yogurt.

"The serving sizes for many foods are a joke now," said Jacobson, who praised the proposed revisions. "The half-cup of ice cream" or "2-ounce muffins and bagels," he said, haven't been seen in American eating habits "in decades."

## Revamp Aims To Curb Obesity

Certain items that are typically finished all at once, such as a 20-ounce soda bottle, would be listed differently than they are now: The updated label would require manufacturers to display nutrition information for the entire package, not just the serving size.

If a food package is two times the serving size and could be consumed all at once, such as a 24-ounce soda bottle, the FDA would require a dual-column label. This would provide a nutritional breakdown by both serving size and container size.

Administration officials said an economic analysis indicated the new labels could bring between $20 billion and $30 billion in benefits. Officials didn't break those numbers down, but presumably much of the benefit would come from reduced health care expenses. The cost of the new labels was estimated to be about $2 billion over 20 years.

The food industry, which would be responsible for updating the labels on its products, would bear much of the cost.

Administration officials said widespread obesity was one of the primary reasons for the update. While acknowledging that the new labels alone would not solve the epidemic, they said they believe they could help curb it.
