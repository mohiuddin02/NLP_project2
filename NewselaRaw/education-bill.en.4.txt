WASHINGTON, D.C. — The No Child Left Behind law was passed in 2002. It says how U.S. schools should be run.

The law lets the U.S. government tell states how to run their schools. Students have to take statewide tests. Teachers are judged by the scores their students get. Schools are punished if too many students do badly.

## New Law Means Big Changes

On Thursday big changes were made to the No Child Left Behind law. President Barack Obama signed a new bill. The bill is now law. It changes how teachers are judged. It changes how schools are punished. It might also change what students learn. 

States have much more power now. They can decide what happens in their schools. U.S. schools will no longer all have to follow the same rules.

## Changes For All

Teachers, students and schools will all see changes.

Teachers will no longer be judged by how well their students do on statewide tests. Teachers hated that idea. They said it was unfair to teachers. Some students are just less prepared. 

For example, students might have gone to bad schools before. Perhaps their parents are not able to help them.

Before Thursday, schools had to be punished if too many students got low test scores. Many schools began to spend too much time on preparing students for the tests. Teachers say that hurts learning. It makes school much less fun. 

## Students Still Have To Take Exams

Students still have to take the statewide exams. They will take them in math and English. They will not have to spend as much time on tests, though.

Many states use Common Core. It says what each student must learn. For years, the U.S. government has pushed states to use Common Core. 

Many people are very unhappy with Common Core. They believe students have different interests and needs. They think teachers should decide what students learn.

The new bill says the U.S. government cannot push schools to use Common Core. It is now up to schools to decide. They can use Common Core, but they do not have to.

## States Can Fix Schools Their Own Way

States can now run schools on their own. 

They still must fix bad schools. Every student deserves a good school. States can now fix schools in their own way, though.
