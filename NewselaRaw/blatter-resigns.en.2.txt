![](https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150602-AMX-SOCCER63.png) Sepp Blatter, the president of soccer's world governing body, announced his resignation Tuesday. The decision came just days after several other soccer officials were arrested for corruption.

It remains unclear why Blatter resigned. However, a federal law enforcement official and another person familiar with the case said that Blatter remains a focus of the investigation into Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Blatter will remain FIFA president until a new election, and no date has been set. Investigators hope to get evidence from those already arrested to identify others involved in the wrongdoing. No new charges were announced Tuesday.

In a news conference in FIFA's Zurich headquarters, Blatter said he had done nothing wrong. He acknowledged that he had lost the support of "the entire world of football." Until he steps down, Blatter said, he will focus on making "far-reaching, fundamental reforms" in FIFA. He spoke about limiting the number of years officials can serve in leadership positions. He also called for making changes to FIFA's powerful executive committee, which decides on the dates and locations of soccer tournaments.

## FIFA Needs Fixing, Group's President Says

"I cherish FIFA more than anything and I want to do only what is best for FIFA and for football," said Blatter, 79. He has served as FIFA's president since 1998. "FIFA needs a profound overhaul."

On May 27, Swiss authorities arrested several FIFA officials, including two vice presidents. Hours later, American law enforcement agencies announced a 47-count indictment. It charged 14 officials at FIFA and global sports marketing companies in a number of criminal schemes, including bribery, fraud and money-laundering. The list of charges said that FIFA officials took bribes from countries competing to host the World Cup. They also illegally took money from companies that wanted to broadcast soccer tournaments.

At first after the arrests, Blatter said he welcomed the U.S. investigation. Over the weekend, he said something very different, Blatter said "there is something that smells" and suspicious about the fact the FIFA officials were arrested two days before he was re-elected president. He also criticized comments by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who said that the entire organization of FIFA was corrupt.

## Officials Look For Evidence Of Bribes

Blatter has not been charged with a crime. However, federal authorities believe that FIFA secretary general Jérôme Valcke was involved with transferring $10 million in 2008. That money was part of a bribe paid by South African officials to persuade FIFA to let the country host the 2010 World Cup, law enforcement documents state. Valcke is one of Blatter's top official.

Valcke's possible involvement was first reported Monday evening by a newspaper, which noted he might not have known the money was part of a bribe. South African officials have denied paying the bribes. Valcke has not been charged with a crime.

Tuesday's announcement means the beginning of the end of a long career for Blatter, who joined FIFA in 1975.

Under Blatter, FIFA has been shaken by rumors of corruption, bribes and backroom deals. These usually involve FIFA's presidential elections and its votes on World Cup sites. Blatter's resignation calls into question whether the 2022 World Cup will go on as planned in Qatar.

## Resignation Draws Support In Europe, U.S.

Blatter's announcement was welcomed by government officials, players, and experts across Europe and the Americas. U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati called it "an exceptional and immediate opportunity for positive change within FIFA."

"Today is an occasion for optimism and belief for everyone who shares a passion for our game," Gulati said.

In Latin America, players and officials celebrated Blatter's departure. They also expressed hope that world soccer would become more open and honest.

Brazilian soccer legend Romario de Souza Faria, now a senator, wrote on Facebook that Blatter's resignation was the "best news in ages." He said it "begins a new era for world football."

## "Enough Lying," Says Argentine Soccer Star

Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona is one of the most famous players of all time. He told a radio station that "today the truth is out and I am enjoying it."

"They hate soccer," Maradona said of FIFA officials. "Enough shady dealings. Enough lying to the people."

Britain's sports and culture secretary, John Whittingdale, said Blatter should have resigned long ago. He called it was "only the beginning of the process of change we need to see from FIFA."

In Germany, the news of Blatter's resignation was met with relief and even joy.

Hans Sarpei is a German-Ghanaian former professional soccer player. He tweeted, "I'll go to my office now and dance with joy."

"This is the absolutely right decision, and it is overdue," said the president of the German Football Association, Wolfgang Niersbach. "It is a tragedy, actually, that he did not spare himself and all of us by doing this earlier."
