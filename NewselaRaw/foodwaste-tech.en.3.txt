The reasons why are complicated. Grocery stores think they could get in trouble with the courts if they give bad food to food pantries, which offer free food to people who do not have enough to eat. Farmers throw out perfectly good fruit if it looks ugly. People let bananas go bad on their shelves without eating them.

## Why Throw Food Away?

Five years ago, Maria Rose Belding was a freshman in high school. She lived in Pella, Iowa. She felt bad about all of the food going to waste. She wanted to help change things. 

At the time, Belding volunteered at a food pantry. She had just thrown out hundreds of boxes of expired mac and cheese. She did this even though there were many people waiting outside the pantry to collect free food.

"We were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn't communicate," Belding remembers. She felt frustrated. This feeling would lead her to develop an important technology in the fight against hunger. 

## Saving Tons Of Food

Belding is now 20 years old and in college. She spent many years studying the hunger problem. She built a large online network that connects thousands of food pantries in 24 states. The network allows food pantries to quickly share extra food. This way, the food does not go to waste. So far, the network has saved an estimated two tons of food. That would weigh about as much as a small truck.

Belding's program is called MEANS. It stands for Matches Excess and Need for Stability. Experts agree that it is a good idea. Belding has received praise for her work. 

Belding says even people who give food to food pantries are part of the problem. Most people give things like creamed corn or beans that are almost expired. This food eventually gets thrown out. A grocery store might give 400 jars of peanut better. It is hard to give all the peanut butter away before it expires.

## Building A Website

When Belding started studying the idea behind her program, she was sure someone had beat her to it. She was wrong. 

It took more than a year. It was a year of planning and building the program. Then in February, the website went online.  

Months passed. In May, Belding was sitting in class when she saw one of her users post some food to the website. She realized this was the moment when the program would either succeed or fail. 

## Lots More Work To Do

She became very worried when she saw that the food was canned beans. She did not think anyone would want them. "So we were all anxiously sitting by our computers hitting refresh, and I said, 'Please, someone take this.' And then, it's gone. It just disappeared." Someone wanted the beans.

Things then happened very quickly for MEANS. The group now has several workers. It used to have just 50 food pantries working with their website. Now it has 200.  

Belding said there is still much work to do. There are still 26 states that are not yet using her program. She said she had more calls to make, and more people to meet.
