In the midst of this year's wars, horrors and treason, it will be difficult for the Nobel Peace Prize committee to find a worthy laureate.

Where on the planet can a man, woman or organization be found to have reduced the bloodshed and cruelty? The world has witnessed violence in the usual locations as well as new places.

Politicians in the Middle East failed this year and last year to stop the killing and harming of soldiers and citizens. The Middle East is a region that has seen fighting between Israel and Palestine, as well as a civil war in Syria. It is unlikely that a political diplomat will be named a winner when the prestigious Nobel is announced in Oslo, Norway, on Friday.

## Diplomats And Popes

Secretary of State John Kerry, the top diplomat from the U.S., was unable to bring peace to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He attempted to have peace talks between the two sides but could not resolve the fighting. The conflict goes back a long time and recently there was deadly destruction in the Gaza Strip.

The 4-year war in Syria has not ended either. Lakhdar Brahimi, a diplomat for the United Nations (U.N.), tried to bring an end to the Syrian war. The U.N. is an international organization dedicated to keeping peace around the world. As a diplomat, Brahimi held peace conferences to bring the two sides together to discuss a deal, but these did not work. He quit in May. His replacement, Staffan di Mistura, hasn't even managed to bring about another peace conference.

There appear to be no politicians who are inspiring as previous laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize, such as South Africa's Nelson Mandela (1993 peace laureate) or Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev (1990) or former U.S. President Jimmy Carter (2002). The deadline to submit a nomination was Feb. 1.

Nor did any religious leader make a noticeable contribution to world peace. Pope Francis, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, was nominated by the Argentinian parliament. Pope Francis is from Argentina. He has boldly guided the Catholic Church toward returning to a ministry focused on the plight of the poor. In his personal life, he has avoided fancy possessions for a more humble lifestyle and wardrobe.

Yet, Pope Francis has only been in office for 19 months. An earlier pope who was also dedicated to peace, John Paul II, led the Catholic Church for 27 years and was not recognized by the Nobel Committee.

## Whistleblowers And Protesters

Controversial actions have led at times to some people receiving a Peace Prize. In the past, protesters and whistleblowers — people who reveal secrets about the government — have received a Nobel. But most of this year's known controversial nominees have already been passed over.

Former U.S. Army analyst Chelsea Manning is serving a 35-year prison sentence for giving classified government documents to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. Manning's act was praised by some as revealing suspicious government behavior but denounced by others as an act of treason, or betraying the country.

Also, a former employee of the U.S. government, Edward Snowden, is charged for leaking secrets about the government. Snowden is currently a fugitive in Russia. Similar to Manning, Snowden is saluted and hated in nearly equal measures.

Protesters nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize include a Russian musical punk band called Pussy Riot. They are a rare voice of protest in a country ruled by the strict Russian President Vladimir Putin who has arrested them for their rebellion. Pussy Riot was nominated in previous years but not chosen.

Despite the lack of obvious deserving recipients, there were a record-breaking 278 nominations this year. It is up by 19 from last year's previous record. Among the nominees are 47 organizations. The Nobel Committee keeps this list secret for 50 years, but nominating individuals and agencies often disclose their nominee to the public.

## Malala Or Mukwege?

When there is no individual who stands out, informed speculators have put forward some names of groups as worthy recipients.

The Peace Research Institute Oslo issues a list of potential winners each year. For 2014, they suggest a Japanese peace group, an independent Russian newspaper, and Snowden, the whistleblower.

Japanese People Who Conserve Article 9 is an organization that wants to keep peace. In Article 9 of Japan's constitution, the country pledges to avoid "the right of belligerency" or fighting to solve international conflicts. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to revise the constitution to allow for military defense. He has been in office for nearly two years.

Another nominee for the peace prize is the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. The newspaper has criticized President Putin. It has paid the price with at least six of its journalists murdered since the newspaper was founded in 1993.

Other nominees who also have a chance of winning the prize include activist and Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai. She was shot by the Taliban, a terror organization, because she defied their attempts to prevent girls from getting an education. Another potential nominee is gynecologist Denis Mukwege who works as a doctor for females. He has treated thousands of female victims of violence and torture in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country in Central Africa.

## Newspaper Nominates Kohl

Uruguayan President Jose Mujica has also been nominated. He gives away 90 percent of his salary to housing programs for the poor and has legalized marijuana and gay marriage. Another contender for the Peace Prize is Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the top diplomat from the United Nations. He has been praised for bringing attention back to climate change in a world widely distracted by war.

One potential nominee has long been out of the world's spotlight. The Guardian newspaper thought Helmut Kohl of Germany deserves late recognition. Kohl was the chancellor of West Germany in the late 1980s when the country was still divided. He brought the country together peacefully through pro-democracy movements and skilled diplomacy.

"Modern-day revolutions rarely end happily," the British newspaper noted, giving examples of failed revolutions in Egypt and Ukraine. "Helmut Kohl was no revolutionary, but the startling revolt that happened on his watch had a happy ending. Reunited Germany is one of today's great success stories, Europe's biggest country, its engine of growth, its biggest exporter, its anchor of stability."

Wouldn't it be fitting, the Guardian asked, to honor the 84-year-old icon of reunification with the prestigious Nobel Prize almost exactly 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
