BERLIN, Germany — During winter in Berlin, the sun is only up for about 7 hours. The city gets dark earlier in the day. Still, many people bike. Marion Gisske bikes almost every day. Even in the winter, she continues to bike.

Biking isn't strange for Marion. She also rides in the summer, when Berlin's daylight lasts for almost 17 hours. However, it does make her a success story in Europe. Many cities in Europe want people to travel to and from work by bike instead of by car. For Marion, riding a bike is an easy choice.

"Every day is a good day when it starts with a sunrise you see from your bike," Marion explained. "To come home on the bike is to relax, and to see everyone else looking very stressed in their cars. The trains are packed. The bike is perfect."

## Berlin Is Making It Easier On Bikes

Berlin wants more people to bike in the city instead of driving. The city wants one of every five trips in the city to be on a bike. 

Last year, the city decided to make it easier to bike in Berlin. Officials spent $16 million on bike lanes and bike traffic signals. Bike lanes and traffic signals help make biking safer.

By U.S. standards, Berlin's goal seems expensive and difficult. By European standards, however, Berlin is way behind. 

Copenhagen is another European city. In Copenhagen, 18 of every 50 people biked to work in 2012. By the end of 2015, more than 25 of every 50 biked to work.

## Oslo Might Ban Cars Downtown

Oslo is the capital city of Norway. The city council there has been talking about banning cars from downtown. The council wants to spend $450 million on bike lanes and bike traffic signals. They hope people will bike instead of driving. In four years, they hope three out of every 15 cars will be off the road. By 2030, they want to five out of every 15 cars off the road.

Ola Elestuen works for the government in Norway. Elestuen works to protect the environment and save energy. "Oslo wants to become an example for the world," Elestuen said.

Oslo wants to do things even better than other cities. Some other European cities build bridges and traffic signals with cyclists in mind. Protected lanes for bikes can make biking faster than driving. Bike paths can also make it safer.

## Biking Has Its Benefits

Stefan Goessling worked on a research study about the costs of travel by bike versus cars. His study looked at Copenhagen. Stefan found that it costs more to drive than to bike. The cost of biking a mile is 14 cents, whereas driving driving a mile costs 88 cents.

Goessling said biking is good for people's health. Biking saves money on things like health care. When people are healthy, they go to the doctor less. Goessling also said traveling by car costs the city more money. Each car mile costs 27 cents on things like fixing roads. 

Goessling's study only looked at Copenhagen. However, he thinks the results would apply to other places, like the United States. Americans could get more exercise by biking, Goessling said.
