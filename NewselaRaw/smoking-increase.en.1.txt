SEATTLE — A new analysis from the University of Washington (UW) shows that the number of smokers worldwide — and the number of cigarettes consumed — have never been higher, 50 years after the U.S. Surgeon General first warned of the ill effects of smoking.

Between 1980 and 2012, the number of adults who smoke increased from 721 million to nearly 1 billion, the study reported. The analysis was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The number of cigarettes smoked globally jumped from about 5 trillion to 6.25 trillion.

The study is one of the most comprehensive ever to examine global tobacco use. It shows that the remarkable reductions in smoking rates in the United States and other wealthy countries have been offset by smoking's rising rate in the developing world.

"The University of Washington study demonstrated clearly how much further the world, particularly low- and middle-income countries, still has to go," said Matthew Myers. He is president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids which is based in Washington, D.C.

The rise in the number of smokers reflects population growth, particularly in nations such as China and Indonesia. It is also a result of the tobacco industry's heavy marketing in poorer nations, experts say.

## Sheer Number Of Smokers

Smoking numbers are usually reported in terms of rates, or the percentage of people who smoke. The UW analysis confirmed that the global smoking rate dropped from 26 percent to 18.7 percent during the study period.

But the sheer number of smokers is most important when it comes to the public-health impact, said Ruth Malone. She studies global tobacco issues at the University of California, San Francisco.

"It's premature deaths ... and the total global burden of suffering — of preventable suffering — that we're talking about here," said Malone, who was not involved in the UW analysis.

After dropping rapidly for a decade, global smoking rates have declined more slowly since the mid-2000s, said Marie Ng. She is the lead author of the analysis from the UW's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). And though the data are still uncertain, the analysis hints that the worldwide smoking rate for men may have started to climb in the past three years.

The surgeon general's 1964 report drew a clear link between smoking and lung cancer and other diseases. Since then, tobacco-control efforts in the U.S. have saved 8 million lives, according to another JAMA study. The percentage of Americans who smoke has fallen by more than half, from 42 percent in 1964 to 18 percent in 2012.

And despite population growth, the number of smokers in the U.S. has also dropped, from 52 million in 1980 to 38 million in 2012.

"Tobacco control has been described, accurately, as one of the great public-health successes of the 20th century," wrote Thomas Frieden. He is the Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and contributed an editorial accompanying the studies.

## Anti-Smoking Measures Help

But lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates tobacco-related illness kills 5 million people a year worldwide. That is more than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.

Ng and her team spent three years compiling and analyzing more than 1,000 data sets from 182 countries. An online visualization tool prepared by IHME allows anyone to sift the results by country, sex, age and other factors.

Those details reveal that countries with effective tobacco-control programs have all seen dramatic declines in tobacco use, Myers said.

Uruguay, which was the first nation to adopt a set of WHO-recommended policies, such as higher cigarette taxes and restrictions on advertising, saw smoking rates fall 25 percent in just three years.

Since 1980, the smoking rate in Mexico, which requires gory warning labels on cigarette packages, has fallen faster than in the U.S. But countries such as Russia, Indonesia and China, where up to 54 percent of men still smoke, have slowed global progress, Myers said.

Russia, however, recently adopted some of the world's toughest anti-smoking measures, which will kick in soon.

"This study is not a reason for a sense of hopelessness," Myers said. "It is, however, a clarion call that in those countries that have not yet implemented tobacco-control policies, the death toll from tobacco is going to be devastating."
