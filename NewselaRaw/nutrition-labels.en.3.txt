WASHINGTON — On Thursday the government proposed a change to the way food is labeled. The new set of rules would be the first major makeover of nutrition labels in more than 20 years.

The new labels would provide more calorie information. For example, they would indicate the amount of added sugars in a food item. And they would be based on new, mostly larger serving sizes that reflect how people really eat.

The changes are aimed at addressing serious public health issues. Among these are widespread [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) — that is, the condition of being extremely overweight.

For the next 90 days, the public will be allowed to comment on the planned changes. The government will release final rules for the new labels within a year.

## Making Healthier Choices

Government officials believe the new labels could lead shoppers to make healthier choices. They also say the labels will encourage the food industry to cut down on added sugars.

First lady Michelle Obama was to formally announce the new labels from the White House. She has made better nutrition a focus of her "Let's Move!" campaign. This effort is devoted to battling childhood obesity.

When you "walk into your local grocery store" figuring out what's in the food should be simple, she said. You should be able to tell right away whether something is "good for your family."

Nutrition labels are found on about 700,000 products. Given the cost of changing them, the government is not calling for an overnight shift. It is proposing instead that the new labels be phased in over a two-year period.

On the proposed new labels the calorie count would appear in larger, bold typeface. And there would be a separate entry in the sugar section. This new entry would allow shoppers to distinguish between added sugar and natural sugar.

Government officials said that would help shoppers cut down on added sugar.

## Added Sugar, Serving Sizes

Nutrition expert Marion Nestle predicted pushback from large food companies. "The food industry is really eager for people to not know how much sugar there is," she said.

Still, some claim the new added-sugar entry doesn't go far enough. The amount of sugar should also be shown as a percentage of recommended daily intake, argued Michael F. Jacobson, a scientist and activist. "So many people consume far too much," he said.

Jacobson noted that the American Heart Association recommends that people consume very little added sugar. It suggests women take in no more than 25 grams per day. And for men, it recommends no more than 35 grams per day. One can of soda alone contains about 40 grams.

The new labels would also change serving sizes. The serving size for soda, for example, is currently 8 ounces. This number is meant to equal the quantity of soda people usually drink at one time, on average. However, people often drink soda in 12-ounce cans or even larger bottles.

The proposed rule would require the serving size to be at least 12 ounces.

## To Help Curb Obesity

With the update, the serving sizes would increase for some products, such as ice cream. For some other products, such as yogurt, sizes would decrease.

"The serving sizes for many foods are a joke now," said Jacobson. "The half-cup of ice cream" or "2-ounce muffins and bagels," haven't been seen in Americans eating habits for years, he said.

Certain items that are typically finished all at once would be scored differently on the updated labels: Nutrition information would be given for the entire package, not just the standard serving size. This would apply, for example, to a 20-ounce soda bottle.

New rules will also apply to items if the package is two times the serving size and it could be consumed all at once. For example, a 24-ounce soda bottle would contain two 12-ounce servings under the new rules. Manufacturers would be required to put a label with two columns on sodas. This would provide a breakdown of calories and sugar by both serving size and container size.

Officials said widespread obesity was one of the primary reasons for the update. They acknowledged that the new labels alone would not solve the problem. But, they said, they believe the labels could help curb it.
