ST. LOUIS — One-third of the food we consume depends on pollination by honeybees. But these tiny workhorses in our food system are continuing to die in perplexing ways.

Beekeeping groups have held conferences. Researchers have organized task forces. And the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has contributed some of its resources to tracking down the cause of the mysterious deaths. In a recent report, it concluded that a range of factors may be responsible, from stress to pesticides.

Now, agricultural and chemical heavyweights are getting into the mix. Missouri-based Monsanto Co. bought an Israeli bee research company two years ago and is hosting an industry conference on bee health. Bayer CropScience, another major company, is building a 5,500-square-foot "bee health center." Fellow chemical giant Syngenta joined Bayer in developing a "comprehensive action plan" for bee health.

Monsanto hired Jerry Hayes, a bee industry expert, to run its research. "The beekeeping industry has always crawled on its hands and knees to USDA and universities, begging for help," he said. "Now we have this very large company involved that knows how important bees are to agriculture."

## Bees Abandoning Their Hives

The industry's interest goes straight to the bottom line. Bees pollinate up to $20 billion in American agricultural crops. Monsanto, for one, owns Seminis, one of the country's largest fruit and vegetable seed producers — and many of those seeds depend on bees.

But as researchers, and now the private sector, puzzle over the mystery, some scientists and environmental groups are pointing to a major culprit. They contend that the very companies working for solutions are a main cause of bee deaths in the first place.

In 2006, beekeepers started noticing that bees were abandoning their hives, a phenomenon scientists call Colony Collapse Disorder. Since then, the American bee population has dropped by an average of 30 percent every year. Researchers, beekeepers and farmers are trying to figure out the cause.

The disorder is being blamed on mites and viruses. But some researchers believe the agricultural system relies too heavily on chemicals and monocultures, such as the vast fields of corn and soybeans in the Midwest. The widespread planting of single crops crowds out plants and flowers that are a source of pollen for bees.

"We have been systematically eliminating flowers that bees require for nutrition and survival," explained Marla Spivak, a University of Minnesota entomologist. Insecticides deemed necessary to kill crop pests, at high enough doses, can be deadly to bees, Spivak pointed out.

## An Insecticide The Wrongdoer?

The thing to blame is a particular class of insecticides, called neonicotinoids, that are widely used because they are thought to be less toxic to mammals. Manufactured by Bayer and Syngenta, neonicotinoids are used as seed coatings on most of the corn and soybeans planted in the U.S.

A recent study by Purdue University researcher Christian Krupke found high levels of neonicotinoids in dead bees in and around corn fields. The study was prompted by massive bee die-offs in the spring, when corn planters were spewing dust containing neonicotinoids.

"I know, definitively, that there's a relationship between treated seed and spring die-offs," said Krupke. He added that the chemical gets in the air and lands on dandelions and even on the bees themselves.

While Krupke says there's no direct link between neonicotinoids and Colony Collapse Disorder, anything that stresses bees is of great concern.

The industry, however, disputes there is a link between the neonicotinoids it produces and the health of bees.

"There's no scientific evidence linking neonics with bee health — period," said Dave Fischer, director of environmental toxicity and risk assessment at Bayer CropScience. He explained that Bayer relies heavily on bees for pollination, particularly in its canola fields in Canada. "It would be a poor business model if we were poisoning the bees we depend on," he said.

## Are Neonicotinoids Needed?

But some researchers question whether neonicotinoids are necessary at all. The industry claims it boosts yields by 6 to 12 bushels an acre.

Krupke has done tests to determine if that's true. "We have not found any difference in yield or root damage — nothing," he said. "It doesn't mean it never works. But it means we certainly don't need to be putting it on every kernel of corn."

Doug Gurian-Sherman, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, thinks the problem is so serious that insecticide use should be discontinued as soon as possible. Missouri's beekeepers would seem to agree.

Neal Bergman runs the state's largest bee operation. He remembers a seven-year stretch in the 2000s when crop planes doused cotton fields with the insecticide malathion.

"They sprayed 400,000 acres of cotton every week," he said. "It didn't matter how the wind was blowing or what time of day it was. They sprayed over people, over animals, over beehives — everything."

Bergman says his bee population plummeted, costing him $1 million and almost putting him out of business. Since then, he's been wary of insecticides. He would like to see more coordination among farmers so they don't spray chemicals when the bees are around a particular crop.

To keep his bees healthy, Bergman uses several medicines and gives his hives protein supplements.

Still, some say time is getting short to solve this mystery of bee deaths.
