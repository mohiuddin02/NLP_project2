WASHINGTON â€” The Senate Thursday voted 68-32 to overhaul the nation's immigration system, an ambitious plan that creates a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants while requiring stepped-up border security.

The measure represents the most sweeping changes to immigration law since the 1980s.  After sailing through the Senate, it now faces a perilous path through the House of Representatives, where Republicans outnumber Democrats.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said flatly: "The House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes. We're going to do our own bill."

While the bill's passage was no surprise, Senate leaders created some drama by having members vote from their seats, a practice reserved for only the most history-making occasions. One by one, senators rose from their seats to declare their votes as a packed Senate gallery looked on, including an entire section of college students and parents wearing bright blue "United We Dream" T-shirts.

## A Thousand-Page Bill

The Senate vote showed strong support to the thousand-page bill painstakingly crafted by eight senators from both parties and amended this week to bring in some skeptics. Fourteen Republicans joined 52 Democrats and two Independents in voting yes Thursday, while 32 Republicans voted no. The eight authors of the bill were called the "Gang of Eight."

The debate stirred a lot of passion on the Senate floor.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the spirit of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, who worked to enact immigration legislation before his death in 2009. "Senator Kennedy knew the day would come when a group of senators divided by party, but united by love of country, would see this fight to the finish," Reid said as he closed the debate.

"That day is today. And while I am sad that Senator Kennedy isn't here to see history made, I know he is looking down on us proudly. He is not alone," Reid said.

## "Out Of Many, One"

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a key architect of the bill, had endured sharp criticism from conservatives for his efforts to find common ground. Before he voted yes Thursday, he recalled his parents, who came to this country from Cuba.

"Well before they became citizens, in their hearts they had already become Americans," he said. "It reminds us that sometimes we focus so much on how immigrants could change America, that we forget that America changes immigrants even more."

He added, "This is not just my story. This is our story. It reminds us that we are 'E Pluribus Unum.' Out of many, one."

Under the legislation, employers would have to check on a potential employee's legal status, and the number of visas available for skilled workers needed by the technology industry would be increased.

## Path To Citizenship

The measure would create a 13-year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants who came to the U.S. without authorization. Those eligible could first apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant status. They would achieve that status if they pass a background check, have not been convicted of a serious crime, pay any taxes owed and pay a $500 fine.

The registration would be valid for six years, allowing the immigrants to work and travel. After that time, the status could be renewed, as long as the same conditions are met. They also would have to show they had been regularly employed and can support themselves financially.

After 10 years, the status could again be adjusted. Immigrants would have to meet new requirements, including proficiency in English and a new $1,000 fine. Three years after that, in most cases, they could achieve citizenship. Before green cards are issued to those with provisional legal status, though, five security-related conditions would need to be met.

Most notably, top executive branch officials would have to certify that certain steps had been taken to secure borders. Those include towers, ground sensors, thermal imaging, unmanned aircraft systems, Blackhawk helicopters and marine vessels. A 700-mile fence would be built between the U.S. and Mexico.

Twenty thousand additional Border Patrol agents would be added to the force of 18,400.

## Bowing To Political Reality

Opponents said the plan essentially pardoned people who broke the law and they questioned whether the security provisions were realistic.

"The promises of an open and fair process have been as hollow as the promises that this bill is the toughest ever and will end the lawlessness in the future. It's amnesty first and plainly lacks any mechanism, any commitment, to enforcement," said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who led the opposition.

Other Republicans had a different take. They tend to represent states with large and growing Hispanic populations, and they were bowing to political reality. They saw their presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, win only about one-fourth of the Hispanic vote last year, and are concerned that voting block is slipping away.

"If someone is going to be here in this country for 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years, I want them to assimilate," said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. "I want them to have the rights, and more importantly, the responsibilities that come with citizenship."
