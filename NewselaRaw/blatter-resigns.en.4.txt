Blatter announced his decision Tuesday. It came just days after other soccer officials were arrested. The U.S. Justice Department said they were secretly taking money against the law.

No one knows what led Blatter to quit. An American law enforcement official said the Justice Department is looking into whether Blatter also took money.

Blatter will remain president of FIFA until someone else is elected. FIFA stands for the French name, Fédération Internationale de Football Association. It is a sports league, like the American NBA or the NFL. Its teams are in about 200 different countries.

At FIFA's offices in Switzerland, Blatter said he did nothing wrong. He admitted he had lost the support of "the entire world of football." In most of the world, soccer is called football. Blatter said he plans to make important changes in FIFA while he is still president.

## Leader Says He Wants To Do "What Is Best"

Blatter has been the FIFA president since 1998. Blatter said he would limit the number of years someone could be president. He also said FIFA's top committee must be changed because it has too much power. The committee decides on the dates and places of soccer tournaments.

Blatter, who is 79, said he loves FIFA more than anything. "I want to do only what is best for FIFA and for football," said Blatter.

On May 27, the Swiss government arrested several people who work for FIFA. Hours later, the American government announced 47 criminal charges against them and others. The government said FIFA officials took money from countries competing to have the World Cup soccer championship.

Blatter has not been charged with a crime. The Justice Department thinks a top FIFA official was involved in a $10 million secret deal in 2008. That money was paid by people in the South African government. They wanted the 2010 World Cup to be played in their country.

South African officials have denied paying for the World Cup. The FIFA official has not been charged with a crime.

For many years, people have wondered about secret deals in FIFA. They questioned how FIFA's presidents were chosen. They also questioned votes on World Cup sites.

The soccer world welcomed Blatter's exit.

U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati called it a chance for FIFA to change.

## Players Hope Soccer Will Be More Honest

In Latin America, players and officials celebrated. They spoke of their hope that soccer would become honest and open.

Romario de Souza Faria is a Brazilian soccer legend and is currently a government lawmaker. He wrote on Facebook that it was the "best news in ages."

Diego Maradona is one of the most famous soccer players of all time. He told a radio station that "today the truth is out and I am enjoying it."

He said, "Enough lying to the people."

John Whittingdale is in charge of sports and culture for the English government. He said the end of Blatter's job was the first step to changing FIFA.

In Germany, the news was greeted with relief and even joy.

Hans Sarpei is a German-Ghanaian former professional soccer player. He tweeted, "I'll go to my office now and dance with joy."

"This is the absolutely right decision," said Wolfgang Niersbach. He is the president of the German Football Association. Niersbach said Blatter should have quit earlier.
