Dogs are not known as being the most graceful drinkers. If you place a bowl of drinking water in front of a thirsty canine, you are likely to see much of it eventually splashed on the floor.  However, researchers who study how different animals drink are learning that dogs might actually have a pretty smart strategy all their own.

The findings provide new ideas on animal behaviors that are still mysterious to humans. The new research was recently described at a scientific conference focused on fluid dynamics in San Francisco.

Different animals have different strategies when it comes to getting a mouthful of water, said research co-author Sunghwan Jung of Virginia Tech University.

## Different Animals, Different Drinking Skills

Some animals use suction to drink water — like humans do. We use our cheeks like a vacuum to suck up liquid from the lip of a cup or through a straw. The sucking creates negative pressure in our mouths.

Carnivores, including wolves and lions, do not have complete cheeks. This allows them to open their mouths very wide to attack prey in the wild. However, they cannot close their lips completely or create any suction. They cannot suck up liquid the way humans do. Carnivores have to use their tongues to lap at liquid and bring it toward their mouths.

Using a tongue instead of a vacuum to drink water may not seem like the most efficient way to drink, but Jung said that some creatures who drink with their tongue have figured out how to do it efficiently. Cats stick out their tongues in a J shape, barely flicking the top of the water. Then they quickly move their tongue up over and over again, each time pulling water up into the air. They close their mouths over part of the water stream when it becomes tall enough. Scientists think that learning this skill is the secret to cats' remarkable drinking skills.

## Dogs Are Not So Complex

Some researchers used to think that dogs used their tongues to simply scoop up water instead of drinking it in the complex way that a cat does. Now they say that is not the case at all. Dogs actually have their own unique strategy.

The researchers used a video camera to record dogs drinking water. They wanted to learn more about how exactly dogs drink liquid. To do so, researchers created glass tubes in the shape of a dog's tongue. They dunked the tubes in the water in the same way that a dog dunks its tongue to drink.

There were some important differences between how dogs and cats drink. Dogs stuck out more of their tongues, allowing them to whack more area on the water's surface. Their tongues were used to pull the water up into a column at an extremely fast rate — much faster than cats, according to Jung. While cats barely flicked the water, dogs used more tongue and plunged into the liquid.

However, while there are many differences, both animals do one thing at the same time: just before the stream of water they have flicked up is about to fall back down, they close their mouths around the liquid. This allows them to capture the maximum amount of water.

"Dogs use a very smart (mechanism) to optimize their drinking," Jung said.

So the question remains: why did cats become such dainty drinkers while dogs are more sloppy around the water bowl? There is no way to know for sure at the moment, but Jung said it might be because cats simply do not like water nearly as much as dogs do.
