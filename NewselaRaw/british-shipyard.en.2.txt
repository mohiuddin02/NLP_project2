LONDON — Britain will shut down the last naval shipyard in England, closing a chapter of history stretching back hundreds of years. The move, announced Wednesday, will get rid of nearly 1,000 jobs.

The decision was significant for a nation that was once the mightiest naval power in the world.

Workers in the southern city of Portsmouth have been building warships since the reign of King Henry VIII. But the government has agreed to end construction there, saying demand for the ships had fallen.

Vessels for the Royal Navy will still be built in Britain, but only in Scotland. Great Britain includes England, Scotland and Wales.

## Portsmouth Will Handle Maintenance

Hundreds of jobs are to be cut at Scottish shipyards as well. Still, workers in Portsmouth accused the government of cutting their jobs for political reasons. The workers say the government did not want to make Scots angry because there is a vote next year on whether they should separate from England and Wales to become an independent nation.

Prime Minister David Cameron defended the decision to stop shipbuilding in Portsmouth. He noted that the city's dockyards would continue to repair and maintain warships. Ships just will not be built there. Yes, 940 jobs will be lost next year. But 11,000 in the industry will remain, he said.

"Many more people have been involved in ship-servicing than in shipbuilding," Cameron told lawmakers. "Some of the largest and best-equipped warships we have ever had in our country will be based and hosted at Portsmouth … which will mean a lot of work for Portsmouth and for our naval base there for many, many years to come."

Defense Secretary Philip Hammond denied that the next year's vote played a role in the choice to keep Scotland's shipyards busy. He said the government would put $160 million into servicing ships in Portsmouth. The spending is an effort to make cutting job cuts easier to take.

The loss of jobs is not the only damage to Portsmouth. Perhaps just as hurtful is the loss of its historic role as the center of British shipbuilding. The work done in the city helped turn the small island of Britain into a naval power that once had a vast worldwide empire.

## Made Britain A Naval Powerhouse

Portsmouth has been important for English monarchs since the 13th century. In 1511, shipbuilders there launched Henry VIII's beloved Mary Rose. The ship was one of the first war vessels able to fire a broadside, or shots from all the guns on one side at once. The launch led to the rise of Britain as a naval powerhouse.

The ship sank 34 years later during a fight with the French fleet. The wreck lay on the seabed for nearly 300 years, without anyone noticing it. Then a diver accidentally came across it. The Mary Rose was raised from the water in 1982 and is now a big tourist attraction.

Another historic craft, the HMS Victory, is also anchored at Portsmouth. That vessel saw action in the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. It was the flagship of Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

Gerald Vernon-Jackson is the leader of the Portsmouth City Council. He said the British government was putting itself in a tough position by ending shipbuilding in England.

"If Scotland becomes independent, where will the Royal Navy build their ships? They'll have to go to foreign countries to have their ships built," Vernon-Jackson told Sky News. "That's a terrible thing for an island nation that depends on sea trade like the United Kingdom."

But Hammond said Britain would try to keep military shipbuilding within its own borders. It would do this even if Scotland left Britain.
