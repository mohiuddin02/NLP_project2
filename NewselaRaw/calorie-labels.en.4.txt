Many Americans are overweight. Being overweight can make a person unhealthy. It can even cause diseases.

People become overweight when they eat too many calories. Calories are how energy is counted in food. Too few calories can make people hungry or lose weight. Too many calories can make people gain weight.

The government is worried. It has made laws to help. Fast-food places now have to show how many calories are in the foods they serve. The government hoped this would help people to pick good foods.

It also hoped restaurants would start to sell more healthy foods.

## We Eat What We Like

Scientists did a study to see if the government was right. They found something interesting. The government was only partly right.

People who eat out do not choose food by calories. They pick what they like to eat.

Now comes the interesting part. When food places have to post calories, they serve healthier items. All of the food on their menu becomes a bit healthier.

Then some people will choose them. People might be eating healthier and not even know it.

## Hold The Sprinkles!

Posting calories made places like Starbucks and McDonald's change. They cut calories and fat in some foods. They also offered more healthy foods. Restaurants may have felt bad about how many calories were in their foods.

A new law will start next year. It will make more places that sell food list calories. Movie theaters, snack shops and ice cream stores are just some of them.

Every day, about one-third of Americans eat out. Cutting calories at restaurants could really help to keep people healthy.
