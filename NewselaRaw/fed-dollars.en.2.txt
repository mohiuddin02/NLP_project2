WASHINGTON — To lawmakers and others arguing that replacing the $1 bill with a $1 coin would save the government money, the Federal Reserve says, "Don't bet on it."

The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. And it controls the country's money.

A new study by the Fed said the old-fashioned greenback is more durable than people realize. And replacing it with a dollar coin would cost the government $1.2 billion over 30 years. Coins are more expensive to produce, it pointed out.

The Fed study looked at the benefits and costs of moving from paper money to coins. It found that the $1 bill "should remain in circulation and not be replaced with a $1 coin."

## Coins Last Longer Than Paper ...

Some in Congress are pushing the government to replace the dollar bill. The reason is that a dollar coin would last longer. Canada and Britain — and much of Europe — have replaced small value paper money with with coins.

Last year, the Government Accountability Office estimated a switch could save the government $4.4 billion over 30 years. The GAO works for Congress, and looks into how the government spends money.

The Dollar Coin Alliance is an organization lobbying to get the government to switch to the $1 coin. The organization includes groups that watch how the government spends money, transportation agencies, metal mining companies and vending machine groups. It promotes an economic report that estimated a switch would save $13.8 billion over 30 years.

The organization criticized the Fed's study. It says the central bank wants to keep the dollar bill because it profits from the sale of paper money.

It's no surprise the Fed is fighting the switch, said Shawn Smeallie. He is the head of the Dollar Coin Alliance. He said the Fed wants to keep the dollar bill for the wrong reasons. "The best interests of taxpayers, not the Fed, must come first."

## ... But Cost Much More Money To Make

The Fed issues money through its reserve banks and orders it from the Treasury. The Fed said it is not a profit-making institution. Every year it turns over any profits to the Treasury Department. In addition to printing money, the Treasury also collects taxes and pays the government's bills.

The Fed study said estimates of costs savings for a dollar coin are way off the mark.

The dollar bill is made with paper that blends cotton and linen. It is now is more durable and lasts about 70 months compared with 18 months in 1990, the report said. The bills that were eliminated in other countries lasted less than 20 months.

Although a dollar coin can be used for 30 years, it also costs much more to produce.

A dollar bill costs about 5 cents to make. A dollar coin costs about 33 cents, the Fed said. Over 30 years, the government would spend an additional $6.9 billion if it replaced the bills with coins.

At that cost, the government would make money on the switch only if the dollar bills lasted less than 4.75 years. Since they currently last 70 months, or about 5.8 years, the bill is more efficient, the Fed said.

## Dollar Coins Sitting In Vaults

And the shift to a dollar coin would result in additional costs. Extra vault storage space at banks and equipment would cost "perhaps in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year," the Fed said.

Not to mention the public has shown no great love for dollar coins so far, the Fed added.

The newest dollar coins have images of American presidents. They were promoted by the Fed and the U.S. Mint, but the effort didn't get people interested in them, the report said.

There are about 1.4 billion dollar coins sitting in Fed vaults. That's approximately a 40-year supply.

The report said polls have shown that a majority of Americans prefer the dollar bill to the dollar coin. Those same polls found that making the switch could lead more people to stop using cash. Instead, they might use credit cards and other payment methods.

But the Dollar Coin Alliance said polls have shown about two-thirds of Americans support a switch to a dollar coin. But, that's if they think it could save the government money.
