CHICAGO — Chicago children returned to school Tuesday, walking past more than 1,300 guards lining the streets in crime-ridden neighborhoods.

Last year, concerns about safety prompted the city to send 1,200 guards to help make sure students got to school safely.

Thanks to $1 million from the city this year, another 100 "Safe Passage" workers were lining routes that students walk to get to school. After Governor Pat Quinn pledged $10 million, officials said another 600 of the workers would be hired and on the streets over the next several weeks.

When they are all in place, said Jadine Chou, more workers will be assigned along existing routes and some routes will be extended farther from schools. Chou is the chief safety and security officer for the Chicago Public Schools, The district has added 27 schools to the 93 for which there are already Safe Passage workers.

"It was good last year, but I don't think it stopped the violence none," said Tiffany Davis, who was walking her 7-year-old son to Dulles School of Excellence on the city's South Side. "Maybe it calmed things down a little."

## Worst Fears Were Never Realized

There is far less publicity about the first day of school than a year ago. Last year, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel ordered the closure of nearly 50 schools. Parents worried that forcing children to walk through unfamiliar and dangerous neighborhoods to new schools would put them in danger of getting caught in gang fights.

But the worst fears of violence against children walking to school never came to pass.

"It didn't happen, to the glory of God, and I think (very little) if anything, happened to children on their way to and from school," said Bishop Larry Trotter. He is the pastor of Sweet Holy Spirit Church on the city's South Side, one of several pastors who had urged Emanuel to reconsider the closings. "The mayor and his team did a wonderful job."

Chou said not one student was seriously injured along a Safe Passage route while guards were on duty last school year.

## Before And After School Is A Concern

Since school ended in the spring, the city has witnessed bursts of violence. Over the July Fourth weekend, for instance, 14 people were killed and dozens were injured. In one tragic incident, an 11-year-old girl inside a house at a slumber party was killed when a bullet fired outside at someone else pierced a wall and struck her in the head.

Some worry that the city is not doing enough to keep students from harm. High school students, in particular, go to and from school for clubs and other activities before or after the Safe Passage workers are on duty.

Last December, a 15-year-old girl who left her home before dawn to get to a school on the city's North Side was beaten and raped. She was less than a half block from a Safe Passage route.

"She had to get to school earlier than the Safe Passage (workers) were on duty," said state Representative LaShawn Ford, who noted that Safe Passage workers were not on the street at 6 a.m. Ford has pushed for their hours to be expanded this year. Guards start less than an hour before classes begin and stay up to an hour after school ends, according to Chicago Public Schools.

## It May Become More Political

There is also a political risk for Emanuel, who is up for his re-election for mayor next year. His most-talked-about potential rival, Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis, has criticized Emanuel for closing neighborhood schools and has dubbed him the "murder mayor" because of the city's violence.

Any violence that occurs on a student's walk to and from school could become fodder for Lewis — or any other opponent — to use against Emanuel. His popularity has fallen over the last year.
