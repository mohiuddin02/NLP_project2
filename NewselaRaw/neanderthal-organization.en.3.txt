Neanderthals are our closest human relatives. They became extinct when the last of them died out tens of thousands of years ago. They had a reputation for living like slobs. It was believed that they threw their stuff everywhere.

But now some scientists think that they were not such untidy creatures. There is reason to believe that they organized their dwelling based on tasks, just like modern humans do.

Not long ago archaeologists discovered new information about Neanderthals. They dug up evidence that our extinct relatives butchered animals, sharpened tools and started fires in different areas of their living space. Similar to how we cook in a kitchen and sleep in a bedroom.

The discovery was made at collapsed rock shelter in northwestern Italy.

## A Pretty Neat Cave

The archaeological site used to be home to both Neanderthals and humans. Researchers there focused on three levels of the cave that Neanderthals used roughly 45,000 years ago.

Julien Riel-Salvatore is a professor at the University of Colorado. He worked at the dig site in Italy.

He said that before seeing the site, researchers did not think that Neanderthals were organized. Experts believed that putting and keeping things in order has always been something that only humans were able to do.

Specifically, researchers found evidence of fire building, or hearths, toward the rear wall of the cave. Stone tools and chips were found outside the cave. Animal materials were also found outside the cave.

This may mean that Neanderthals wanted to keep certain activities separate from others. For example, they may have wanted to keep their sleeping space free from harmful waste or bad smells that involved animals. That might be why animal materials were found outside the cave instead of deep inside of it.

## What's With The Ochre?

Researchers cautioned that their conclusions were made on a very small part of the cave. They only studied a roughly 15-square-foot part of the site. They added that further work had to be done to prove their findings true.

Among other items researchers found at the site were shellfish remains. They also found large amounts of ochre. Found in the earth, ochre is a clay-like material.

Researchers said they were unsure what the ochre was used for. But they think that it may have been used during animal butchering.

Riel-Salvatore said that the ochre could have been used in several ways. Neanderthals could have used it on animals to make leather. It could have also been used as glue, cleaning material or even for symbolic purposes.

"We really can't tell at this point," Riel-Salvatore said.
