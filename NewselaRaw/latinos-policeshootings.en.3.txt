LOS ANGELES â€” Kris Ramirez grew up in Southeast Los Angeles. He says he never felt angry when police cars drove through his neighborhood.

"If someone is wearing a uniform," Ramirez said, "you show respect." He saw no reason to be afraid of police.

Then last October, a sheriff's deputy shot and killed his 28-year-old brother, Oscar Jr. The shooting happened in Paramount near some railroad tracks.

Earlier that day a 12-year-old girl said she saw two men carrying a knife and handgun. Deputies stopped Oscar because he looked like the men the girl described. Deputies say he ran when they tried to talk to him.

The deputies say that when they caught up with Oscar, he would not follow orders. They claim he moved his arm in "a threatening manner." It turned out that Ramirez did not have a knife or gun with him.

## Little Coverage, Attention For Oscar's Death

The Ramirez family does not believe the sheriff's deputies are telling the truth. They say Oscar was no danger to the police. They point out that four of the five bullets that killed him were in his back. He must have been trying to get away, not to attack the deputies.

The family protested in front of the Paramount police station. Most people did not pay attention.

The story was very different when Los Angeles police killed a black man shortly after. The man was named Ezell Ford. Newspapers covered the story and many people showed up to protest Ford's killing.

Seeing the difference made Kris Ramirez unhappy. "Why can't we get that same type of coverage or help?" he wondered.

## In Southern California, Many Officers Are Latino

Police killings of Latinos have not gotten nearly as much attention as police killings of blacks. Yet, such killings of Latinos are very common.

Twenty-three people were killed by Los Angeles police this year. Fourteen of them were Latino.

None of those deaths has been noticed much. There has been very little protest.

There are several reasons for this.

Latinos and blacks see the police differently. Over many years African-Americans have been mistreated by the police more than any other group. Latinos do not have that same long history. They are less likely to think police are at fault.

In Southern California, many police officers are Latinos themselves. Within the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), almost half the officers are Latino. Only around 1 in 10 are black.

Many Latinos in Los Angeles support the police. The same is not true for many blacks.

## Different Conversations For Latinos, Blacks

Latino parents talk to their children about the police differently than black parents do. Many black parents warn their children about the police. They tell them the police may harm them even if they have done nothing wrong. Latino parents do not usually give their children the same kinds of warnings.

"My message has always been don't get involved in anything bad," said parent Yolanda Dominguez. Staying out of trouble is the best way to avoid problems with the police, she said.

Dominguez said she thinks U.S. police are much better than Mexican police. Dominguez grew up in Mexico.

## Many Latinos Afraid To Speak Out

Lawyer Luis Carrillo says many Latinos are also afraid to speak out. In many Latin American countries, governments and police are very cruel. Protesting can get a person in serious trouble. People learn to mind their own business and say nothing.

The Ramirez family is still fighting. No matter what happens, they will never forget Oscar.

In June, Oscar's father planted a tree in his dead son's honor. He planted it on what would have been Oscar's birthday. The tree now grows near the train tracks where Oscar was killed.
