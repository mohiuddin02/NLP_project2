WASHINGTON — On March 23, star pianist Jan Lisiecki will leave his teen years behind. The Polish-Canadian classical musician may not know what gifts he'll be getting for his 20th birthday, but at least he can count on it being an exciting one. When his birthday milestone arrives, Lisiecki will be on a plane to Abu Dhabi, where he's scheduled to perform for the first time.

"We're going to get some warm weather, which is always nice when you live in Canada," Lisiecki said. He lives in Calgary with his parents, who will be traveling with him to Abu Dhabi.

## Magical Musical Birthday Tour

Lisiecki also will be going to Spain, and then finally to Washington, D.C., for a March 28 recital at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The Kennedy Center's online events calendar showed the recital is sold out.

On April 7, Lisiecki will return to the Kennedy Center to appear with the Philadelphia Orchestra, under the direction of conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin. He will be performing as a soloist in Edvard Grieg's "Piano Concerto in A Minor."

Lisiecki's birthday tour only adds to the accomplishments he has racked up in the past five years or so. When he was 15, Lisiecki signed an exclusive recording agreement with Deutsche Grammophon and started making appearances at prestigious venues all over the world. He has played with the New York Philharmonic and graced the BBC Proms. He even anchored a season-opening concert of Orchestre de Paris under conductor Paavo Järvi.

## Music Colors His World

Lisiecki juggles an intense schedule of performances and recordings. When he made his debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 2014, he performed a series of three Mozart concertos in one week.

Part of Lisiecki's success stems from the fact that he simply enjoys being at the piano. He describes it as a different world altogether, one of color and possibility.

"I think that also communicates to the audience," Lisiecki said.

## Honoring His Polish Heritage

Lisiecki's March 28 recital will include pieces from well-known composers like Bach and Mendelssohn. The program will also pay tribute to Lisiecki's Polish roots by including pieces by Ignacy Jan Paderewski. In addition to being a composer and pianist, Paderewski was the first prime minister of an independent Poland after World War I.

The recital will also include all 12 of the etudes in Chopin's "Opus 10." Lisiecki, who has recorded an album of Chopin etudes, is looking forward to giving his audience the rare opportunity to hear the etudes in order. Lisiecki thinks it will help them grasp the "overarching idea" that links the compositions.

"That gives the audience a different feeling — a special feeling — and really also demonstrates Chopin's genius."
