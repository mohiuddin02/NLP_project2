SACRAMENTO, Calif. â€” Most high school English teachers love William Shakespeare. The English author wrote plays and poems 400 years ago.

Dana Dusbiber, though, is not crazy about him.

This month, the California teacher wrote an essay on an education blog. Dusbiber explained she does not want to teach Shakespeare's plays, although they are taught in nearly every high school in America. His works do not have anything to say to her students who come from many different cultures, she said.

Her main problem is that Shakespeare was white and lived too long ago.

## Much Ado Online About Her Opinion

Dusbiber's opinion caught fire online and on radio and television. Many people strongly disagreed with her.

"High school teachers are supposed to love Shakespeare, and I don't, so I said I didn't," said Dusbiber, who teaches at Luther Burbank High School in Sacramento, California. Dusbiber said teachers rely too much on Shakespeare in the class. She finds this strange.

She said she has replaced Shakespeare's plays with works by authors who are not white. Dusbiber is white herself.

Nearly all of Burbank High School students are nonwhites. Also, about 4 out of 5 students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches because their families did not make enough money.

Dusbiber wanted to show nonwhite students that successful authors have different skin colors like theirs. Instead of Shakespeare, Dusbiber tells them to read authors from different backgrounds. These include Isabel Allende, who was born in Peru, Sharon Draper, an African-American, and Mexican-American Francisco Jimenez.

## Another Class Acts Out "Romeo And Juliet"

In her essay, Dusbiber spoke out against teaching Shakespeare. She said his view of the world would now be considered old-fashioned, and he wrote as a white man.

Dusbiber said it is bad to focus on one white man's view of life especially since he lived so long ago. By doing so, students may think that other cultures are less important.

A few miles away, Christine Baker teaches at Sacramento New Technology High School. Four out of 5 students at her school are not white.

Baker puts Shakespeare into modern English. Shakespeare wrote in the English of 400 years ago, which can be very difficult for people to understand today.

She said Shakespeare can be boring when read as a book instead of acted as a play. She still thinks his plays should still be taught in school, though.

Baker asked her students to act out part of his play "Romeo and Juliet." It is about two teenagers who fell in love, but their families hated each other and did not let them get married. Then, she told her students to read the play on their own.

"They get the feeling of fighting families, of young love," Baker said.

## Shakespeare Must Be Performed, Not Read

Dusbiber is not the first to suggest moving away from Shakespeare in the classroom. Mark Powell is the assistant director at Salisbury Playhouse in England. He wrote that Shakespeare's "words were chosen to be spoken or heard, not to be read." He said Shakespeare's plays need to be performed. They lose all life when they are just read.

Many people did not like Dusbiber's view. Most of the opposition came from traditional people who do not think the education system should change. A different view came from the magazine New Republic. It said it is important to teach Shakespeare so students understand how people thought in the past.

Ted Appel is the principal at Burbank High School, the school where Dusbiber teaches. He said Dusbiber wants to make sure teenagers learned about different viewpoints.

It is important to Dusbiber that students read many different kinds of books, Appel said. Her goal is to help students think about important questions and ideas.
