SAN ANTONIO, Texas â€” Thousands of families came to Texas from Mexico and Central America last summer. Crossing the border into America was against the law. The government opened two places for them to stay. The places are called detention centers. They are like jails. The people cannot leave unless the government lets them. The centers are in Texas.

Now the government is changing the rules. It is freeing mothers with children faster. They are getting ankle bracelets. The bracelets are electronic. They send a signal. The signal lets the government keep track of the people.

## Some Mothers And Children Won't Be Held

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a government group. Its shorter name is ICE. It is in charge of carrying out immigration laws. These laws say who can move to the United States to live. The group said some mothers with children would not be held in detention.

These mothers would have to fit certain rules. First, the women must explain why they could be punished in their home countries if they return home. Second, the women cannot be a threat in America or break the laws. Third, they cannot be people who would run away.

## Change Is Overdue

Jonathan Ryan runs a group that helps people in detention. He said ICE should have changed the rules a long time ago.

About six mothers were at a San Antonio bus station recently. They were there with their children. They wore ankle bracelets. The bracelets were big. They barely fit under the mother's jeans.

## Not Everyone Will Run Away

Linda Brandmiller is a lawyer. She said ankle bracelets are fair in some cases. They are not needed in others. Not all the mothers need one, she said. Not everyone will try to run away.

ICE said it looks at each case one by one. Then it will decide if the person needs to wear an ankle bracelet.
