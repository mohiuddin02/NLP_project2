PYRAMID LAKE, Nev. - Brian Dunn cast his fly line into the blue waters. He was fishing in a desert lake. Before long, a 6-pound, 25-inch-long cutthroat trout was splashing in his net. It had a yellow ID tag. This was no ordinary fish. Scientists once thought it was extinct. Dunn had caught a Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroat. It is the largest inland trout in North America.

The trout is shaped like a torpedo with orange cheeks and pink stripes. It can grow as large as salmon. Its comeback is a rare win for threatened and [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). That win was made possible by the a biologist working in one of the emptiest corners of the West.

## The Return Of The One That Got Away

The fish was brought back to Pyramid Lake in 2006. Now, people catch trout weighing more than 20 pounds. The biggest one ever found was a 41-pounder caught in 1925. That record could be broken someday soon. Last year, Lahontan cutthroats laid eggs in a nearby stream. That had not happened for more than 70 years.

"This is such an exciting story because this was such a unique fish," said Mary Peacock. She teaches at the University of Nevada. "You can see pictures from the early part of the 1900s with people holding really large trout out of Tahoe or Pyramid. We thought those fish were gone."

## A Lost Fish Is Found

By the 1920s and '30s, overfishing was hurting the fish's numbers, but there were still plenty. The killer blow was the construction of a dam south of the lake on the Truckee River. The dam sent large amounts of water to nearby farmers. Snowmelt that once gushed into Pyramid Lake each spring shrank sharply. The lake level dropped until, finally, trout no longer could reach the Truckee River to lay eggs.

"The last known run left the lake (in) 1938," Terry Hickman and Robert Behnke wrote in a report in 1979. "No water was available in later years and ... this magnificent trout was believed to be extinct." But they added in their report the possibility that some of the original Pyramid Lake cutthroat could be in some  unknown waters that are hard to reach.

Morrison Creek is very hard to reach. It is on the Nevada-Utah border. It tumbles 2 to 3 miles into the Great Salt Lake desert from Pilot Peak, That's where Don Duff caught a scrawny fry in the mid-1970s. Duff was a Utah state biologist at the time. He was searching for a different trout, the Bonneville cutthroat. But the fish he caught in the creek didn't look like a Bonneville. He sent samples to Behnke, the cutthroat expert. He examined the sample. Behnke said that the fish were Lahontan cutthroats from Pyramid Lake. But he couldn't prove it.

## Lahontan Life-Support

The fish's discovery did not guarantee its recovery. Fewer than 400 were thought to live in Morrison Creek. The government did not want to try breeding more. "It was something that everybody fought, that nobody would believe," said Bryce Nielson, a biologist. "Nobody really wanted to bother with it." But that wasn't good enough for Nielson. He began giving Lahontan life-support on his own. He built a small fish farm on a ranch owned by a fish-friendly landowner. Often, eggs didn't hatch. Those that did, didn't always survive. But he, the landowner, and another friend kept trying.

In 1995, the first eggs from Nielson's fish farm were shipped to the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery Complex. Now, hundreds of thousands of cutthroats from Pilot Peak are grown there. But did they really come from Pyramid Lake? Only a DNA test could say for sure. And with the old giants gone from the lake, where would the genetic material come from?

## Verifying Ancient DNA

The answer came in the 2000s. A Jurassic Park-like breakthrough gave researchers a way to take DNA from museum samples. Peacock found tissue samples from the original Pyramid Lake cutthroats in museums. She compared their DNA with the DNA of more than four dozen other Lahontan populations.

What she found rocked the fishing community. No DNA more closely matched the museum samples than the cutthroat from Pilot Peak. A lost legend had been found.
