LOS ANGELES â€” A new study is telling older people to just stand up and move around.

It's not enough for people to get regular exercise as they get older, the study found. Researchers say it's also important not to spend too much time sitting down.

In fact, for people over 60, every extra hour of sitting nearly doubles the risk of health problems.

This is true no matter how much exercise a person gets, concluded the researchers. The study was published Wednesday in the Journal of Physical Activity &amp; Health. Researchers came from four universities and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

## Get Up And Go

People who get up and do even 30 minutes of light activity can improve their health, researchers said. Stand-up bingo, anyone?

The researchers wrote that too much sitting was linked to problems like diabetes and heart disease.

Many people have followed federal health suggestions. The federal government told people to exercise 150 minutes a week to stay healthy. They thought that's all they needed to do.

Apparently not so.

Experts have thought that people spend too much time sitting because they don't exercise. The researchers wanted to see if sitting in itself causes health problems.

The researchers looked at information from 2,286 people 60 years of age and older. The information is from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The national surveys include physical exams and answers the people gave about their health and habits.

## Stop Sitting Still

The study found the people spent almost nine of their waking hours a day sitting down. This is out a total of 14 hours spent awake. A total of 3.6 percent of them reported problems in their activities of daily living. This included trouble getting in and out of bed, getting dressed and being able to walk in the house.

More than one in 10 of them said they had no long-lasting health conditions. But more than half reported arthritis, even more reported high blood pressure and about one-third of the people reported being very [overweight](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity). People who spent more time sitting down tended to be older, male, more educated and less wealthy. They also tended to smoke and be in bad health.

Sitting has been getting a lot of attention lately. There's even a new saying: "Sitting is the new smoking." The study's authors recommend that everyone sit less. They also specifically suggested that people exercise while watching TV and during work hours. Walking to meetings and standing at desks are other ways to be more active and reduce the amount of time sitting still.

"The real problem is that we are raising (inactive) children," said one of the researchers, Pamela Semanik. She is an assistant professor of nursing at Rush College of Nursing in Chicago. "It's so (common) in our culture."

At Rush, the results of the study convinced her coworkers to change their ways, she said. Semanik personally said she has sold her car and reads articles while walking on a treadmill.

The researchers said as many as 5.3 million deaths each year can be linked to too little activity.

## The Couch Question

So how much coach potato time is OK?

That's the big question, Semanik said. "We don't know how much is OK." She said researchers suspect that too much sitting can be made better when people take breaks to move around often.

Researchers say that the study is the first to look at whether sitting too much causes problems for people in their daily lives. There were limits to the research, though. The devices used to measure activity don't notice bicycling. They also can't worn for swimming. So if people swam or bicycled, those activities were not recorded.

The researchers are in favor of any program that gets people to get up and moving. This is because getting older adults off the couch may be easier than getting them to exercise. This is especially true in people who are in pain and suffer from illnesses, like heart disease.

The researchers are not saying there's no value in exercise. They say it's a cheap way to be healthier and reduce health care costs. But the study looked at very different questions, Semanik said: How people stay independent, out of nursing homes and able to care for themselves.

Even a lot of daily exercise may not offset the bad effect of too much time off their feet.
