BEIJING â€” On a recent day, Ma Jun, one of China's best-known environmental advocates, showed off his latest tool in the fight against his nation's air pollution: a computer app.

Displayed on a tablet, the app shows a map of northeastern China covered with large orange circles. Each one represents one of the country's major polluters, reporting its emissions in real time.

The data come from monitoring equipment the government has installed at about 10,000 plants around the country. Through the app, Ma and his co-workers at the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs have made that information available to millions of Chinese on their own computers, tablets and cellphones.

## "Enforcement Is Weak"

The app is part of an ambitious effort by environmentalists to use data and social media to influence public opinion. China, which is not a democracy, lacks more usual routes to social change, such as elections or an independent court system that would allow people to sue companies that pollute.

China has many laws against pollution, Ma said, but "enforcement is weak." The cost of polluting is too low for companies to feel the need to pollute less.

Many of the worst polluters are companies owned by the Chinese government or companies that have close ties to Chinese government officials.

Especially in smaller towns or regions, officials have a "lack of motivation" to pursue serious polluters, Ma said. Shining a spotlight on them "is one of the very few options we have" to make officials enforce the law, he said.

## Life Or Death Issue

Over the past several months, the app has been downloaded about 10,000 times.

Whether making data about emissions available to the public will be enough to get officials to make changes remains to be seen.

But for the Chinese, pollution is a life or death issue. A study published last year by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences indicated that air pollution, mainly from coal, reduces the average life span of the 500 million residents of northern China by 5 1/2 years.

A separate study conducted by researchers at two Chinese universities estimated that in 2012, burning coal led to 670,000 premature deaths in China. The early deaths were caused by diseases such as heart disease, stroke, emphysema and lung cancer. Emissions from Chinese factories can blow across the Pacific Ocean and on some days they can even account for up to a quarter of airborne pollutants in California.

The same pollution that blankets China's cities in stifling clouds makes the country the world's leading contributor to global warming, caused by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

## Cutting Down On Coal

Recently, Chinese President Xi Jinping struck an agreement with President Barack Obama. He pledged that over the next 15 years China would cap its emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas that gets released when coal and oil are burned. Scientists say carbon dioxide is the major cause of global warming. He also promised to make renewable energy like solar power, one-fifth of the nation's power supply by 2030.

Right now, coal provides about 70 percent of China's energy and accounts for at least half of its pollution and most of its carbon emissions, said Alvin Lin. He works at the Beijing office of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

After years of trying to suppress information about pollution, the government in recent years increasingly has admitted its extent. Until 2012, for example, no cities in China were allowed to publicly disclose the level of PM2.5, the tiny particles that cause the most damage to human lungs, Ma said. Now, 190 cities do.

## China's Costly Cleanup

A cleanup on the scale of what China needs, however, will be hugely expensive and time-consuming. To reduce electricity generated by burning coal, China plans to build nearly 60 new nuclear power stations. The country also will increase its imports of natural gas and expand its use of solar and wind power over the next couple of decades, officials say.

The country also will have to close down its oldest and dirtiest plants, such as steel mills and cement factories.

Many of those moves run up against powerful interests. Local and regional officials are still judged mostly on their ability to bring in money for China's government and are more interested in increasing factory production than reducing their emissions. Large companies still have influence over government policy.

Officials may have good reason to change, though. As recently as five years ago, the environment ranked relatively low among public concerns. Now, pollution routinely is among the top issues the Chinese worry about, said pollster Victor Yuan.

Translating that into pressure for clean air is where Ma's pollution app comes in.

## Political Will For Change

If the public understands exactly where the pollution is coming from, "it becomes risky for governors and mayors to interfere," Ma said. Since he began publicizing factory emission levels, about 200 major polluters have contacted his group to discuss their cleanup plans, he said.

Even in the best of circumstances, cleaning China's air to the level of international health standards would take decades. But, Ma said, a small number of plants contribute much of the pollution. Targeting them can bring about significant improvements much sooner.

Ma mentioned the blue skies at November's Asia-Pacific economic summit in Beijing as proof of what can be achieved. The Chinese government took extraordinary steps to clear the air, including shutting down polluting factories across the region and giving government workers days off to reduce traffic. The results showed "you don't need 30 years" to clear the air, Ma said, just the motivation to tackle the job.

Public unhappiness over pollution has now reached a level that the government cannot afford to ignore, Ma said. "The smog issue finally has created some real political will" for change.
