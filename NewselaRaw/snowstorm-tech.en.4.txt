WASHINGTON, D.C. — Many states are using technology to help keep roads safer this winter. They use things like iPhones to take pictures of roads during storms. The pictures show snow and ice on the roads. Other devices tell what temperature a road is. Some technology shows where snowplows are.

Rich Roman works for the state of Pennsylvania. He is in charge of keeping the roads clear. Roman said technology has changed how winter roads are cleared. The inside of a plow truck has many buttons now. It has a radio, too. It almost looks like where an airplane pilot sits, Roman said.

Rick Nelson works for a group of state highway departments. He said states are spending more money on technology. They want to make sure people can get where they need to go.

## Keeping Roads Clear Is Costly

People in the U.S. need to be able to drive around, he said. It does not matter what the weather is.

Nelson's group studied 23 states. It looked at the money the states spent to keep roads clear in the winter. The states spent about $1.13 billion last winter. Some states spent much of their yearly money during the winter. New Hampshire spent more than half its road money.

Many states use sensors in the road. The sensors measure the road's temperature. They can tell if the road is wet or dry. That helps the states decide when to use more chemicals. Or they could use less. The chemicals melt the ice. The chemicals can be be bad for the land and animals in some areas. Technology helps states use only what they need.

## Technology Saves Lives

Some states use special equipment on plow trucks. The equipment shows where the trucks are. A few also use the equipment  to track weather. It can also show road conditions. The trackers also show how much salt is being used. This information gives bosses a better idea of how materials are being used. They can also keep track of how long people are working on the roads.  The technology can save time and money.

Winter driving can be dangerous. About 1,500 people a year are killed in winter crashes, said Paul Pisano. He works for the U.S. government. The crashes happened in snow, sleet or ice. Pisano said the new technology helps make roads safer.
