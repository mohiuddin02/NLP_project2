NEW YORK â€” First lady Michelle Obama supports healthy living for kids. Many American children have too much body fat. Being overweight can cause health problems. Obama has been speaking out to help kids become healthier.

On Thursday, she went to New York. She attended an event organized by a group called the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The foundation made an announcement. It said it will give $500 million to help American children grow up at a healthy weight.

Obama gave a speech at the event, which was held at Edward A. Reynolds West Side High School. She praised the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and asked parents to help as well.

She said she wanted parents to "dive in" to help kids grow up at a healthy weight.

## Changing Habits

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation named three things that families can do. First, parents should keep sugary drinks away from children younger than 5 years. Second, they should make sure their kids exercise instead of just watching television. Third, parents should make sure their children are at a healthy weight when they start school.

Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey is in charge of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. She said families can help their their kids be healthier, even if they have to change some habits.

Changing habits is not always easy, but it is not impossible. Lavizzo-Mourey said Americans have changed their habits before. Smoking used to be more popular than it is today. Many people stopped smoking after scientists showed how dangerous it is.

Lavizzo-Mourey said that eating and exercise habits can change, too.

## Some Other Changes

Five years ago, Obama began a program called "Let's Move!" It tries to get kids to exercise more so they don't get overweight.

In some ways, the health of American children has gotten better. Obama said that the number of very overweight kids has stopped going up. In some age groups, the number has even gone down.

There have been other changes. Some fast-food restaurants have started putting apples and skim milk in their kids' meals. Food at the supermarket now has more information on the packages. This makes it clearer how healthy the food actually is.

School lunches across America have also become healthier.

Obama said things have gotten better. But more work needs to be done. The nation "can't afford" to slow down, she said. Americans have to keep working to help kids be healthy.
