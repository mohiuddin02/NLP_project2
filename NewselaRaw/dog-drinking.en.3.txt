Dogs are messy drinkers. If you give a thirsty dog a bowl of water, a lot will probably be spilled on the floor. Now, scientists know more about why dogs drink the way they do.

Drinking water is a basic behavior for many animals. Still, how animals drink is a mystery to scientists. At a meeting in San Francisco, scientists presented research on how dogs and cats drink.

Sunghwan Jung is a scientist at Virginia Tech University. He said that different animals drink water in different ways.

## Cats Are Careful Drinkers

One way animals drink is by sucking water. This way is called suction. Humans use suction. We use our cheeks to suck up liquid to drink. The cheeks create a vacuum inside our mouths. Suction is what lets us drink water through a cup or straw.

Not all animals use suction. Some animals, like wolves and lions, cannot suck up liquid. Their lips do not close all the way to create suction. They have to use their tongues to drink water.

These animals use their tongues like a spoon. It might not seem that a spoon is better than a vacuum to drink water. However, some animals that drink with their tongues can do it efficiently.

Cats use their tongues to drink. They have a special way of drinking. They stick out their tongues in the shape of the letter J. They touch the top of the water with their tongue. Then they bring their tongue close to their mouth. When they bring their tongue up, water comes up too. The cats close their mouths over the water when it it comes up high enough.

## Dogs Just Like Water More

Scientists are also learning more about how dogs drink water. They used a video camera and taped how dogs get water into their mouths. They even made fake dog tongues out of glass. They put the tubes into the water just like a dog puts it tongue into the water when it drinks.

Cats and dogs drink water in different ways. When dogs drink, they stick out more of their tongues. They touch more water because more of the tongue is out of the mouth. Their tongues also move very fast when they scoop water up to the mouth. Cats just touch a little bit of the water. A dog uses more of its tongue and sticks it deeper into the liquid.

There are some differences between how dogs and cats drink. Still, there is one thing they do the same. Dogs and cats close their mouths around the water at the same time. When they flick up water, it quickly falls down. Dogs and cats close their mouths around the water before it falls. This allows them to capture more water for drinking.

Scientists are continuing to study how animals drink water. One question is why cats are neat drinkers and dogs are messy drinkers. Perhaps it is because dogs like water more than cats do, Jung said.
