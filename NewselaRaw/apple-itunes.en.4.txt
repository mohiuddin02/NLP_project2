Apple wants its iTunes store to get new music first.

Apple is worried that people are streaming music instead of downloading it through iTunes. This is costing the tech giant a lot of money. Apple is pushing record companies to release their new music through iTunes. Only later could other streaming services, like Spotify, stream it.

Music business insiders gave the information. They did not want their names used.

The music market is changing. And Apple is struggling to battle with the streaming services. It wants people to download music from iTunes, not stream it over the Internet. Apple is based in Cupertino, Calif.

## iTunes Downloads Drop

"These are really changing times. And I think everybody's going to be trying different things, whether it's iTunes, Spotify" or the music companies, said Irving Azoff. He manages the Eagles and Christina Aguilera. He also manages other music acts. "It's kind of up for grabs."

Most people in the U.S. who pay to download music to their phones and computers do it through Apple's iTunes store. They can listen to the music anytime they want. The iTunes store grew for about 10 years. But in 2013, its sales began to drop. Apple started making less money.

There are several reasons behind the drop in sales. But, the popularity of streaming services is the main one.

Smartphones are how people listen to music on the go today. Almost half of smartphone owners use their phone every day to stream music. Fewer people use their phones for downloading music.

Apple makes more smartphones than any one company. And iTunes is the world's biggest music seller. But Apple only makes the iPhone. More people in the U.S. own Android phones. They're made by several companies. Android phones don't come with the iTunes app.

An Apple spokesman would not comment for this report.

## Beyonce's Fast-Selling iTunes Release

"I've never had anyone (at Apple) say 'streaming is killing our business,'" said Jim Guerinot. He is a music manager. His company handles No Doubt, Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) and other acts. Guerinot said Apple wants to offer customers something that no other company has.

Apple has pointed to the sales of Beyonce's fifth album in December. The album was offered only through iTunes. It became iTunes' fastest-selling album.

Few artists are as popular as Beyonce. But Apple says her album is a good example. It shows how releasing music first on iTunes increases sales.

But Beyonce's album also angered Target and Amazon.com. Both refused to sell the CD when it was released.

More recently, hip-hop artist Kid Cudi's release, "Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon," was sold only through iTunes and other download websites. It launched last week at No. 4 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts. The album sold 87,000 units.

## Taking A Bite Out Of Apple Sales

But, rapper Schoolboy Q used streaming to let people know about his new album. "Oxymoron" was heavily promoted on Spotify. U.S. Spotify streamed songs from the album 3.3 million times before it came out.

The album began at the top of Billboard's album chart last week.

It sold nearly 139,000 copies in the first week the album was released. Two of the rapper's earlier albums sold just 17,000 and 48,000 copies.  They are "Setbacks" and "Habits &amp; Contradictions."

Ken Parks helps run Spotify. He said Apple shouldn't tell people how to listen to music. People don't like it, he said.

Mark Mulligan is a music business expert. He said streaming services may be taking away Apple's best iTunes customers.

"It's not that streaming is replacing downloads," Mulligan said. Streaming companies are going after Apple's download customers who spend the most.
