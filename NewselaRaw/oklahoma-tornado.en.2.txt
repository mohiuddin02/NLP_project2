A huge tornado whipped through Oklahoma Monday. The 200 mile-per-hour winds flattened neighborhoods. Frantic residents searched in the rubble for missing loved ones. At least 24 people were killed, including many children.

The twister's path stretched for 20 miles. It cut through Moore, a city south of the state capital.

The tornado will go down in state history as one of the deadliest. Two elementary schools were destroyed, making it an even more heartbreaking disaster. Rescue crews sifted through the wreckage at Plaza Towers Elementary School.  There were 75 students and staff in the building when the storm struck.

News helicopters were banned from flying over the ruins of the school, CNN reported. Rescuers feared engine noise would make it hard to hear cries for help. They raced against the setting sun to search the area while they could still see.

The other school rocked by the tornado was Briarwood Elementary School in Oklahoma City. News reports said the twister shot cars through the front of the building.

## "Horses And Stuff Flying Everywhere"

Oklahoma often has tornadoes. But even lifelong residents were shocked by the size and power of Monday's storm. Some compared it to some tornadoes that struck Moore in May 1999. One twister had winds of 345 miles per hour, the fastest ever recorded at the surface of the Earth. Forty-eight people died.

"It was just like the movie 'Twister'," Lando Hite told a reporter from television station KFOR. "There were horses and stuff flying around everywhere," he said. Hite was standing with no shirt and covered in mud.

The tornado began at 3 p.m. and lasted for 40 minutes. The timing could not have been worse since family members were separated between home, school and work. Fallen trees, furniture and other debris blocked roads. Then came traffic jams as drivers rushed to find loved ones.

## "As Serious As It Gets"

The National Weather Service put out a tornado warning 16 minutes before the twister struck. Roads were packed as motorists tried to flee the area.

At 3:01 p.m. the National Weather Service posted on Facebook: "TORNADO EMERGENCY FOR THE (Oklahoma City) METRO AREA. Large violent deadly tornado moving toward Moore! Take cover RIGHT NOW DO NOT WAIT!!" At 3:03 it wrote on Twitter: "This is as serious as it gets for (Southwest Oklahoma City) and Moore. Please seek shelter now!"

In southwest Oklahoma City, the overpowering winds flipped cars and dropped them onto roofs.

A CNN reporter said people who survived the storm risked their lives climbing through the shaky wreckage. They were looking for belongings. Police warned that there was risk of fire from power lines that had fallen. The National Weather Service said more storms were likely. Hail as big as tennis balls fell on the region. The deadly weather extended as far as parts of Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas.

Tornados are rated on the Fujita scale from 1 to 5, with F5 being the worst. Monday's storm was rated an F5 because it caused death and injuries.

## State Of Emergency

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin called out the National Guard to help. She declared a state of emergency in 21 counties.

"We are looking under every single piece of debris" for the missing, Fallin said. "Our hearts are broken for the parents that are wondering about the state of their children that had been in the schools that have been hit today," Fallin said.  "I know that there are families wondering where their loved ones are."

President Barack Obama called Fallin and told her the people of Oklahoma were in his and the first lady's prayers.
