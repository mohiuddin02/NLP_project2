Young people love the Internet. Teens spend hours every week watching online videos. They go to websites like YouTube to watch short videos made by regular people.

Some videos are watched millions of times. They reach people all over the world. A few of the people making them have even become famous. For young people, online videos have become as popular as movies and TV.

## Teens Watching More Videos Than TV

Defy Media is a company that is interested in teen habits. Defy wanted to understand what teens like to watch and listen to. So the company did a study. It wanted to find out why Internet videos have become so popular.

Defy studied about 1,350 people between 13 and 24 years old. It asked these young people a number of questions about online videos. Defy wanted to know why young people watched what they did.

The Defy study showed that teens watch a lot of online videos. On average, teens watch more than 22 hours of online video every week. That is nearly twice as much time as they spend watching TV.

The study tried to figure out why online videos are so popular with teens. One reason might have to do with who makes online videos. Those are usually made by regular people, not experts. Many videos are actually done by teens.

## Behind The Scenes

Lots of people enjoy seeing people like themselves. It can be exciting to see a famous person and be able to think, "He's just like me!"

Andy Tu works at Defy Media. He mentioned another reason that teens like online videos. Teens can see who made online videos.

Many people work on a TV show or movie. Hundreds of people work on movies, for example. Writers come up with what the actors will say. Costume designers decide what the actors will wear. The director says where to put the camera, and a team of editors put the scenes together into a finished movie. All of this work takes place behind the scenes. Viewers only see the actors. They cannot see all of the other people who worked on the movie.

Online videos are simpler. An online video is usually made by a single person. Often, people just record themselves on their computers or phones. So, viewers can see who made these videos. Watching the videos might feel like hanging out with friends.

## How Did Nicki Minaj Get In The Study?

Teens feel that they have a lot in common with the people making online videos. One teen who was part of Defy's study said that she loved singer Nicki Minaj. However, she and Minaj had little in common.

According to Tu, the teenager said: "Nicki Minaj is all about making money." The teen's life was very different from Minaj's.

Some teens look up to YouTube stars. They can even imagine themselves making popular online videos, too. When asked if they could be a YouTube star, more than half of those surveyed said yes. Then they were asked about being a TV or movie star, fewer than half said yes.

## Becoming Even More Popular

Defy's study shows that teens enjoy online videos for several reasons. Meanwhile, these videos keep getting more popular.

Tu that said he was walking around a shopping center in Los Angeles last weekend. He spotted an event that featured famous online video makers. The young people at the shopping mall were excited. The older people just looked confused.

For now, online videos are most popular with teens. Tu thinks that they will eventually become popular with everyone.
