WASHINGTON â€” On Friday, first lady Michelle Obama spoke at an event marking Black History Month. She said the most important thing for blacks today is getting a good education.

Obama was joined by a group of women who took part in the civil rights movement, which fought to give equal rights to black Americans. The women, Obama said, represent many different sides of the movement. Still, as different as they are, "there is something that connects each of their stories," she said. What they all share in common is a "hunger for and belief in the power of education."

## They Overcame Challenges

Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Carlotta Walls LaNier were among the women who joined the first lady at the event. Both had to fight hard to receive an education. During the 1960s, Hunter-Gault was one of the first black students to attend the previously whites-only University of Georgia. During the 1950s, LaNier was the youngest member of the Little Rock Nine, a group of black high school students barred from entering Arkansas' Little Rock Central High School. At the time, Little Rock only admitted whites. LaNier eventually became the first black female to graduate from the school.

LaNier and Hunter-Gault often faced physical resistance while attempting to receive an education. Both women were able to overcome the challenges even after people tried to stop them.

Obama said that while times have changed, problems still remain. Mobs with bricks and bottles no longer keep young black women from attending college. In the past, some white people used violence to keep black students from getting an education.

Yet even today, many black students find it difficult to get a good education.

"Nobody needs a military escort to get to class. But that doesn't mean that our children don't still face struggles when it comes to education," she said.

## Everyone Has Potential

The high school graduation rate for black students is on the rise. However, a smaller fraction of black students graduates from high school than white, Hispanic or Asian students.

Because of that, Obama urged the young black women who attended the event to go to school no matter what. Get yourself an education, she said, even if it means attending "bad" schools with crumbling buildings and outdated technology. She insisted that if children fall behind in school, they fall behind in life.

"We simply cannot afford to lose out on the potential of even one young person," she said. "We cannot allow even one more young person to fall through the cracks."

Education, she said, is key. It is all-important when it comes to solving problems such as high rates of imprisonment, poverty and racial profiling.

Obama herself is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. She heads the program Reach Higher, an effort to boost the desire for college education in high schoolers.

## Turning The Key

Friday's event was co-hosted by Essence magazine, a magazine for African-American women. Only a few days earlier, the magazine released its first issue in 45 years without a photo on the cover. Instead of an image, the cover features the words, "BLACK LIVES MATTER."

Essence Editor-in-Chief Vanessa K. DeLuca led Friday's panel discussion. Its theme was the continuing importance of education.

"Education is still the key to success," said LaNier. "You need all the education you can possibly get."
