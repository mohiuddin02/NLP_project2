Mattel is the toy company that makes Barbie dolls. They are working on a new doll called Hello Barbie that works with the Internet. Mattel held a demonstration to show everyone how the project is going. The presenter greeted the doll by saying, "Welcome to New York, Barbie."

Thanks to voice-recognition technology, Hello Barbie was able to understand what the presenter said. The doll then gave a response that made sense: "I love New York! Don't you? Tell me, what's your favorite part about the city? The food, fashion or the sights?"

Mattel thinks the doll will be a big hit with children because of how it interacts with them. Hello Barbie will also learn about its users as they play.

## Secrets May Not Be Safe With Barbie

During the demonstration, the presenter told Hello Barbie that she liked being onstage. Later in the conversation, she asked the doll what she should be when she grows up, and Hello Barbie responded: "Well, you told me you like being onstage. So maybe a dancer? Or a politician?"

Mattel says the high-tech doll can actually learn about what its users like. It can change questions around to be more personal. It can make children feel like Hello Barbie is really getting to know them.

Children might think Hello Barbie is "cool," but many parents say it is "creepy." The doll has a microphone that records children's speech. Then it sends the recording over the Internet. Computers listen to the recording and tell Barbie what to say back to each child.

Children's rights groups across the nation are calling for Mattel to stop making Hello Barbie. They don't like how the doll listens in on children. They say the company should leave children and their secrets alone.

## Who Are Kids Really Talking To?

Georgetown University's Angela Campbell is uncomfortable with Mattel's plan. She says they are not being very clear about what they are doing with the information they collect.

Susan Linn does not like Mattel's plan, either. Linn runs the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. She says that kids using Hello Barbie are not just talking to a doll. They are talking to a toy company that only cares about making money off of them. Linn thinks Hello Barbie might be giving children hidden advertising messages.

Mattel has been working with a partner for the Hello Barbie project. A company called ToyTalk created the technology in the doll. Both companies say that they are committed to safety and privacy. They say the new doll follows all of the government's laws about children and the Internet.

## Listening In Is Weird

Oren Jacob is in charge of ToyTalk. He says they have been careful to make sure that strangers never hear any of the stored recordings. He says the recordings will only be used to help ToyTalk make Hello Barbie's questions and answers even better. Jacob says Hello Barbie will never be used to tell children about other Mattel products or movies.

ToyTalk also helps parents keep an eye on what their children are sharing. They can sign up to receive emails containing links to their children's conversations with Hello Barbie. That way, parents can hear all of the same recordings ToyTalk hears.

Linn says that does not help. She does not want parents to be able to listen in on children, either. "When children have conversations with dolls and stuffed animals, they're playing, and they (share) a lot about themselves," she said.

But ToyTalk says that giving parents this information is part of obeying the law. "We want to make sure parents are in control of their family's (information)," Jacob said.

The problems with Hello Barbie show how tough things have become for toymakers. Companies need to make money, so they hurry to invent the high-tech toys kids love. But parents are the ones who buy the toys, so companies must make sure they think the new designs are safe for kids. Finding the right balance can be tricky.
