FERGUSON, Mo. â€” A white police officer who killed a black 18-year-old will not be arrested. Michael Brown was a teenager who was shot by officer Darren Wilson. His death sparked weeks of protests.

Some of the protests became violent and people wanted justice.

The shooting of Brown happened on Aug. 9 in the mostly black St. Louis suburb that is patrolled by a mostly white team of police officers.

Brown's body lay for hours in the center of a street and an angry crowd of onlookers gathered. People protested and broke into shops the next night while police responded with armored vehicles and tear gas.

Protests continued for weeks. They were often peaceful, but sometimes turned violent. Demonstrators sometimes threw rocks and handmade explosives. Police fired smoke canisters, tear gas and shot rubber bullets.

## The Grand Jury

A group of people, called a grand jury, met to listen to witnesses and hear the facts about what happened to Brown. The jury met for 70 hours and listened to 60 people who saw the shooting.

They decided not to charge Wilson with killing Brown.

Bob McCulloch, who brought the case to the grand jury, announced the decision Monday evening. The jury had 12 members. Nine of the members were white and three of them were black. They had been meeting weekly since August to listen to witnesses and look at the evidence.

McCulloch said that the people on the jury were "the only people who heard every witness ... and every piece of evidence." He said many witnesses said things that in the end did not match the evidence.

A crowd gathered around a car to listen to McCulloch's statement on the radio. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, was there. When the decision was announced, she burst into tears and began screaming before being taken away by supporters.

The crowd exploded in anger and moved toward the barrier where police in riot gear were standing. They pushed down the barrier and began throwing things at the police while the officers stood their ground.

## "Make A Positive Change"

Of the 12 people on the jury, at least nine of the members would have needed to vote that Wilson should be charged with a crime. If they voted that way, there would be another court case. The case would decide whether or not Wilson acted wrongly when he shot Brown. They voted that he would not be charged.

Brown's family released a statement. They said they were very disappointed in the decision and understood how frustrated people are. They asked people to act "in ways that will make a positive change."

Government investigators will look into the Brown case. They want to know if he was treated worse because he was black. If they find that police acted wrongly, more police may have to go to court. The government is also looking into the Ferguson Police Department. It is trying to see if the department often treats black people unfairly.
