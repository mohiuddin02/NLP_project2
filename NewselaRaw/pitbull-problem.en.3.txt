CHICAGO — At Chicago's main animal shelter, a pit bull mix wags his tail and licks a visitor's hand to make a friend. In the next cage, a pit bull snarls and shows his teeth. Nearby, another pit bull barks nonstop.

Pit bulls make up more than one-third of the dogs that come into Chicago Animal Care and Control. And they make up about two-thirds of the dogs that get euthanized. Animals are euthanized, or put to death, in a quick and peaceful way. They are usually given drugs that put them to sleep. Dogs at shelters get euthanized if no one adopts them.

This makes it even sadder, because the shelters are full of pit bulls.

The problem is simple. People keep breeding pit bulls for money, and owners can't or won't handle them. So, they end up being abused, neglected or put to sleep.

## Broad Heads And Jaws

Pit bulls are not a breed but a general term for a group of dogs. They include American pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers and various mixes. They're known for their strong builds, and large, broad heads and jaws. Some love them for their sweetness and loyalty. But others fear them.

The number of impounded and euthanized pets has declined. It's happened because so many have been adopted. Another reason is that many have been sterilized so that they can't have babies.

It has been a great success in animal care, but not for pit bulls. Their numbers have been growing at shelters. In Chicago, the number of animals put down each year dropped by more than half.  But the number of pits bulls put to sleep has risen.

What happens to the dogs depends on how they are treated by humans. But people do not agree about what to do with them.

## Blamed For The Most Dog Bites

For those looking to own a pet, pit bulls are everywhere. They're for sale on eBay for up to $1,000 each, at pet stores, in parking lots. They're even at Chicago hockey games. One day, Chicago's animal control website showed 41 dogs up for adoption. Twenty-eight of them were pit bulls.

In Chicago, pit bull mixes are blamed for the most dog bites — by far. Some owners have to give up the dogs after they bite someone. In other cases, owners say they lost their home or lost a job and can't afford them. Pit bulls are not allowed in many apartments.

Sgt. Mark George, head of the Chicago police animal crimes unit, said there is not as much dogfighting as in 2007, when NFL star Michael Vick was sentenced to prison for it. But it still goes on. Some people get the dogs for protection in dangerous neighborhoods, he said. But bad people get them too.

Susan Elliot runs an animal shelter. She says the breed is popular with "thugs" who often mistreat them. Rescuers also fall in love with them. About half the dogs the shelter gets are strays; others are given away by their owners.

"The problem is, people don't want them after they're a year old," Elliot said.  She said they're not as cute then, and people find that taking care of dogs is a lot of work. They get lazy and they complain the dog wants to play too much.

"They're wonderful dogs in the right hands," she said.
