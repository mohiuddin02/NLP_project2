Black people shopping in expensive stores are often treated badly. But recently a black teenager got more than that â€“ he also got handcuffed. The 19-year-old says all he did was buy an expensive belt.

Trayon Christian said he was wrongly arrested after buying a $350 belt at a shop in Manhattan. This was a familiar story to African-Americans. Many are used to finding that their money is not as good as everyone else's. Shopping while black, they say, can be an upsetting experience.

This has happened many times over the years. Oprah Winfrey once complained that a clerk did not think she could afford a $38,000 handbag. Even President Barack Obama has said he was once followed in stores.

But many people don't recognize how common this unfair treatment is. People also don't realize how the constant small insults can add up to a big problem.

## Shopping While Black

Natasha Eubanks said: "Don't ever tell me it doesn't happen to me." Eubanks runs a gossip website. She often shops at expensive stores in New York. "You can't assume it doesn't happen just because it doesn't happen to you," Eubanks said.

She said that sometimes it takes clerks more than five minutes to speak to her. If you're black and looking at expensive things the assistants often ask lots of questions. They want to know what you're doing in the store and what you do for a living. Eubanks said this has happened to her at least 20 times in New York.

Trayon Christian's problem was not how he was treated when he went into Barneys New York, a store that sells expensive clothes. It was what happened after he left the store. The 19-year-old said that he bought an expensive belt at the shop. When he left, he was stopped by undercover police officers.

Christian said the police told him he "could not afford" the belt. He claims he was arrested unfairly. Two other young black people also said they were badly treated in New York stores.

Yvonne Chan once worked in a shop in a mostly white Massachusetts town. Every few months someone would be caught stealing, and about half the time it was a black person.

Chan said she always tried not to judge people on the color of their skin. But the student admitted that she found herself watching black people more carefully.

Chan added that she wanted to consider everybody equally. But she said she did end up thinking of groups of people differently due to her experiences. Chan said that this changed her view of people as individuals.

## Black Customers Closely Watched

Jerome Williams is a business professor at Rutgers University. He says viewing people unfairly changes which people are arrested.

Some people say black customers are more likely to steal. They say because of this, it is OK to watch them more closely. But one study showed that white women in their 40s did more stealing than other groups.

Williams explained that white women don't show up in crime figures because they are not always caught. Clerks don't watch white women as closely as they watch black customers.

Black college student Dido Kanyandekwe knows when he is being watched. But the 18-year-old said that when he sees staff looking at him he jokes with them. Kanyandekwe says "Hello, I see you" to store guards. Or he just waves at them. The student was in Barneys on Monday buying a $600 pair of sneakers.

"Most black people don't have the money to buy stuff at Barneys," said Kanyandekwe. He is the son of rich parents. "But that does not mean all black people are not able to buy these things."

## Discrimination Can Hit Anyone

Black people are not the only ones who face unequal treatment. Hispanic shoppers say they experience the same thing. And Sher Graham is a white woman who lives in Alabama. She said black servers in fast-food restaurants often wait on black customers first. But the experience is most common for African-Americans.

Candace Witherspoon lives in Los Angeles. She went to a store to buy a purse recently. She said the sales assistant barely greeted her. Then ignored her. Witherspoon saw that white customers in the store were treated differently.

Witherspoon said that when the other customers left, the assistant said "Thanks ladies for shopping. Have a good day." But she said that when she left, the clerk gave her a nasty look and didn't say anything.

Toni Duclottni runs a fashion website in Los Angeles. She went to a department store and wanted to spend about $4,000 on shoes. But she spent the money in another store when after she got ignored.

Duclottni said that the solution to this problem is simple. She thinks the shop assistants should just behave differently. "They rush to judgment without speaking to a person," she said. "They would be surprised if they just walked up and said, "Hello, can I help you find something?'"
