HORSE MOUNTAIN, Utah — Standing atop a rocky ridgeline near his base camp at dawn, Scott Richardson is a solitary figure in the slanting light. He surveys a primordial wilderness of dry creek beds and stands of juniper and pinyon pine.

"This is dinosaur country," he says, gesturing toward the valley below. "There are bones all over this place."

The 58-year-old is an Arizona native, dressed in a wide-brimmed hat and white clothes for protection from the sun. He walks past darting lizards as he follows a closed road left to return to its natural state.

Just off the path, an object catches his eye. An odd, almost oval shape pokes from the dirt, and he quickly determines it's a 75-million-year-old hadrosaur vertebra. The fossil is caked with dirt, and it looks like any other rock. But not to Richardson: He's seen numerous similarly shaped bones and recognizes the object's size and heft.

He drags his fingers over the fragment and explains that it came from the top of the creature's spine, near its neck. "This is what it's all about," he says. "If you brushed around and dug some holes, you might find other bones going into the ground. There might be a whole animal here."

## Prospecting For Prehistoric Bones

Richardson is a dinosaur finder, a bone prospector on the hunt for ancient predators and their prey.

Six months each year, from March to September, he works as a paleontologist technician for the federal Bureau of Land Management.

He ranges across the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and helps dig bone quarries. He pieces together fragments in a lab — puzzles with no images to guide him.

Most of the time, he trudges among the scrub brush, always watching, searching for a hint — a different color, feel or shape — that suggests a dinosaur's grave might lie somewhere beneath.

Richardson, the son of two teachers, grew up in Phoenix. He learned his love of the desert hunt when his father took him scrounging for Native American arrowheads.

He was trained as a geologist and went to work in the mining industry. He left the job when his father died in the 1980s, and spent the next 10 years wandering and hiking the West.

He ended up volunteering at a natural history museum in the Flagstaff, Arizona, area. His position eventually led him to Utah and his present paying job. For 12 years, he has bushwhacked across southern Utah, scouting out remnants of the distant past.

## Uncovering, And Discovering

"These were colossal creatures that ruled the planet for millions of years," Richardson says, standing in his lab in nearby Kanab. He holds a 5-foot-long hadrosaur femur, which looks like a bone from an old "Flintstones" cartoon. "To expose bones that haven't seen the light of the sun for 80 million years is just pretty incredible."

The 1-million-square-acre Kaiparowits Plateau, part of the national monument, contains a trove of bones from the Cretaceous period, which lasted from 144 million to 65 million years ago. This part of southern Utah back then was lush forest. It was the coast of the lost continent Laramidia when a vast sea split present-day North America.

"It wasn't exactly a fun time to be around," Richardson says. "Temperatures were over 100 degrees, with 90 percent humidity. Aside from the predators, there were bugs, insects and worms, all of them with sharp teeth that were trying to eat you. Even the birds had teeth."

Rugged and isolated, unmapped by the U.S. Geological Survey until half a century ago, the Kaiparowits is virtually untouched by paleontologists. Scientists in the last decade have unearthed as many as 20 new dinosaur species.

They also discovered a 90-million-year-old shark with grinding teeth, sheaths of petrified dinosaur skin, a horned skull the size of a small elephant, crocodiles that swam and chased prey on land, and 2-foot-tall creatures with razor claws that ran in deadly packs like velociraptors.

Walking hundreds of miles a year, Richardson has uncovered four new species of dinosaur, including the only full head and spine of a Kosmoceratops. He found a member of the armored ankylosaur family; a Lythronax, an ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex; and an unknown species of a duck-billed dinosaur.

"Scott is persistent; he's spent more time out there than almost anyone," says Mike Getty, chief preparator of paleontology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, who also has surveyed the area. "His success is a mix of his on-site training and doggedness."

## His First Find Fondly Remembered

Richardson recalls his first big dinosaur find as a parent would the birth of a first child. The year was 2006, and just after a thrashing rain Richardson spied weathered bones in the dirt while hiking along a narrow ridgeline a few miles north of his current campsite.

Dropping his 40-pound pack loaded with excavation tools, he began carefully digging: "Pretty soon, I'd dug so many holes the place looked like a prairie dog mound." His heart raced with excitement and he sensed he had found something truly remarkable.

He approached a paleontology team nearby and asked the experts to inspect his find. They told him the bones were nothing special — and then broke into grins. The site was huge: a full skull of an unknown cousin of the triceratops.

"We could tell it was a brand-new skull," Getty says. "It's not often you see a specimen with that many features preserved. It was clearly something unlike anything else ever found."

The creature, labeled "the horniest dinosaur," with a record-breaking 15 horns jutting from its skull, was eventually named Kosmoceratops richardsoni. Richardson's friends began calling him "Scottosaurus."

"That's when I knew I'd arrived," he says. "There's a photo of me with the skull, grinning ear to ear like a proud daddy."
