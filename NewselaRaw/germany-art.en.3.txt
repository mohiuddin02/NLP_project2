LONDON â€“ Famous works of art have been discovered in an old man's home in Germany. They were thought to have been destroyed or lost in World War II. But, police discovered them when they entered the man's home and found the masterpieces in a room surrounded by canned food.

What they found was astonishing: paintings by Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso), Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse and Paul Klee. They found 1,406 works of art in all. The art is believed to be worth at least $1.3 billion. Some or all of the art was thought to have been stolen by the Nazis more than 70 years ago. That would make it one of the largest collections of art recovered since World War II.

The elderly man was first noticed by police in 2010 while traveling on a train from Switzerland to Germany. He had almost $12,000 on him. That amount of money is just below the limit of how much people are allowed to bring into Germany. He appeared nervous when he was questioned. The police felt that something was not right.

Later, they raided the apartment in Munich where the man lived, rarely going outside. His name is Cornelius Gurlitt, 80. His father was an art seller during World War II. Cornelius got the art from him.

## An Astounding Amount Of Art

The stunning find was reported Sunday by the German magazine Focus.

It is the largest collection of stolen art held by a single person, says Julian Radcliffe. He works at the Art Loss Register in London. It tracks works of art that have vanished. "Two years ago we found a dealer who had two stolen pictures in his safe when he died, and we thought that was pretty shocking. To find one on this scale is exceptional."

Overall, the Germans are suspected of stealing 650,000 paintings and other artworks before and during World War II. Though the Munich discovery is huge, it is just a drop in the bucket.

Gurlitt's home was raided in early 2012. The German government has been a bit quiet about what is happening with the art. The works have been moved for safety and the search goes on for the rightful owners of the artwork.

Many of the original collectors could be Jewish families, who had their art stolen. Others sold the art cheaply to quickly flee Europe and save their own lives.

## The Man Sold Some Pieces

The police southern Germany took a long while to admit the discovery. And they have not given out a full list of the works of art found. That disturbs people who are working to return stolen art to their proper owners.

Anne Webber works for the Commission for Looted Art in Europe. She points out that the German investigators are being too secretive. "Families have been looking for (their) art for 75 years."

Focus said that Gurlitt sold off some pieces when he needed money. In one instance, he put a painting by German artist Max Beckmann up for sale.

The family of the original owner somehow heard about the sale. They claimed the painting as theirs and reached a deal with the company that was running the auction. And so the sale went ahead, Webber said. The work fetched nearly $1.2 million when it was auctioned to the highest bidder.

"What would have happened if the family had not identified it?" Webber asked.

## His Father Helped Nazis Collect Art

Gurlitt's father was an art seller who helped the Germans collect and dispose of artworks. Some of the art was taken by force from Jews. Many of the pieces Gurlitt's father had were believed to be destroyed during bombings.

At the end of the war he was asked what art he had. It was believed that he had "a truckload of art, and he said, 'It's all rumors, all of it was destroyed, I just have a few paintings from my dead father and my sister,'" Webber said. Many of the sellers who worked with the Germans to handle stolen art were able to build big collections for themselves, he said.

One member of the police told the magazine that Gurlitt was a man "who didn't exist." His name could not be found on any government lists. It is believed that he didn't pay taxes.

If the rightful owners of some of the artworks cannot be found, it's possible that they will stay with Gurlitt. That would no doubt upset Jews who survived World War II and their descendants. Many have fought to have their family treasures returned to them.
