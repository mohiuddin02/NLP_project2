WILLISTON, N.D. — Snowflakes and tumbleweeds whip past dismantled stacks of steel that used to represent jobs for hundreds of oil workers.

Four massive drilling rigs near the North Dakota-Montana line sit idle. They are waiting for oil prices to rise again. Last year, when oil was selling for $100 a barrel, each rig employed almost 200 people. Now, with oil prices cut in half, they employ Shay Hunt, the night watchman.

"Over there, that was my rig," said Hunt, a 35-year-old father of three from Williston who has worked the oil fields for more than 13 years.

"Rain comes, 40-below (temperature) comes, lightning and tornadoes come, we keep working," he said, facing away from the downed rigs and into the biting wind blowing in from the west. "One time a (grass) fire came up around the rig. We kept on working."

But there is a new threat to the oil fields. One you can't work through.

## North Dakota's Transformation

A six-year massive oil boom transformed both the economy of North Dakota and the lives of its people — sending unemployment to record lows and adding massive new development and construction. Local governments had record budget surpluses —extra money beyond what they were spending. However, the recent drop in prices is beginning to alter the landscape here. Half the rigs are inactive, costing thousands of oil workers their jobs with more layoffs likely to come.

But in Williston, the center of the boom, there is little panic. Officials say they welcome the chance for their city, the fastest-growing small city in America for the past four years, to catch its breath after years of breakneck change.

"We grew so fast, so quickly," said Shawn Wenko, economic development director for Williston, which is home to the nation's highest rents, lowest unemployment rates and largest city recreation center. "Obviously, we have some catch-up to do."

## Preparing For The Upturn

In cities across the oil fields, residents are waiting to see whether this is a slowdown or an actual bust, which is a period of great economic decline. There are still billions of barrels of oil locked tight in the rock below, and every day millions of barrels still pump to the surface. To make up for the downed rigs, communities are counting on a continued flurry of construction, small business start-ups and manufacturing, as they rush to build homes, schools, roads and sewer lines to serve the new North Dakotans who now call the area home.

Hunt, who has gone from rig crew foreman to night watchman, said some of his friends on the rig have gone back to their home states. They are waiting for oil prices to rise again.

Oil has been part of Williston's identity since the first oil strike nearby in 1951. Downtown galleries sell framed portraits of oil wells at sunset. The visitor's bureau sells Pipeline Pretzels, Frack Jacks pancake mix and Drill Bits crackers. At the city line, signs welcome you to Boomtown, U.S.A.

Chuck Wilder, whose grandmothers were in Williston for its founding in 1887, has watched oil busts empty out his hometown before — first in the 1950s and again in the 1980s. This, he said, doesn't feel anything like a bust.

## "There's Not A Job We Don't Need"

The oil deposits below Williston are so rich, companies can still make money drilling here, even with oil prices cut in half.

But the talk these days is less about exploration and more about shoring up existing extraction operations. The city has a billion dollars' worth of infrastructure projects on its to-do list before 2020. And that means there is still plenty of work here, for those who want it.

At Job Service North Dakota, the state employment office in Williston, there are two job openings for every job seeker.

Office manager Cindy Sanford flips through five pages of oil industry job listings: roustabouts, truck drivers, electricians, technicians, mechanics, drilling engineers. The list of job vacancies outside the industry is even longer: construction workers, cashiers, diesel mechanics, painters, teachers, a helicopter pilot, a cake decorator.

The office added 70 new job listings the Friday before and 60 more on Monday. A new Menards opens soon that will need 300 workers and a sporting goods warehouse that will need 189 more.

"If you know any civil engineers, I need 10," Sanford said, looking around at the dozen or so job seekers hunched over computers. "There's not a job we don't need."

## Land Of Opportunity

Still, it's a very different employment picture than during the exhilarating, hectic days of the boom, when almost anyone could step off a bus and into a six-figure job in the oil industry. Around town, they joked that oil companies would hire anything with a pulse.

Newcomers are still walking into Sanford's office every day, straight from the bus stop or airport. But the jobs they are finding no longer offer six-figure salaries and benefits. These days, employers are looking for workers with training, skills and a solid work ethic. Just like employers back home.

Many laid-off workers have jumped to jobs in the still-booming construction industry. Some started companies of their own.

"You can almost smell the entrepreneurship in the air," Sanford said.

On Main Street, Kelsey Thorne of California is getting ready to open Williston's first Italian restaurant. Starting a business here — a community full of potential investors, with plenty of unmet needs — has been easier than it would have been back home, said the highly trained chef who will manage the eatery.

 "We see Williston as a land of opportunity, for sure."
