TOKYO, Japan â€” In Japan, some jobs have been off limits to women for ages. Making sushi, a popular raw fish dish, is one of them.

Traditional views are the main reason women have stayed out of the sushi world. Some people think women's body temperatures are too warm to make sushi which is served cold.

Sushi chefs are also known for their "Edo-style" macho attitudes. They cut their hair short and use proud language.

Some women are challenging traditions like these. They have picked the perfect time to learn the art of sushi. The Japanese government wants more women to get jobs because the number of people working in Japan is shrinking.

## "Women Are Better At Communicating"

Right now, women hold fewer than one-tenth of the leadership positions in Japan's biggest businesses. By 2020, the government wants that number to grow to one-third. Japan has a long way to go to reach its goal.

Sushi chef Yuki Chidui, 28, is leading the way for other female sushi chefs. She runs the Nadeshico sushi restaurant in Tokyo. Nadeshico's staff is entirely female and her store's motto is "fresh and kawaii," which means "cute."

Chidui does not look or act like most male sushi chefs. She is soft-spoken and seems almost childlike in her pink flowered kimono. Ads for the restaurant show her as a "manga" character with big, lovable eyes. Manga are comic books in Japan.

"I think women are better at communicating with customers, and they're kind and gentle," Chidui said.

Chidui had been working at a department store when she decided to take a chance and start her own business. She had been in a rut and felt stuck.

Chidui's restaurant has been open for five years now, but her journey has not been easy. She has had to put up with lots of questions and sometimes insults from her customers. Some of the male customers are disrespectful.

## Experience Is What Really Counts

Becoming a sushi chef is a difficult process. Sushi-making skills take several years to learn. Chefs-in-training usually are not permitted to hold a knife for the first year. They spend most of their time on deliveries and dish-washing.

Masayuki Tsukada, 34, started training to become a sushi chef at 18. He says Japanese people have been closed-minded about women becoming sushi chefs.

When it comes to being a good sushi chef, Tsukada says that experience is what really counts. He says skills like being able to talk and keep all of the orders straight at the same time are the most important. Preparing the sushi in front of the customer can also be very challenging.

The sushi profession is gradually opening up to women. Tokyo Sushi Academy offers two-month crash courses in sushi-making and about one-fifth of the Japanese students are female. One-third of the students from overseas are women.

"More women are accepted as sushi chefs at casual restaurants," said Sachiko Goto, the academy's principal. Goto also said women have an easier time finding sushi-making jobs in other countries.

## Getting Good At Making Sushi

Restaurants where Tsukada and other professionals work charge 10,000 yen ($100) or more for dinner. They serve expensive fish like marbled tuna and rare types of baby fish. Nadeshico's meals cost about three times less.

It might not be as fancy, but people eating at Nadeshico said they liked what they were getting.

"This tastes so good," said Masataka Nakayama, 40, a physical therapist.

He and a friend took a train from northeastern Japan. They came to Tokyo to check out back-to-back concerts by AKB 48, a female singing-and-dance group.

Nakayama said sushi at Nadeshico was the perfect way to end the visit. The women who served his food did not seem that different from AKB 48 members.

Chidui says making sushi seems simple, but requires a lot of preparation ahead of time to deliver just the right taste. She says she is disappointed that some Japanese people are forgetting the delights of sushi. Instead, many choose to eat pizza and sliced beef over rice called "gyudon." Some settle for "kaiten zushi," which is sushi made by a machine.

Still, Chidui feels she is finally getting good at making sushi, and hopes more women will follow in her footsteps.

"This is really fun," she said.
