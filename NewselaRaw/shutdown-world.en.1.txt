BERLIN — A German newspaper columnist wondered this week why people here were shocked by the American political stalemate that led to the recent government shutdown.

After all, they'd seen it before: Republicans insisted on scaling back the Affordable Care Act and the shutdown followed. That wasn't so different from when German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that the Greeks scale back their spending, and a crisis broke out in Greece.

While it was only one column in one newspaper, it did nicely sum up how much of the world seemed to be seeing the United States during the budget standoff:  both dysfunctional, like Greece, and authoritarian, like Germany.

No one was amused, however, because the United States, after all, is not a bit player on the international stage like Greece. It is the unquestioned global leader. And while after a decade of controversial war it's not so unusual for Europeans to express hostility toward the United States, many were shocked to see how hostile Americans seem to be to one another. They also didn't understand how disinterested Americans seemed in how their internal fight might affect the rest of the world.

"This is pure domestic politics," said Xenia Dormandy, an expert on the United States and its place in the world at the London think tank Chatham House. "Nobody cares about any of the international implications. There's a lack of desire to even think about the repercussions."

Some predict the fighting will have long-term consequences.

## No. 1 Spot At Stake

Willem Post, an expert on U.S. politics at The Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands warned that the standoff in the United States and divisions within Europe over what to do about its own economy are causing the two powers to drop the ball. Neither is taking the steps that would enable them to remain the dominant forces in the world, Post explained. At the same time, there is talk of China rising and power shifting to the Pacific.

The United States is still the world's largest economy and will long remain the world's most powerful nation, he noted. And Europe, troubled as it may be, remains a substantial economic force.

"This is a window of opportunity now, for two continents with shared goals, to make a partnership under which they will not diminish," he said. "Of course, they cannot wait 20 years to make this happen. This is a moment, and it must be seized. Instead, we have dysfunctional governments on both sides of the Atlantic."

And there will be consequences, he said.

"For us, failure to make progress now is an issue, but only one of many," he said. "For our children and grandchildren, it is a looming disaster."

## A Troubled Role Model

The American role in it makes it all the more incomprehensible to Europeans. To people in Europe, their own dysfunctions make sense; the European Union, after all, is made up of 28 nations with competing interests, while the eurozone, where the euro is the currency, is composed of 17 nations with differing economic needs and styles.

But the United States is a single nation.

"Europeans really don't understand," he said. "The United States is the model democracy; it should be leading by example. Instead, there is no talking, there is no compromise. The lesson to the rest of the world is that the United States these days can't be relied upon."

The impact of the standoff came through in a commentary distributed earlier this week by the official Chinese news agency Xinhua. The writer suggested that given the current crisis "it is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanized world."

The commentary proposed that the time has come for the world to leave the dollar behind as the international standard currency. Such a move that would be disastrous for American consumers used to low prices on imports.

The piece goes on in even stronger language to denounce the United States for its international policies. "Under what is known as the Pax-Americana, we fail to see a world where the United States is helping to defuse violence and conflicts … instead of honoring its duties as a responsible leading power, a self-serving Washington has abused its superpower status and introduced even more chaos into the world."

The language of the piece is harsh, but the thoughts are hardly fresh. They also won't go away simply because the United States, once again, drove up to the edge of the cliff and dangled the world economy for a while before deciding not to actually drop it.

## Politicians Playing With Fire

Earlier this year, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius gave a speech in Jakarta, Indonesia, encapsulating recent global history and the end of "The American Century."

"The world was bipolar with the domination of the United States and the USSR," Fabius said, referring to the Soviet Union, which broke apart into Russia and smaller republics in the early 1990s. "It was then, for a short time, uni-polar, dominated by the United States. In the future, we all want it to become multi-polar, with regulated multi-polarity. For the moment, in my view, it is zero-polar."

As such, the global cost of this government shutdown shouldn't be measured in dollars as much as in prestige, some analysts say. And in those terms, the losses were steep.

Joerg Wolf, editor in chief and a foreign policy expert at the Atlantic Community, a Berlin-based think tank, noted that "it is mind-boggling that politicians are so slow to see the costs of their actions."

Wolf wonders if politicians really need to experience the consequences to appreciate them.

"The perception in the United States Congress does seem to be that if a default causes problems for China, that's China's problem," he said. "The U.S. is playing with fire. There will be blowback."
