LOS ANGELES â€” The Pacific Crest Trail is very challenging for hikers. It runs up the entire length of California and all the way to Canada, for 2,650 rugged miles.

Hikers are lucky to find relief and helping hands along the way.

Sandy and Barney Mann live near the southern end of the trail. They open their five-bedroom San Diego home to as many as 60 hikers a night. They even pick them up from the airport and drive them to the trail's starting point an hour east.

Donna and Jeff Saufley live up the trail, in Agua Dulce. They provide a night's rest to more than 1,000 hikers a season. They even offer food and shelter to the hikers' dogs and horses.

Hank Magnuski lives east of San Francisco. He gives hot coffee and snacks to hikers coming off a particularly tough 300-mile stretch.

They are all part of a small network of people known as "trail angels."

## Making It To "Hiker Heaven"

Trail angels help long-distance hikers along what is one of the most difficult trails in the world. They provide food, shelter, medicine and hot showers.

There are fewer than 100 trail angels. They do what they do with little or no reward other than the hikers' grateful smiles. All are volunteers. Everything they offer hikers is paid for out of their own pockets.

An angel among angels, Donna Saufley is the best-known of the trail volunteers.

Each April, she and her husband set up tents and a trailer for the hikers. Their home is known as "Hiker Heaven."

Saufley says she gets a lot out of being a trail angel.

"I have to say, far and away, these are some of the most interesting people on the planet," she said. "I always say that it's a river of life that washes up to my shore."

Almost all the trail angels say they get something very rewarding out of what they do. In fact, they think they get as much from the experience as the hikers themselves.

"I want to get to know the hikers," said Pea Hicks, who lives in San Diego. Hicks helps hikers get started at the Mexican border.

Being a trail angel is also a way to stay involved in hiking, says Hicks. She walked the trail herself in 2006.

## Hikers Bring Music, Laughter

Over time, the trail angels have gotten busier. It is partly because the trail has gotten more popular with hikers.

Saufley says that during her first year in 1997, she hosted 50 hikers all season. Last year, she often had that many staying each night. About 1,200 backpackers stayed with her over the summer.

Saufley loves it when her home is filled with hikers.

"The sounds of conversations mingling with music and laughter" is a beautiful thing, she said.

## Exhausting But Worth It!

While the trail has become quite popular, it is still very difficult.

Often the trail is blocked by rockslides or huge fallen trees. In certain places, hikers must climb uphill, sometimes 10,000 feet or more.

Some hikers complete the trail several times. Others add their own special twist. Two years ago, Portland native Ron Ulrich hiked the whole thing dressed in a wedding gown.

The Manns have helped hikers for 10 years. They say those they have helped often stay in touch by sending notes and cards.

Barney confesses that being a trail angel is not always easy. Helping so many strangers each spring can leave him and Sandy feeling exhausted.

Still, he said, "We are so lucky to be able to do this."
