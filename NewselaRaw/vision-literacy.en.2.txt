BALTIMORE â€” Alexander Dominguez zoomed through worksheets in the month after he joined Maygon Thompson's third-grade class at Charles Carroll Barrister Elementary School. He quickly became one of the best students.

So when the third-grader could not read a simple sentence on the board, Thompson was puzzled.

"I thought he was kidding," said Thompson, a teacher at the school in Baltimore. "But he's so serious about his work, it had to be something else."

A team of researchers at Johns Hopkins Hospital might have figured out that "something else." They're trying to answer a simple but overlooked question. The question is, are students struggling to read because they can't see?

Dr. Megan Collins is a children's eye doctor at the hospital. For the past six months, she has been checking vision and giving glasses to students in a dozen Baltimore elementary schools. She is trying to link vision problems and reading in groups of school children.

If the researchers can answer the question of whether students cannot read because they cannot see, they can help change students' lives, Collins said.

## Some Unexpected Results

Their first tests will include a sample of 300 students from 12 schools. The students will have their eyes examined and, if needed, they will be measured for glasses.

The study begins with a reading exam and students who receive glasses take another exam at the end of the school year.

Of the 250 students tested between January and March, 150 needed glasses, results that were unexpected.

"We were very surprised," said Dr. David Friedman of Hopkins. The number was twice as many as would typically have needed glasses, he said.

Friedman said that many students had other challenges with reading, including a learning disability called dyslexia. Still, if even 5 percent to 10 percent could be helped by wearing glasses, it would make a big difference, he said.

## Baltimore Has Had Problems Testing Students

The Maryland State Department of Education requires students to have their vision tested only in the first grade and ninth grade. This leaves a lot of time for problems to go unnoticed.

Julie Gray has been teaching at Charles Carroll Barrister for 16 years. When a student is struggling to read, she said, vision problems are the last thing she is looking for.

"This is so helpful because it's not something teachers can easily identify," she said. "We're not doctors."

The city also has a history of problems when it comes to making sure that students are tested and treated properly.

The Abell Foundation reported in 2010 that the city's health department did not have enough people to test students and follow up to see if they received glasses. The department conducts vision tests for city students.

Dr. Leana Wen is the new health commissioner in Baltimore. She said the department has made significant improvements since 2010. Almost all the students who are supposed to get their vision tested are being tested.

## Hospital's Approach Could Help

Still, challenges remain with following up after the tests, Wen said. Fewer than 20 percent of students who have vision problems on the test end up getting glasses, she said.

The health department is looking at new ways to get glasses to students. Wen said Johns Hopkins' approach could help solve the problem.

The Hopkins study includes second- and third-grade students, who are at a critical time in their education.

Research shows that those who cannot read by the end of the third grade are four times less likely to graduate on time.

## A Pair For Home, A Pair For School

Bob Slavin is a Hopkins education professor. He believes money and how the reading problem is labeled are reasons the connection between vision and literacy has never been explored deeply. Slavin started a program that provides education programs to schools throughout the country.

"As long as we see it purely as a health problem, there's no money to solve it," he said. "If you see it as something that's an education problem, the money is already there."

Students who need glasses receive two pair, for home and school. Many students in the study, like Alexander, were given glasses at some point and lost them or broke them.

At Charles Carroll Barrister, fewer than than two-thirds of third-graders passed a 2014 state test. That means the study could make a big difference.

About one-third of the school's population speaks English as a second language.

"Our greatest struggle is figuring out what they really know and what is just a barrier," said David Wunder, principal of Charles Carroll Barrister. "This study is really connecting a bridge for us."
