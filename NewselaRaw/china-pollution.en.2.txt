BEIJING â€” People die about 5.5 years sooner in northern China than their countrymen in the south. A new study has found that heavy air pollution is almost entirely to blame.

The research was published on Monday in China, the U.S. and Israel. The paper examined air-quality readings collected in 90 Chinese cities between 1981 and 2000. This information was then compared with death rates in 145 locations across the country from 1991 to 2000.

Other studies have established strong links between air pollution and ill health. And many experts have tried to work out how death rates in China are related to poor air quality.

Yet this new research specifically shows that pollution does lower life expectancy. This proof may shock both officials and the public. Over the past few decades, China has transformed from a poor, mostly rural country, to a booming land dotted with mega-cities and massive industry. The question of how much China must sacrifice for the sake of rapid development is a hot topic.

## North And South Of Huai River

In China the researchers found an ideal place to examine the effects of air pollution. The Huai River is a major waterway that flows through the center of the country.

Previous Chinese governments gave people north of the river free coal to burn in winter. Yet those who lived south of the Huai received none.

The reason for the unequal coal donations are still unknown. But the decision created two experimental groups on either side of the river that could be compared with each other. The impact of burning coal on air quality - and on health - could be isolated and examined by researchers.

Michael Greenstone is one of the authors of the new study. He said that this situation was an "unintended consequence" of the government's policy. Greenstone added that researchers would never consider exposing some people to more pollution and other people to less pollution over the course of their lifetimes. Yet these different histories on either side of the Huai were important to the study.

## Heart And Lung Problems

Air pollution is measured by total suspended particulates (TSPs). TSPs are specks of dust, smoke or dirt carried in the atmosphere. Greenstone and his co-authors found that north of the Huai River, the TSPs measured over 500 micrograms per cubic meter. This was 55 percent higher than levels south of the river.

Life expectancy in the north was 5.5 years lower. The experts say this is almost entirely because of deaths from heart and lung problems that are caused by air pollution.

The researchers estimated that 500 million residents of northern China altogether lost 2.5 billion years from their lives. This was during the 1990s alone.

Another co-author, Yuyu Chen of Peking University, said: "It's a huge loss. Air pollution in China is really damaging people's health much more seriously than the findings in previous literature." Chen believes there now should be no argument over whether China takes air pollution seriously. He also wants to change the laws to make the air cleaner.

## Economic Growth Before Health?

Dirty air remains a serious concern in China. The capital city Beijing witnessed some of its worst air pollution ever in January. This was caused by the weather and emissions from coal heating. The episode became widely known as the "Airpocalypse."

The pollution closed highways, forced the cancellations of airline flights and outdoor activities. It also sent countless people to hospitals. Regions up to 1,100 miles away from Beijing were affected, almost the distance from New York City to New Orleans.

Another spell of terrible air besieged Beijing in late June. These episodes led some to ask if China is sacrificing too much of its citizens' health for economic growth. There have been numerous protests over this issue in recent years. Many Chinese people are concerned about the environmental problems and air pollution in their country.

## Emergency Measures

During the Airpocalypse, China's government experimented with several emergency measures. In January, they ordered factories and construction sites to close. In June, the government announced a package of 10 anti-pollution policies. This included forcing heavy industries such as steel manufacturing to replace outdated technologies and publish data on pollutants.

Heavy polluters have been asked to reduce their emissions by 30 percent by the end of 2017. Yet the pollution cuts also depend on the economic output of these industries. Critics of this policy say that if economic growth continues to grow quickly, the total decreases in pollution will be small.

Chen said that Chinese citizens would be willing to give up some financial development in order to prolong their lives. He concluded that the public would forgo up to 2 percentage points of economic growth to reduce TSPs by 100 micrograms per cubic meter.

Numerous Chinese cities have average TSP readings of 200 to 300 micrograms. In the U.S., the average is 20 to 30 micrograms. Long-term exposure to each additional 100 micrograms cuts life expectancy by three years, Chen and his team concluded.
