VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. — A 19th-century newspaper that Mark Twain once wrote for is back in print, after a break of many years. What would the famous writer and humorist think?

The Territorial Enterprise was once the region's top source of gossip, humor and tall tales. The newspaper, which has run out of money on more than one occasion, is now a monthly magazine. This time it includes an online edition, territorialenterprise.com.

## "He'd Get A Kick Out Of It"

Would Twain use Twitter to bemoan the sad state of the press, as he once did with pen and ink? "If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed. If you do read the newspaper, you're misinformed."

Or would he get upset at who is running the media today? "I am not the editor of a newspaper and shall always try to do the right thing and be good so that God will not make me one."

Even the Enterprise's new editor, Elizabeth Thompson, guesses that Samuel Clemens would have some fun. Clemens was Twain's real name.

"He'd have something to say," she said. "He'd get a kick out of it."

## The Paper That Wouldn't Quit

The newspaper sold as many as 15,000 copies at its peak in the 1860s. The Enterprise was Nevada's first newspaper and the largest west of the Mississippi River. Its reporters wrote about the craziness and financial fallout of the discovery of silver on the eastern slope of Mount Davidson called the Comstock Lode.

The mining boom eventually died, but the paper continued to tell the story of a rough town where unwashed men settled arguments with guns. The original Enterprise stopped publishing in 1893.

Since then, the paper has been revived numerous times. The most notable attempt was made by railroad historian Lucius Beebe, who sold it in 1961. Scott Faughn, who also publishes the Missouri Times, is behind the latest attempt.

In its best days, the Enterprise not only covered the news, it made news.

Reporters included William "Dan De Quille" Wright, James "Lying James" Townsend and Samuel "Mark Twain" Clemens. Their articles "became legendary for their wit," editors recently wrote.

Thompson said the paper aims to carry on that tradition.

## Readers Are Eager For New Edition

The first new edition was published in March. It includes news and an interview with Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, as well as a modern version of the so-called "sagebrush humor" Twain helped make famous before he became America's favorite writer.

Clemens had traveled west from Missouri with his brother, Orion Clemens, who became secretary of the Nevada Territory before the area became a state in 1864. Historians say Clemens first used the name Mark Twain while at the Enterprise.

In three years, he wrote stories about territory politicians, shoot-'em-ups and the stock market. Some of the stories were reprinted in his 1872 book "Roughing It."

In Virginia City, reaction to the rebirth of the Enterprise has been positive.

"I'm excited about it; it tickles me," said Sandi Sweetwater, who manages a gift shop and offers tours of the newspaper's original offices one floor below.

She pointed to Twain's original desk and an in-office toilet. There was also a spittoon, a pot for spitting tobacco juice into.

## What's In A Name?

Across the street is the Mark Twain Saloon. Owner John Schafer said that even the name Mark Twain might have Nevada roots. While historians believe the name comes from Clemens' Mississippi riverboat days — a river man's phrase for water two fathoms deep — the bar owner says there is another theory.

"There's talk Clemens got the name Mark Twain in Virginia City saloons," he said. "The phrase comes from ordering two drinks at once and asking that they be served on credit."

Thompson has high hopes for the paper, which began with 2,500 copies being sold. She has spent recent months researching Twain and the time period in which he wrote and is ready to try and match, if not precisely the wit, then at least the spirit. Thompson said that she thinks Twain would be pleased.

"We hope he's smiling upon this venture from either above or below," she said.
