NOVOAZOVSK, Ukraine — Two columns of Russian tanks and military vehicles fired missiles at a border post in southeastern Ukraine, then rolled into the country Thursday, a top Ukrainian official said. Ukraine's overmatched border guards fled.

Comments from Ukraine's National Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine and the United States were all in agreement. Their remarks left no doubt that the Russian military had invaded southeastern Ukraine.

A top NATO official said at least 1,000 Russian troops have poured into Ukraine and fought with Ukrainian soldiers, resulting in casualties. He said another 20,000 Russian troops were right over the Russian border.

"Russian forces have entered Ukraine," Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko declared Thursday. He called an emergency meeting of his security council.

President Poroshenko summoned the council as the strategic southeastern town of Novoazovsk appeared firmly under the control of separatists and Russia. The move opens a new front in the war in eastern Ukraine between the separatists and the Ukrainian government. The separatists consider themselves to be ethnically Russian. They want parts of Ukraine to break away from Ukraine and join Russia.

## Fears Of Russian Escalation

Russian stock markets dropped nearly 2 percent on Thursday as fears grew that Russia was escalating the conflict. If Russia moves in that direction it could provoke the U.S. and European Union to impose further trade sanctions.

Some sanctions are already in place blocking trade and business by Russian companies and individuals. The earlier sanctions were meant to punish Russia for taking control of Crimea in March. Sanctions were then increased after the crash of a Malaysian airplane, which was blamed on a Russian missile fired by the separatists.

Brigadier General Nico Tak told reporters at NATO headquarters that Russia's true goal was to keep the separatists from being defeated by Ukrainian forces. He believes Russia wants to turn eastern Ukraine into a "frozen conflict" that would destabilize the country "indefinitely."

"Over the past two weeks we have noted a significant escalation in both the level and sophistication of Russia's military interference in Ukraine," Tak said at NATO headquarters in Belgium. "Russia is reinforcing and resupplying separatist forces in a blatant attempt to change the momentum of the fighting." Tak said the Ukrainian military had appeared to be winning the battle.

NATO also produced satellite images to prove that Russian combat soldiers "are operating inside Ukraine's sovereign territory," Tak said.

## "Increasingly Grave"

The satellite images were only "the tip of the iceberg," Tak added.

"We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons, including air defense systems, artillery, tanks, and armored personnel carriers being transferred to separatist forces in eastern Ukraine," he said. He called the situation "increasingly grave."

Alexander Zakharchenko is the leader of the separatists. He said in an interview on Russian state television that 3,000 to 4,000 Russians have fought on the separatist side since the armed conflict began in April.

The U.S. government accused Russia of bringing about a new military campaign in Ukraine. The U.S. says Russia is helping rebel forces expand their fight and sending in tanks, rocket launchers and armored vehicles.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Russia was being dishonest about its actions, even to its own people.

Russian forces, she said, are being sent 30 miles (48 kilometers) inside Ukraine, without them or their families knowing where they are going. She cited reports of burials in Russia for those who have died in Ukraine.

On Thursday morning, an Associated Press journalist saw rebel checkpoints at the outskirts of Novoazovsk. He was told he could not enter.

Novoazovsk, which lies along the road connecting Russia to the Russia-annexed Crimean Peninsula, had come under shelling for three days. On Wednesday the rebels entered it. The area had previously escaped the fighting that has engulfed areas to the north, and the only way rebels could have reached the southeast was coming through Russia.

## Russia-Crimea Land Link Sought

The new southeastern front raised fears that the separatists are seeking to create a land link between Russia and Crimea. If successful, it could give them or Russia control over the entire Sea of Azov. The sea is prized for the gas and mineral riches that energy experts believe it contains.

Ukraine already lost roughly half its coastline, several major ports and significant Black Sea mineral rights in March when Russia took over Crimea. Russia sees Crimea as part of Russia. Until 1954, it was part of Russia and more than half of the Crimeans consider themselves Russian.

Joseph Dempsey is a military expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. He said recent images of a military convoy in eastern Ukraine showed a type of T-72 tank that "is not known to have been exported" by Russia.

The tank's presence, Dempsey said, "strongly supports the contention that Russia is supplying arms to separatist forces."

Associated Press journalists on the border have seen the rebels with a wide range of unmarked military equipment — including tanks, Buk missile launchers and armored personnel carriers. The journalists have run into many Russians among the rebel fighters. Ukraine also captured 10 Russian soldiers Monday around Amvrosiivka, a town 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Russian border.

In Donetsk, the largest rebel-held city, 11 people were killed by shelling overnight, the city said Thursday.
