ST. LOUIS â€” High school agriculture programs are sprouting up across the nation's Midwest. The programs teach many teenagers that working in the field frequently has nothing to do with cows and plows.

The agriculture courses are being offered at the same time as school funds are being cut and the number of farms in the United States is declining. The courses are rich in science and are seen as a stepping stone for students thinking about careers including city forestry, natural resources and the genetic engineering of crops.

Students who like agriculture are in luck: Tens of thousands of jobs are opening up each year in the field. Almost half of them go to college graduates with agriculture-related degrees, analysts say.

"There's a shortage of workers in a number of careers, and the numbers of those jobs are staggering," said Harley Hepner, the Illinois State Board of Education's chief adviser for agriculture education.

## Fewer Farms Every Year

Membership in Future Farmers of America (FFA), a national group, also jumped. FFA has about 580,000 members now, almost double the amount it had in the mid-1980s. More kids are interested in becoming members although the number of farms in the country has been falling. The total amount of farms declined 4 percent between 2007 and 2012, according to government figures.

Many FFA members have little to do with farms, as Rebecca Goodman explains.

In Indiana, where corn is king, the 18-year-old is the president of the school's FFA, but she is not a country girl. Goodman has lived in Indianapolis since she was 3, and had never been on a farm before she joined the FFA. Her experience with animals is limited to cats and dogs.

"The only thing I planted was a small garden, and the only thing that grew out of it were weeds," she says.

But Goodman would like to work with conservation efforts. She credits the agricultural sciences program at Beech Grove School with pointing her that way.

## Hands-On Learning

Beech Grove's Applied Life Sciences Academy opened in November 2012. The goal was to become a place of hands-on exploration of live plants and animals. Teachers say that for students who struggle with some subjects in traditional math and science classes, the Academy helps them make connections with the real world.

Classes include animal, plant and soil sciences. The students taking some of the courses earn credits in high school science classes.

Programs like the ones offered by Beech Grove's Academy have increased in recent years in many states in the U.S. Midwest. Seven high schools in Kansas and four in Nebraska joined the group in the past school year. Illinois added another 10. And since 2011, Missouri has added seven schools to bring that state's total to 331.

The Beech Grove Academy is one of 13 similar programs Indiana has added since 2010. It has two middle school and two high school teachers for almost 500 students. The Academy pays for itself thanks to help from the state, which gives an allowance per each student in the district depending on the class. The allowance varies from $375 to $450 per student. With that help, Beech Grove put together $180,000.

"Beech Grove needed more electives and teachers, and this was a perfect fit that didn't cost much," said Chris Kaufman, an agriculture professional who helped set up Beech Grove's program.

"This is about understanding the environment and the world around you as it relates to animals, plants and food, then going out with those skills to get a good career," he said.

## A Path To The Future

The Academy helped Goodman. She remembers having a hard time, not knowing what do with her life in the future. "Before this (program) came, I was in a dark place. It has helped me find my way back," she said,

Her classmate Alicia Perez used to believe that learning about agriculture was only for people who wanted to be farmers. But she doesn't believe that anymore.

The 17-year-old dreams about one day becoming a chef. Learning about plants and food has changed her life.

"It's an amazing program," she said.  "My heart is in culinary arts, and there are so many different careers" you can find in agriculture.

"This is definitely something you have to go into to realize it's so much broader," Perez said.
