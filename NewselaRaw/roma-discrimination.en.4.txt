<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131024_Roma.jpg" /> BERLIN â€” French police grabbed 15-year-old Leonarda Dibrani earlier this month while she was on a school field trip. Her crime? Her family, who are from the Balkans, wanted to live in France. The French government had just said they couldn't. It also said it couldn't wait until the end of the school day to get her out of the country.

Police escorted Leonarda off a bus filled with her classmates and quickly took her away. Along with her family, she was quickly expelled to Kosovo. She had never lived in that country.

Many believe they know the real reason for the way she was treated: She is Romani. Or, to use the more common and insulting word, a Gypsy. Experts say that bad treatment of Roma people is still very common. And people often still say hate-filled, insulting things about them.

The Roma originally came from northern India. But they have lived in Europe for 800 years. A new report says they are treated very unfairly when it comes to jobs, education, and health care.

## Anger Against The Roma

At first, things seemed to go well after what happened to Leonarda. Hundreds of French students flooded the streets of Paris to support her. They demanded that she be allowed to return. Many thought that Europeans might finally start to think differently about the Roma.

But such hope disappeared within days. A Greek Roma family was accused of kidnapping a young blond girl. Whether they really had kidnapped her or not, the case made a lot of people angry against all Roma.

Human rights lawyer Claudia Tavani said that when times are tough, people want someone to blame. The Roma are always an easy target.

In Slovakia, city governments build walls around Roma camps. In the Czech Republic, neo-Nazis lead protests against the Roma.

In Romania, Roma woman have been offered money to not have children. In France, a politician said of the Roma: "Maybe Hitler didn't kill enough of them."

Hitler's Germany killed between 250,000 and 500,000 Roma. But the hate hardly ended after World War II.

## Insulted And Treated Unfairly

Romani Rose is head of a Roma group in Germany. He said hate toward Roma people remains widespread there.

His people still suffer unfair and insulting treatment, he said. They are the last in Europe to get jobs. They are also the first to be fired. He said that when poor Romani villagers come to Berlin, they find only overcrowded apartments. Crooked landlords overcharge them for nothing but a mattress on the floor.

Cordula Simon is a Berlin government official. She is eager to help Romani immigrants.

Europeans, she said, view the Roma people in one of two ways: either as "happy dancers and fiddlers or as dangerous criminals." But actually "they are just people" like anyone else. And good things are happening. It's just that "too few are willing to listen," Simon said.

One good thing that's happening, she said, involves education. Young Romani children who enter German schools are often very unprepared. Many have never been to school before.

"But their energy level, their hunger to learn, is enormous," she said.

## Hoping For A Better Life

Romani parents sacrifice a lot to give their children a better life, Simon said.

Mitek is a 37-year-old Roma from Bulgaria. He lost a job and couldn't find new work at home. So he left his wife and children behind and came to Berlin six months ago. He hoped for a better life. What he has found so far isn't much.

Every day he's out collecting used plastic bottles. He trades these in for a tiny bit of money. But sometimes he sits and thinks about the good life to come. And he still has hope, even though his new "home" is a scrap-wood hut inside an abandoned factory.

"My hope is still to find a job, and to bring my wife and children to live with me," he said while seated outside his hut. "It hasn't happened yet. But I have hope. My life will be better soon."
