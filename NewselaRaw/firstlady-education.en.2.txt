WASHINGTON — On Friday, first lady Michelle Obama said that the most important issue facing blacks today is education. A group of women who are veterans of the civil rights movement were at her side as she gave her speech.

The first lady was speaking during an event marking Black History Month. The women who joined her, she said, represented many different aspects and eras of the civil rights movement. Still, as different as they are, "there is something that connects each of their stories," she said. What they all share in common is a "hunger for and belief in the power of education."

## Overcoming Obstacles

The civil rights movement veterans who joined Obama at the White House included two who broke down barriers to attend school: Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Carlotta Walls LaNier. Hunter-Gault was one of the first black students to attend the previously whites-only University of Georgia. LaNier was the youngest member of the Little Rock Nine, the group of black high school students barred from entering Arkansas' Little Rock Central High School, which at the time only admitted whites.

LaNier and Hunter-Gault often faced physical resistance while attempting to receive an education.

Obama said that while times have changed, many children today still fail to meet their full potential. There are no longer mobs with bricks and bottles keeping young black women from attending college. Yet, many still do not manage to get the education they should, she said.

"Nobody needs a military escort to get to class — but that doesn't mean that our children don't still face struggles when it comes to education," Obama said.

## Don't Fall Behind In Life

While the high school graduation rate for black students is on the rise, it still remains the lowest rate of all the racial groups in the country.

Because of that, Obama urged the young women in the audience to go to school no matter what — even if it means attending "bad" schools with crumbling buildings and outdated technology. She insisted that if children fall behind in school, they fall behind in life.

"We simply cannot afford to lose out on the potential of even one young person," she said. "We cannot allow even one more young person to fall through the cracks."

Education, she said, is important when it comes to solving problems such as high rates of imprisonment, poverty and racial profiling.

The first lady is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. She heads the program Reach Higher, an effort to boost the desire for college education in high schoolers.

## Education Equals Success

Friday's event was co-hosted by Essence, a magazine for African-American women that recently released its first issue in 45 years without a photo on the cover. Instead of an image, the cover features the words, "BLACK LIVES MATTER."

Essence Editor-in-Chief Vanessa K. DeLuca moderated Friday's panel discussion. It focused on the continuing importance of education.

"Education is still the key to success," LaNier said. "Be prepared to open that door. You need all the education you can possibly get, because that door might be a crack or flung wide open."
