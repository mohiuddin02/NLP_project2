WASHINGTON â€” The United States is trying to stop a rise in unlawful hunting by cracking down on the sale and purchase of ivory. The increase in the number of elephants and rhinos killed in Africa for their tusks and horns is threatening to wipe them out.

The ivory ban is a key part of a new, national plan for combating wildlife trafficking, unveiled on Tuesday. The ban comes seven months after President Barack Obama issued a call to action during a visit to Tanzania. The U.S. will also seek to strengthen the fight against the trade all around the world.

Wildlife trafficking involves the unlawful transport of animals and animal parts. It's a business thought to make about $10 billion per year.

"We're seeing record-high demand for wildlife products," said Grant Harris, who works for the White House. He explained that this is because of a recent explosion in the ivory trade and wildlife trafficking.

## "Smoke Screen" For Ivory Sales

Wildlife supporters are worried that without strong global action, elephants and rhinos face [extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). Once numbering in the millions, Africa's elephant population has dwindled to 500,000 or less, said Dan Ashe, who runs the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. About 35,000 are being slaughtered each year. That toll accounts for nearly 10 percent of the remaining population.

The criminal trade doesn't just concern animal supporters. Wildlife trafficking is often carried out by well-armed groups in regions with weak laws and borders. U.S. officials say this can create a number of threats to international safety. The U.S. is seeking to combat growing extremism and violence in these parts of Africa.

The crackdown uses laws on conservation and endangered species that have been around for years. But these laws have not been strictly enforced, meaning that once the ivory is in the U.S., domestic sales are not really controlled.

That means someone who placed an ivory chess set for sale on eBay, for example, faced little risk of being investigated by police. This is even if they had no proof that the item was legal. Some ivory items are allowed by law, such as antiques. These are ivory items that are more than 100 years old.

Ashe said that the legal trade provides a "smoke screen" for the unlawful ivory sales. He said it also makes it more difficult for police to find the banned goods, as well as catch and punish the criminals.

## U.S. Bans Ivory Exports

Under the new rules, if someone is caught trying to sell ivory, the government will seize the items. This is unless sellers can provide proof that their goods are legal. Sales across state lines will be banned except for antiques. Sales within states will also be stopped unless sellers can show they were brought into the U.S. before the ban.

The export of ivory out of the U.S. will also be banned, with very few exceptions. "For consumers, the general message going forward is buyer beware," Ashe said.

Officials are confident that the crackdown will mean almost a complete ban on ivory sales. The U.S. wants to set a strict example and spur other countries to take similar steps. They hope this will drive down global demand for wildlife products and put traffickers out of business.

Late last year, U.S. officials destroyed more than six tons of seized ivory tusks, carvings and jewelry. Last week, France followed suit by crushing more than three tons of ivory. Other nations including Gabon and China have taken similar steps.

The U.S. demand for wildlife products is only beaten by China, where ivory costs more than $1,000 a pound. The price of ivory has increased significantly, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

## Sting Dubbed "Operation Crash"

Carter Roberts, the group's president, said that Obama and Congress have sent a very strong message to the rest of the world. This is that the U.S. will no longer allow the "massive and senseless slaughter of wildlife." The U.S. also wants to catch the gangs that make huge amounts of money from the trade.

Still, the government won't seek to charge individuals, such as people who try to sell ivory they inherited from their parents. Instead, it will target the organized criminals that profit from the unlawful trade.

Last year, the government launched a sting dubbed "Operation Crash." This went after an international ring that smuggled endangered black rhino horns. Fourteen people have been arrested during this nationwide investigation so far and seven have been convicted.

While unveiling the plans, Obama called on Congress to pass more new laws. Congressman Ed Royce said he would review Obama's plan to make sure it is strong and effective. Senator Dianne Feinstein wants to be able to use laws used in drug cases in wildlife trafficking.

The Safari Club International Foundation represents animal hunters. This group criticized Obama's plans for not looking at the relationships with African nations. Joe Hosmer, the group's president, said government actions can spoil on-the-ground conservation projects, which he argued are already working well.

Hosmer said that the people and the businesses in the African countries at the most important in keeping the wildlife population safe.
