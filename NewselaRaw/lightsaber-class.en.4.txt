DORAL, Fla. — Many "Star Wars" fans have done it all. They have seen the movies, read the books, and bought the toys. What is next? Some fans in Florida want to learn to move like a Jedi. 

A group of "Star Wars" fans gets together every other Saturday. The group is called Magic City Jedi. They go to a class. It is part yoga and part dance. They learn "Star Wars" Jedi moves and martial arts. They battle with lightsabers.

The teachers are Alfred Smith and Santiago Martinez. Alfred is a yoga teacher. Santiago works at a bank. 

## A Little Luke Skywalker, A Little Han Solo

Santiago said that a lot of people like "Star Wars." In class, students can pretend to be a Jedi. They learn to fight with lightsabers. Santiago likes teaching. He said it lets him pretend. He said, "What kid doesn't want to be Luke Skywalker or Han Solo?" 

On a recent Saturday, 17 people came to class. Some brought their own toy lightsabers. They light up and make noise. Others used the class lightsabers. These were made of plastic pipes wrapped in pool noodles.

Class started with meditation and yoga. For meditation, the class was quiet. They focused on breathing. Yoga poses helped them pay attention. They started balancing on one leg. They stood like a tree. Smith said that a Jedi knows what is going on around him or her. Jedis need good balance too.

## Flourish And Bash 

Next, they learned easy lightsaber moves. Students moved their sabers down to each side, and then up to the middle. Some students were silly. 

The students learned new moves. One was called a "flourish." To flourish, the person moves fast while twirling the lightsaber. They also learned how to "bash." A bash is a fast forward attack that ends with a pullback.

Class ended with meditation. The students sat quietly and focused on breathing. Meditation helps a Jedi focus.

Everyone ended the class with a smile. Most agreed it made for a fun workout. "You really feel like a Jedi," said Valerie Villar, age 26.
