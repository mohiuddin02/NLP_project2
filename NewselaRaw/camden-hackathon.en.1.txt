CAMDEN, N.J. â€” This weekend, the city of Camden, New Jersey, will host its first ever "hackathon." A hackathon is an event in which computer programmers meet to work on projects together. The Camden hackathon will bring together professional programmers and a group of Camden students who hope to use their computer skills to give back to their community.

The event is being hosted by Hopeworks 'N Camden, a youth development organization. Hopeworks offers technology and training classes for teenagers and young adults. The organization helps youths learn how to design websites, build life skills, graduate from high school, and succeed in college, among other things.

On Saturday, these youths will team up with professional computer programmers from around the country. Some of the programmers coming to the hackathon work for the car company Subaru, which plans to move its North American headquarters to Camden.

## Networking Over Coffee And Keyboards

According to event organizers, the hackathon will allow students to meet professionals and learn more about computer programming. At the same time, it will benefit Camden. The city was once a major manufacturing center, but many of Camden's factories have shut down, eliminating thousands of jobs. Today, Camden is one of the country's poorest and most dangerous cities.

The students at Hopeworks want to help change that. During Saturday's hackathon, teams will work on designing new websites for four nonprofit organizations. One of them is the Camden Mayor's Youth Council, dedicated to improving services for the young.

"We're used to thinking of Camden as a helpless victim," said Dan Rhoten, executive director of Hopeworks. "The reality is Camden can produce a lot of things." He added that he hoped the hackathon would inspire young people by showing them that students of all backgrounds can build careers in technology.

## Technology May Unlock Door To Brighter Future

One Hopeworks student is 23-year-old Gabrielle Lee. She wants to leave Camden, but she hopes to return later to teach English as a second language. She sees technology as playing a role in her future. As an aspiring educator, she is interested in online learning.

"Being at Hopeworks makes me want to impart my skills," she said.

Rhoten said he plans to hold hackathons every six months or so. Camden government agencies and nonprofit groups will be able to request projects in advance. For example, upon the city's request, programmers could upgrade a website that collects information on abandoned properties.

Hopeworks' hackathon comes at a time when Camden is in the midst of ambitious transformation efforts. The state government has taken over the school district and is changing the way some schools are operated. The Camden County government has taken over policing the city and has a bigger force of officers than the city had.

## Residents Want To Bootstrap Camden Out Of Dark Hole

Meanwhile, the state is offering money, in the form of tax credits, for businesses that move into the city. Subaru is not the only company moving to Camden. The Philadelphia 76ers are building a practice facility and offices in the city. Holtec, which builds equipment for nuclear power planrs, and the utility company American Water are also setting up operations in Camden.

The tech students at Hopeworks see the arrival of these businesses as a good thing. Still, it may not help the city's residents directly or immediately. The youths help Camden improve, too, Rhoten said, and can show the city that it need not rely solely on outsiders.

One of the Hopeworks students, West Lalanne, a 21-year-old Rutgers University-Camden student who lives in Camden with his mother, said that hackathons can bring people together.

"Right now Camden is a world where we have small communities," he said, "but we don't have a large community."
