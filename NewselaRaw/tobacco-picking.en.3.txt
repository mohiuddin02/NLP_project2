RICHMOND, Va. — You have to be at least 18 to buy cigarettes in the U.S. However, when it comes to working in fields of tobacco, the main ingredient in cigarettes, it seems age doesn't matter.

According to a new report, children as young as 7 are working long hours in tobacco fields. They are toiling under sometimes hazardous and sweltering conditions. The tobacco leaves they harvest are laced with nicotine and pesticides.

The new report, from a group called Human Rights Watch, is based on interviews with more than 140 children. Those children work on farms in the four states where most of the country's tobacco is grown: North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia.

The group admits that most of what it documented is legal under U.S. law. Nonetheless, it is calling on state governments and tobacco companies to do better. It is urging them to take further steps to protect children from the hazardous harvesting.

## Covered With Chemicals

"The U.S. has failed America's families," said report co-author Margaret Wurth. It is "not meaningfully protecting child farmworkers from dangers to their health and safety." Farming "is hard work anyway, but children working on tobacco farms get so sick that they throw up." Child workers get covered with chemicals "and have no real protective gear."

Children interviewed by the group said they sometimes felt sick while working on tobacco farms. They reported experiencing headaches, upset stomachs and vomiting. Most likely, the children were affected by something called Green Tobacco Sickness. This occurs when workers absorb nicotine through their skin while handling tobacco plants.

The children also said they worked long hours — often in extreme heat — without overtime pay or sufficient breaks. They said they wore no, or inadequate, protective gear.

U.S. agriculture labor laws allow children to work at younger ages and in more hazardous conditions than children in any other industry. Children as young as 12 can be hired to work on a farm of any size. And children of any age can work on small farms.

In 2011, the Labor Department proposed a new law that would prevent children under 16 from working on tobacco farms. However, the suggested changes were withdrawn in 2012.

## Urging Companies To Help

Human Rights Watch has met with many of the world's biggest cigarette makers and tobacco suppliers. The group encouraged companies to help prevent child labor.

The companies, the group said, are concerned about child labor. To help limit it, they have developed standards for the growers who supply them with tobacco. Growers are required to follow child labor laws.

Still, those efforts have only gone so far.

"The conditions are inhumane and they should improve them," said 17-year-old Erick Garcia, of North Carolina. Garcia has been working in tobacco field since he was 11.

Additionally, Garcia said kids should mostly be focused on school and shouldn't be in the fields: "That's not a place for children," he said.

Republican Kentucky state Senator Paul Hornback, who owns a tobacco farm, said he doesn't believe further restrictions are needed.

"People get pretty extreme about trying to protect everybody from everything," Hornback said. "It's hard manual labor, but there's nothing wrong with hard manual labor."
