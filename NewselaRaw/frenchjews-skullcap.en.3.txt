PARIS, France — Marseille is a city in southern France. Jews there have a difficult decision to make. Many Jewish men wear a skullcap, or a small hat, in public. It is known as a kippa. It is a reminder that God is with them. Jews are not sure if it is safe to wear the kippa in public anymore. They have to decide whether to wear the kippa or to leave it at home and stay safe.

The choice is about freedom of religion. Religious people around the world have to make the same decision. Wearing certain clothing lets others know a person's religion. This can be dangerous because people have been attacked for their faith.

## Many People Do Not Feel Safe

Israel is a country in the Middle East. A few thousand Jews from France have moved to Israel to feel safe. There has been violence against Jews in France. The Islamic State is a group causing violence, especially in the last year. It is also called ISIS. The group wants to set up its own country governed by its type of Islamic law.

A Muslim is someone who follows the religion Islam. Some Muslims and Jews do not get along.

An attack last week was the final straw for Jewish leaders in Marseille. A 15-year-old boy with a machete slashed a Jewish teacher in the street. Under police questioning, the boy blamed ISIS.

## Protecting Freedom Of Religion

Jews are concerned for their own safety. Zvi Ammar is a Jewish leader in Marseille. Ammar asked Jews not to war the kippa "until better days." 

Ammar called it the hardest decision he had ever made. Many French people were unhappy with his choice. Yet not wearing a kippa means other people will not be able to identify Jews. This might keep Jews safe from some violence.

The French government did not agree with Ammar's announcement.

Haim Korsia is another Jewish leader in France. He said, "It means that we are projecting part of the responsibility on the victim." Korsia said that freedom of religion is an important part of France. People should be able to wear a kippa without being afraid.

## Is Blending In Better?

Israel's government has a special area on its website to help Israeli travelers stay safe. It advises Israelis not to dress or act Israeli unless it is necessary. Israel is a Jewish country. Its government says that part of staying safe means not calling attention to one's religion. 

Maya Tzidon owns a shop called Kippa Centre in Tel Aviv, Israel. Tzidon said that she has customers from all over the world, including France. She said that many buy black kippas because they blend in. People are afraid to wear kippas that stand out.

Public signs of religion have put Muslims at risk, too. Some Muslim women wear headscarves or veils. This lets people know that they are Muslim, just like a kippa makes people aware that someone is Jewish.

American Muslims have reportedly been harassed and threatened more often recently. Attacks by ISIS have led to anger against Muslims. Some Muslims now feel unsafe.

## Teacher Speaks Out

Benjamin Amsellem is the teacher who was attacked recently. He was deeply shaken by the attack.

"It is something that no one can imagine and very difficult to live with," he said.

He is not alone. France records hundreds of incidents against Jews and Muslims every year. Property is vandalized, and people are hurt or killed. Thousands of Jews are leaving France for safety.
