BEIJING, China — China has promised to stop selling and processing ivory.

This could be a major victory in the battle to stop elephant poachers — but China has not said when it actually plans to put a stop to ivory trading.

Top Chinese wildlife official Meng Xianlin said his country was still deciding when and how it would take action, but he added that China could not be expected to act alone. Meng said  countries like the United States also need to toughen their regulations, too.

"Some people say, 'China should take the leadership, you first, you stop everything and other countries will follow,'" he said. Meng said a lasting solution will require more cooperation between countries over a longer period of time.

## Praise For Chinese Government's Leadership

Wildlife experts say the announcement is a major shift for China. Ending the country's legal ivory trade is seen as the greatest step that can be taken to reduce poaching. Yet how much of a difference it makes depends on when China acts, and how firmly.

Most of China's legal ivory trade is based on a very large supply imported in 2009. Legal ivory sales cover up the fact that a vast network of illegal trade fuels poaching in Africa. There is no way for consumers to know whether products have been made with poached ivory.

On May 29, China destroyed nearly 1,500 pounds of poached ivory in a public ceremony. Zhao Shucong of China's Forestry Administration announced that China would "strictly control the ivory trade and processing." Zhao said China would eventually halt commercial processing and the sale of ivory products.

Wildlife conservationists were surprised to hear Zhao's announcement. Several groups praised the Chinese government for its leadership. They say ending the legal ivory trade in China will make it much easier to stop illegal activity.

## Some Wonder If China Is Serious

Other groups  were not so quick to celebrate. Some people wondered whether China was serious about shutting down its network of carving workshops. In the past, China defended ivory carving as an important part of its culture, so people had a hard time believing the Chinese government had changed its mind. Some wondered if it would just keep selling ivory to workshops until its supply was gone.

Meng said the Chinese government was committed to building an "ecological civilization." That phrase was one of President Xi Jinping's many slogans.

Cristian Samper, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, said Meng's remarks should send a message to poachers all over the world.

Now that China's commitment is clear, Samper says its government agencies need to develop a plan and a timeline. They need to figure out how to put the decision about ivory trading into practice. Samper also insists that all consumers stop buying ivory.

China bought 62 tons of ivory from Africa in 2008, and then imported it in 2009. At the time, elephant numbers were relatively healthy and limited international trade was allowed. Since then, China has gradually released the ivory to more than 30 licensed carving workshops, but will not say how much ivory it still has left.

Meng said the Chinese government is selling five tons of ivory a year to carving workshops but would "gradually" reduce that amount to zero. He said a total ban on ivory processing and sales could come "very quickly," but then added: "One year, two years, three years, four years, 10 years. Is that quick or not quick compared to the history of the world?"

## Attitudes Are Changing Among Younger Chinese

Meanwhile, the African elephant population has been cut in half over the past 16 years. More than 20,000 animals are thought to have been killed for their tusks in each of the past two years.

Meng said attitudes toward conservation are changing throughout China, particularly among younger people. For example, fewer people want to eat shark-fin soup because it is made with an endangered animal. Rhinoceros horn, once used in traditional Chinese medicine, was banned in 1993 and is now hard to find.

However, Meng said China should not be the only country to take action.

The United States is the world's second-largest market for illegal wildlife products. It still allows trade in ivory acquired before the worldwide ban that went into effect in 1989. Trophy hunters can also import ivory into the United States as long as they do not sell it.

Europeans continue to trade ivory acquired in colonial times. Some African countries even encourage trophy hunting for income.

## U.S. Hasn't Banned Illegal Ivory Trade

In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a tightening of the rules on ivory trading. New York and New Jersey both passed laws outlawing it, but the United States has not completely banned it. The National Rifle Association still supports trophy hunting and the sale of guns with ivory handles.

"China's announcement puts the ball back in our court," said Peter LaFontaine. As campaigns officer at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, LaFontaine has written that the U.S. must lead by example. He believes the U.S. must not "be an active player in the devastation and eventual extinction of such a majestic and intelligent species.

"It's up to us to change the laws — and actually enforce them — before it's too late."
