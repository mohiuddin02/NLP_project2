In November 2014, two police officers in Cleveland shot and killed the 12-year-old boy. The police were checking out a 911 call. The officers saw Rice and thought he was holding a real gun. It was a toy. The officers were white. The boy was black.

## Calling On LeBron For Help

Last month, a court decided that the officers should not be charged with killing Rice. If they were charged, there would be another court case. If they were found guilty, they might have to go to jail.

Many people were upset with the decision. They felt it was unfair to Tamir Rice.

James is the closest thing Ohio has to a superhero. Activists are people fighting to help Rice's family get justice.They asked James for help. They asked him not to play basketball. They used Twitter to reach out to James. They want to use him to make the government put the officers on trial. The government's Department of Justice is looking into Rice's death.

## Sending A Message

Last year, James said Tamir Rice's death sent a message. He said it showed that black people still are not treated fairly.

James used to play for the Miami Heat. In 2012, James and his Miami Heat teammates put on hoodie sweatshirts. They did it to honor another dead black teen. Trayvon Martin was killed in Florida by a white man. Martin was wearing a hoodie when he died.

## When Athletes Take A Stand

Some Rice supporters have posted videos of another famous athlete, Muhammad Ali. In the 1960s, Ali was the greatest boxer in the world. At the time, men could be called to serve in the U.S. Army. There was a war in Vietnam, a country in southeast Asia.

Ali was asked to serve in the Army and said no. This was against the law.

Ali said many black people in America were treated like dogs. They did not have simple human rights. Ali is black and a Muslim. He did not want to go fight in Vietnam when there were race problems in America. He also said it was against his religion.

In 1967, A judge said Ali had to pay $10,000. His boxing championship title was taken away from him. He was not allowed to box for three years.

James has not yet said if he would sit out and not play basketball.
