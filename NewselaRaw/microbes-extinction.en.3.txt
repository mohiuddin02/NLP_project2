LOS ANGELES â€” About 252 million years ago, long before there were even dinosaurs, most of the living things on Earth died. Scientists call this event the end-Permian extinction.

It has long been a mystery over what happened that killed off nearly all life. Now they have a new idea of how it may have happened. A new study suggests that tiny microbes on the bottom of the ocean may have been to blame.

Microbes are very small living things that can only be seen through a microscope. They are usually bacteria. These particular microbes were so small, that 1 billion of them could fit in a thimble-full of ocean dirt.

The end-Permian extinction lasted for 20,000 years. Scientists say that nearly nine-tenths of all life on Earth was destroyed during that time.

Gregory Fournier is a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He said the end-Permian extinction was worse than what killed the dinosaurs. "Things were very close to being over for good," he said.

## CO2's Rapid Rise

Scientists have struggled to understand exactly what caused the long extinction. There was a quick increase of CO2 levels at the time. That would have caused the oceans to turn to acid. The Earth would have become hotter. Most forms of life would not have been able to survive in such conditions. But what actually caused the CO2 levels to rise has remained a mystery.

Some scientists have suggested an asteroid could be to blame. Others say it was volcanoes or coal fires.

Now, researchers from MIT and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have named a new and unlikely suspect. They blame a tiny microbe called Methanosarcina that puts out methane gas.

MIT scientist Dan Rothman was looking at how carbon levels grew during this time and found the first clue that microbes could have been involved. What he saw was not a straight line. It was a rapid upward curve.

A sudden fire in a coal field in Siberia would not have created CO2 that way, he said. What he saw was in line with the work of microbes.

It was the first time anyone had suggested microbes might be involved with the end-Permian extinction. But microbes have been accused of changing the chemistry of our planet at other times. For example, microbes are responsible for creating the first oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.

"What they do" is very important, Rothman said. "And if they do better or worse, things change."

## Increase In Nickel

Fournier put it this way: "Microbiologists like to say, 'Microbes rule the Earth, and we just live on it.'"

To figure out which microbe might been responsible, Rothman took his research to Fournier. Fournier had written a paper about Methanosarcina in 2008. The paper showed that sometime in the last 400 million years, Methanosarcina got a new gene. The new gene allowed it to produce methane more easily than ever before.

Fournier worked to figure out more precisely when the gene change happened. He found it most likely occurred about 250 million years ago.

The researchers cannot say for certain that the microbe and the huge amount of methane it produced were responsible for the end-Permian extinction. Still, they do have one more line of evidence to support their idea. In order to make methane, Methanosarcina needs nickel.

Much of the volcanic activity at the time occurred in Siberia. It has some of the world's largest supplies of nickel. Furthermore, the researchers found an increase in nickel in dirt from that time.

"Our proposal is unusual, but it does bring together many observations, and ties a lot of stuff together," Rothman said. "That doesn't make it right." But it is enough to do more tests to see if that's what really happened, he said.
