MINNEAPOLIS â€” When he was a youngster, A.J. Briscoe was a strong student who had the chance to go to special schools in his area. But he lived in a tough neighborhood and he began to look up to young men he saw with fancy things and new cars. These guys were making lots of money in ways that were against the law. Briscoe joined them and became a gang member.

Briscoe was 12 the first time he was arrested. The police stopped him with drugs in his pocket. He spent a week in a jail for young people. By the time he was 14, Briscoe said, he had made $200,000 selling drugs on the streets.

The temptations of the criminal life were strong and Briscoe told himself he was not hurting anybody, he was just selling drugs.

## Always In More Trouble

It wasn't long before Briscoe ran into more trouble with the police. A pattern began: he would be arrested, charged with a crime, sent to jail. He sold drugs in 32 states and was put behind bars many times.

For the last 22 years of his life, Briscoe has been either in prison or on probation. After being released from prison he was put on probation. It meant he could only live in certain places. He had to report what he did every day and deal with surprise visits by his probation officer.

In prison, though, one unlikely thing changed Briscoe's life and put him on the right path: reading.

## Reading Turns Into Bigger Dreams

Briscoe's change came after he saw another prisoner trying to read a children's book to his son. The prisoner struggled to read. He was illiterate. Briscoe could read, but he started to think about his own children. How would he teach them?

"It haunted me to think about my own son asking me to help him with his homework," he said. From then on, Briscoe read everything he could get his hands on. Prison became his college.

Once, reading saved his life. Briscoe was facing serious criminal charges that could have sent him to prison for 60 years. He dug through law books and found a mistake in the case against him. When his lawyer presented the mistake to the judge, Briscoe got only three years instead of 60.

Briscoe is now dedicated to pursuing his dream: becoming a businessman who encourages young people to read and spreads a message of hope.

## Encouraging And Helping Other Kids

He began his pro-reading project while he was in prison in Tennessee. He started a program to encourage prisoners to read: all the prisoners would give a little money, and the money would be used to get new books for the prison library.

These days, Briscoe wants to help young people who may be facing the same temptations he did. Briscoe started a program called To Succeed You Must Read! It reaches out to students in schools and libraries. It includes a summer book club. Briscoe plans to visit 200 poor schools to encourage reading and to help kids follow their dreams, and fight their fears.

Briscoe has a partner and supporter, Sundia Briscoe. They married five years ago.

"Sundia," he said, "taught me how to love people."

## Amazing To Be Truly Free

A.J. and Sundia live in a home filled with African art. On their front porch is a bookshelf, where kids can take books for free. There is plenty of taking, Sundia said with a laugh.

"Every day, in the summer especially, I come home to kids waiting on the stairs. They want to eat, because he's always cooking or baking. They grab a book. They're so excited to just be around him," she said.

A.J. recently celebrated the first day that he was completely free from government supervision. His probation had ended. It rained that day. His car broke down. He missed a meeting. It was still an "amazing" day, he said.

For the first time in 22 years, he was truly free.
