This may prompt you to snicker. Don't. It's not funny, and the fact that nice people avoid talking about human waste contributes to what is an enormous and deadly problem.

In India, for example, the United Nations estimates that more than 600 million people don't use toilets. They don't use latrines — toilets built over holes in the ground — either. They go on the ground.

And that's just one country. Even though major improvements have occurred in the past 20 years, an estimated 1 billion people worldwide still go out in the open. Another 700 million use unhygienic bathroom facilities such as "hanging latrines" that deposit directly into streams, or buckets that are simply emptied in the streets.

## Deaths From Diarrhea

All told, estimates of annual deaths from diarrhea range as high as 1.5 million, the majority of them caused by water made dirty by human waste. Most of the victims are under 5 years old.

Diarrhea causes people to go to the bathroom several times a day, and lose fluids and salts in the process. If not stopped, it can lead to death.

The number of children who die every day from diarrhea-related diseases is "shocking," said Robert Zimmerman, an engineer at Kohler.

Can Kohler help? The company is mostly known for producing expensive faucets and sinks. The firm's marketing describes its dedication to "gracious living." Building toilets for the world's poor is not what made the company famous.

But Kohler also is among the world's five largest manufacturers of plumbing products. And in 2011 the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, started by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates and considered the country's most generous foundation, announced its "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge." That made Kohler take notice.

It's been a long time since the toilet has changed much. The modern flush toilet works in about the same way as the one invented in the late 1500s by Sir John Harington. He was a witty English author who installed one of his toilets in a palace of Queen Elizabeth I.

And with some improvements in the 18th and 19th centuries, the flush toilet has worked pretty well. It has contributed greatly to reducing disease — when it's well-connected. But it's not much help unless it is hooked up to a system to treat the waste it swirls away. In much of the world, that sort of infrastructure, with pipes and waste treatment plants, doesn't exist.

"That's very, very expensive," said Doulaye Kone, an environmental engineer who grew up in a village in Africa's Ivory Coast. He works at the Gates Foundation. "It will work in very few (developing world) cities."

## A Self-Contained Toilet

So the foundation called for off-the-grid designs that don't need to be connected to water, sewer or electrical lines. It gave grant money to eight universities. One grant went to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) team led by environmental science professor Michael Hoffmann.

The plan: Develop a self-contained toilet and waste treatment system powered by a solar panel generating enough energy to store for use at night.

Kohler contacted Caltech and offered to supply fixtures for the first prototype model.

The Caltech toilet went on to win the Gates challenge in 2012. Hoffmann and his students will fine-tune the first model and get it ready for field testing in India, set to begin later this year. Kohler has offered to continue its support.

Kohler provided Caltech with parts for further test models. The company also offered design advice on creating a toilet "that is culturally appropriate for the India market," Zimmerman said.

The Caltech effort is just one of several that the Gates Foundation is supporting. Kohler rival American Standard Brands also received a grant. That company has plunged more directly into the work than has Kohler.

American Standard has taken a low-tech approach. The company developed a plastic toilet pan that uses a mechanical trap door and water seal designed to close off the holes under latrines from the open air and prevent flies from entering.

## Donating Devices To Bangladesh

Last year, American Standard donated more than 500,000 of the devices to organizations in Bangladesh, the company said. The firm now is working in Kenya on an effort, also supported by the Gates Foundation, to develop a similarly simple device for areas that lack abundant water.

American's Standard's approach is cheap. One problem with the Caltech toilet is cost. Hoffmann estimates that initially it will take $1,500 to $2,000 to build.

The Caltech toilet — with its solar panel and battery — also has been criticized as being too complicated.

Hoffmann says that it's just the first model and can be simplified.

But Pete Kolsky, a water and sanitation expert and professor at the University of North Carolina, believes the whole "reinvent the toilet" idea needs to be put in the proper light.

The developing world's sanitation problems are immediate and they are far more about organization, motivation and their own societies than they are about technology, he said.

Hoffmann, though, is convinced that technology can help solve sanitation problems where other approaches, he said, have had little success.

"This can be done," he said. "Fifty years ago, computers were too costly and complicated for the average person. Today almost everyone carries a computer in their pocket."
