EXCELSIOR, Minn. — On a crisp late fall afternoon, David Bedford plucks an apple from a young tree. He chomps into the fruit and chews thoughtfully.

It is "perfectly good," he says, but no more than that. It's "not excellent — not a wow." He tosses the apple to the ground, then sprays a stripe of orange paint down the trunk that tells the orchard crew to take it down. "You're going to the firewood farm," he tells the tree, with a wry grin.

Bedford is mild-mannered and even-tempered, but unforgiving in his quest to produce the next great apple.

After many years as an apple breeder, Bedford knows what he is looking for — and this apple isn't it. So the tree has to go to make room for other, more promising varieties.

## "That Crunch, That Juiciness"

Bedford is a scientist with the University of Minnesota's apple-breeding program. During peak apple season here in Excelsior, he tastes around 500 to 600 apples a day.

His sense of what is a good apple and what is not has shaped the choices available in grocery stores around the world.

"He's one of the elite breeders for apples in the world," said grower John Jacobson. "One of his strengths is his ability to take an apple, bite it and project what's going to be popular." He can immediately spot "that crunch, that juiciness" that people love.

Bedford does not do the job alone. He and Jim Luby, who directs the university's fruit-breeding program, have been collaborating on apple selection for 30 years. During their partnership, the program has released six new varieties: Honeycrisp, Zestar!, SnowSweet, Minneiska — also known as SweeTango — Frostbite and most recently MN55. The last-named one will not be available commercially for several years.

## Tasting And Tossing

Bedford is the guy who does the day-to-day work. He is the one who personally tastes all those so-so apples in hopes of finding "the next Honeycrisp, or something even better."

"He's our front line, making the decisions about what gets thrown out — and 99 percent gets thrown out," Luby said.

Of the surviving 1 percent, Honeycrisp is the program's rock star. Introduced in 1991, it is now the sixth-largest apple in production in the United States, according to Mark Seetin of the U.S. Apple Association. "It has exploded in the last five years — it's a doggone good apple," Seetin said.

The university's apple operation, one of the nation's three major breeding programs, is more than a century old. It has 27 apple introductions to its credit, but Honeycrisp put it on the map, in Jacobson's opinion. "When they released Honeycrisp, they hit it out of the park."

## Tree Rescue

Bedford did not breed the first Honeycrisp tree — that was done before his time. However, he and Luby were the ones who noticed how good it was and saved it from being abandoned and lost forever.

"Here's a little-known secret of Honeycrisp: It got thrown away by the original breeder — it had some winter injury," Bedford said. That first tree was destroyed, but four clones made from grafting Honeycrisp branches onto another type of tree had survived. His first taste of the "explosively crisp" fruit made an unforgettable impression. "I've tasted millions of apples, and I can still remember my first Honeycrisp and my first SweeTango."

Other apples bring up less fond memories. Bedford is not shy about trash-talking Red Delicious, the unimpressive variety he grew up eating in North Carolina that made him think he didn't even like apples.

## Apples Have Many Flavors

Sampling apples with Bedford is a bit like tasting wine with a wine expert. As he shares each slice, he points out apples that taste like cherry Lifesavers, or that have hints of flower or herbal flavors.

Bedford looks for 20 characteristics when sizing up apples, but some traits carry more weight than others — and appearance is secondary. Crunchiness and flavor "are the two most important things," he said.

To achieve that perfectly crunchy, flavorful apple, Bedford pairs different parent trees.

MN55, the latest promising apple the program has come up with, is the child of Honeycrisp and an Arkansas variety. The result is an apple that tastes much like Honeycrisp but is more heat-tolerant and ripens earlier.

Jacobson was convinced that MN55 was a winner after tasting one of the red apples in mid-August. "I ate it, and thought, 'This is really something.'"

He shared his enthusiasm with Bedford, who in his usual, laid-back way just said, "We've gotta do a little more testing on it."

Bedford, 63, has no desire to retire anytime soon. "We are nowhere near reaching the limit of how far we can go," he said.

Bedford says he hopes to keep breeding apples as long as he is physically able. "If an apple a day keeps the doctor away, I'll live forever," he said with a smile.
