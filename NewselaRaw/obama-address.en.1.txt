WASHINGTON — In an effort to energize his slow second term, President Barack Obama made a promise on Tuesday night in his State of the Union address. He vowed to sidestep Congress "whenever and wherever" necessary to close the economic gap between rich and poor. He revealed an array of modest executive actions, including an increase to the minimum wage for federal contract workers. He is also planning to make it easier for millions of low-income Americans to save for retirement.

"America does not stand still and neither do I," Obama declared in his prime-time address. A joint session of Congress was present and millions of Americans watched his speech on television.

Obama's hour-long address served as the opening charge in a midterm election fight to control Congress that will quickly consume Washington's attention. Democrats are seeking to cast Republicans as uncaring about the middle class. They have urged Obama to focus on the gap between the wealthy and poor, and to help kids born poor get a chance to enter the middle class. His emphasis on executive actions was greeted with shouts of "Do it!" from many members of his party.

Declaring 2014 a "year of action," Obama also sought to convince a doubtful public that he still holds power in Washington even if he can't crack through a divided Congress. The White House was burned by a series of legislative failures in 2013. Now, the president's aides say they're redefining success not by what Obama can jam through Congress but by what actions he can take on his own.

## Wages And Health Care

Obama had only a few proposals for action by lawmakers. What he had was largely focused on old ideas that made little progress over the past year. He pressed Congress to revive a stalled immigration overhaul. He also wants to pass an across-the-board increase in the federal minimum wage and give more children access to early childhood education.

Republicans have lost popularity in recent months, too. They have also been talking about income inequality in recent months. But they blame the widening gap between rich and poor on Obama's economic policies.

At an emotional high point in the speech, Obama singled out Cory Remsburg. Remsburg is an Army Ranger who was a guest of first lady Michelle Obama. He was nearly killed in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) during one of his 10 deployments. He rose slowly from his seat and was greeted by long and thunderous applause from the president and lawmakers.

Even as Washington increasingly focuses on income inequality, many parts of the economy are gaining strength. Corporate profits are soaring and the financial markets are hitting record highs. But with millions of Americans still out of work or struggling with wages that haven't increased in years, Obama has found himself in the sometimes awkward position of promoting a recovery that feels distant for many.

"The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by, let alone get ahead," Obama said. "And too many still aren't working at all."

The president earned some of his loudest applause — at least from Democrats — when he took on lawmakers who oppose his health care law. The law floundered in its initial rollout last fall. Obama said that while he doesn't expect to convince Republicans on the merits of the law, "I know that the American people aren't interested in refighting old battles."

## "Give America A Raise"

The president's speech drew an interesting mix of visitors to the House chamber. Among those sitting with Mrs. Obama were two survivors of the Boston Marathon bombing, as well as Jason Collins, an openly gay former NBA player.

Republican House Speaker John Boehner brought business owners from his home state of Ohio who say Obama's health care law is hurting their companies. Willie Robertson, a star of the television show "Duck Dynasty," also scored a seat alongside Republicans.

Though Obama sought to emphasize his presidential powers, there are limits to what he can do alone. For example, he can raise the minimum hourly wage for new federal contractors from $7.25 to $10.10, as he announced. But he'll need Congress in order to extend that increase to all of America's workers.

Republicans quickly said this plan was ineffective. Said Boehner: "The question is how many people, Mr. President, will this executive action actually help? I suspect the answer is somewhere close to zero."

White House officials countered by saying many more working people would benefit if Congress would go along with Obama's plan to raise the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) for everyone.

"Give America a raise," Obama declared.

## Immigration Law Makeover

The president also plans to pass a law to help workers whose employers don't offer retirement savings plans. He wants to help companies that hire the long-term unemployed, and he wants to create programs that train workers and improve environmental policies.

The president's plan to make changes himself is, in a way, his admitting that he failed to make good on two major promises to the American people: that he would unite Washington and that his re-election would clear the way for congressional action on major projects.

Some Republicans have warned that the president's focus on executive orders could backfire by angering Republican leaders.

Obama isn't abandoning Congress completely. He made a renewed pitch to make over the nation's immigration laws, perhaps his best opportunity for signing major bills into law this year. But it is unlikely, with many Republicans against Obama's plan to create a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million people already in the U.S. illegally.

Seeking to give Republicans some room to maneuver, Obama did not specifically call for a citizenship pathway Tuesday, saying only, "Let's get it done. It's time."
