SYRACUSE, Utah — For many years, farmer Neal Briggs has looked east to the mighty Wasatch mountains for a hint at how much water his fields would get.

Each spring, he could see snowy peaks along the Rocky mountains nearby. From these he could guess the amount of water that would fill streams and flow into his fields of wheat and alfalfa.

Now, as a historic drought lingers, Briggs looks to the mountains and sees mostly bare rock. And down in his fields he sees another problem: an infestation of insects.

"A farmer who's heavily in debt probably won't make it," said Briggs, 59. He cultivates 300 acres half an hour northwest of Salt Lake City.

## "A Picture Of A Dead Cow"

This year, the state suffered its warmest and least-snowy winter since the late 1800s, when Utah was still a territory, and not yet a state. The snowpack has melted at the lowest elevation in the mountains, and most of the higher altitudes will soon follow.

"This is one of those years farmers will tell their grandkids about," said Utah state water expert Randall Julander. "About just how dry it was and how bad it was."

Drought now grips 40 percent of the West, with no end in sight. Globally, 9 of the 10 warmest years recorded since 1880 have occurred since 2000, officials say.

Utah's farming business is much smaller than California's. Utah's agricultural sales for 2013 reached $1.8 billion, well below California's $46.4 billion. Officials here have begun to ration water, and Briggs and other farmers worry about more cutbacks this summer.

Streams and reservoirs are running between 10 percent and 40 percent of normal. A 1-to-100 scale that state officials use to rank their volume shows a low of 3 and an average of 25. "Twenty-five is bad," Julander said. "Three is a picture of a dead cow with a couple of buzzards on it."

## Aphids Attacking His Crops

Briggs sees another challenge from Utah's weird winter: an infestation of killer aphid bugs.

Russian wheat and pea aphids normally freeze in the winter. They survived it this year to assault farmland this spring. Briggs didn't even know the speck-like insects were ravaging his fields. Then he spotted tens of thousands of predator ladybugs drawn to feast on the aphids — making the fields a sea of green with red polka dots.

"I thought, 'Maybe we'll get by,'" he recalled, sitting in the kitchen of his farmhouse. "You know, let nature do what nature does."

A week later, he stood in his fields and nearly cried. Even the vast numbers of ladybugs couldn't stop the pests. The aphids were spreading, eating through both his wheat and alfalfa crops, and injecting a toxin that kills the plants. Briggs' alfalfa crop has now been sprayed with an insecticide that killed the aphids, but spared the ladybugs. Now, most of the farmers are back in control of their alfalfa crops. The aphids, however, are still damaging wheat.

## It Could Be Worse Than Last Year

Briggs, a father of six who farms with two of his sons, has watched the water levels in streams get lower each spring. Even so, he stays hopeful.

"Even if we have a bad year, we figure the next year will be a good one," said Briggs. "Even if we have five bad years in a row, we're still looking for that next good year."

Meanwhile, Utah keeps its eyes toward the sky.

Randy Parker is the head of a Utah farmers group. He believes this year will be even worse than last year if they're not "blessed by Mother Nature." The right balance of moisture and summer temperatures is badly needed in Utah.

In May, a show-stopping rainstorm raged for two days straight. It dumped 2 inches of rain on land that averages only 17 inches a year. Briggs recalls rushing out to check his backyard water gauge and texting his son, Aaron, with each significant rise.

"Yeah!" came his son's response. "Woo-hoo!"

## "We'll Continue To Farm"

Farming has always been a gamble. If it's not the drought one year, it's plummeting prices for selling produce the next year or higher taxes charged by the government. Through it all, Briggs says, he prefers the lifestyle of the farm and says his children have been his most rewarding crop.

Inside their kitchen, Briggs, his wife, Caroline, and Aaron talk about the future. They don't expect the water runoff from the Wasatch mountains to ever be the same again.

"Despite any drought, we're farmers and we'll continue to farm," Caroline said. "It's our life."
