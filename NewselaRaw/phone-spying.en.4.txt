WASHINGTON - New information keeps coming out about U.S. spying. Reports say the United States has spied on friendly countries. It gathered information about phone calls made by millions of Europeans. It may have even gathered information about phone calls by Germany's leader.

The White House said Monday that there needs to be new limits on how the U.S. gathers private information. A top senator also announced that spying on friendly nations would stop.

All the talk of spying has put pressure on President Barack Obama.

Obama was interviewed on television Monday. But he would not discuss anything about how the National Security Agency (NSA) monitored phone calls. He would not talk about whether the spy agency tapped the telephones of Germany's leader. Or if it tapped the phones of 34 other world leaders.

## Anger Here And Overseas

News came out that the  U.S. secretly tracked calls in France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Brazil. The details come from top-secret papers. Edward Snowden leaked those papers to reporters. Snowden used to work for the NSA. Some of the countries that the United States is closest with are upset.

People in the United States are also angry. They do not like the NSA collecting information about millions of Americans' calls. The spying was part of a plan to stop terror attacks.

"Obama must feel very uneasy and embarrassed right now," said Hans Christian Stroebel. He is a German politician.

White House officials did not want to answer questions about the spying. They would not discuss when it began. Officials also would not say who approved the spying.

Congress is angry that it had not been informed, either. Congress is supposed to watch over the U.S. spy agencies. Sen. Dianne Feinstein heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. She said it would hold "a major review" into all spying operations.

## A Balancing Act

Feinstein said that Obama did not know U.S. spies were tracking Angela Merkel's calls since 2002. Merkel is the German leader. "That is a big problem," Feinstein added. The White House has told her the NSA would stop spying on U.S. allies, she said. She supports the decision. But she said Congress needs to know exactly what U.S. spies are doing.

She said this about the NSA gathering information about leaders of countries that work with the U.S.: "I am totally opposed."

Two Spanish newspapers reported on a document leaked by Snowden. They said it showed that the NSA collected information on 60 million telephone calls. The calls were made in Spain between December 2012 and early January.

Similar reports came out in Italy and France.

Spanish officials called the U.S. Ambassador in to discuss the matter. The Ambassador lives in Spain and represents the U.S. After the meeting, he made a statement. He said that the United States needs to balance privacy and security.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said something similar.

Carney also said that technology is getting much better. That means there are more ways to gather secret information. That also means there needs to be more limits.
