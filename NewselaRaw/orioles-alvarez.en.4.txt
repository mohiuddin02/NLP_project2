Dariel Alvarez wasn't sure he would finish the trip from Cuba to Mexico. It wasn't easy to escape from his native country. At one point, his boat ran out of fuel. He didn't eat for days.

"I was scared to come so far and fall short," Alvarez said, in Spanish.

Now, the 25-year-old outfielder is one of the best prospects of the Baltimore Orioles. Alvarez might play in Major League Baseball soon.

His journey from Cuba to the Norfolk Tides, a minor league baseball team, was not easy. It is against the law for Cubans to leave their country. Alvarez had to sneak off the island.

If he got caught, he would go to prison in Cuba. Alvarez was willing to risk it. He wanted to help his family and follow his dreams of playing baseball in America.

## "Come Here, Succeed"

Alvarez left Cuba knowing he might never see his family again. He left without saying goodbye to several friends. He eventually reached safety in Mexico.

To play sports in the United States, Cubans need a special permit, called an unblocking license. Alvarez waited more than year for his unblocking license. He couldn't play baseball for that year. He also couldn't go back to Cuba.

Alvarez said the Cuban government won't allow him back into the country until 2021. He says he wishes that time would pass faster. When his grandmother died, he could only call home.

Alvarez considers other Cuban baseball players in America his brothers. They all have stories of escaping Cuba. They all dreamed about playing baseball in the major leagues.

He has spoken to many of them on different Major League teams. Some of them are star players, like Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox.

"They're examples to follow," Alvarez said. "They're Cuban, they came here, they triumphed. That's what we all want. Come here, succeed, and leave our names in this country representing Cuba."

## Raw Power And Speed

Alvarez is close to his goal of joining his friends in the major leagues.

In June, the outfielder was invited to the All-Star Futures Game in Minneapolis. Many current All-Stars once played in the Futures Game.

Four days after the Futures Game, the Orioles moved Alvarez up to their team in Norfolk. The Tides play at the highest level of baseball below the major leagues.

The Baltimore Orioles are aware of Alvarez's skills. They know they have a player with raw power, speed, and natural talent.

On defense, he covers a lot of ground in the outfield. Coaches know he also has a strong throwing arm.

Orioles manager Buck Showalter thinks Alvarez still needs to improve his batting. Showalter has high hopes though. He thinks Alvarez could play in the major leagues.

"We think he has the best arm of everyone" with the Orioles, Showalter said.

## "My Family By My Side"

Alvarez's future was not always that bright. When he came to America, he signed with the Orioles for $800,000 in 2013. Some Cuban stars made millions of dollars more than Alvarez.

The money was still an improvement from baseball in Cuba. Alvarez said he used to make just $12 a month.

Alvarez said he would have taken whatever the Orioles would have offered him. He wanted to play baseball more than anything else.

Alvarez met his girlfriend, Patricia Canedo, in the U.S. They're going to have a baby boy in September. Canedo is working to become an American citizen. The Cuban government might permit Alvarez's family to visit when that happens. Alvarez hopes to introduce his mother to her American-born grandson someday.

"The only thing left to make me the happiest man in the world is to have my family by my side," he said.
