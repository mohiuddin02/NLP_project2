DETROIT — General Motors is raising prices to try to sell more pickup trucks.

Wait, raising prices?! That is not the way it usually works. Companies usually lower prices if they want to increase sales.

But GM is going the opposite way to try to win in the red-hot U.S. pickup truck market. At least that is its first step.

The automaker is increasing the cost of its 2014 Chevrolet Silverado truck by 8.5 percent. GM is also raising the cost its GMC Sierra trucks.

## Raising Prices To Lower Them Again

Industry watchers suspect the move is just one part of a plan to sell more trucks. They expect the car maker to begin offering incentives, or discounts, next month that will cut the final price.

The incentives will make buyers feel like they're getting a deal. Of course, everyone likes to think they're getting a deal. But whether they actually save money or not depends on the size of the discounts.

The move comes after GM's pickup truck sales fell 8 percent in September, while its two biggest competitors saw increased sales. Sales of Ford's F-Series rose 10 percent. The F-series are the best-selling pickups in America. Chrysler's Ram sold 8 percent more trucks. The Detroit Three –– as GM, Ford and Chrysler are called –– sell the majority of pickup trucks. Between them, they share 90 percent of the market. The Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan trucks have the rest.

## Using The Web To Find A Steal

Ford and Chrysler offered car buyers good deals last month, said Jesse Toprak. Toprak is an analyst for the TrueCar.com auto pricing website. Raising prices and then offering discounts on cars and trucks is common. Truck buyers especially like to get good deals, Toprak said.

GM's plan is meant mainly to help the dealers that sell its trucks increase sales, he said. The price of trucks built after Oct. 7 will go up. Those on car lots now will stay the same.

GM officials may be counting on a change in buying habits. Car buyers do not pay as much attention to the list price of a car as they used to. Toprak says most buyers do research online first. Many independent auto websites suggest prices people should pay that are below the list price, he said. The websites are not connected to car dealers or manufacturers.

Smart customers know how to get a better deal, he said.

## Sizing Up The Competition

In May, Nissan Motor Co. did the opposite of what GM is doing. The Japanese automaker lowered the price of its cars. It did this so that the cars would show up high in Internet search results. Nissan sales are up 13 percent since then.

GM spokesman Jim Cain would not comment on any future discounts. Its current round of incentives end Oct. 31. But he said that the discounts help dealers sell cars. Customers can use the discounts to help pay for them.

Last month, GM spent less money on truck discounts than the year before. The discounts averaged $3,430 less on the Silverado. They averaged $3,339 less on the Sierra, according to TrueCar. Both Chrysler and Ford offered bigger discounts on their 2013 models last month.

Under GM's new plan, the price on the basic Silverado will rise from $24,585 to $26,670. This includes shipping.

When the trucks were introduced, GM kept prices the same as on 2013 models. The increase has been planned for a long time, Cain said.

The Silverado now will cost $1,780 more than Chrysler's Ram Truck. It will cost $1,605 more than Ford's F-150.

Cain says GM can charge higher prices because it has the newest truck in the market. The Silverado also has the most features. The trucks also go farther on a gallon of gas, too.
