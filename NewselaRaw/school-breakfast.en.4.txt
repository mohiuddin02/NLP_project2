Students get many things at school. They get homework. They get grades. Many also get breakfast in class.

Many schools give breakfast to poor students. The food costs less or is free. Breakfast is served before class. Students eat in the cafeteria.

Now, some schools are changing how they serve food. They want to help even more kids. So schools are starting to serve food during class. Teachers serve food to poor students and rich students. All children can eat if they are hungry.

## Cereal, Apples And More

Some people say these programs help kids. Not everyone agrees.

Many people think it is good to hand out breakfast at school. They say breakfast helps kids learn. Hungry students might not do well.

Stanley Mosk Elementary is a school in Los Angeles. The school gives all students breakfast each morning. Teachers pass out the food. Then they show a short video. It tells kids how to eat healthy. It takes about 10 minutes for them to eat.

Students eat different kinds of food for breakfast. They get apples, cereal and a breakfast sandwich. Sometimes there are leftovers. Not everyone wants to eat.

## Some Say No Food In Class!

Some people do not like the breakfast programs. They do not think students should eat during class. Eating takes away from learning time. Giving breakfast to all students can waste time and food.
