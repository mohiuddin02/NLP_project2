PUEBLA, Mexico — A plain-spoken Mexican nun, who is trying to save her congregation from debt, has become an unlikely television star.

Sixty-eight-year-old Florinda Ruiz Carapia, better known as "Hermana Flor," is one of five finalists on Mexico's version of "Master Chef." Contestants compete for a 1-million-peso prize, which equals $59,000. Her order, the Congregation of the Passion of Jesus Christ, owes 7 million pesos for loans it took out to build or expand schools, according to Alejandro Esquivel, producer of the show on the TV Azteca station.

Jose Antonio Barrientos, a missionary in the order, confirmed the debt problems. A missionary travels to other countries to help poor people, and promote Christianity. He said the order is also worried that new government requirements might mean that the order's schools would need expensive renovations — which would only add to the debt.

## Down To The Final Five

Hermana Flor has already made it past several stages that have narrowed down the contestants from 300 wannnabe chefs to five finalists. With only three weeks left till the show's end, Hermana Flor has proven so popular that Esquivel is a little worried about the potential backlash if the nun does not win. A panel of professional chefs judges the contestants on the taste, presentation and speed of their dishes.

"I think Hermana Flor's popularity comes from her being a very straightforward, very human, very sympathetic person," Esquivel said. "I think there will be disappointment if anyone is eliminated, but obviously, that will be much greater if it is Hermana Flor because the audiences like her so much."

It's not all sugar and sweetness from Hermana Flor, and in fact it is her tasty, fiery chile sauces that have gotten her this far.

Hermana Flor cooks three meals a day for 150 students who are studying at a seminary to become priests. She runs a simple but nutritious operation: A small mill grinds moist heaps of corn for fresh tortillas, sheep graze outside the windows, pigs and chickens eat the kitchen scraps and leftovers go to local hospitals.

## Lessons In Lobster And Chops

But it leaves Hermana Flor struggling with arranging food on plates and presentation, things she doesn't worry about when hungry would-be priests pile into the dining hall. When that happens, she sets out a giant plate full of food for each table of 10, and everybody serves himself.

She also was baffled when the judges at "Master Chef" made her cook a lobster. "There are a lot of things I don't know how to use, like the lobster," she said. "That's a kind of seafood I've never cooked here. We don't have the money for that kind of thing."

She also was a bit intimidated by thick cuts of meat.

"I did a chop (on the show), and it came out raw because it was so thick. I ruined it," said the sister, who is just under 5 feet tall. "Look at this," she said, pointing to a metal bowl of thin-cut flank steaks marinating in the seminary's kitchen. "The steaks we have here are paper-thin; you put them on the grill and they're done. We don't have any medium, medium-rare, none of that here."

## Keeping It Fresh And Classic

To dress up a typical day's lunch menu, Hermana Flor uses the classic, local ingredients that do not cost much and pack a punch. On a recent day, she is cooking beef, grilled nopal cactus, grilled onions, rice, beans and tortillas.

"There is always chile in Mexico, and lots of it, and tomatoes and onions," she said, adding, "With that, I can make you a tasty dish."

The three judges on the show agree, praising the sister's sauces. She has earned more than 31,000 followers on her Twitter account in the 15 weeks since the show began, and fans crowd her Facebook page with comments like, "You're an inspiration!" and "She's Mexico's favorite nun."

But just do not try to congratulate Hermana Flor yet.

"Don't tell me I'm famous. I'm not famous until I get that money in my hand," she said. "I want to win because I want to help others. I still have five (contestants) to go, and fame hasn't done anything for me yet. It hasn't given me 1 cent."

Keeping an eye over the helpers in her industrial-size kitchen, Hermana Flor noted, "There's never enough money in the religious orders. Money is never wasted."

## Cooking To Pay Down Her Order's Debt

She said she dreams of helping her order get out of debt and funding missions to help poor people in Africa or Mexico.

"We have debts, we have missions where we provide aid, and so with this contest, and the million pesos they offer ... I am going to be able to help," she said in a friendly but determined way.

She would also like to attract new recruits to her religious order that is growing older and smaller, as nuns there age and fewer young women choose to replace them.

"I'd like to invite the girls who are watching me (on television) and want to be like me to come to the convent, so the order can grow, and so there can be many, many Hermanas Flor."
