The increase was driven by soaring rents, low wages and high unemployment.

The new report was prepared by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, which conducts a tally of the homeless every two years in both the city and county of Los Angeles.

## Living In Tents, Camps And Cars

One of the report's more disturbing findings is that the number of tents, makeshift camps and vehicles occupied by homeless people has soared 85 percent, to 9,535.

"It's everywhere now; the encampments are in residential neighborhoods, they're outside of schools," said Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Bonin, who represents the Venice section of Los Angeles. "It shows we've got a hell of a lot of work ahead."

The increase in homelessness was fueled by rising rents and home prices in downtown Los Angeles and Venice. Cheap hotel rooms, motels and single-room apartments in those areas — once the last refuge of the poor — are being eliminated.

Rapid change in these neighborhoods has led to increasing pressure and conflict. In just over two months, there have been two fatal police shootings of unarmed homeless men. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is investigating the March 1 death of Charly Keunang and the killing last week of Brendon K. Glenn.

Mark Ryavec, president of the Venice Stakeholders Association, called on Mayor Eric Garcetti and other elected officials to address the issue. "Fixing this situation is their responsibility, not just the LAPD's," he said.

## Lack Of Affordable Housing

Countywide, more than 44,000 homeless people were tallied in January, up from more than 39,000 in 2013, the report said. Well over half — nearly 26,000 — were in the city of Los Angeles.

Homeless advocates blamed public officials for the disappointing results.

"The city and county have done such a terribly poor job of creating affordable housing," said Steve Clare, executive director of Venice Community Housing. "Basically they've ignored the issue."

Homeless authority commission members called for more state and local money and said neighborhoods throughout the county must accept housing for homeless residents.

"There need to be enormous new dedicated resources," said Peter Lynn, the authority's executive director.

The rise in homelessness comes at a time of renewed local focus on the problem.

After decades of squabbling and inaction, the city and county have begun pursuing new solutions. These include rapidly re-housing newly homeless people and creating so-called permanent supportive housing for the long-term homeless. Supportive housing programs provide the formerly homeless with mental health and addiction counseling, to help keep them from returning to the streets.

However, the campaign has so far proved no match for the region's high cost of housing and lack of new money for low-income housing. In addition, the county's unemployment rate of 7.5 percent still tops the national rate of 5.6 percent.

## Fewer Homeless Veterans

Los Angeles also has the nation's largest concentration of homeless veterans. Housing them has become a primary goal for the city and county, as well as the federal government. The Obama administration this year roughly doubled funding to the county, offering $105 million in grants and services aimed at the homeless veteran population.

The number of homeless veterans has indeed declined, despite the overall increase in homelessness. According to the new report, homelessness among veterans dropped 6 percent countywide over the past two years, to about 4,400.

Mayor Garcetti and federal officials have pledged to house every homeless veteran by the end of the year, and as of January, the mayor said he was more than halfway to his goal.

However, such progress is being overshadowed by an increase in other homeless populations. Advocates say that in some cases, veterans and longtime homeless people are shoving aside those newly homeless because of the affordable housing crisis.

"What's happened is existing resources have been re-targeted to the chronically homeless, but the pot hasn't been significantly expanded," Clare said.

The city's affordable housing fund, which in 2008 totaled $108 million, plunged to $26 million in 2014.

## No Legal Right To Shelter

The region has wrestled for decades with how to create housing for homeless people. Unlike in New York, there is no legal right to shelter, and securing the money and political backing to build supportive housing throughout the county has been a struggle.

Christine Margiotta of United Way of Greater Los Angeles said, "It's critical we don't lose sight of that and become disheartened. We just need to redouble our efforts ... and have a strong eye toward prevention in the future."

Alice Callaghan, a longtime advocate for the homeless, criticized city leaders for failing to stem the loss of housing.

"All we get from City Hall is breezy poetry — 'I will house everybody by next year.' That's absurd. There's no housing to put people in," Callaghan said. "It's very depressing. I don't think people understand how bad it is."
