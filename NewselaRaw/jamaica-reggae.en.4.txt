KINGSTON, Jamaica â€” Renaldo Brown is practicing his flute under some trees. The 12-year old is barefoot. He is wearing donated clothes. But Brown is a student at a Jamaican music school famous for teaching many of this island's top musicians.

"It's challenging but I like it. I'm getting better 'cause I've been practicing nearly every day for two years," said the serious boy. Brown is from the tough Jamaican city of Spanish Town.

Renaldo is among two dozen students at Alpha Boys' School who are discovering a new world through music. The boys from poor backgrounds have all been sent there by family courts. Some of the boys are orphans. Others are sent to the home because of neglect. In some cases, their parents can't control them.

Students have lived at Alpha since the late 19th century. Most of Jamaica's world-class music has come out of Alpha. The school gives hope to at-risk kids. Year after year, Alpha boys bring the sounds of Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae music to the world.

## Fighting Tough Times

But its place in Jamaica's music might not even matter.  The school is being squeezed. Rising costs and shrinking state support make the school difficult to run. The money problem has gotten so bad that the nuns say they will have to stop letting students live at the school later this year.

The school is building up its own money-making businesses. It recently started an "Alpha Wear" clothing line. There is also an Internet radio station. It draws 60,000 people monthly. Sister Susan Frazer said the online radio program isn't bringing in money yet. But the school expects people to start paying to support the radio station. The station will also sell ads.

Frazer said Alpha also wants to update its training. The school wants to make sure the famous music program survives.

But students will learn more than how to play, she said. They will learn the whole business of music.

Students at the school are taught self-discipline and pride while they learn music. They learn to read music and understand harmony and composition.  Alpha currently has about 85 kids, and 25 of them are in the music program. The other students study traditional classes like woodworking and tailoring.

## Excited About The Future

Many former students have become top musicians. The Skatalites is an important band. Its members went to Alpha. So did jazz pioneer Joe Harriott and dance hall deejay Yellowman. Many others have found work as strong backup musicians. They work in Jamaica and other countries around the world.

"If you go to France, you'll see Alpha boys playing music professionally. You go to Germany or New York, you'll see Alpha boys," said Winston "Sparrow" Martin. He is the school's longtime band teacher. He also went to Alpha as a student. He has given musical training to many boys at the school. And he also made himself a world-class musician at the same time.

Alpha's music program started in 1892. Back then, boys just played drums and flutes. Sister Mary Ignatius Davies was the school's longtime leader. She started a brass band at the school. Davies supported her students' musical talents for years until she died in 2003.

The current Alpha students are excited about the future. On a recent afternoon, band members practiced under a tall building. It was full of trumpets, saxophones and other instruments, some new and others battered and worn.

Renaldo and most of his classmates stopped to talk during a break. They said they dream of becoming pro musicians.

"A lot of other people from here have become musicians," he said with a half-smile. He looked down at his bare feet. "Well, I hope I can, too."
