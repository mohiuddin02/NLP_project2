KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” Leah Schmidt is a school nutritionist. It's her job to come up with [healthy meals for kids](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school lunch).

Schmidt loves solving one particular puzzle: How do you come up with healthy meals that children will actually like?

On Monday at Dobbs Elementary, there was good news: The day's lunch had largely been a hit with kids.

True, a few apple-slice servings were tossed in the trash. Otherwise, the students had eaten everything.

Schmidt fears that finding healthy meals that kids like will soon become too difficult.

## New School Year, New Rules

The government is slowly making food rules stricter. Every few years, it is introducing new rules about what kids can eat. The idea is to get unhealthy food out of school cafeterias.

Nutritionists like Schmidt think that is a great idea, of course. Still, they worry that the government is moving too fast.

Nutritionists worry about three upcoming rules in particular. One would affect grains: in other words, things like bread, rolls, pastas and pizza crusts. Under the new rules, half of the grains students eat have to be whole-grain. Whole-wheat bread, for example, is a type of whole-grain food.

Another rule would make it so children must pick up a fruit or vegetable with each meal. Schools fear this will lead to food waste: Kids may simply throw away what they do not want.

## My Turkey Too?

The government also is gradually lowering the amount of salt kids can have.

Schmidt said salt limits may become a real problem. By 2017, kids may only be allowed to have a very small amount.

Take "one deli turkey sandwich with cheese and mustard," she said. That would use up most of the salt for one week.

For now, though, Dobbs fifth-grader Cree Crook is satisfied with her choices. She said her school's lunch team has been doing a good job. They have come up with healthy meals that are also tasty.

The switch to whole grains has taken regular macaroni and cheese out of the mix. But that's OK, Cree said.

"We have the Santa Fe Mac," she said, meaning the whole-grain pasta and cheese dish with red sauce. "It's good, and it comes with a whole-wheat roll. The wheat roll is very healthy for you."

## Favorites Beware!

Nancy Coughenour is in charge of food for the Shawnee Mission School District. In her district, she said, things are going fairly well. Nutritionists and students have mostly adjusted to the healthier food.

"You have to mess with it," she said. In other words, nutritionists have to come up with new recipes.

The district's regular chocolate cake dessert is now made with whole-grain flour. Going to whole-grain soft tortillas was a tricky move, Coughenour said. But that too seems to have gone well.

Still, Coughenour agrees that the upcoming rules may be going too far. She is particularly worried about the salt limits.

The 2017 salt rules may be too tough, Coughenour said. Some student favorites may have to be dropped.

"Chicken nuggets, pizza, ketchup, mustard," she said. "I don't know what we'll do with those."

## Happy Food Changes

Still, fifth-grader Cree is happy with the changes so far. So are her parents. "My mom and dad want me to have four vegetables and fruits (every day)."

Cree does not want to go back to the old foods she used to eat.

School nutritionists do not want to go back either. They will push for healthier meals, Schmidt said. After all, that's what nutrition is all about.

Still, Schmidt cannot help worrying about the government's new rules. "I hope they'll be realistic," she said.
