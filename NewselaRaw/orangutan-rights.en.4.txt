A court in Argentina decided that an ape has the same rights as a human. The case was decided in December. It was the first time an ape was given the rights of a human.

The orangutan is named Sandra. She lives at the Buenos Aires Zoo in Argentina.

The ruling will change her life. It also may help set other animals free.

In Argentina, Sandra now has the right to be free. She has the right to live and not be harmed.

Orangutans and monkeys are primates. So are humans.

## Case Changes History

Before the ruling, primates other than humans were treated as objects, said Andrés Gil Dominguez. He said the case changes history.

Dominguez is a lawyer with an animal rights group. His group filed the court case for Sandra. It said that she had been denied her freedom for no reason. It was just like a case that would be filed for a human prisoner.

Sandra was born in Germany in 1986. She has lived at the Buenos Aires Zoo for 20 years. Now the courts will try to find another home for Sandra. She is getting older, so she will have to be healthy enough to travel to be moved.

Interest in freeing Sandra started in 2012. Then, the leaders of the Buenos Aires Zoo had considered sending the ape to a sanctuary, or safe place for animals. They never did anything, though.

Sandra's case may help the court cases of other animals. Aldo Giúdice studies primates at the University of Buenos Aires. He said that apes are very close to human primates. Because of this, he said it is crazy that they are "in prison."

## Think Just Like People

Other court cases have been filed for zoo primates in Argentina. Outside of Argentina, there was a case in 2005 for a chimpanzee named Suiça. The chimp lived in a zoo in Brazil. Suiça died before the case could be judged. In 2012, an animal rights group tried to use the U.S. Constitution's 13th Amendment to gain freedom for orcas, also called killer whales. The 13th Amendment ended slavery.

In 2013, another group filed paperwork to free four chimpanzees in New York state. The case was rejected. Now, lawyers are fighting the court's decision. The group wants "imprisoned nonhuman animals to be returned" to nature, says Steven Wise. He runs the group.

Famous scientists like Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey have studied how apes behave. They found that great apes think and feel just like people, Giúdice says.

We cannot "let them suffer in prison," he said.
