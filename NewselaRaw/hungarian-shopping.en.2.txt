Hungarian lawmakers have passed a bill that will ban most shopping on Sundays. They argued that the move would ensure that families will have more time together.

Not everybody thinks the law is a good idea. One in 10 people in the country is without a job. People who have jobs, do not make that much money. So, the bill limiting shopping is likely to be resented if, as stores warn, they are forced to get rid of workers through layoffs. Others worry the government will have less money with a drop in Sunday shopping, since it collects taxes each time a sale is made in stores.

Sunday is the Christian day of rest. The law in Hungary is similar to Western European restrictions against shopping on the Christian Sabbath put in place after World War II.

## Many Exceptions To The Ban

The Christian Democratic People's Party proposed the ban. The Christian Democrats are partners in Prime Minister Viktor Orban coalition government.

About 37 percent of Hungary's 10 million people are Roman Catholic, according to the CIA World Factbook. An additional 16 percent follow other Christian religions. Meanwhile, 18 percent are not religious and another 27 percent do not say what their religion is.

Like laws in Germany, Austria, Holland and other countries, the Hungarian shopping ban has many exceptions.

Drug stores, tobacco shops, farmers markets and stores on military bases are allowed to operate on Sundays. Bakeries can open between 5 a.m. and noon.

Shops at airports, train stations, gas stations and hospitals also are allowed to be open on Sundays. They can stay open as late as 10 p.m.

Small shops are not covered by the law, under a certain condition: Their Sunday workers have to be people who own at least 20 percent of the business or be family members of the owners.

The four Sundays preceding Christmas are not part of the shopping ban. All stores also will be allowed to open their doors once a year on a Sunday of their choosing.

## Sunday Shopping Necessity

The National Association of Entrepreneurs and Employers opposed the law. The business group warned this month that its passage would lead to about 20,000 layoffs. It vowed to organize a national vote on the shopping ban. The group pointed out that a government report said about 20 percent of Hungarians do most of their weekly shopping on Sundays.

There were no studies conducted by the government before the law was passed to show how it would affect business in the country, the Hungarian business news site Portfolio reported.

The shopping curbs take effect March 15. They will mostly affect large department stores and major European grocery chains, such as Spar, Aldi, Tesco and Lidl.

Lawmakers who favored the ban promoted it as a family measure. They said it was insurance that shopping will not "shorten the time that families spend together."

Economy Minister Mihaly Varga had urged rejection of the bill. Varga is in charge of making sure Hungary makes wise decisions with its money. Instead of the law, he appealed to employers to make special payment arrangements with those people willing to work Sundays.
