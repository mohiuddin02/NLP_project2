SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Scientists are planning to pluck, push and park a spinning asteroid between here and the moon.

Most of us hope to dodge space rocks. But NASA has an ambitious, $105 million plan. It wants to build a spaceship and drag one closer to Earth. It's a first step in a future voyage to Mars.

"Our goal is to go out there and rendezvous, then get it into the hands of the people who can understand it," said David Korsmeyer, a director at NASA's Ames Research Center. Scientists at Ames will contribute to the project.

Asteroids have our respect because a big one could knock Earth off its orbit. In February, a little one rocked Russia and a bigger one was a near miss. The close call only added to the anxiety.

But they're also valuable, and pursuing one could launch us into deeper space.

## A Stepping-Stone into Space

That's because we'll need a vehicle a lot better than a fuel-driven rocket. With new NASA money, engineers hope to design a futuristic solar-electric ship. It would make a slow, steady and sustainable trip to find an asteroid. It is the journey that thrills scientists, not the destination.

After finding the right space rock orbiting our way, the spaceship might push, tug or harpoon the asteroid. Or it might stuff the rock into a big bag. Perhaps it would use a lasso like some kind of space cowboy to corral it.

## Waiting for Stars to Align in Washington

"As a space-faring country it has been more than 40 years since we have been to deep space," where the asteroids are, said Stanford University aeronautics professor G. Scott Hubbard. "We need to regain our 'chops,' " he said. "It's a demonstration of space exploration technologies for the future."

The "Asteroid Retrieval Mission" is still in talks in Washington, D.C. It is a major new goal for NASA. The agency retired the shuttle fleet and grounded a moon-landing plan. Suggested last year by the California Institute of Technology, the idea has found favor at the White House. In his only space speech, President Barack Obama promised we would land on an asteroid by 2025. But there's been a cooler reception in Congress.

## Sky-High Prices

Developing the technology to bring home an asteroid will raise costs, warned Hubbard. The $105 million is just a down payment on a project that could end up costing billions of dollars.

In the summer, Ames and other NASA research centers will work out the details. At Ames, "we can provide tools that make the mission more successful," Korsmeyer said.

For instance, Ames scientists could make tools like their CheMin device on the Mars rover. It analyzes the makeup of Martian rocks. Ames could also build sensors to help find an asteroid. Most asteroids travel too far away to be useful. And some are huge.

But little ones, the size of a dump truck, might be practical to grab using unmanned spaceships, NASA says.

## Lining It All Up

Asteroids are the rubble left from the birth of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. They hold clues about our origins and, perhaps, valuable metals. The main goal is not to protect the Earth from a rogue space rock. But the technology developed "could prove useful in diverting" one, said Tom Jones. He is a planetary scientist and former astronaut, and advises the asteroid-seeking B612 Foundation.

The hunt won't be easy. The perfect asteroid will be too small to reflect light. Plus, it doesn't want to be captured. NASA calls it "an uncooperative object". It will be moving at 17,000 miles per hour, happy in its own orbit, and spinning like a top. It may not even be solid rock, but just a tumbling bunch of ice.

Then there's the challenge of catching it. Korsmeyer calls it "a multivariable math game." Think of catching a baseball while on a Ferris wheel.

Once captured, it would be slowly pushed or pulled, and nudged close to the moon. There, remote-controlled ships would arrive to chip off chunks for study. Eventually, astronauts would visit it.

"It's not a trivial undertaking," Korsmeyer said. "You are lining up a whole set of moving balls to try to put one in the pocket."
