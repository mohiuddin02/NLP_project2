NEWPORT NEWS, Va. â€” Using fish to make fertilizer isn't a new idea. But John Morris is doing it in a modern way called aquaponics.

Morris raises tilapia fish. The fish create waste when they poop while swimming in the water. The waste has vitamins and minerals, so it's like food for growing crops. He uses the waste water to grow vegetables.

He turned his farm into the Herb Aqua Farm.

Inside two greenhouses on the 8-acre farm, Morris raises fish in large tanks. The waste water is turned into a kind of liquid fertilizer. Part of the water goes to fill hydroponic beds where plants grow on water. They don't need any soil. The rest of the water is sent to crops in the ground outside.

## Selling Fish And Vegetables

The farm lets Morris earn money two ways. By March, his first batch of tilapia will have grown large enough to sell. And the lettuce, herbs and vegetables can be sold year-round.

It's the only way to farm where you can grow both fish and vegetables, Morris says.

It fits in with the county's goals, says Lisa T. Perry. She helps businesses grow in Isle of Wight County. It shows how things are changing in farming, she added.

Morris, 56, came to farming late in life. For 17 years he was a firefighter and later he operated a cabinet-making business. In 1999 he moved to Isle of Wight.

One day he picked up a Farmer's Almanac. He read an article about aquaponics.

In aquaponics, plants and fish grow together without soil. It can produce fresh, organic food anywhere. And it has almost no effect on the environment.

Morris wrestled with the idea.  "I was very nervous," he said. "I fought it tooth and nail."

But he sold his cabinet-making shop and bought the equipment.

## "You Have To Keep Learning"

"I believe this is my calling," Morris said. "I didn't want to wake up when I was 75 years old and wish I'd done something else."

He added, "It was a big decision, but you have to keep learning. That's what keeps us young."

Morris says he has put about $175,000 into the business. "If it fails, it fails," he says, but he's hopeful. "I have a business mind and I'm methodical."

He's also passionate about "green" farming. It doesn't use herbicides and pesticides. Those chemicals are often used to kill weeds and bugs that harm plants. But, they have polluted the Chesapeake Bay and killed off the earthworms and the healthy bacteria in the soil.

Morris bought his first fish in August. They live in tanks heated to about 72 degrees Fahrenheit.  The waste water goes through a filter that traps the solids. The water is pumped into the beds to feed the vegetables.

A wood stove heats the place. With large lights hanging from the ceiling, Morris can grow crops year-round.

"I'll have crops in January," he says.
