ORLANDO, Fla. â€” A bunch of Coyotes will be let loose in hurricanes this year. Their mission: to improve hurricane forecasts.

These coyotes aren't the four-legged kind, however. They are small pilotless planes, or [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), developed after Hurricane Sandy. They will be tested for the first time this hurricane season, which runs from June to November in the Atlantic Ocean.

The tiny planes will be launched into the eye of tropical storm systems. Their main purpose will be to spot changes in air pressure.

What they find should help the National Hurricane Center get a better handle on hurricanes. Most importantly, the information will help determine how strong a storm could become.

"It's an innovative way to measure the atmosphere," said hurricane expert Jason Dunion. Dunion is a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

## Little Drones On A Big Mission

The Coyotes weigh about 7 pounds. They have a 5-foot wingspan and can fly at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour.

The tiny drones will be dropped out of NOAA's WP-3 hurricane hunter planes. They will be launched while 10,000 to 12,000 feet above the ocean.

Coyotes will do what no other planes can: spend up to two hours circling around the center of a hurricane. They will send forecasters detailed information about a hurricane's inner workings.

"You're getting a longer snapshot" of changes within the eye of a storm, Dunion said.

Coyotes also will be flown into a hurricane's eye wall. The eye is the calmest part of the storm. But, the eye wall is the most destructive part. It's the ring of clouds around the eye. It is the area with the heaviest rain and strongest winds. The goal will be to find the speed of the strongest winds. That information, too, should help the hurricane center improve its predictions. It will help show just how strong a hurricane will become.

Additionally, Coyotes will provide clues about something particularly important: Just _when_ a hurricane might begin to rapidly increase in strength. Fast increases can be destructive if the hurricane is near land.

## Benefits Of Getting Up Close

Coyotes cost about $70,000 each. Yet two or three of them might be sent into a single storm with little hope of ever seeing them again.

Dunion said the benefits will be worth it. He said the small plane can fly right above the ocean surface in a storm's eye. Getting that close is far too dangerous for any plane with people aboard.

The Coyote's ability to fly close to the ocean during a storm is particularly useful. It will help scientists better understand how a tropical system gains power from the heat of the ocean's surface.

The temperature "of the ocean near a storm's eye is not something we sample very often," Dunion said. "It's hard to sample."

This summer, NOAA plans to station Coyote-carrying WP-3s in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is doing this to get an early look at storms that could hit the U.S. coastline.

The Coyote is not the first drone to be flown straight into a hurricane. In 2005, a small drone called an aerosonde was flown into Hurricane Ophelia. That plane, however, had to launch from land, then fly out to the storm.

Coyotes, though, will be launched from a hurricane hunter plane already in a storm. They will thus be able to stay in the air longer and collect more information.

"This is just over-the-top technology," said Erica Rule, of the NOAA.
