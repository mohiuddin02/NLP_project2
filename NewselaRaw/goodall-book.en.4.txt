We know a lot about chimpanzees because of Jane Goodall. Jane is a scientist.

The picture above is of Jane and a chimpanzee. Goodall studied them for many years in Africa.

There is a new book for children about Jane's life. It is called, "Untamed: The Wild Life of Jane Goodall." The book was written by Anita Silvey. It is full of pictures and stories about Jane's whole life and her work with chimpanzees.

Anita hopes her book will help children change the world.

## Jane Growing Up

The book begins with Jane's life as a child. Jane loved her family pets. She also loved being outside and reading. One book she loved reading was "The Story of Doctor Dolittle." It was about a man who goes to Africa. He learns how to talk to animals.

Anita says kids think about their own lives when they read. They think about how a story can help them. Jane might have thought this too.

## Treating Animals Like Humans

Jane first went to Africa at age 22. It was in Africa that she studied chimpanzees. She changed how scientists treat animals. Other scientists gave the animals numbers to tell them apart. But Jane gave the chimps names. She said every chimp was special.

## Everyone Can Help

Anita's book wants to help children. It says that if you love something, you can use it to help the world. Jane used her love for animals to change the world. If children follow their dreams, they can do the same.

Jane wrote the beginning of Anita's new book. Jane wrote that children can make a difference. She thinks children make a difference every day.
