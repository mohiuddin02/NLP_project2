SAN FRANCISCO â€” Gay people can serve on federal juries. A court in San Francisco became the first in the country to decide this Tuesday.

Until now, gay people could be kept off some juries just because they were gay. A gay person is attracted to a person of his or her own sex.

The decision by the three judges on the court was unanimous. That means that all three judges agreed. They sit on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

The decision came out of a 2011 fight between two companies that make medicine. A lawyer for one of them prevented a gay man from being on the jury without a good reason. This was unfair, the judges said. A jury decides which side is right and which side is wrong at a trial.

## An Important Decision

Judge Stephen Reinhardt is one of the judges. He wrote that it's important to keep on eye on laws that treat people unequally. Courts should not create or strengthen prejudice. Courts also should not treat people unfairly, he said.

Gay rights supporters are happy with the decision. It will make it harder to treat gay people differently. Many states don't allow marriage between men or between women. This is called same-sex marriage. The activists hope the ruling will help them win the right to same-sex marriage. In many states, only men and women may marry each other.

Same-sex marriage is already legal in California.

"This is really a very big deal," said Jon W. Davidson. He is with a group that wants equal rights for gay people.

In the 2011 case, two drug companies argued about the price of a drug. They took their disagreement to court. A lawyer for Abbott Laboratories, one of the companies, did not want a man to be on the jury. This was after the man said he had a male partner.

The lawyer said he had "no idea" whether the man was gay. But he did not give another reason for keeping him off the jury. Before a jury trial, the lawyers for both sides pick the men and women of the jury.

The jury decided in favor of Abbott. The other drug company asked for a new trial. The other company, GlaxoSmithKline, claimed that Abbott didn't want the man on the jury because he was gay.

Abbott gave several reasons for excluding the man. But Reinhardt said they were just excuses.

## Treating Gays Fairly

"Jury service is one of the most important responsibilities of an American citizen," Reinhardt wrote. It gives gay people a way of expressing what's important to them. It also gives them a say in issues that affect their lives.

No one has to say if they're gay. But if they do, they can't be kept off a jury because of it, the judges said.

Keeping gay people off juries sends a bad message, Reinhardt wrote. People might think gays can't be trusted to be fair.

Davidson said he did not know how often gay jurors are kept off juries. Lawyers don't need to give a reason if they don't select a juror. But if asked, it must be a fair reason.

"People have stereotypes," the gay rights lawyer said. They think all gay people will vote a certain way. "Or a lawyer might think, 'I just don't think I will relate well to a gay person on a jury.'"

The legal system should treat people as individuals, Davidson said. All jurors need to be treated the same.

This may not be the last word in the matter. Abbott could challenge Tuesday's decision. It can ask a larger group of judges to take another look at the case. It also can appeal to the Supreme Court.
