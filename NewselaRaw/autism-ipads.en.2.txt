AUSTIN, Texas — Jaime Morin, 9, has autism. The condition has made him nonverbal — unable to talk — his entire life. Things have gotten better, however, since his mother, Lupe Santander, found out about Zach's Voice. The group provides iPads to autistic children who have trouble communicating.

"He can say exactly what he wants with the iPad," says Santander. "When he first figured it out, the look on his face was priceless. We could finally understand him, we didn't have to say 'Yes' or 'No' when he pointed to things."

Because children with autism who are nonverbal cannot talk, the thoughts occupying their heads are unable to come out — that's where the iPad comes in. Through the app of their choice, the children can form sentences by putting together words, which come in the form of buttons and a picture to match the word. Then they play the sentences back for others to hear. The iPad becomes their voice.

This improves "their understanding of the world around them," says teacher Danielle Skala. She has a few students who use iPads in her classroom.

## Zach's Voice Has A Unique Mission

Zach's Voice became an official group last May. Their mission is to provide iPads to autistic children who have problems communicating.

Zach's Voice was founded by Abby Whitworth, who named the group after her 7-year-old son. Whitworth was inspired by Zach's experience with the iPad. Before the Apple product, he used DynaVox, a heavy device that was hard to program, Whitworth said. Besides being clunky, it drew attention to him — but with an iPad, he blends in.

A particular incident at the grocery store inspired Whitworth to form Zach's Voice. While shopping, she saw an autistic child walking around with note cards, which he used to communicate. The number of words available through this approach, however, is limited.

"The iPad lets kids use all the words they want," says Whitworth. "It's an unlimited amount of options, as opposed to what you get with handwritten note cards."

"With picture books and note cards," says Skala, "I got to decide what the kids said — now, the child decides."

## Very Special Apps

The app recommended by Zach's Voice is ProLoQuo2Go, but the group provides a gift card that covers the cost of whatever app families decide to download. Jaime chose Lamp Words for Life, the program he had been using with his therapist.

ProLoQuo2Go lets kids add words to the program. For example, they can add family members' names or the names of their favorite cartoon characters.

"The kids start off using the app to communicate about the things they love," says Whitworth. "It's rewarding and motivates them to use the program."

Zach's Voice works with teachers to find families who would benefit from the program.

Parents must promise to use the iPad only for the benefit of the autistic child, and no other apps can be downloaded. The idea is that the iPad is to be used to help the kid communicate and for no other purpose. It becomes part of the child's everyday activity, just as essential as wearing shoes when they leave the house.

## Communicating With Confidence

The iPad can do more than just help children with autism communicate — it sometimes also can make it easier for them to talk.

"Zach talks now," Whitworth says. "It started six months ago, about a year and a half after he first got his iPad."

Jaime's speech has also expanded since he began using the iPad. He has started to repeat sentences and words after hearing them through the app, and when he hears a certain pronunciation, he tries to imitate it.

"It opens up their world, their voice can be heard," Santander says. "He's not stuck in his little body anymore. It has given him confidence."

The iPad as a communication device also can relieve anxiety.

"Being heard and understood can be a great source of relief for our kids," Whitworth says.
