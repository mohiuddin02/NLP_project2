DALLAS â€” A nurse who took care of an Ebola patient is the first person in the United States to get the deadly disease.

The woman discovered she had a fever Friday night and drove herself to the emergency room of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. She was placed in isolation 90 minutes later. A blood sample sent to the state health lab in Austin confirmed Saturday night that she had Ebola.

The woman had helped care for Thomas Eric Duncan, who died last Wednesday. He brought the deadly disease with him from Liberia, Africa, when he came to visit relatives in Dallas.

Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said Sunday that the nurse caught Ebola because of a "breach in protocol." The word protocol refers to the rules that health care workers must follow when they come into contact with Ebola patients.

## Exposure To Ebola

Health care workers are required to wear protective gear, including gloves, masks and special clothing. The CDC was keeping watch on people who had contact with Duncan. The nurse, however, was not on its list.

Frieden said CDC officials have spoken with the nurse. She was not sure how she may have caught Ebola.

Frieden said exposure to the Ebola virus can come from a single accidental slip-up. "Unfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola" in health care workers, he said.

Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey said the nurse had "extensive contact" with Duncan. The nurse missed two days of work before going to the emergency room Friday night. Officials think she came into contact with only one person since she began feeling sick.

Ebola is spread through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of a sick person. It can only be transmitted after an infected person begins showing symptoms.

"We have been preparing for an event like this," Lakey said.

## Nurse's Apartment And Car Cleaned

Presbyterian Hospital official Daniel Varga said the nurse contracted Ebola during Duncan's second visit to the hospital. Duncan, the first person to die of Ebola in the United States, went to Presbyterian's emergency room Sept. 26. He was sent home with medicine and returned to the hospital two days later, on Sept. 28. Duncan tested positive with Ebola. He died Oct. 8.

Officials are not saying who the nurse is or how she helped take care of Duncan.

The nurse's apartment was cleaned and sterilized Sunday. While the CDC didn't consider her to be at "high risk" of contracting Ebola, she had been taking her temperature twice a day and checking herself for other signs of the disease.

Symptoms of Ebola include fever, headaches and stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Ebola is fatal in 50 percent to 80 percent of people who get it. Although there are experimental treatments, there is no proven vaccine or cure yet.

A team also thoroughly cleaned the nurse's car and the common area of her apartment building on Sunday.

## "It's Really Puzzling"

Police officers and a CDC official talked to apartment residents on Sunday morning and gave out information about Ebola symptoms. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings also visited them.

"It just breaks my heart. She was just an innocent woman who took care of someone who was sick," said neighbor Colleen Watson said.

Lindsey Carpenter, 33, said her roommate had searched on the Internet to find out why news helicopters were flying over their neighborhood. The roommate barged into her room at 9:30 a.m. when he found an answer. "There's an Ebola patient in the neighborhood," he said.

Carpenter, who works in a nearby hospital, said she hopes Presbyterian Hospital investigates how the nurse got Ebola. The nurse was exposed to Duncan during his second visit to the hospital and the health care workers were wearing protective gear.

"I wonder how she got it," Carpenter said. "It's really puzzling. There's probably more to the story that we don't know."
