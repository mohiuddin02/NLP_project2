FERGUSON, Mo. â€” Medicine has the power to heal. So does food, says Cat Daniels.

On Aug. 9, a black teenager was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The teen's name was Michael Brown. His death set off protests nearly every night.

Daniels has been serving Sunday meals to protesters ever since. She has tried to calm the angry crowds with plates of food.

"Food can heal your soul," Daniels said.

## A Family Dinner

On Thanksgiving, Daniels served dinner in a church near St. Louis. The hungry crowd had traveled far for their meal.

Most of them did not know each other three months ago when the protests started. Inside the church, it seemed like a family dinner. They were united by their anger over Brown's death. They were also united by thankfulness for Daniels. They call her "Momma Cat." She has fed them since August.

People listen to her, said Pastor Henry Logan, who has been working with her since August. "She does it one meal at a time."

Last Monday, violent protests broke out again in Ferguson. A grand jury decided not to charge the officer who shot Brown. A grand jury is made up of a group of people. They decide if a person should be charged with a crime. If Wilson was charged with a crime, he would have to go to court.

On Thanksgiving, the city of Ferguson seemed to stop and take a deep breath. The protesters stopped to eat their own Thanksgiving dinners.

The holiday was cold and quiet, at least for a few hours.

## The Power Of Food

"It's a day to breathe, to love one another," Daniels said. She said it was also a day "to share and give thanks for what we have and what we will have." Daniels was surrounded by the food she stayed up all night to cook. She made fried turkey, vegetables, and tres leches cake which is made with three kinds of milk.

Momma Cat thinks police treat black people in Ferguson unfairly. She has been on the streets protesting. She says her real job, though, is to help the protesters. To do that, Daniels turned to one thing that brings people together, no matter what they think or where they come from, food.

Momma Cat believes in the power of food.

On most Sundays, since Brown's death, Daniels has been dishing out food in the parking lot across from the police station. She stands behind a row of warming dishes and pans. She serves anyone who walks up.

At first, Daniels paid for most of the food herself. As the weeks went on, she began accepting help from the protesters she feeds.

## "Come Together And Heal"

Police officers have not walked across the street for a meal, Daniels said. If they did, she would gladly fix them a plate.

A great-grandmother, Daniels has been a mother, cook and friend to the protesters.

Baker said the Thanksgiving dinner at the church came at an important time. "Momma Cat gives us an opportunity for people to come together and heal."

Daniels and her husband had been thinking of selling their house. They wanted to move away from the area she says is divided between black and white and rich and poor. After Brown's death, Daniels said, she knew she had to do something.

Maybe she did not belong on the front lines of the protests, but she could at least keep the protesters fed.

Although she said she is not an activist, "we had to get active. We had to say, that's enough."
