A massive tornado more than a mile wide ripped across a large suburban area near Oklahoma City Monday afternoon with winds whipping up to 200 miles per hour. Neighborhoods were flattened into fields of rubble leaving residents frantically searching for loved ones. At least 24 people were killed, including several children.

The 20-mile-long path of destruction cut mainly through Moore, a city of 56,000 just south of the Oklahoma state capital.

Rescue crews swarmed into the wreckage at Plaza Towers Elementary School, where 75 students and staff had sought refuge in a hallway. CNN reported that the Federal Aviation Authority banned aircraft and news helicopters from flying over the school site so that engine noise would not prevent rescuers from hearing any cries for help from survivors.

The other school hit by the tornado was Briarwood Elementary School in Oklahoma City. Local newscasters reported that children were trapped inside.

The twister will go down in history as the most deadly for the tornado–prone state. It hammered two elementary schools and ripped the second floor off Moore's medical center, forcing injured victims to go to other area hospitals.

## "Horses And Stuff Flying Everywhere"

Oklahoma is no stranger to tornadoes, but even lifelong residents expressed disbelief at the size and power of the storm and the devastation it caused. Some compared it to the cluster of tornadoes that struck in May 1999, when a record 48 people perished.

"It was just like the movie 'Twister'," Lando Hite told a reporter from television station KFOR. "There were horses and stuff flying around everywhere," Hite said, standing bare-chested and covered in mud amid a landscape covered in debris.

The tornado swept through at about 3 p.m., pummeling the area for 40 minutes. The timing could not have been worse since it meant family members were separated between home, school and work, adding chaos and congestion to the recovery effort.

## "As Serious As It Gets"

A tornado warning was in effect for 16 minutes before the tornado developed, according to the National Weather Service. Roads were clogged as motorists tried to flee the area. People sought refuge wherever they could — in hallways, freezers and even in horse stalls.

At 3:01 p.m. the National Weather service posted on Facebook: "TORNADO EMERGENCY FOR THE (Oklahoma City) METRO AREA. Large violent deadly tornado moving toward Moore! Take cover RIGHT NOW DO NOT WAIT!!" At 3:03 it wrote on Twitter: "This is as serious as it gets for SW OKC and Moore. Please seek shelter now!"

In southwest Oklahoma City, the monstrous winds flicked cars upside down, dropping them onto the roofs of toppled houses.

A CNN reporter said people who survived the storm risked their lives climbing through the unsteady wreckage of their homes searching for belongings while the threat of more strong storms remained. Downed power lines raised the risk of fires.

Hail as big as tennis balls pelted the region and the storms extended as far as parts of Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas.

## National Guard Called

Tornados are rated on the Fujita scale of 1 to 5. An F1 is the weakest category. The storm was rated a F5 because it caused death and injuries.

Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin called out the National Guard to assist in the rescue effort and declared a state of emergency in 21 counties.

"We are looking under every single piece of debris" for the missing after a massive tornado ripped apart the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore. "Our hearts are broken for the parents that are wondering about the state of their children that had been in the schools that have been hit today," Fallin said.  "I know that there are families wondering where their loved ones are."

President Barack Obama spoke with Fallin and told the governor that the people of Oklahoma are in his and the first lady's thoughts and prayers.
