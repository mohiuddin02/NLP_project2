MIAMI — The remote-controlled aircraft known as a drone has been a powerful but controversial weapon against terror Now, it is about to take on a new and seemingly inexhaustible enemy: the black salt marsh mosquito.

On Sept. 2, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District began testing a next-generation drone. The hope is that it will provide a high-tech edge in the daily battle to beat back the swarms.

The new [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) is about half the size of the large sea hawks commonly seen in the Keys. It won't be equipped to spray or blast bugs. Instead, it will be rigged with an infrared thermal camera that detects differences in temperature.

The goal is to survey the area's mangrove swamps that are difficult to get to. These are the breeding grounds for the marsh mosquito, the biggest biter in the island chain.

## Finding Pools In The Swamp

Mosquitoes thrive in shallow pools of water. In just days, they grow from tiny larval worms to buzzing blood-suckers. If the bird-size drone can accurately spot such pools, it could save mosquito-fighters time, effort and money.

"Our people on the ground have to walk an hour to a marsh and find out what's there,'' said district leader Michael Doyle. "It's hard to cover all those places at once. If something like this could allow them to map where the water is, we could move a lot more quickly.''

Whether the drone proves to be a good mosquito hunter or not, the test shows how unmanned planes are quickly changing. Drones have revolutionized warfare and been adopted by law enforcement. But they also are being employed for an increasing number of commercial and research uses.

They've helped track poachers in Africa. They've been used to monitor wildfires in California. They have recorded gases spewing from a volcano in Costa Rica. In coming years, researchers at the University of Florida hope to use drones for a variety of new purposes. Squadrons of drones no bigger than paper airplanes may soon gather information from places dangerous for manned aircraft, such as hurricanes or ice shelves.

## Battling The Swarm

The new anti-mosquito drone was developed by Prioria Robotics, a small Gainesville company founded by University of Florida engineering and business students. It has been dubbed the Maveric.

"I would have laughed two years ago if you told me this could help with mosquito control," said company salesman Derek Lyons. "You put it in people's hands and it becomes like the iPhone. You have no idea what the applications are going to be."

If it proves useful in the Keys, it will be helping Florida's largest and most challenging mosquito-control operation.

Marsh mosquitoes aren't public health threats like Aedes aegypti, which spreads dengue fever. But they are the most common annoyance. Fast and furious breeders, they appear in huge numbers when rainstorms or changing tides flood mangrove thickets. The key to controlling them, Doyle said, is using helicopters to hit breeding areas with small particles of bacteria. This kills developing insects before they take wing.

Doyle estimated the tactic gets rid of about 80 percent of marsh mosquitoes. Those that escape can be controlled by spraying. However, spraying is now forbidden in more and more places, due to efforts to protect vanishing tropical butterflies.

## Hit 'Em While Larvae

It's getting harder and harder to spray for adults, Doyle said. "We have to improve the accuracy of killing them at the larval stage."

The battery-powered drone weighs 2.6 pounds and has a wing span of just over 2½ feet. It can easily be launched by hand like a paper airplane. Or, thanks to bendable wings, it can be shot from a 6-inch-diameter carrying tube. The drone can fly for up to 70 minutes in a six-mile radius, cruising at about 30 miles per hour. As it flies, its rotating camera sends live video to a laptop computer.

The drone costs $65,000.

Doyle stressed that the district hasn't yet decided whether to buy a drone. He questions whether the cameras will be able to pick out pools that are only a few inches deep. They simply may not stand out enough from surrounding soggy soils.

Fred Culbertson is piloting the test flights. He said mosquito hunting would be "a learning experience" for everyone. "But we feel that once we get down and work with them for a couple of days, we can probably tweak things to make it work."
