DETROIT â€” Tracy Peasant began crying in court Monday as she described how her water service had been shut off by the city. She had to buy bottled water for herself, her four children and four grandchildren. They couldn't get water from the faucets in their house.

"It was hard," Peasant said, wiping her eyes with a tissue.

Peasant was the first witness in Monday's court case. The judge was named Steven Rhodes. A group of nonprofits have asked Rhodes to stop the city from shutting off water for people who aren't paying their bills.

In 2013, Detroit filed for bankruptcy because the city owes more than $18 billion in its own unpaid bills. The bankruptcy will allow Detroit to sell off some of its property to raise money. It will also cancel some of Detroit's debts.

## High Bill, Leaky Pipes

Peasant's water was cut off in September 2013 because she did not pay her water bill. The bill came to more than $8,500. She said the bill was so high because of a water leak. Peasant was turned down for a program that would help her pay her bill because she owes too much. Peasant said she makes $259 a month.

"No, I'm not looking for free water," Peasant said. "I'm just looking for affordability, to afford it."

The nonprofit groups include the National Action Network, Michigan Welfare Rights Organization and the Peoples Water Board. They argue that the city shut off water unfairly. It didn't give homeowners enough warning. They also said the city should give more help for poor people who do not have enough money to pay their bills.

However, lawyers for the city said Detroit cannot give away water for free.

Lawyer Sonal Mithani said stopping the shut-offs would only hurt customers who have not paid their water bills. Their bills would pile up.

"The city has a responsibility to all of its residents," Mithani said. She said it's not fair for the people who are paying their bills. They would have to pay higher water fees to cover the unpaid bills of others.

## City Has Rules For Shut-Offs

Peasant said her water was unexpectedly turned back on in June by a woman she believed to be a city worker. The worker was there to make sure the water was still off. However, the worker had a change of heart when she got to the neighborhood.

"She said, 'I can't do this with these kids and stuff. This is wrong,'" Peasant said. "When she left, she said, 'You have some water now.'"

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department Director Sue McCormick spoke in court about the shut-offs.

McCormick admitted that the department's old rules for cutting off service are on the department's website. They were written in 2003. They say a Water Department worker has to identify himself or herself. The worker also has to tell the customer how much money they owe to the department. However, this year the Water Department hired an outside company to cut off the service. Those workers often didn't talk with customers before shutting off their water.

The judge focused on the difference between the rules and what actually happened. He asked McCormick if the department could legally cut off water without following its own rules.

## 44,000 Shut-Off Homes Since 2013

He asked her whether she thinks a department could "simply ignore" them.

McCormick said the department stopped letting customers know about the shut-offs face-to-face. She told the judge she wasn't sure when that began.

She said the department can change the rules as long as it's following the law.

McCormick said the department has shut off water to nearly 44,000 Detroit homes since 2013. She could not say how many of those homes had children or people with health problems living in them.

McCormick testified she makes $190,000 a year. Her salary comes to about 63 times more than what Peasant makes.
