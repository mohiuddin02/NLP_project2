ATHENS, Ga. — The "no-pain, no-gain" way of thinking about kids' sports is beginning to take second place to safety.

More and more, schools are setting rules to keep student athletes safe. The rules make kids stop playing when it's too hot or they are hurt. The goal is to protect kids from the serious injuries that can come from pushing kids to their limits — or beyond.

Since 2009, every state has required that kids be taken off the field if they hit their head. A type of brain injury called a concussion can occur when someone gets hit in the head.

In addition, some states require schools to have medical devices that restart the heart, as heart attacks are a leading cause of death in young athletes. Also, in the South a number of states have strict rules to avoid heat-related illnesses. And some schools are trying to prevent what are called overuse injuries. They are caused by repeating the same motion over and over, such as pitching a baseball or softball.

## More Schools Need Trainers

"Without question, all of these policies on heat, concussion, and so forth, they all make sense," said Doug Casa. He is with the Korey Stringer Institute at the University of Connecticut. The Stringer Institute studies ways to keep student athletes safe. "The most important thing you can do is have an athletic trainer on staff."

Only four of every 10 public high schools have a full-time athletic trainer, says the institute.

The Stringer Institute was named for Minnesota Vikings football player Korey Stringer. He died of heat stroke in 2001. Heat stroke is caused when someone is out in the sun too long. Stringer's death brought attention to the issue of heat-related illnesses in athletes.

In 2011, Ralph Sweargin was the head of the Georgia High School Association (GHSA). He knew that Georgia had particularly high heat-related illnesses. Between 1980 and 2011, eight high school football players in Georgia died from the heat. At the time in Georgia, schools were starting the year earlier and earlier, which meant football practices begin in mid-July, the hottest days of summer.

## More Breaks If It's Hot

Sweargin realized that schools in the state had to follow the same rules to keep kids safe. He also knew schools did not have enough information about what these rules should be. They were "relying on best guesses" and "copying what other people were doing."

Sweargin asked scientists to study how heat affects high school football players.

They found that players were especially at risk for heat-related illnesses in the first days of practice. Bud Cooper was one of the scientists. He found that it's important for players to slowly get used to the hot weather.

Cooper said that using the heat index to determine heat rules was not enough. The heat index just measures air temperature and humidity. It reflects how hot people actually feel. Yet it ignores "radiant temperature," the temperature on the ground. Certain surfaces, like concrete or a football field, store up heat, making the heat more intense.

The GHSA told all high schools to use a special calculator. It measures temperature, humidity and radiant temperature. For a reading above 82, teams must take frequent breaks. Higher readings mean shorter practices, and players must wear shorts, not long pants. For readings above 92, outdoor practices are stopped.

## Parents And Coaches Must Change

Schools in the North also need statewide heat rules, Cooper said. Temperatures in the North are high when football season begins. When Stringer died of heat stroke, the heat index hit 110.

Head injuries and extreme heat have drawn the most attention in high school sports. However, they are not the only dangers to young athletes.

Overuse injuries also are receiving more attention. The increasing number of student athletes playing sports year round is causing more injuries. For pitchers, there are elbow and shoulder injuries. In soccer, players get knee injuries. In volleyball and swimming, it's often the shoulder.

Many schools are limiting the number of pitches baseball and softball pitchers are allowed to throw. Some schools force teams to stop training for a while. This gives athletes time to recover. Many parents and coaches, though, are pushing kids to be "better, faster and stronger," said Jeffrey Dugas. He is a sports doctor in Birmingham, Alabama.

Mark Hyman is a sports reporter. He wrote a book about the increase in youth sports injuries. As more adults have become involved in youth sports, more kids have become injured. Before, when kids got hurt, they stopped playing, Hyman said. Now, "parents and coaches have been the ones to push them beyond physical limits."

For sports injuries to decrease, parents and coaches have to change, he said.
