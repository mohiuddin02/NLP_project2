STAVANGER, Norway — The sun is finally shining on the small Norwegian town of Rjukan.

The town is tucked in between steep mountains. These block the sun during the winter months. Rjukan is normally covered in shadow for almost six months a year. People who live there have to catch a cable car to the top of a nearby cliff to get some sun in the middle of the day.

That changed a bit on Wednesday. Dim rays from the winter sun reached the town's market square for the first time. Three 183-square-foot mirrors placed on a mountain helped the town see the light.

Cheering families put on sunglasses as the sun crept from behind a cloud. Some reclined on sun loungers. They sipped drinks and waved Norwegian flags. The sunlight hit the mirrors and reflected down onto the faces of delighted children below.

## Seeing The Light

TV footage of the event showed the center of the crowded square light up. But it was just a bit of light. It was not like the town was hit by direct sunlight. Still, people who live there said they could notice the effect.

"Before when it was a fine day, you would see that the sky was blue and you knew that the sun was shining. But you couldn't quite see it. It was very frustrating," said Karin Roe. She works for the local tourist office. "This feels warm."

The town of Rjukan is often freezing throughout the winter. So is much of Scandinavia. But on Wednesday, it was 45 degrees Fahrenheit in the town.

Rjukan is not the first place with mirror-assisted sunshine. The Italian town of Viganella has a similar sun mirror. That mirror is smaller, though.

The idea to bring sunlight to Rjukan was Sam Eyde's. He came up with it 100 years ago. Eyde was a Norwegian businessman who built the town between the mountains. He needed it for workers at a plant he put at the foot of a nearby waterfall. The plant produced power from the rushing water.

The famous engineer never saw his plan happen. But his plant and the town he founded still was well-known in Norway. It was the site of the country's most famous wartime adventure.

The Germans took over Norway during World War II.  The factory was used to try to develop an atomic bomb for Germany. Twelve Norwegians parachuted into the nearby tundra. Their mission was to sabotage the plant with bombs. They survived freezing temperatures. The mission inspired a 1965 Hollywood movie. It is also being turned into a 10-part TV series.

## Computer-Controlled Mirrors

Now there is a strange twist. The three mirrors that reflected the sun onto the town are operated from Germany. The mirrors captured the sunlight. They sent it in a curve that lit up about one-third of the square below.

A cloud weakened the sun's effect. But a band encouraged it to move away with the song, "Let The Sunshine In."

Jan-Anders Dam-Nielsen runs the Norwegian Industrial Museum. It is located on the site of the famous factory. He said the solar experiment is a new chapter in the history of Rjukan.

"Soon we will celebrate 70 years since the saboteurs struck the factory," he said. "Then we will think about how we mark this. This is a really important day in the history of this town. And like the mirrors reflected the sun, we will reflect this in the museum."

The mirrors are also called heliostats. They cost about $850,000. They were flown in by helicopters in and installed 1,500 feet above the town square.

The mirrors are controlled by computers. They are more commonly used to create solar power in sun-drenched regions of the Middle East.

The century-old idea was revived in 2005 by artist Martin Andersen. He lives in the town and helped raise money for the mirrors. The most money has come from Norsk Hydro — the company started by Sam Eyde.
