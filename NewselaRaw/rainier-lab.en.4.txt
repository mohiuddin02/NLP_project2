SEATTLE â€” Would you want to explore a cave made out of ice? What if the cave was at the top of a mountain? What if the mountain was a volcano? A volcano is a mountain filled with burning hot liquid rock that comes from below the Earth's surface. Every now and then the liquid rock explodes through an opening in the volcano and into the air.

Most people would not find the climbing fun. Adventurer Bill Lokey does.

Lokey is 67 years old. This August, he traveled to the ice caves at the top of Mount Rainier. It is a 14,411-foot-high volcano in Washington state.

The caves at the top of Mount Rainier are an unusual sight. They are icy and some are as big as an auditorium.

## Pockets In The Ice

How did they get there? The top of Mount Rainier is covered in ice and snow because it is very cold that high up in the air. But down below, the volcano releases heat. The heat slowly melts pockets in the ice, making the caves.

In the early 1970s, Lokey explored these caves with a group of adventurers and mountaineers. They used tape measures and compasses to make maps of the caves.

Ever since, Lokey hoped to visit the caves again. This summer, he finally met a group of experts who wanted to go to the caves as well.

They set out in August. Getting there was not easy.

Leading the group was a man named Eddy Cartaya. The group included scientists, mountain climbers and Lokey.

The first day of hiking was exhausting. The 15-person team hiked for seven hours. They finally reached Camp Muir, a group of stone huts part of the way up the mountain.

## A Big Storm Hits

Another climber greeted them with some bad news. He said there was a big storm coming.

Cartaya and his group decided to leave right away. They hoped to get to the top of the volcano before the storm hit. They were not so lucky.

The next afternoon, the team was only partway to the top. Then the sky darkened. Snow began to fall.

"We grabbed our packs and ran for the nearest cave entrance," Cartaya said. They spent the night inside the caves.

Eventually, the storm passed. Cartaya and his team then started taking measurements of the caves. They measured how wide and tall each chamber and passage was. Later, they used their measurements to make a three-dimensional map of the caves.

Lokey's group got to the caves on Saturday.

## The Volcano Below

Scientists in the group hoped to learn a lot from the caves. They started to work.

One scientist wanted to know more about the volcano below. He measured the air in the caves. He wanted to study the gasses that are released when volcanoes explode.

Another scientist wanted to see if there were any tiny living things, so she took samples of the water and soil.

Lokey spent his two days at the top of Mount Rainier helping the scientists with their experiments. He also thought about how he had been there before, 40 years ago.

"It's just amazing to be here again," he said, before heading down Sunday. Most people will never see the Mount Rainier ice caves. Lokey has seen them twice.
