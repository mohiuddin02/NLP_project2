YUBA CITY, Calif. — Here in California's Central Valley, birds flying high in the sky have spotted water. They are coming in for a landing.

Migrating birds — birds heading south for the winter — need wetlands. These areas are places for birds to rest and eat during their long journeys. Without them, birds might not have the strength to continue.

These wetlands are man-made. They are flooded rice fields. Birds need spots like this these days. The drought in California has dried out many natural wetlands in the state.

Each year, about 350 kinds of migrating birds fly through central California. Millions of birds are currently heading south.

## "They See Water And Come Down"

Conservationists — people who protect, or conserve, wildlife — are creating temporary wetlands to give the migrating birds places to rest and recover.

They are renting 14,000 acres from rice farmers to create wetlands.

The field here is part of the 5,000-acre Montna Farms. Birds began to appear just hours after the field was flooded.

"It was incredible," says conservationist Simon Avery. "The birds are flying high over our heads, and they see water and come down."

Things are looking bad for birds in California this year. The new man-made wetlands are one good thing.

## State Hit Hard By Drought

Almost all of California is in a bad drought. Wetlands have dried up. When birds crowd into smaller spaces, it is easy for diseases to spread.

Canada and Alaska had a wet winter last year. More birds than usual were born. Now, more birds are coming to California.

Even before the drought, most of the state's natural wetlands had disappeared. Fortunately, rice farmers flood their fields in winter. Rice fields have taken the place of natural wetlands.

The drought has hit rice farmers hard, however.

Normally, the state's rice farmers flood 250,000 to 300,000 acres of land in winter. This winter, only about 50,000 acres will be flooded.

## Looking At Bird Flight Paths

Millions of birds migrate in September to October and in February to March. That is when the conservationists are trying to create temporary wetlands.

Bird flight paths have been carefully studied. The information is used to put wetlands where they will do the most good.

Montna Farms was picked after careful study. This week, farmer Jon Munger is hard at work. He is getting the fields ready for another flooding.

As he works, various birds stand around, waiting for the fields to fill up with water. In two weeks, there will be thousands of birds. They will be busy swimming, resting and hunting bugs.

Without these temporary wetlands, birds would be in even more trouble, Munger said. They might die before they can complete their journeys.
