LOS ANGELES — Tiny microbes on the bottom of the ocean floor may have been responsible for killing off most of the life on Earth a long time ago, according to a new study.

These microbes of death were so small, that 1 billion of them could fit in a thimble-full of ocean sediment.

But scientists suggest that they may have caused the end-Permian extinction, the most catastrophic mass extinction the Earth has ever seen. It started roughly 252 million years ago — long before the dinosaurs — and it continued for 20,000 years. By the time it was over, nearly 90 percent of all life on Earth had been destroyed, the scientists say.

"It was not as dramatic as the impact that probably killed the dinosaurs, but it was worse," said Gregory Fournier, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who studies evolution. "Things were very close to being over for good."

## Mystery Of CO2 Rise

Scientists have struggled to understand exactly what caused the long, slow, mass die-off in this dark era of our planet's history. Examining layers of rocks, known as the geologic record, tells us CO2 levels rose quickly at the time. That would have caused the oceans to become more acidic and the Earth to heat up. Such conditions made the environment too harsh for most forms of life. But what actually caused the CO2 levels to rise has remained a mystery.

Some scientists have suggested an asteroid could be to blame; others have proposed that volcanic activity or coal fires might be the culprit.

Now, in a paper published this week, researchers from MIT and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing, China, have named a new and unlikely suspect. They blame a tiny methane-spewing microbe known as Methanosarcina.

The first clue that microscopic microbes could be involved in the greatest die-off the Earth has ever known came when MIT geophysicist Dan Rothman was looking at how carbon levels grew during this time. What he saw was not a straight line, but rather a rapid upward curve.

"If the CO2 came from the sudden combustion of a coal field in Siberia it wouldn't behave this way. It has this special character that is consistent with microbial processes," he said.

It was the first time anyone had suggested microbes might be involved with the end-Permian extinction, but far from the first time that microbes have been accused of changing the chemistry of our planet. For example, photosynthetic microbes are responsible for creating the first oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.

"It is absolutely normal that microbes are mediating the great elemental cycles," said Rothman. "What they do is crucial. And if they do better or worse, things change."

Fournier put it this way: "Microbiologists like to say, 'Microbes rule the Earth, and we just live on it.'"

## Nickel A Key To The Puzzle

To figure out which specific microbe might have a hand in this ancient catastrophe, Rothman took his research to Fournier, who had published a paper about Methanosarcina in 2008. The paper showed that sometime in the last 400 million years, Methanosarcina received a gene transfer that allowed it to produce methane more efficiently than ever before.

After seeing Rothman's analysis, Fournier worked to figure out more precisely when the gene transfer happened. He found it most likely occurred about 250 million years ago.

Although the researchers cannot say for certain that the microbe and the vast quantities of methane it produced were responsible for the end-Permian extinction, they do have one more line of evidence to support their hypothesis. In order to turn acetate into methane, Methanosarcina needs nickel.

"Even if they had all the food in the world they would be limited if they were starved for nickel," Fournier said.

But if there was a lot of nickel around, the microbes would be unhindered. And, wouldn't you know, much of the volcanic activity at the time occurred in Siberia, which has some of the world's largest deposits of nickel. Furthermore, the researchers found an increase in nickel in sediments from that time.

"Our proposal is unusual, but it does bring together many observations, and ties a lot of stuff together," Rothman said. "That doesn't make it right, but it is consistent, and that's what is necessary to move forward and provide further tests."
