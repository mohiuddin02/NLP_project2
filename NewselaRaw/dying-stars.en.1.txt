LOS ANGELES â€” It has long been known that the clouds of gas and dust, or nebulae, that dying stars cast off are strikingly colorful. Now, though, astronomers have discovered something new and mysterious: Some planetary nebulae in the Milky Way galaxy's central bulge are strangely aligned.

The discovery was made by two University of Manchester astrophysics researchers, who will publish their findings shortly in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The new findings provide insight into how the stars behind the nebulae formed. And they also suggest what unknown forces near the Milky Way's heart could have pulled the nebulae into formation.

A dying star's nebula is a sight to behold. Like a flower shedding its petals, an aging star casts off its outer layers, surrounding itself with cloud-like shells of gas and dust. These ethereal structures are created by stars with masses of about one to eight suns, and are often rendered in breathtaking color. Stars that are more massive than eight suns tend to explode into supernovae.

But these shells aren't just interstellar eye candy. Planetary nebulae can tell scientists much about the environment in which they were formed. Nebulae reflect their stars' individual characteristics. And they can reveal whether a star is one of a binary pair of stars and whether it has any orbiting planets tugging at it gravitationally.

## Something Strange In Galactic Bulge

The two researchers, lead author Bryan Rees and Albert Zijlstra, studied data from 130 nebulae. All are located roughly 26,000 light-years away in the Milky Way's densely populated central galactic bulge. About 44 of them were bipolar; that is, they had formed into twin gas clouds, often resembling butterfly wings. The majority were elliptical, meaning they had a mostly roundish shape.

Soon the researchers began to notice something strange: More than half of the bipolar nebulae seemed to be aligned, even though they were separated by vast distances of many light-years amid the crowded galactic bulge. Just one light year equals about 6 trillion miles.

"The surprise is that there's a relationship between things that are so widely separated," Rees said. "Now, how can we explain it?"

Other bipolar nebulae that sit closer to the Earth, farther from the galactic center, are randomly oriented, not neatly arranged. This means there must be something going on in the bulge that's causing its nebulae to line up.

The nebulae's shared alignment points to "a powerful magnetic pull in the galactic bulge when they were formed," Rees said. "It's not necessarily there now."

## Strong Magnetic Fields At Play

Say you're holding a magnet near a bunch of scattered nails, and only some of the nails are magnetized. Only the magnetized nails will turn and point if you bring the magnet near, leaving the unmagnetized ones untouched.

That's sort of what could be happening here, astronomers say. The bipolar nebulae were probably two-star systems with strong magnetic fields. Like the magnetized nails, they would have been unable to resist a powerful magnetic force in the galactic bulge around when it was forming stars, about 8 to 13 billion years ago. The elliptical nebulae, lacking this strong magnetic field, remained unmoved.

If you were to look at these bipolar nebulae along the plane of the galaxy, Rees said, they would look like hourglasses lying on their sides.

The findings could help explain how "bipolar nebulae are formed, and provide some insight, possibly, on the way the bulge was formed," he said.

The study doesn't go into what exactly could have caused that magnetic field. However, a recent study in Nature says it has found evidence for a strong magnetic field around the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Whether that field could have extended to where these nebulae are, and had the observed effect, remains to be seen.
