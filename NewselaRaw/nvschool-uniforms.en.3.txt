SAN FRANCISCO â€” In 2011, a Nevada public elementary school announced that all students must wear a uniform. On the shirt is printed the school's motto, "Tomorrow's Leaders." The words curve above a drawing of the school mascot, a gopher.

One parent objected to the uniforms and eventually sued. She claimed that they went against the First Amendment, which protects the right to free speech. That amendment to the Constitution doesn't only allow people to say what they want. It also means they can't be forced to say something, either in speech or writing.

In a ruling this Friday, three judges from an appeals court largely agreed with her. They declared that the words "Tomorrow's Leaders" could harm students' right to free speech. The uniform cannot be required, the judges said. Unless, that is, the school district can come up with a good legal reason for the uniform. And that will be difficult.

The school's uniform rule "compels speech," wrote Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen. That is, it forces students to "say" something they may not agree with. It does this by requiring "the written motto, 'Tomorrow's Leaders.'"

## Clothing With Messages

The judges also objected to the fact that the school allowed some students not to wear the uniform. Students belonging to national youth groups like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts can skip wearing the uniform sometimes. They are permitted to wear their own uniforms on meeting days.

That, the court said, is unfair. It "favors the uniforms of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts over all other uniforms."

The lawsuit was filed against Roy Gomm Elementary School in Reno, Nev. But the ruling also applies to California and other Western states.

Eugene Volokh, a professor of constitutional law, represented the mother. Public schools are allowed to have dress codes, he said. But they may not make people wear clothing with messages. It doesn't matter that those messages don't seem too likely to upset anybody.

Different people are upset by different things, said Volokh. "You can't be compelled to become a moving billboard for the state's messages."

## Protecting Free Speech

Volokh said the school motto could be viewed as glamorizing the idea of being a leader. And it could be seen as suggesting that "the school is producing leaders."

In ruling for the mother, the judges mentioned a 1977 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, the highest court in the U.S. New Hampshire had passed a law requiring all state license plates to contain the state motto, "Live Free or Die." The Supreme Court struck that down.

Volokh said the elementary school could still encourage students to wear the uniform. But they also would have to permit similar clothing without the motto. And they would have to allow the uniforms of other groups in addition to the Scouts.

Mary Frudden is the mother who filed the lawsuit. She is a lawyer. It is highly important "to protect our First Amendment rights," she said.

"I believe we should consider the best interest of every child in our public schools," Frudden said. Schools should encourage students to be free thinkers. Kids must not be made to all think alike, she said. That would be bad for "our children and our society."
