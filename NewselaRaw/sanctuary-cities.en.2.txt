HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. â€” Some Republicans are using the term "sanctuary city" to get tougher immigration laws. They claim these cities protect those who are in the country illegally from immigration authorities.

The reality is that while some cities ignore federal immigration rules, many refuse to enforce them. It is not that they care so much about immigrants, but they do fear lawsuits.

In July, a woman named Kathryn Steinle was killed in San Francisco. The police said the man who shot her was an immigrant who was released from jail even though U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sought to deport him for a sixth time. Since then, the debate over officials who refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities has boiled over.

## Some Lawmakers Want To Punish Cities

On July 23, Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a bill that would punish cities that refused to share information with federal immigration authorities. The White House has threatened to veto the bill if it is passed by the full Congress.

The vote came after presidential hopeful Donald Trump attacked illegal immigration.

San Francisco has openly declared itself a refuge for all immigrants, regardless of whether they are here legally. San Francisco is known as a liberal city. However, some of the cities and counties that do not detain immigrants are politically conservative and traditional, and they agree with the Republicans. They are not trying to protect immigrants from deportation. They are trying to avoid getting sued.

A federal court in Oregon said that being in the country illegally was not enough reason for someone to be held in jail for up to 48 hours. That rule is called a detainer. The city of Huntington Beach, California, is mainly white and Republican. But last summer it stopped holding these immigrants in jail for purely legal reasons.

## Police Just Follow The Law, One Chief Says

"We don't have any policy or anything that prohibits our folks from interacting with ICE. We just follow the law," said Police Chief Robert Handy. He added that his officers don't generally ask about whether people are in the country legally or illegally. The reason is that it doesn't relate to their cases, not because they're protecting anyone. If a judge's order tells the police to put someone in jail, "we'll hold them in our jail," he said.

San Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city more than 20 years ago. It continues to advertise itself as a place of refuge for immigrants. In 1989, the city banned officials from enforcing immigration laws or asking immigrants if they are here legally. The only exception to this rule is if it is required by law or court order.

Today, there are about 200 cities and counties that do not follow requests to detain immigrants in jail.

## Some Cities Try To Gain Immigrants' Trust

The places vary widely on how far they go to welcome immigrants or whether they help them at all. Places like Cook County, Illinois, and Santa Clara County, California, want to encourage immigrants to trust the police. Others, such as San Bernardino and Riverside counties in California, are worried about getting sued.

Jennie Pasquarella is a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. She said that when someone uses the term "sanctuary city," it implies a decision about dealing with the local immigration communities. "Most of the detainer policies were adopted to address the legal concerns," she said.

Mark Krikorian is the executive director of the Center for Immigration Cities, which is against illegal immigration.

## Officials Want To Be Alerted Before Jail Release

Some cities "may cooperate here but not there. Some may cooperate on certain matters but not other matters," Krikorian said. However, he thinks any city that does not cooperate with immigration authorities is a sanctuary city.

Last year, a number of cities that worked closely with ICE stopped holding immigrants in jail because of the ruling in Oregon. In response, immigration authorities said they would ask police to simply let them know when a person, who is suspected of being in the country illegally, is about to get released. Then the immigration authorities could arrest him or her.

In the Orange County jail, sheriff's deputies work closely with federal immigration officials. They regularly ask immigrants whether they are here legally. They tell the agents when someone who may be deported out of the country is due to be released. But the agency doesn't hold people on the detainers due to legal concerns, said Steve Kea, an assistant sheriff.

Orange County is not a "sanctuary" area by any definition, said Undersheriff John Scott.
