LUKANG, Taiwan — Kenneth Wang was not yet 3 years old when the Taiwanese secret police took away his father in 1947.

Japan occupied parts of China from 1931 to 1945\. Kenneth Wang's father was the first Taiwanese to serve in an important government position during Japanese rule. But that made him a marked man in Taiwan after the end of World War II — when China took control of the island and began a bloody campaign of terror against scholars, doctors and other elites. Historians estimate 10,000 to 30,000 people died.

"My mother went to ask for his body. They denied they had even taken him," recalled Wang, who moved to the United States in the 1960s and now lives in San Diego. "We never found out where he was."

Wang and about 100 other Californians were part of a 160-member group of people born in Taiwan called Friends of Tsai Overseas. They returned to Taiwan this week not only to vote in Saturday's election but also to witness a change of power.

## Waiting Years For Political Change

On Tuesday afternoon, Wang stood by the roadside in Lukang in western Taiwan, with a group of other Americans born in Taiwan. They were waiting to cheer on presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen as she passed by in her campaign vehicle. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is on the verge of winning the presidency. The DPP is also likely to sweep the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, and their allies out of control of Parliament. It would be the first time the KMT will be out of power since Taiwan's modern political era began in 1949.

"Seventy years — it's been a long struggle," said Wang. "Finally, we are going to overcome the KMT."

For Wang and many of the others, the journey is intensely personal.

"My dad was an (anti-KMT) activist in the 1980s, and he received threats — some that even mentioned me, my middle school, the route I took," recalled Wendy Yang, a 39-year-old lawyer who joined the tour with her mother. "He sent us away for our own safety. That was 1992."

As American as she has become, said Yang, "I can't stay away from Taiwan. That tie is always there."

## Heavyweights In Their Hometowns

Taiwanese campaign rallies resemble street festivals. They are known for lion dancers and men pounding traditional drums, fireworks and even giant inflatable spiders.

The DPP's rally Tuesday evening had a vibe that was part rock concert, part religious service. Wang, Yang and the rest of the group arrived on five buses and got prime seats near the stage.

Both Tsai and the KMT presidential candidate, Eric Chu, visited Southern California last year. They both wanted to win support from Taiwanese-born Americans.

The number of returnee voters in Taiwan has been sliding. This year, only 2,317 overseas Taiwanese registered to vote, and maybe 1,500 of them will actually fly to Taiwan to do so. Still, Taiwanese political leaders say they play a huge role in the last days of the campaign. Since arriving last weekend, Yang's group has been attending two to three campaign events daily.

"These people who manage to do well in the U.S. or Canada, they're outstanding people," said Lai Ching-te, mayor of Tainan, one of Taiwan's largest cities. "When they return to their hometowns, their support carries extra weight."

## Rallying For Their Candidate

On Tuesday afternoon, the overseas Taiwanese were in sleepy Lukang. They  enthusiastically waved flags and held up green banners to support the DPP's local candidate, film director Chen Wen-bin. Later, they gathered in a vacant lot and led victory cheers, "Dong suan!" they chanted. Get elected!

"When I see all these overseas Taiwanese coming back, it's like a big family reuniting," said Chen, the DPP candidate.

China's civil war ended in 1949, leaving the Communists in control of the mainland and the Nationalist Party ruling Taiwan. Since then, each side has insisted it was the rightful ruler of all of China.

For decades, Washington was a close ally of Taiwan's KMT-run government, valuing it as an anti-Communist ally. Under communism, the government owns all property and there is little freedom. The Nationalists are anti-communist, but for most of its history, it was not democratic. Until the late 1970s, the United States and many other Western countries recognized Taiwan's Nationalists as the legitimate Chinese government, not the mainland Chinese communists.

## A Changing Tide Of Influence

That situation has changed. China's Communist leaders have used the nation's growing economic power to press many countries to cut ties with Taiwan. Beijing continues to insist that Taiwan and the mainland are part of "one China" and must be reunited some day.

But many Taiwanese — especially younger voters — yearn for full independence from mainland China.

Chen said he hopes overseas Taiwanese will advocate for Taiwan back home — especially in the United States. America remains a key military and political ally of Taiwan.

"These overseas Taiwanese can witness this election, this important moment," Chen said. But they can also return to their home countries "to explain Taiwan's need for democracy and need for international support."
