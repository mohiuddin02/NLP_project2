KANSAS CITY, Mo. — It started more than 60 years ago. As construction crews began developing sections of a Kansas City meadow near the Blue River, a man started showing up with a metal detector.

The man, John Adams Jr., was concerned about valuable pieces of local history being lost forever. Over an 11-year period beginning in 1952, he dug up dozens of items. The objects he found had been left there during a fierce Civil War battle, the October 1864 Battle of Westport.

Adams found belt buckles, bayonets, guns, bullets, unexploded artillery shells — even a carved bullet that may have been used as a chess piece. Often he arrived after big rains, in case rushing water had revealed something previously hidden. Whenever new construction commenced, he asked permission to look around.

Today, Civil War students are thankful for the work of Adams. Because of him, a collection of artifacts from Kansas City's most significant Civil War battle survives today.

## Byram's Ford Big Blue Battlefield

Visitors to the Battle of Westport Visitors Center and Museum can see what Adams saved. About 75 artifacts that he retrieved from the area now known as the Byram's Ford Big Blue Battlefield will be on exhibit.

Adams' collection has only recently become known to more than a handful of people. It greatly increases the number of recognized Battle of Westport artifacts. In addition, some of the pieces are distinctive enough to be matched to particular units that fought in the battle.

Adams held onto his Civil War finds for many years. When his health went bad a couple of years ago, he sought a way to preserve the collection. He approached Mike George, a collector of historical artifacts, and talked him into buying the collection for $400 not long before Adams' death in 2012.

"To me it was just a bunch of rusted things," George recalled recently. "He said, 'I want somebody who will appreciate it and not sell it.' He was a good friend and finally I said, 'John, I'll do it, but only because it is you.'"

Although George wasn't an expert on the Battle of Westport, he knew the basics.

The battle between the Union North and the Confederate South lasted three days. It began on Oct. 21, 1864. Approximately 29,000 soldiers were involved, making it the biggest Civil War battle west of the Mississippi River. When the Union side won, any hope of a significant Confederate presence in Missouri was ended.

## Preserving Local Civil War History

Earlier this year, with the battle's anniversary approaching, George decided to exhibit some of Adams' artifacts. He chose the Remington Nature Center, a wildlife and history museum in St. Joseph.

Seeking reliable information about the battle, George tracked down Daniel Smith. A lawyer, Smith serves as chairman of the Monnett Battle of Westport Fund, a group devoted to preserving local Civil War history. The fund has preserved much of the 40-acre Byram's Ford Big Blue Battlefield.

When George and Smith's phone discussion on the battle turned to George's artifacts, Smith felt doubtful but interested. The Monnett Fund had obtained only a small collection of Battle of Westport artifacts.

Smith drove to the nature center, where George had the artifacts arranged on tables.

George mentioned his friend, John Adams.

"Adams?" Smith repeated, suddenly very interested.

Smith had researched the Adams family for years.

## "I Was Absolutely Floored"

William Adams and his family had come from Virginia to Jackson County in 1853 and purchased 276 acres from brothers named Byram. The property stood near a crossing, or ford, of the Big Blue River — Byram's Ford.

Then the war arrived. The Adams family had to flee Jackson County because of an evacuation order and did not return to the Byram's Ford property until 1870.

When George started talking about Adams, Smith's doubts about the collection vanished.

George showed Smith two Hotchkiss shells, the type fired by guns used by the 2nd Missouri Light Artillery, a Union outfit.

"The shells would have been fired from the east bluff above Byram's Ford across the flood plain and onto the west side," Smith said.

The Monnett Fund only owns a copy of such a shell. Here, however, were two real examples, both still whole because neither had exploded.

"I was absolutely floored," Smith said.

## Found In A Family Barn

George then showed him a French-made handgun that may have belonged to a Confederate soldier. It had been found in an Adams family barn in the late 19th century and had been kept in the family through the years.

Adams searched his family's old property for artifacts well into the 1960s. He began finding less, however, once asphalt and concrete started covering up more of the area around the old battlefield.

Today, the Byram's Ford Big Blue Battlefield is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the government's list of historical places it considers worth preserving.
