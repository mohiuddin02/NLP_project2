CHICAGO — Cancer is much less common in elephants than in humans, even though the big beasts' bodies have many more cells. Researchers now think they might have found an explanation for that puzzling fact. If they are right, their discovery might someday lead to new ways to protect people from cancer.

Elephants' cells contain 20 copies of a major cancer-suppressing gene, compared with just one copy in humans, two teams of scientists report. The gene helps damaged cells repair themselves or self-destruct when exposed to cancer-causing substances.

The findings are not proof that those extra p53 genes make elephants cancer-resistant. However, if future research does provide confirmation, scientists could try to develop drugs for humans that would mimic the effect.

## Whales, Elephants Have Low Cancer Rates

Dr. Joshua Schiffman, a cancer specialist who led one of the teams, began his research after hearing a lecture a few years ago. The lecturer brought up the fact that large animals, including elephants and whales, have comparatively low cancer rates even though they have many more cells than smaller species. Cancer involves uncontrolled cell growth.

The lecturer mentioned that elephants seem to have extra copies of the p53 gene. Schiffman's patients include children with incomplete p53 genes because of a condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which greatly increases their chances of developing cancer. So Schiffman sought to find clues in blood samples taken from eight elephants, including Ringling Bros. circus animals and local zoo animals.

His team — along with a second group of scientists — eventually determined that elephant cells have 20 copies of the p53 gene. The second team found that many other species have only one copy per cell, just like humans.

## Further Confirmation Of Results Is Needed

Schiffman and his team looked at how elephant cells reacted to radiation, compared with cells from 10 healthy humans and 10 patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Radiation is known to cause cancer in humans and many animals.

The elephant cells self-destructed at twice the rate of healthy human cells and more than five times the rate of cells from patients with the syndrome. Cells that do not self-repair or self-destruct when exposed to cancer-causing substances are more likely to develop the disease.

The work was published Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Dr. Judy Garber, a leading cancer specialist, said the research is intriguing but needs further confirmation.

## Only 1 In 20 Elephants Dies Of Cancer

The research will not lead to any immediate treatment for humans. Still, progress in the fight against cancer can come "from unexpected directions," said Dr. Ted Gansler of the American Cancer Society. He noted that studies of eyelid and tooth development in mice led to drugs used for colon cancer, throat cancer and several other cancers.

Schiffman's team also found that elephants sometimes live as long as humans, yet only about 1 in 20 dies of cancer, versus about 1 in 4 humans.

## Research Is "Very Intriguing"

The second group of researchers, working with frozen zoo specimens, looked at more than 60 other species by way of comparison. They found that only elephants and wooly mammoths, their extinct relatives, have extra copies of the cancer-suppressing gene.

The second team also inserted elephants' p53 genes into mouse cells. They found that those cells behaved just like elephant cells and self-destructed when exposed to DNA-damaging drugs.

Schiffman's team is seeking funding for research into possible treatments based on the elephant research. While studies in humans are at least several years away, "we certainly think we've found something very intriguing," Schiffman said.
