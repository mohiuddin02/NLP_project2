Jeramey Winfield had imagined himself working in downtown Chicago, taking the train to work and contributing to his profession. He wanted to get his own apartment and begin helping his family financially.

"I had this vision of helping my mom out, since she struggled to raise five of us. I wanted to give her some relief," said Winfield, who is the first in his family to go to college.

Yet, more than a year after graduating in media studies from Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire, Winfield still does not have a full-time job. In fact, he said, he has rarely been called back for an interview.

## "A College Degree Is No Guarantee"

While unemployment is falling to its lowest level in years, recent college graduates across the country are nonetheless struggling to find work. For young African-Americans with four-year degrees, a new report found, the job search has been especially brutal. They are having a harder time than whites finding a job, are more likely to be in a job that does not require a college degree and are being paid less than white workers with the same experience.

Even African-Americans who study science, technology, engineering and math — majors that are winners in the job market — have had a hard time finding work, said John Schmitt. The senior economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research co-authored the new report, "A College Degree is No Guarantee."

"We are looking at a group of people who did everything right," Schmitt said. "They graduated high school like they were told. They went to college and graduated. They entered the labor market. But they are more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts."

## Trying To Lead The Way

In many cases, like Winfield, these graduates were the first in their family to attend college. They bear heavy expectations and responsibilities, from carrying the banner of success for the family to helping out their families financially. That can make their search for work all the more urgent, and their failure to find it a greater burden.

The gap between whites and blacks has been fueled by many factors. Black college graduates do not have strong professional networks, and may have more trouble reaching the people who hire in the corporate world. More important, according to Schmitt, young African-Americans can face discrimination when they try to get their foot in the door.

"Employers give in to their racial bias and they are more likely to offer a job to a white candidate than a black candidate," Schmitt said.

Among recent black graduates ages 22 to 27, the jobless rate in 2013 was 12.4 percent compared with 5.6 percent for whites. For black 22-year-olds just leaving college, 67.1 percent were underemployed, compared with 56.2 percent for all college graduates in that age group, Schmitt said. Underemployment is when a person holds a job that too low-paying or does not match their qualifications.

## Stress And Pressure

Joblessness can be particularly traumatic for young African-Americans, said Robert Hawkins, an associate professor in poverty studies at New York University's Silver School of Social Work. Often they have to cope daily with racism and deal with the stress of living in poor, violent communities, Hawkins said. There could be pressure from family and friends who expect them to be successful.

"You have someone who went to the right school, worked really hard and was told they can be anything they want," Hawkins said. "Then they realize that isn't true."

At the Career Transitions Center of Chicago, Executive Director Anita Jenke said that some of her African-American clients come from struggling communities and their families rely on them to help with bills, child and elder care. Because they don't have much money, they cannot afford the cab fare or train ticket to get to interviews. Sometimes they lack a working cellphone or Internet access, and many jobs require resumes and applications to be filled out online.

"These kids have so much to give," Jenke said. "They are so motivated, so personable and committed to making it. They are accomplished and often they want to work helping to contribute to society. They just need an opportunity."

## Going Above And Beyond

At Colby-Sawyer College, Winfield was a standout student who created the campus' first gospel choir.

"Jeramey is just a wonderful person who made our campus a better place," said the college's president, Tom Galligan, who became friends with Winfield while he was on campus.

His success at Colby-Sawyer, which he attended on a scholarship, is part of the reason Winfield cannot understand why he can't find a job.

"I feel like I'm a sharp and confident person," he said. "I've always gone above and beyond. It does make me think, 'Am I not good enough? What's wrong with me?'"

Winfield has an older brother who was shot and left paralyzed, his mother does not have much money and his siblings struggle to get by.

Winfield scrapes by earning money from working with a mentoring program at his former high school, and occasionally he picks up substitute teaching jobs, which pay him about $125 a day. The rest of the time, he volunteers as a youth leader at his church and searches for work.

"Being rejected by the professional world has pushed me to go harder working at my high school and my church," he said. "Since I can't give what I learned to a professional environment, I know I can come back to where I came from and use it here. I'm still a success to the people here."
