MIAMI, Fla. — Neither his father nor his brother was in the audience on Monday. Still, Jeb Bush jokingly referred to both, drawing laughs by noting that he met his first president the day he was born and the second the day he came home from the hospital.

Bush, who was there to formally announce his run for the White House, soon turned serious, making his point humbly and unmistakably clear: The presidency, he said, was something to be earned, not inherited.

"Not a one of us deserves the job," the former Florida governor told a hometown crowd Monday, "by right of resume, party, seniority, family or family narrative.

"It's nobody's turn," Bush went on, in what also served as a poke at the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton. "It's everybody's test, and it's wide open — exactly as a contest for president should be."

The question of dynastic succession for Bush, the son of former President George H.W. Bush and the younger brother of former President George W. Bush, is one of the largest hurdles facing him in his historic White House bid.

## Bush Challenges His Party On Immigration, Education

Bush's candidacy represents a gamble in other respects as well. More than most others in the field, Bush has been willing to challenge the standard positions of his party, particularly when it comes to immigration and education. He has called for a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, while rejecting the enforcement-driven approach favored by many in the Republican Party. He has also continued to support federal education standards that are deeply disliked by many conservatives.

The bet is that Bush can lay out positions that will appeal to a broad range of voters, especially the rapidly growing share of Latino voters, without destroying his chances of first winning his party's nomination.

The official launch of Bush's candidacy was a mere formality after six months of heavy campaigning. Still, it served as a fresh start of sorts for a candidacy that has proved less than overwhelming. The event, attended by his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, and his wife, children and other family members, drew hours of television coverage and dozens of reporters to swampy south Florida.

## Campaign Rally Aims Beyond Traditional Base

The launch was carefully designed to signal that, even at age 62, Bush is poised to be a different sort of Republican. It sought to suggest that he would be able to connect with voters outside the Republican's shrinking traditional base.

Indeed, Bush's rally was no typical gathering of aging, white, rural Republicans. Latin music pulsed outside the college gymnasium where the announcement was made, and English, Spanish and several other languages mingled together at the event.

The chosen venue, Miami Dade College, was itself a signal. A branch of the state public university system, the palm-dotted suburban Miami campus has one of the largest enrollments of Latino students in the country.

Inside the heavily air-conditioned gym, Bush delivered the message he hopes will serve him through the long, grinding campaign. It mixed can-do confidence and a highly flattering recitation of his record as governor with subtle jabs at the several senators competing with him for the Republican nomination.

Bush took turns criticizing the administration of President Barack Obama and swatting at his congressional rivals. He suggested that his time as governor had prepared him to serve as president. "Executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that," he said.

Yet for all the newness he sought to project and despite the many young people in the audience, much of Bush's message was old-time Republican gospel. It included calls for lower taxes, less regulation and more limited government. His promise to banish the special interests and "shake up the culture of Washington" is standard for candidates of both parties.

## Bush Sets Ambitious Goal Of 19 Million Jobs

In one of Monday's few specific pledges, Bush laid out an ambitious goal of 4 percent annual growth for each year he is president. The result, he said, would be the creation of 19 million new jobs.

Bush, who started in Florida politics in the early 1980s, had been mentioned as a presidential prospect for years. Still, he surprised many in December when he finally expressed interest in running.

Perhaps more surprising, though, has been his performance since then.

Far from being the commanding front-runner some anticipated, Bush has failed to break free of a large and growing field of Republican rivals, by far the biggest in recent memory. More than a dozen hopefuls have declared their candidacy or are weighing a White House bid.

Even Marco Rubio, Florida's junior senator, declined to stand aside for Bush, who helped guide Rubio early in his political career.

Time has not done Bush any favors.

## Political Re-Entry Has Been Bumpy

The Republican Party has moved considerably to the right since Bush last ran for office more than a dozen years ago. And his political rustiness has shown, most notably when he fumbled an easily foreseen question about whether he backed the unpopular war his brother launched in Iraq. Bush finally said that, given what is known today, he would not have supported the invasion.

Change, especially in politics, is never easy.

At one point Monday, Bush was interrupted by demonstrators. The protesters were angry with Bush because he has backed away from advocating a path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

Turning to address his critics, Bush vowed to "pass meaningful immigration reform," though he offered no specifics.

To win the presidency, Bush suggested he would seek to bring the Republican Party to his way of thinking, not the other way around. If he succeeds, that in itself would be a historic achievement.
