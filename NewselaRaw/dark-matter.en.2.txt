LEAD, S.D. â€” For decades, scientists have been searching for something they believe is a major part of the entire universe. The problem is, they don't know what it looks like or where to find it. They do have a name for it, though: dark matter.

Dark matter was first proposed by scientists in the 1930s. It is a way they explain certain inconsistencies between how scientists expected the universe to act and how they saw it actually behaving.

The latest attempt to find dark matter is happening nearly a mile underground in an old gold mine. On Wednesday, scientists there announced their search has so far come up empty.

But physicists on the project were upbeat. They said they had developed a new and better way of searching for the mysterious material that has mass but cannot be seen. The experiment has only been running for a few months, so they plan to keep looking.

## LUX Looks For WIMPS

The Large Underground Xenon experiment, or LUX, is currently the most advanced Earth-based search for dark matter. A detector attached to the International Space Station has so far failed to find any of the stuff, either.

The experiment is taking place at the Sanford Underground Research Facility, which was built in an abandoned gold mine in South Dakota's Black Hills. The advantage of running the experiment underground is that some 4,800 feet of earth help screen out background radiation. Such radiation can create confusion about just what scientists are seeing. So, the more of it that can be eliminated, the better.

There are many theories about what dark matter is. The LUX team hopes it will be revealed in the form of so-called weakly interacting massive particles, nicknamed WIMPS. To help spot the WIMPS, the researchers installed a large tank of xenon gas, cooled to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit. They have been searching for evidence of a WIMP bouncing off one of the xenon gas's atomic particles.

But nothing has been found yet. The team will continue looking for another year. It plans to build better equipment and to use a bigger tank of xenon. Scientists involved in the experiment said it had eliminated some ideas about what dark matter might be, but there are many more ideas about what to search for.

"The short story is that we didn't see dark matter interacting, but we had the most sensitive search for dark matter ever performed in the world," said physicist Daniel McKinsey.

## What's The Matter?

The LUX experiment was 20 times more sensitive than any previous experiments, scientists said, meaning is was 20 times more able to pick up possible evidence of dark matter. The proposed next experiment would be 1,000 times more sensitive still.

The lab, in a bright, clean space at the end of an old mining tunnel, is reached by a 10-minute ride in an elevator that once carried miners. McKinsey said the experiment has far less radiation interference than any other dark-matter lab.

One problem scientists face is that they are not sure what dark matter is: Is it a bunch of light particles that weakly interact, or is it more like a black hole? Black holes are areas in the universe where gravity is so strong that light cannot escape.

"It's ghost-like matter," McKinsey said of dark matter.

Researchers "are really searching in the dark in a way," said physicist Avi Loeb. "We have no clue. We don't know what this matter is."

But dark matter is central to the universe.

## "Missing Most Of The Universe"

Scientists believe about one-quarter of the universe is made up of dark matter. This is five times as much as the ordinary matter that makes up everything we see. Dark matter is often defined by what it isn't. It's something that cannot be seen, and it isn't a form of energy.

Scientists are pretty sure dark matter exists. But they are not certain what it is made of or how it interacts with ordinary matter. It is considered central to all the scientific theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies move and interact.

"We know there's stuff out there that is something else," said physicist Neal Weiner. "And that makes these searches hugely important because we know we are missing most of the universe."

The lack of success could mean the instruments aren't good enough, McKinsey said.

Of course, the problem could just be that no one knows what dark matter really is. "Perhaps we're going in the wrong direction," Loeb said.
