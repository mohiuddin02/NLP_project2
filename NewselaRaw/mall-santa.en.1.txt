CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Parents hoping to avoid a wait for a visit with Santa Claus at Woodfield Mall near Chicago can now reserve a spot in line with the jolly fellow, though it will cost them.

To make an appointment to see St. Nick at the Minion-themed Ice Palace, which opened Nov. 5, the mall for the first time is requiring a $10 fee that can be used toward the purchase of a photo package.

The new fee and elaborate home for Santa are part of a trend across the country to make holiday displays grander at shopping centers. The goal is to bring online shoppers back to malls.

## Santa Goes Hollywood

Holiday displays are "on the scale of what we are calling an attraction now," said Ruth Rosenquist, a spokeswoman for Noerr Programs, which sends Santas and photographers to 278 malls across the United States, including Woodfield. "They are full-scale Hollywood productions." she said.

Perhaps the biggest reason for the shift is the way the Internet has driven shoppers away from malls, leaving retailers desperate for gimmicks to bring them back.

"I really believe that it's a result of online shopping and the fact that developers are now realizing that Santa Claus is a physical manifestation of the holidays," she said. Santa brings people back to the malls.

Malls in the Chicago area typically allow free visits with Santa but charge fees for photos and do not let parents take pictures, operators say. A spokesman for Simon Properties, which runs Woodfield, said kids still can see Santa for free if they walk up and wait in line. The advance charge is only if they want to reserve their place. The fee helps to ensure that families keep their appointments with photographers, the spokesperson said.

## "A New Level Of Greed"

Mary Jo Shepherd, a parent who has brought her kids to Woodfield for years, considers the advance fee "a new level of greed."

As a social worker, she said she sees families who cannot afford the photo fees. She considers Christmas exhibits at malls and stores, like the holiday window displays at Macy's in downtown Chicago, to be a "give-back" to customers, and was appalled a few years ago when Woodfield stopped letting parents take their own pictures during Santa visits. "It just keeps getting worse and worse every year."

Shelly Kunets, a mom who was visiting Woodfield with her newborn, said she would not pay to see Santa.

"I think it's taking away from the spirit of why we see Santa," she said. "The magic is in meeting Santa. The rest is just extra."

But Matthew Caczewe, a father of two girls, said he works in sales and understands why malls might have to charge for bigger exhibits.

"To get more, where does the money come from?" he asked.

As expensive as the Santa experience can get, it is not surprising that the holiday legend has evolved into a marketing icon, said Robert Thompson. He teaches television and popular culture at Syracuse University.

"Let's remember, Santa is the patron saint of the commercialization of Christmas," he said. "He represents the idea of a bag bursting with presents. On that level, it's hard to get really worked up, because he's always been tied up with moneymaking."

## One Santa Spreads The Free Word

There are still good options for people who want a simple visit with Santa without the fees or reservations, according to none other than Santa himself. John Sullivan, who once managed Santa mall exhibits and now portrays Santa at a variety of events, maintains a long list of free events on his website, at www.santainchicago.com

Most cities, villages, park districts and chambers of commerce offer free visits with Santa and let parents take their own pictures, he said. He attended one such memorable event on Chicago's South Side.

"It was very rewarding, because the kids were so happy to have a Santa there," he said. "The parents were delighted they didn't have to go to a mall and pay."

## It's A Production

Of all the local Christmas productions, perhaps the most elaborate was scheduled to begin Nov. 14 at Oakbrook Center, in Oak Brook, Illinois. It has teamed up with DreamWorks Animation to create "Adventure to Santa," a 20-minute movie that leads visitors on an interactive journey to find Santa, with help from Shrek, Donkey and their friends. Participants attend a Sleigh Flight School and choose one of three obstacle courses. The adventure is offered at only four other sites nationwide, including, appropriately, Las Vegas.

One change to the attraction in its second year is that reservations require the purchase of a photo package, which costs from $39.99 for parties of up to five, to $73.99 for parties of up to eight.

The show was such a hit last year, said Suzanne Beres, a spokeswoman for General Growth Properties, which manages the mall, that online reservations began this year in August.

"We are taking reservations to make it easier and quicker," Beres said. "It allows you to shop and dine and go directly to see Santa. It kind of eliminates standing in a line."

## Recalling Simpler Times

But there is hope for those who long for simpler times, said Rob Albertson of a company called Bandwith Marketing. Marketing experts have noticed a backlash from the public and some retailers who refuse to give in to today's commercial trends, such as letting "Black Friday" creep into Thanksgiving and charging for pictures with Santa.

"When things become too big or too grand or too monetized, there's a nice pendulum shift back," he said.
