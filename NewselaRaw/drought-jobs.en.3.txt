California produces more fruits and vegetables than any other state. Growing food for the rest of the country takes a lot of water, which right now, California is missing. The state is in the middle of a serious drought. It needs more water.

In 2014, a lack of rain forced California farmers to stop using 500,000 acres of land. Farmers did not plant on the land to let it rest and soak up more water. Having too many trees or bushes on it would dry it out more. The roots from the plants would soak up the water from the soil. The farmers would also want to water their crops to keep them alive.

Now experts say that farmers might need to rest twice as much land this year.

## Many Lost Farm Jobs

Richard Howitt is a farming expert at the University of California in Davis. He says 2015's dry weather is going to be much worse than 2014.

The state has had mostly dry weather for the last few years. Winter is usually California's rainy season, but it did not rain or snow very much this year. Even the wettest parts of the state are still drier than they should be.

Wendy Fink-Weber works for a California-based group that represents farmers. She says about 17,000 farm jobs were lost in 2014. She said the lost jobs could mean more work for other states.

Farmers in other states could start planting some of the crops California cannot grow, but not everything. They will only grow the ones that they can sell right away. Crops like almonds would not work. They can take three to seven years of growing before the first harvest is ready.

Resting the land where almonds are grown would mean killing all of the trees. Fink-Weber says farmers will try to avoid that if possible.

She says that fruit and nut farmers will work on keeping their trees alive. They will not push the trees to grow lots of big, healthy fruit. They will just let them grow a few small pieces. Still, some of the trees will have to be destroyed.

## Not Enough Snow To Melt

Dry weather is nothing new for California. Thomas Harter, who teaches at the University of California in Davis, says the state has gone through several dry years lately.

This dry period has gone on longer than usual. Because of this, California is using more groundwater than ever before. Groundwater is water that collects in underground pools. The pools form naturally. They take a long time to fill back up on their own.

In the spring and summer, farmers can usually count on melting snow to help water their crops. This year, there was only a tiny amount of snow.

That's why California decided to make new laws. The laws say how much water people can use. Farmers do not have to follow the rules because water is such an important part of their jobs.

## Have A Back-Up Plan

California's water problems are not going to get better anytime soon, Howitt says. He wants farmers to change how they use water. He wants farmers to plan for right now as well as the future.

Howitt knows farmers want to raise the kinds of crops that make them the most money. Many of those crops use lots of water. Howitt says it is fine for farmers to raise those crops. He just wants them to raise other crops, too.

Howitt encourages farmers to grow some crops that need less water. When dry weather hits, the farmers might lose their high-priced crops. The ones that do not need as much water might be OK. If they grow more of the dry weather crops, California's farmers can still make some money.
