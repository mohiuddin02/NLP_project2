CALAIS, France — The school's floor is sandy like the nearby dunes and its roof is held up by tree branches covered in flowered cloth. Inside, the students seated at small desks are listening with soldierly attention.

"'Light' is 'lumiere,'" said the teacher, giving a French lesson in English to migrants who have come from far corners of the globe to this vast camp in the French port city of Calais. "A lamp gives you light."

The single-room schoolhouse is located on one edge of the camp known as the "jungle," and the four to six classes held there every day are packed with students.

The Chemin des Dunes School opened its small door — found in a garbage can — on July 11. It was the brainchild of Zimako Jones, a Nigerian and one of an estimated 3,000 migrants who are living in dwellings of sticks and tarp. They are among waves of migrants fleeing violence and poverty and arriving on Europe's shores, crossing the internal borders of European countries and straining asylum systems across Europe. They are hoping to be allowed to stay and to be granted asylum, which is offered to people who would be endangered if they were sent back to their home countries.

## Common Struggle Unites Diverse Nationalities

"It helps build bridges between the different nationalities," Virginie Tiberghien, one of about 20 volunteer teachers, said of the school. "It really helps maintain a sense of humanity even if their daily lives are very difficult."

Most of the migrants in Calais hope to sneak away through the Channel Tunnel, which connects France and Britain under the English Channel. They believe Britain offers them better prospects for jobs and prosperity. With help from the school, which offers a haven from the cruelty of daily life, some are trying to learn enough French to end their travels and apply for asylum in France instead.

The school offers French, English, painting and tai chi, a Chinese form of exercise — or whatever else the teachers might propose.

But the graffiti on the outside canvas wall of the schoolhouse perhaps best reflects what is at stake: "Never give up hope," says one, while another says, "Hey everybody. We are in school." The word "ciel," French for "sky," and a picture of a bird decorate one wall.

## Learning Without Regard To Religion, Skin Color

Zimako dreamed up the idea for the school and built it with the help of five Sudanese, mostly out of an urge to improve the lives of people in the camp.

"I thought of doing this to help the people of the jungle, to unite them," he said. "It's a school without religion, without color. We are all together, people."

Zimako also wanted to help himself. He arrived in southern France as a migrant in 2013 and moved in April to Calais, where he is seeking asylum. Fluent in French and English, he was swamped with so many requests from needy migrants to help them translate that he was tired.

Today, a big chalkboard covers the front wall of the classroom, and pictures of objects from animals to airplanes are posted on walls with their French names. The classroom can squeeze in up to 35 students, who are mainly adults of different ages.

Tiberghien is a speech therapist teaching a French class, and Chris Jaumotte, a Belgian artist living in the area, teaches French and art.

## Dignity Accompanies Each Lesson

"We give them a bit of dignity. I think their dignity is being trampled here," Jaumotte said, referring to the tarp shelters where those in the camp take shelter. The artist gives the students an A for their concentrated effort.

"This is a jungle," said 26-year-old Ahmed Riaz of Pakistan, who hopes the school will help him find his way out of the camp. He ended up sitting in the schoolhouse literally by accident — after breaking a leg when he tried to catch a ride to Britain through the Channel Tunnel. Riaz, who is seeking political asylum in France, has attended French class at the school since it opened.

## Aid Groups Help Provide Classroom Staples

Humanitarian associations have helped contribute supplies such as notebooks and pens. Jaumotte bought the paints, brushes and small pots for each desk in the art class.

At one desk, a young African had painted a boat at sea, full of people, much like the boatloads of migrants who make the perilous passage across the Mediterranean, as many in the camp have done. He titled the picture in red "Dangerous Days."

Zimako is humble about his accomplishment, and he keeps thinking big: He wants to build a second, larger school.

"It's ideas at work," he said. "It's not me."
