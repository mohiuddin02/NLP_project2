In 2006, Michael Cox, a chicken farmer in northwest Arkansas, faced a choice that many farmers do: Expand the business or die out. His family had been raising chickens for three generations, first for the giant agriculture company Cargill and then for themselves. Even with 800,000 hens, Cox was not big enough to compete. "We were planning our funeral," he said.

Cox, who was then 25, started producing more expensive organic eggs from chickens that are not given drugs and eat food free of chemicals. They can go also wander outdoors. Then, in 2009, he heard about a Texas company called Vital Farms that wanted to produce pasture-raised eggs from hens that roam outside all day, eating what they want, and sell them across the country. "Here were guys doing something completely different," Cox remembers. "It was just crazy enough to work."

 He signed on to raise 5,000 chickens.

## Egg Label Confusion

Since then, Vital Farms has nearly doubled in size each year. What started as a farm outside Austin, Texas, with just a few thousand birds now works with about 60 farms and produces 1.5 million eggs every week. The eggs, which cost from $4.99 to $8.99 a dozen, are sold across the country in Whole Foods Markets and other natural-foods grocers. They are also sold in some regular grocery stores, including Safeway and Kroger.

Because Vital Farms sells nationally, people who live in cold climates such as the Northeast can buy pasture-raised eggs year-round. It is also proof that companies can treat animals well, pay farmers well, and still compete in the marketplace. "We set out to build a big business without compromise," said Jason Jones, Vital Farms' president. Matt O'Hayer, the founder and chief executive, added: "Our job is to show people that an egg is not just an egg."

But buyers remained confused about egg labels. According to a survey by Vital Farms, most consumers were unfamiliar with the term "pasture-raised," and the majority thought that "cage-free" and "free-range" meant the birds have been raised outdoors.

In fact, none of those labels has an official definition and they mean different things. Cage-free hens are housed in an average of 1 square foot of indoor space and never go outdoors, while free-range hens get an average of 2 square feet of outdoor space. A Vital Farms laying hen spends most of her day outdoors if the weather is nice and is allowed 108 square feet of outdoor space.

## Diet Makes A Difference

O'Hayer, who delivered eggs as a middle schooler, says it wasn't until he raised backyard chickens in the 1980s that he saw firsthand how a hen's diet affected the quality of her eggs. If the birds ate only corn, which most feed is made of, the yolks were pale and flavorless. If he threw some grass clippings over the fence, the yolks turned gold and had a deeper flavor.

If the company's standards seemed over-the-top when it launched in 2007, Vital Farms had an important supporter: Whole Foods. From the beginning, the chain's flagship store in Austin carried its eggs.

Today, Vital Farms works with nearly 40 farms in Missouri and Arkansas. It also has clusters of farmers in Georgia and is signing up to work with farmers in Texas.

Of course, raising hens the Vital Farms way makes for an expensive egg. Their pasture-raised organic eggs can cost as much as $8.99 a dozen compared with $4.69 for standard organic eggs. Even its regular eggs cost more than twice as much as eggs from caged hens.

## "They Are Just That Good"

Because its eggs are so pricey, Vital Farms works hard to let people know how good they are. Some of its cartons are designed by David Byrd, a fan of the company who is famous for creating psychedelic posters for rock 'n' roll legend Jimi Hendrix. Each dozen eggs includes a mini-newspaper, The Vital Times. Its motto is: The Most Egg-Cellent News on the Planet!

The effort is working. A spokesman for Whole Foods said pasture-raised options have boosted egg sales overall without destroying sales of organic eggs. Kroger plans to offer Vital Farms eggs in nearly all of its stores by the end of the year.

People are very loyal to the Vital Farms brand, much like they are to companies like Apple or Nike. Maurice Sinnett, who lives in Washington state, used to buy Vital Farms eggs at a nearby Safeway. When it closed, he went looking at Albertsons. But they didn't have them. So Sinnett started shopping at a local chain store. "It may seem crazy to change stores just for the eggs, but we think they are just that good," he said.

Sinnett likes the richer yolk. But mostly, he is motivated by the company's respect for animals. "There's a humane way to do things and the 'I-don't-give-a-damn-I'm-at-the-top-of-the-food-chain way," he said, adding: "A woman recently asked me how could I pay $6 a dozen for eggs. My answer was, 'How much do you pay for a cup of coffee at Starbucks?'"
