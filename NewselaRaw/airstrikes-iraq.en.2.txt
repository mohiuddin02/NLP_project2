WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama on Thursday approved U.S. military airstrikes against Islamic fighters in northern Iraq. The strikes are intended to save Iraqi religious minorities surrounded by the fighters. The president also wants to help protect Americans in the area.

Obama said American military planes already had dropped food and water to tens of thousands of Iraqi religious minorities stranded on a mountain. The people risk death if they descend.

"Today America is coming to help," the president declared.

Obama's announcement threatened to bring the U.S. military back into the country's long religious war.

The United States withdrew its troops from Iraq in 2011. It has not gotten so involved in Iraq since then. Obama, who made his remarks in a steady and somber tone, has counted on being remembered as the president who ended what he has called the "dumb war" in Iraq.

## People Are At Great Risk

The supplies were delivered to the tens of thousands of Yazidi people trapped on a mountain. The people risk dying of thirst and starvation.

Yazidis follow an ancient religion with ties to a faith that originated in what is now Iran. The Islamic State group ordered the Yazidis to join Islam, pay a religious fine, flee their homes or face death. The Yazidis chose to flee.

Obama said the Iraqi government requested the food and water. The Islamic State fighters are waging a war against the governments of Iraq and Syria. They want to take control of both countries and create a religious government.

Obama acknowledged that renewed U.S. military action in Iraq would worry Americans. He vowed not to put American combat troops back on the ground in Iraq and said there was no U.S. military solution to the crisis.

"As commander in chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq," Obama said.

Even so, he explained that airstrikes might be needed if the Islamic fighters attack Irbil. The city is in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. U.S. troops and the diplomats representing the U.S. government are based there. The troops were sent to Iraq earlier this year after Islamic fighters swiftly moved across the border with Syria and into Iraq.

## "We Will Take Action"

"When the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action," Obama said. "That's my responsibility as commander in chief."

He said he had also cleared the way for attacks if necessary to help the Iraqi military protect people.

U.S. military leaders said planes already had dropped food and water in the area. The planes delivered a total of 72 bundles of food and water. They were escorted by two F/A-18 fighters from an air base in the region.

The planes delivered 5,300 gallons of fresh drinking water and 8,000 prepackaged meals. They were over the drop area for less than 15 minutes at a low altitude.

The president described the mission as part of the American duty to use its unique strengths to help prevent widespread killings.

Officials said the United States was prepared to make more airdrops if necessary. They did not say how quickly those missions could occur.

##  The Constitution's Guidelines

White House officials said the Iraqi government has asked the United States to take military action. For that reason, they do not believe Washington is breaking international law by launching the attacks. They also said the U.S. Constitution gives Obama the power to act on his own to protect American citizens.

Obama cleared the way for strikes in Syria last summer after the government attacked its own people with chemical weapons. Those strikes were never carried out. The president has also faced persistent calls to take military action in Syria. More than 170,000 people have been killed in that country.

Some Republicans said that Obama's cautious approach helped the Islamic State group grow in Syria. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina praised Obama's proposed actions. They also said much more will be necessary.

The United States should give military and other help to Kurds, Iraqis and Syrians who are fighting the Islamic state, the senators said.

## Many Lawmakers Called For Action

Obama sent about 800 U.S. forces to Iraq earlier this year. Those troops are largely split between Baghdad and Irbil. More than half are protecting the embassy and U.S. government workers.

Officials said the United States was conducting flights over Irbil with both manned and unmanned aircraft. They were trying to gather information and monitor the worsening conditions.

It's all but certain that Obama would launch the strikes without formal congressional approval. Lawmakers left Washington last week for a five-week recess, and there was no sign that Congress was being called back.

However, officials said the White House was in contact with some lawmakers. They included the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, and Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate.

Some Republicans have specifically called for the president to take action and have said he does not need the approval of lawmakers.
