When it comes to the princesses in Disney's film "Frozen," retailers are saying don't let them go.

More than a year after the hit film came out, princesses Elsa and Anna still rule.

The two princesses are featured in products from dolls and silvery dress-up wigs to iPhone cases and adult-sized underwear. Even Sven the reindeer and Olaf the snowman appear on merchandise, including T-shirts and dental floss.

## "Frozen" Mania Has Meant Big Bucks

The film has been a huge success for Walt Disney Company. "Frozen" mania helped push Disney's overall total sales up 9 percent, to $13.4 billion during the last three months of 2014. Its profit, which is sales minus expenses, rose 19 percent to $2.2 billion.

"A full year after its release, we're seeing the true impact of 'Frozen' across our entire company," Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger said. The company said that "Frozen" merchandise brings in more than $1 billion a year in sales. In November alone, Disney said it sold 3 million role-play dresses.

The success of "Frozen" helped give the overall toy industry a $531 million boost in 2014, the research company NPD Group said. "Frozen" was the biggest and fastest- growing toy brand of the year.

"Frozen" has become the best-selling animated film of all time, and its popularity shows little sign of melting away.

"When you have a jackpot like 'Frozen,' it can go on forever," said Jason Moser, an analyst at the Motley Fool, a company offering financial advice and services. "This really goes back to what Disney does so well — they can create a movie like 'Frozen' and take it in a number of different directions and continue to make money."

## More "Frozen" Stuff All The Time

Disney, the teller of classic fairy tales, is enjoying a boost from selling merchandise and licensing to toymakers. In the last three months of last year, revenue from products jumped 22 percent to $1.4 billion.

"Frozen" was a huge hit at Toys R Us. The toy store expanded its selection from a few dozen products in the beginning of 2014 to more than 300 during the holidays, said Richard Barry, the chief merchandising officer.

Disney has also been skillful at finding ways to keep interest in "Frozen" high. Kids can ride "Frozen" attractions at Disneyland and take a "Frozen"-themed cruise. A new film called "Frozen Fever" is coming out in March, he said.

"Frozen's" success "caught everyone by surprise," said Mike Botterman, vice president of general merchandise for the 99 Cents Only chain.

"Frozen" is especially attractive because girl-friendly entertainment products tend to outsell boy's properties by 10 percent, he said. "With girls there are a lot more fashion items."

## Girls Like This And That

To create more popular merchandise, Disney starts bouncing ideas around in the very early stages of creating a film.

Michael Giaimo is the art director for "Frozen" and production designer for "Frozen Fever." He said that artists talk with stores and Disney's toymakers while they are designing the characters.

"Sometimes there is an initial conversation even before they see any of your designs," he said. "They'll say 'We know girls like this and girls like that.'"

But ultimately, the top priority was creating artwork that contributed to the story, Giaimo said. For instance, they avoided the color pink in the movie, except for a deep magenta on Anna's cape, he said.

"I wanted to stay away from a Barbie world," he said. "The sisters were coming off so strong and distinctive and provocative — I didn't want them to be associated with a palette that is so out there in the world in every way."

## "You Can Get Sensory Overload"

Some of the creative decisions added to the story but increased the cost of manufacturing products, Giaimo said. Anna's dress, for example, features long-stemmed flowers on the bottom third of the skirt. This requires that the cloth be cut a certain way, which wastes fabric, making Anna dolls and costumes more expensive.

The popularity of "Frozen" may eventually prove to be its downfall, some observers said.

To get shoppers to keep buying products, Disney has to keep coming out with new characters and films, said Gerrick Johnson. He is an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, a financial services company. It is one reason that "Star Wars" merchandise has remained so popular nearly 40 years after the original movie came out. But customers constantly faced with fresh movies and merchandise may get tired.

"By 2016, we will be darn tired of 'Frozen,'" he said. "You can get sensory overload if you have too much stuff coming at you.'"

That's a danger that Disney is confident it can avoid.

"It is something we do watch and are careful about," said Josh Silverman, an executive vice president at Disney Consumer Products.

## Feel-Good Movie, Toys

One of Disney's priorities is to create merchandise that appeals on a deeper level to customers, he said.

"When you begin to play with it or eat it or dress it up, we want to make sure that emotional connection" is there as well, Silverman said. Disney wants kids to have the same feeling playing with a doll they get while watching the movie.

"It's one of the amazing things Walt Disney Company does better than anybody else," he said.
