Timothy Cade only owned his hoverboard for three days. Then, it exploded under him.

"Hoverboard is on fire," he says in a video taken after he jumped off of it. "What is going on dude?"

## A Dangerous Toy

The board does not really "hover," or fly above the ground. It is more like a skateboard. It flamed and popped.

His mother ran out with a box of baking soda. She tried to use it to put out the fire. It did not work. The toy hissed and boomed. Then, the battery went shooting out of it. The battery makes the board work. It makes it turn on.

Cade's board is not the only one to catch fire. There have been about 10 others. 

## Safety Rules Needed?

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is part of the U.S. government. It makes rules about the selling and making of many different goods. It said this week that it will be looking into hoverboards. It will try to find out why there have been problems with the boards.

The problem, it seems, is the batteries.

Hoverboards use lithium-ion batteries. Many companies make the boards. Most are in other countries. Not all of them follow the safety rules. This can lead to problems with the hoverboards. 

## Batteries Can Blow Up

Lithium ion batteries are rechargeable. They do not weigh much. They can be used over and over again. This makes them a good fit for electronics like cellphones.

Still, these batteries can catch fire, explained Wired. Wired is a magazine that covers technology. 

The lithium ion battery can blow up. It does not just happen in hoverboards. IPods have caught on fire, too. They use the same kind of battery.

## No One Rides On iPods

Still, batteries in hoverboards face problems that an iPod does not. For one thing, no one is standing on and riding iPods.

For another, there are not many rules about making hoverboards. This bothers Elliot Kaye. He is in charge of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. 

It is easy for manufacturers to get away with making poor goods, he said.
