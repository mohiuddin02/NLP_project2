SIBUT, Central African Republic — At 14, Jordy isn't much taller than his gun.

"It was a way to protect myself, and it was a way to survive," said Jordy, a former child soldier.

"I did a lot of bad things," he said, eyes downcast. "I took people's things by force."

The conflict tearing the Central African Republic apart has turned neighbor against neighbor. For many children, it has ended their childhood.

Children have seen their parents killed and watched as boys and girls just like them were hurt. They have been forced to make decisions far beyond their years. Some decided to join the fighters who ruined their lives.

## Children Left Behind

Children have been victims in virtually every conflict in this country, one of the poorest in the world. More than a year ago, a rebel group known as the Seleka seized power from the government. As many as 3,500 children were part of it. Other armed groups started fighting back and the number of child soldiers grew to 6,000.

Some children, like Jordy, were handed guns, while other children were made slaves.

Today, children barely in their teens still are with the fighters. Even by day, armed men threaten travelers on the road. Rifles and machetes are slung over their shoulders, and the fighters have protective charms draped around their necks.

The Seleka left behind nearly 400 children when they were pushed from power in January. Recently, the humanitarian organization UNICEF negotiated the release of more than 1,000 other children.

On a recent day, dozens of the children gathered on a shaded porch in Sibut. UNICEF made them available for interviews.

Several of them smiled shyly at the visitors. But a few were angry, shouting that they needed help.

## When The Rebels Came

Charly recalled the day when the rebels arrived.

He was 15, and he was selling soap, sugar and other goods from a market stall in Sibut. His father was dead, and his mother couldn't support him.

The fighters streamed in on motorcycles and in pickup trucks. They fired their guns and set homes and businesses on fire.

"When they saw I was brave, and I could point out houses to rob, they accepted me," Charly said. He was given a Kalashnikov rifle and sent on patrols around his hometown, his fear replaced by arrogance.

"Everyone saw me carrying an AK," he said.

The thought of the return to his old life makes him sit rigid with anger, his eyes flashing.

"See the shoes I'm wearing?" the teenager snapped, pointing at his dusty blue flip-flops full of holes.

With the rebels, he had power, he said. "I had boots, a uniform and a gun in my hand.

Jordy, Charly and other youths marched with the rebels to the capital. Some were forced to go, but others were drawn by the idea of stealing.

"When I saw them starting to kill people, that's when I left," Charly said.

## Forced To Be A "Wife"

Mireille was 14 when a rebel colonel spotted her last year and announced he wanted to marry her.

"I said, 'No, I'm still young,'" recalled the slender girl with intricately braided hair. She sat hunched on a bench, wringing her hands in her lap.

That night, the rebel colonel showed up at her home. He took her to a Seleka base, forced her to marry him and gave her a new name, Kadija.

"I wanted to escape, but I couldn't because everyone had weapons," she said.

After several months, the colonel lost interest in Mireille.

Reuniting the 78 girls freed by the Seleka with their families has been especially difficult.

Many children don't even know where their relatives are — hundreds of thousands have fled their homes in the fighting. Humanitarian workers who are caring for some of the former fighters can spend months trying to locate their families.

When families can be traced, they may be slow to take their sons back. Children who have been with the rebels have a hard time obeying their parents.

Many children still march with the fighters, but those who have left struggle to find a way forward.

Mireille said she'd like to go back to school, and Jordy said he would like to try farming. Charly, though, has already been approached by militias eager to take advantage of his knowledge of the Seleka.

"With a gun," he said, "you always have money."
