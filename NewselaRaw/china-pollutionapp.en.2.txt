BEIJING â€” On a recent day, Ma Jun, one of China's best-known environmentalists, showed off his latest tool in the fight against the nation's air pollution: a computer app.

The app shows a map of northeastern China covered with large orange circles. Each circle represents one of the country's major polluters. The app reports the amount of pollution each one emits as it happens.

The emissions information comes from monitoring equipment the government has installed at about 10,000 factories around the country. The app makes this information available to millions of Chinese on their own computers, tablets and cellphones.

## Stifling Clouds Of Smog

It is part of an ambitious effort by environmentalists to get people to pressure the government to stop the polluters.

Pollution in China is among the worst in the world. It blankets China's cities in stifling clouds and makes China's factories one of the leading causes of global warming, caused by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

China has many laws against pollution, said Ma. He is with the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, which created the app. But he said "enforcement is weak." For companies, the cost of polluting is not high enough for them to stop.

Many of the worst polluters are companies owned by China or which have a close connection to Chinese officials.

Especially in smaller towns and cities, officials are not motivated to enforce pollution laws. China is not a democracy and there are no elections or independent courts, where people could sue companies that pollute. Without those, forcing the government to change is difficult. Making information about pollution public, through the app, is one of the few options environmentalists have to get officials to crack down on polluters, Ma said.

## Thousands Of Downloads

Over the past several months, the app has been downloaded about 10,000 times.

Whether the app will be enough to pressure officials to stop polluters is not yet known. However, concern about pollution in China is growing.

As recently as five years ago, the environment ranked relatively low among people's concerns, according to surveys. Now, pollution routinely is among the top issues the Chinese worry about, said pollster Victor Yuan.

A study published last year by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences showed that air pollution shortened the lives of 500 million residents of northern China by 5 1/2 years.

Another study estimated that in 2012, burning coal for heat and electricity led to 670,000 premature deaths in China. The early deaths were caused by diseases such as heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.

Places as far away as California are affected, as China's pollution can blow across the Pacific Ocean. On some days, pollution from Chinese factories can make up about one-quarter of tiny polluting particles in California's air.

## Facing The Pollution Problem

Right now, coal provides about 70 percent of China's energy. It is responsible for at least half of its pollution, said Alvin Lin. He is with the Beijing office of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

After years of trying to hide information about pollution, the government is now admitting how bad it is. Until 2012, for example, no cities in China were allowed to publicly reveal the level of PM2.5, the tiny particles that cause the most damage to human lungs, Ma said. Now, 190 cities do.

Creating public pressure for clean air is where Ma's pollution app comes in.

If the public knows where the pollution is coming from, "it becomes risky for governors and mayors to interfere," Ma said. So far, about 200 major polluters have contacted his group to discuss their cleanup plans.

## Expensive Cleanup Promised

China has promised to reduce pollution within 15 years. A cleanup on the scale of what China needs, however, will be hugely expensive. First of all, China must reduce its heavy use of coal for electricity. To do that, China plans to build nearly 60 new nuclear power stations. The country also plans to import more natural gas and expand its use of solar and wind power.

Chinese government officials say the country also will have to close down its oldest and dirtiest factories, including steel mills and cement factories.

Even in the best case, cleaning China's air to the level of international health standards would take decades. But, Ma said, just a small number of factories create much of China's pollution. Targeting them can bring about significant improvements much sooner.

Ma mentioned the blue skies at an international conference in Beijing as proof of what can be achieved. The Chinese government took exceptional steps to clear the air. It shut down polluting factories and gave government workers days off to reduce traffic. The results showed "you don't need 30 years" to clear the air, Ma said, just the motivation to tackle the job.

So many people have become unhappy over pollution that the government cannot ignore them, Ma said. The problem "finally has created some real political will" for change.
