MIAMI — Miami Dolphins wide receiver Brian Hartline is good at football. He is also good at business.

Hartline studies reports about how much money companies make. He looks at other information for ways to make money. Hartline gives this information as much attention as he gives his passing routes during games.

Hartline does all this studying for a reason. He wants to make smart decisions on how to invest, or where to put his money to try to make more money.

"I only invest if I really understand," Hartline said.

## Doesn't Waste His Money

Hartline is a careful investor. He is also growing as a businessman. He and a grade school buddy bought two convenience stores in Ohio, where he is from. Hartline has been known to pitch in there during the offseason. He waits on customers.

Many pro athletes waste their multimillion-dollar salaries. The National Football League and teams such as the Dolphins are teaching players about handling their money.

In 2009, Sports Illustrated reported that more than three-fourths of NFL players had money troubles within two years of retiring. After the report came out, the league got serious about the subject.

Patrick Kerney, a retired player, was named last year as the NFL's vice president for player benefits. He thinks the Sports Illustrated numbers are too high. Still, he sees the importance of training players to manage their money better.

The NFL will hold its first program to teach players and their wives how to handle their money in March, Kerney said. They will learn if they have enough money to keep living the way they are used to in the future. Some players are running out of money before they expect, Kerney said.

Hartline is not one of them.

## An Early Lesson

The Dolphins receiver says he has long kept track of  his expenses. He also spends less money than he makes. Hartline lived that way long before he received his latest five-year contract. Now he will make $6.15 million a year.

Hartline does admit to treating himself to a fancy sports car. "I like my toys," he said. But he's also been learning about investments so his money will last for years after he has left the football field.

"I'm a numbers guy," Hartline said. "I try to read, to ask questions, to learn as much as possible."

As a child, Hartline got a week's worth of lunch money from his parents. He learned to make it last. He got the businessman's bug from his dad, who owned a business.

## Going To Classes

Kaleb Thornhill said Hartline has been a leader in taking the Dolphins' money management classes. Thornhill teaches the classes.

Thornhill recommends to first-year players that they save at least half of the money they make. The money can grow a lot over time with investments that do not have a lot of risk.

But what's also important, both Thornhill and Hartline say, is that players know what they are investing in and not let anyone sign papers for them. Several former or current NFL players have ended up in court. They complained about missing money or bad investments.

Hartline said he handles all of his own business decisions. He also spreads out his investments. He does not put all his money in one place.

## Learning By Experience

Hartline's investments include what he hopes will be 10 or so convenience stores. So far, he and buddy Ramy Malka own two convenience stores just outside Columbus, home of Hartline's college, Ohio State.

The stores are in large enclosed buildings where customers drive through and order snacks and drinks without leaving their cars.

Early on, Hartline said, "we did it ourselves" — from waiting on customers to putting products on shelves to unloading trucks. They did not have any workers to pay, which turned out to be a blessing. "I learned the business by experience," he said.

In Cooper City, Florida, Hartline is a hero and role model to Aidan Pratt, 14, for consistently saving. Last football season, Aidan won $1,000 from BankUnited for his essay on the importance of saving. Hartline promotes saving as part of kids' learning about managing money. Aidan got to meet him.

Aidan said he followed his hero's example. "It's the only money I have ever won — and I put it in a savings account," he said.
