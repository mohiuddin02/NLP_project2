GUATEMALA CITY â€” For centuries, the Mayan people of Guatemala have told stories through their clothing.

These colorful clothes have caused them to be treated unfairly. They mark them as poor and part of the native people.

Now, the Mayan cloth can be found in Guatemala's nicest stores. Young designers use it for dresses and purses. They even turn the cloth into handmade shoes. They are sold as far away as Dubai, a rich city in the Middle East.

The cloth is called huipil. It is part of a new interest in the country's Mayan roots.

## Colorful Geometric Patterns ...

The Mayan kingdom ruled over all of Guatemala more than 1,000 years ago. Today, musicians and designers are adopting Mayan languages and themes. In countries like Bolivia and Mexico there is also great interest in traditional clothing and art.

In all three countries, this interest is overcoming the unfair treatment, or discrimination, of the native peoples. Modern-day Mayans are proud that the fashion world uses their traditional costume.

"I am proud of my dress," said Adela Qel. She is a Mayan woman who wears the huipil.

The huipiles come in dazzling colors. The colors are woven in bands and geometric patterns. They are embroidered with animals, plants and birds. Mayan women wear them as long shirts or dresses.

Guatemala's high fashion centers have a new use for them. They make the cloth into shoes, ties and purses. Stores around the world sell handbags based on Mayan designs.

## ... On Dresses, Purses And Shoes

The colorful designs make them more popular with people who are not Mayan, said Eduardo Figueroa. He is a clothing designer in Guatemala. Guatemalans living in other countries particularly like the designs. This may be because they miss their home country.

Figueroa is famous for a dress he created for the Miss World beauty contest. It is bright orange with flowers on the shoulders. The dress was rated as one of the contest's best.

"I am inspired by color," Figueroa said. "Guatemalan textiles are rich in color."

Some people think that the Mayan textiles are just for pillows and tablecloths, he said. Figueroa tells them they can be used in many ways.

Karim Corzo is a shoe designer in Guatemala. He said the huge interest helps the women who weave the cloth earn more money.

Tzutu Baktun Kan is a rap musician in Guatamala. He performs in a Mayan language. He says Guatemala is going back to its artistic roots. Kan said he doesn't want the Mayan languages to be forgotten. This, he says, helps prevent discrimination.

But not everyone likes the old ways.

Eduardo Ortiz, a clothing designer, will not use traditional Guatemalan designs. They aren't his style. Also, some Guatemalans don't like them. They think they look too old-fashioned.

## But They Don't Come Cheap

Spain ruled Guatemala for 300 years. The Spanish forced Guatemalans to wear their traditional dress. Every area had its own patterns, because the Spanish wanted to easily recognize the people who lived in each area.

Over the years, embroidery on the clothing became a way for the Guatemalans to express their stories and ideas, said Alvaro Pop. He is a United Nations expert on native peoples. The clothes included symbols like the Mayan calendar and magicians who could turn themselves into animals.

Now, the weavings look more up to date and colorful so people who are not Mayan will like them, Corzo said.

The new fashions don't come cheap. A pair of shoes shoes can cost $50 to $150. A dress can cost between $300 and $800.

Pop said some of that money should go back to the Mayan women who weave the cloth. These women are among the country's poorest and most ignored. Just about all that is left of the great Mayan kingdom is the traditional arts and crafts, he said.

Ethnic fashion is trendy around the world, Pop said. But designers should pay the weavers for the patterns. Each piece is one-of-a-kind, he said. "They don't make it twice and (their ideas) should be paid for, too."
