MOSCOW, Russia â€” Edward Snowden is stuck in Russia. He cannot come home.

Snowden used to work for the American government. Two years ago, he made the government very angry. He said the government was collecting millions of telephone calls of regular people.

The government wanted to listen to the calls. It was using the call information to track enemies of the United States. Still, Americans felt the government was spying on them for no reason.

Snowden also stole secret government information.

## "Edward Loves America"

Snowden said that people should know what the government was doing. He has lost a lot because of what he did. He cannot leave Russia, a country in Europe. The American government also wants to put him on trial for spying. It wants to send him to prison for 30 years.

Snowden would like to return to America, but he does not want to go to prison.

Snowden thinks this may be possible. Many people disagree though. He is not very popular in the United States.

A lot of younger Americans like what he did. But many others do not like him.

Snowden's lawyer in Russia is Anatoly Kucherena. "Edward loves America," Kucherena said. Even Kucherena does not think he will go home anytime soon.

The Russian lawyer said that Snowden could have done worse things. Snowden did not give the secret information to Russia.

## "We Can't Send Him Back"

Some experts say Snowden did a terrible thing. They say he betrayed his country. He deserves to go to trial, they say.

Kori Schake used to work for the government. She said Snowden may not have wanted to be a spy. But when he stole the information, he became one, she said.

Sergei Markov works for the Russian government. He said Snowden needed Russia's protection.

"We can't send him back just because America demands it," Markov said.

Ronald Goldfarb is a lawyer who put together a book called "After Snowden."

Goldfarb said the government must find out what information Snowden stole. It also needs to determine if the information could hurt America.

Ben Wizner is one of Snowden's lawyers in the United States. He agrees that Snowden probably will not return home soon.

"Right now he has two choices. Stay indefinitely there or report to a U.S. prison," Wizner said.
