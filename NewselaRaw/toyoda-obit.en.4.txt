Eiji Toyoda was a Japanese businessman who worked for his family's car business. He visited a Ford factory back in 1950 to learn how Americans made cars. The visit changed the way his company produced automobiles. And that ended up changing the way companies everywhere make cars.

Toyoda died Tuesday at the age of 100. He greatly improved the way his company made automobiles. And he helped make Toyotas popular in the Unites States.

He "understood what it would take to make Toyota a successful company," said car expert David Cole.

Kiichiro Toyoda started the car business. Eiji was his cousin. The family used the Toyota name for the business because they believed it sounded better than Toyoda.

## From Textiles To Cars

Eiji Toyoda was born on Sept. 12, 1913, in Nagoya City. In 1936 he graduated from the University of Tokyo with a degree in engineering. That same year, he started working at Toyoda Automatic Loom Works. This was a textile mill started by his father and uncle. About a year later, he moved to the company's new car-making division.

Toyoda quickly came to love making automobiles. He grew up at the family textile mill, so he was very fond of machines.

"From my childhood, machines and business were always there right in front of me," he said in 1999. "I probably developed an understanding of both."

He rose quickly, becoming a company leader by 1945. Five years later, Toyoda set off to visit the Ford factory in Dearborn, Mich. His experience there gave him the ideas that changed the way Toyota did things.

"We were producing 40 cars a day," he said. "Ford was making 8,000 units, a 200-times difference. The gap was enormous."

## Saving Money And Time

Toyoda changed Toyota's manufacturing approach. The company began making only a small number of cars at a time. They ordered only the parts they needed for those cars.

That way they no longer had to store many supplies at the factory. And that saved money and time. Today, carmakers all over the world do things the same way.

Toyoda showed how car companies can be less wasteful, said Leslie Kendall of the Petersen Automotive Museum.

As for Toyota, it is now the world's biggest car builder.

Eiji Toyoda became vice president of Toyota in 1960 and president in 1967. Among other triumphs, he helped to come up with the Corolla. This became one of the world's best-selling cars.

## Cracking The U.S. Market

In 1957 Toyota began selling cars in the United States. At first, the company tried to sell a slow, small car called the Toyopet Crown. But it was poorly made. That first year Toyota only sold 288 cars.

Then in 1965 Toyota launched the Corona. This was a much better car than the Toyopet Crown. It became the company's first big seller in the U.S.

The popular Corolla followed in the late 1960s. It was both cheap and well-made. And it drove farther on a gallon of gas than other automobiles.

By 1972, Toyota passed Volkswagen to become the top foreign brand in America. So far in 2013, Toyota has sold more than 1.5 million cars here. It now controls more than 14 percent of the U.S. market.

Toyoda retired in 1994. He remained involved with the company. He is survived by three sons, Kanshiro, Tetsuro and Shuhei. All three work for companies connected to Toyota.
