NEW YORK â€” In 1964, U.S lawmakers passed the Civil Rights Act. The law stated that people must be treated fairly.

On Thursday, leaders of the black community said a new civil rights movement is badly needed. They say black people are treated unfairly by police. They hope a civil rights movement will lead to more justice.

In the last two weeks, grand juries decided not to charge two white policemen who were involved in the deaths of two black men. A grand jury is made up of a group of people. They decide if a person should be charged with a crime.

After the decisions, angry crowds gathered around the country. The protesters say the men would not have been killed if they had been white. They also believe each officer should have been charged with a crime.

"Black lives matter!" the protesters shouted.

## Pain And Rage In Their Voices

Black leaders have listened to the rage and the pain of their words. They hope the protesters will begin a new civil rights movement. They also demand that the government investigate if police uses too much force.

"They're asking for something simple. They want to be treated the same," New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday about the protesters. The day before, a grand jury decided not to charge policeman Daniel Pantaleo with a crime. Eric Garner, who was black, died while the white police officer, Pantaleo, was trying to arrest him.

Mickey Thomas is a 21-year-old student protesting in New York. "There was no justice," Thomas said. "I definitely think we've had enough. I feel like there is a new civil rights movement."

## Marches Worked Once Before

Last week, violence broke out in Ferguson, Missouri. A grand jury there decided not to charge Darren Wilson with a crime. On Aug. 9, Wilson, a white policeman, shot Michael Brown, who was black.

On Thursday, black leaders urged protesters to come to Washington, D.C., on Dec. 13. They hope that if enough people come, the government must listen to them.

Al Sharpton is one of the leaders. He is the head of the National Action Network.

"Marches and boycotts led to the '64 Civil Rights Act," Sharpton said.

Sharpton said that the Civil Rights Act led to change 50 years ago. The United States became a more fair country. Today, though, change is still needed, he said.

## Even The President Is Concerned

Those pushing for change have the attention of top leaders. President Barack Obama is the first black American president. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Junior, who leads the Justice Department, is black. De Blasio's wife is also black.

Holder has discovered that some police departments do treat black people unfairly. He ordered them to change their ways. The black leaders say this is not enough. They want Holder to look into all cases where police hurt or kill someone.

Connie Rice is a civil rights lawyer in Los Angeles. She said the government will listen to the protesters. They will force police to be more fair.

Darnell Hunt is with University of California, Los Angeles. He said people have become more aware of the problem.

Lieutenant Colonel John Grimpel is with the New York Police Department. Although the grand jury did not charge Pantaleo, the NYPD is still investigating. It is looking into Pantaleo's actions on the day Garner died. If the department decides Garner's death was the officer's fault, he could be punished. He might be fired, Grimpel said.
