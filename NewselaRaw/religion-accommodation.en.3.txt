SEATTLE â€” Do businesses have to let their workers practice their religion at work? Should they give workers days off for religious holidays, or time to pray during work hours?

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court in Washington state will hear a case that could change how businesses have to deal with workers and religion.

The lawsuit was brought by four workers of Gate Gourmet. The company prepares food for airline passengers. For safety reasons, it doesn't let workers bring their own meals to work.

The four men say the meals the company had been serving to the workers had pork in them. Some of the workers thought it was chicken or beef. Eating pork and certain other foods isn't allowed by their religions or other beliefs. The four men are a vegetarian, an Orthodox Christian, a Muslim and a Hindu.

## Not Spelled Out In State Law

Asegedew Gefe is one of the workers. He is an Orthodox Christian, which is a form of Christianity practiced in Ethiopia and Egypt. He has been working at Gate's warehouse at Seattle's airport since 2010.

"We're not asking for this or that," he said. "If it's broccoli, tell us it's broccoli. If it's pork, tell us pork."

But does the company have to?

Under state law, a company cannot fire someone or not hire someone because of the person's religion. But the law is less clear about whether businesses must allow people to practice their religion at work. This comes at a time when workers are increasingly expressing their religions in the workplace.

Some say the protection is not spelled out in state law. But it is understood as being part of the law, they say.

A year ago, Washington judge Mary Yu threw out the Gate workers' lawsuit. She said state law does not force businesses to allow for religious practices.

Yu wrote that her order was based on an earlier court case. In that one, a very Christian woman sued a school district. She claimed her boss told her to give wrong information to another worker. That went against her religion.

The appeals court tossed out that case. That court is midway between a trial court and the Supreme Court. It said that the Supreme Court had never truly recognized the right to observe religious practices at work under state law.

## High Court Could Guide Lower Courts

But now the Supreme Court is taking up the case. A ruling in the case would guide lower courts in deciding such lawsuits in the future.

It could set the rules for what businesses must do. It might allow workers to sue in state court instead of national court. They might be able to sue companies with as few as eight workers. Only businesses with 25 people or more can be sued in national court.

Aaron Rocke is the lawyer for the Gate workers. He said that the case is "an important matter of civil rights."  It would either show that Washington state respects religion in the workplace, or that it doesn't, he said.

While low in numbers, problems regarding religion at work have been on the rise since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

A survey this year by a group in New York focused on the most common problems involving religion at work. One was being made to work on a religious holiday. Another was going to company events where the food served was not allowed by a person's religion.

## Most Lawyers Avoid State Court

A state law that said people couldn't be fired based on race or religion was passed in 1949. That was 15 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 created those rights at the national level.

But the national law has written rules, to provide for "reasonable" religious arrangements in the workplace. The Washington state one does not. It only has simple guidelines.

So most lawyers in the state file cases involving religion problems at work in national courts. They avoid state court.

Hardeep Rekhi, a Seattle lawyer, recently won a lawsuit he filed for a Muslim man. The worker was fired from his job after he refused to get rid of his beard. His religion promotes the wearing of beards.

Rekhi filed the case in national court rather than state court. The state law wasn't clear enough, he said.
