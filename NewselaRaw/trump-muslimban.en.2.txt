MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — On Tuesday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stood by his idea to block all Muslims from entering the United States. His idea has been widely criticized as un-American by rival Republican candidates, party leaders and others.

"I don't care about them," Trump told the TV news network CNN when asked about the strong disapproval by Republican party leaders. "I'm doing what's right."

Trump defended his plan for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States." He compared it with President Franklin Roosevelt's actions during World War II. In 1942, Roosevelt gave an order that imprisoned Japanese-Americans in special centers called internment camps. He did so under the name of protecting the nation. Now the cruel treatment of Japanese citizens during World War II is remembered as a terrible time in American history.

"This is a president who was highly respected by all," Trump said Tuesday. "If you look at what he was doing, it was far worse."

The idea announced by Trump on Monday evening drew swift disapproval. British Prime Minister David Cameron slammed it as "divisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong." Muslims in the United States and around the world denounced the idea as unconstitutional or insulting.

## Candidate Compared To Hitler

The front page of the Philadelphia Daily News pictured Trump holding his right hand out as if in a Nazi salute. The headline said "The New Furor." Hitler was called the Fuehrer, which sounds like furor. In morning TV interviews Tuesday on ABC and CNN, Trump was asked about being compared with Hitler.

The candidate did not back down. He said that banning all Muslims is justified after recent attacks by Muslim terrorists. Terrorist attacks killed 130 people and injured hundreds more in Paris, France, and killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California.

"We are now at war," Trump said, adding: "We have a president who doesn't want to say that."

Trump's proposed ban would apply to Muslim immigrants and visitors alike. It is a sweeping plan that affects all followers of a religion practiced by more than a billion people worldwide.

Trump announced his plan to cheers and applause at a Monday evening rally in South Carolina.

## Defending His Plan As Protection For U.S.

Trump says we must first "determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses." Until then, "our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that ... have no sense of reason or respect for human life." 

At the rally he referred to the 9/11 attacks. He warned that without sudden action, "it's going to get worse and worse, you're going to have more World Trade Centers." On Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks killed some 3,000 people at the World Trade Center in New York, at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania. 

Rod Weader, a 68-year-old from North Charleston, attended the rally. Weader said he agreed with Trump's plan "150 percent."

Since the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, some Republican presidential candidates have proposed restrictions on Syrian refugees because many are Muslim. Several candidates suggest giving preferences to Christians seeking protection in the United States. 

## Rivals Blast Candidate's Proposal

However, Trump's proposed ban goes much further. His Republican rivals were quick to reject his ideas. Republican candidate Jeb Bush said, "His 'policy' proposals are not serious."

John Kasich, another Republican candidate, slammed Trump's "outrageous divisiveness." Ted Cruz, a more cautious candidate, said, "Well, that is not my policy."

Trump's plan also drew criticism from the heads of the Republican Party in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Those states are the first to vote in next year's presidential primaries. The primaries will determine the Republican candidate for president.

"It is un-Republican. It is unconstitutional. And it is un-American," said Jennifer Horn, chairwoman of the Republican Party of New Hampshire.

Corey Lewandowski, manager of Trump's campaign, said Trump's proposed ban would apply to "everybody." It includes Muslims seeking to move to the United States and tourists.

In an interview on Fox News, Trump said Muslim members of the U.S. armed forces would "come home." His plan would "not apply to people living in the country."

## Expert Says Restriction Based On Religion Is Unconstitutional

In the late 1800s, Congress passed legislation aimed at halting Chinese immigrants from moving to the United States. However, Leti Volpp, an expert on immigration law, said "there is no precedent for a religious litmus test for admitting immigrants into the United States." Volpp pointed out that the United States has never prevented immigrants from a particular religion.

"Excluding almost a quarter of the world's population from setting foot in the United States based solely upon their religious identity would never pass constitutional muster," Volpp said.

Trump's campaign is known for inflammatory statements, including his harsh words about Mexican immigrants. He has taken a hard line against Muslims since the Paris attacks. Trump proposes observing mosques due to fears they will spread hateful ideas.

Nihad Awad, director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Trump "and others are playing into the hands" of the Islamic State terrorist group, also known as ISIS. "This is exactly what ISIS wants from Americans: to turn against each other."
