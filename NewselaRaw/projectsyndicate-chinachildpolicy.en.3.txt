LONDON, England – In the 1970s, the number of people in China was growing. The government got worried. Would there be enough food? It created a new rule that families could only have one child.

The rule was in effect for almost 40 years. This year, the rule has changed. Now, families can have as many as two children. The change will have big effects on the country. It will change the age balance in China, as well as the way people spend money.

## An Age-Old Problem?

The one-child rule reduced the number of young people in China. For years, there was only one child for every two parents. Over time, old people started to outnumber young people.

In 1970, more than half of Chinese people were under the age of 20\. In 2010, after years of the one-child rule, only about a quarter were under 20\. Meanwhile, the share of people above the age of 60 doubled. Overall, the Chinese people got older.

This caused many problems. As old people get to the age when they stop working, they need young people for support. The problem is that there are not enough young people.

## Where Is The ATM Machine?

The new two-child rule will help fix the age balance of the Chinese people, but it will take time. Children born this year will not start working for many years. In the meantime, things may actually get harder for some families. There will now be more very young people in China, and more old people. Middle-aged people will have to support them both.

The rule will also have good effects. It will likely cause families to start spending more money. Right now, Chinese families save a lot of their money. While saving money can be wise, it can also be bad for businesses. Businesses do well when people spend their money rather than saving it.

Families with two children will have to spend more money than families with just one child. After all, children are expensive. The two-child rule will mean that families have more children and spend more money. This will help Chinese businesses.

## Toys, Bicycles, School Books

Some businesses will feel the difference more than others. At first, the higher number of children will help the sales of children's books, toys, and bicycles. With time, more people will need homes and medicine. Other businesses will grow too.

One of the biggest effects of the new two-child rule will have to do with spending for school. In 2009, one-child families spent about a tenth of their money on school. Having a second child will mean that families spend even more on school.

## Helping A Country Grow

Overall, families with two children will spend more money. However, that does not necessarily mean that children will get more from their parents. In two-children families, kids will have to share with their brothers and sisters. Each child might get less.

Still, China's shift to a two-child rule is expected to help the country in many ways. It will help to balance the number of young and the number of old people. It will also help businesses by making families spend more money.
