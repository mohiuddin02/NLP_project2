CHARLOTTE, N.C. — There are many reasons Ron Morgan's 100 Gardens project could fail. But there are more reasons he's determined to make it work, one vegetable seedling at a time.

The idea behind the nonprofit came to Morgan after a trip to Haiti. He traveled there with members of his church after the 2010 earthquake. He expected to design shelters for people. The earthquake left 1.5 million people homeless.

He returned with the belief that food was a greater need. "I've never been that close to so much hurt and emotion," Morgan said. "It changes you completely."

Morgan hopes to build 100 gardens - 67 in the Charlotte area, and 33 in Haiti. He plans to use a soilless growing method called aquaponics. It uses fish to fertilize plants grown in water. The gardens here would serve mostly to teach students. The gardens in Haiti would provide dinner.

## Inspired By A Homeless Man

There's little land for farming available in Haiti. Other groups are also experimenting with aquaponics.

One night, Morgan was at a local grill, talking about how much he wanted to help the island. A man at the next table said: "You've got to meet George."

George Powell was homeless. And a genius, Morgan said, with hydroponics. That is another water-based growing method. Morgan invited Powell to live in his house. After hours and hours of talking, Morgan drew up a design for "George's Garden."

Then, four months later, Powell died. Morgan felt lost without the man who inspired him. But he was even more determined.

"I go out in my yard a few weeks later, and mock up what I think we drew up in the drawings," Morgan said. "By the next spring, it's just a bunch of weeds … as haunting as my commitment to George and the Haitians."

## A Vision Takes Shape

In spring 2012, Morgan turned for advice to Sam Fleming. Fleming is a musician who managed a hydroponics store in Monroe, N.C. The 25-year-old was taken with Morgan's vision. He quit his job to help. Fleming convinced Morgan that aquaponics would work better than hydroponics.

Aquaponics mixes aquaculture, raising fish with hydroponics, growing plants without soil. Water with vitamins and minerals from fish waste goes through pipes. It fertilizes the plants. The plants filter the water. Then, the clean water is sent back into the fish tank.

It requires less space, less energy and less water than typical farming. It can also yield more food in a shorter time — along with fish.

Then another unexpected thing happened. Fleming got a call from Terry Thomas, who works at a youth jail. The site had received federal grant money to set up jobs programs for students. Thomas was looking for advice on how to fix up an abandoned greenhouse.

A year later, the greenhouse is fixed up. A 450-gallon fish tank brims with tilapia. Water rich with vitamins and minerals flows from the tank into rows of plastic pipes fitted with holes like a flute. Lettuce seedlings and bunches of basil grow from the holes.

"It was something that was meant to be," Thomas said. "It's almost a miracle."

## Teenage Aquaponic Farmers

Teenagers at the jail tend the aquaponic garden and other vegetable beds outdoors. Gregg Alford is their teacher. He's all for the idea of 100 Gardens.

Morgan hopes to build his first garden in Haiti in spring 2014.

It will be located in a self-sustaining village called Mahanaim — meaning "God's Camp." The village is being built 30 miles north of Port-au-Prince.

"The garden is a wonderful idea," said Luiguy Massanga, a native of Haiti who lives in Charlotte and co-founded Joseph's Exchange which is assisting the village project. "It's a new approach that will improve agriculture production in the country."

While those around him question how everything will work out, Morgan remains undaunted.

"I never thought I would have made it this far," he said. "It's taken a huge effort on the part of a lot of people. I'm convinced we can do it."
