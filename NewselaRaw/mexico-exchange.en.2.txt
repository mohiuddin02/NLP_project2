MEXICO CITY â€” Young Americans wanting to study in Latin America have stopped focusing on Mexico, which is no longer the No. 1 place for U.S. students to attend a university in the region.

Only about 4,000 U.S. students now study in Mexico, with crime and drug violence being the main deterrent. More go to Costa Rica, Argentina and Brazil. In the past decade, Mexico dropped from first to fourth place.

Most U.S. colleges and universities have exchange programs, which offer the chance to study at another school elsewhere in the world for a year or semester. In exchange, the U.S. schools invite some foreign students for the same period.

The U.S. government wants more Americans to study in Latin America. This was one reason for visits to Mexico Wednesday by both Secretary of State John Kerry and Janet Napolitano, the former Department of Homeland Security secretary. Napolitano now heads the University of California (UC) system.

## Expanding The Exchanges Would Help

Napolitano said she wants more exchanges between University of California campuses and Mexican universities. She added that it should also include professors and researchers, not just students. Of 233,000 students in the UC system, only about 40 study in Mexico each year. About 1,900 Mexicans were at UC schools last year.

Student exchanges would help correct misperceptions on both sides of the border, Napolitano said. Among them, is that Mexico is dangerous and the United States is unfriendly to Mexicans.

"The best way to change that is to have an actual experience," she said. "There has to be marketing on both sides of the border if we're going to make this work."

Kerry said he wants to start a discussion of new ideas and research in higher education between the two countries. President Barack Obama's new higher education exchange project aims to have the United States and Latin America exchange 100,000 students by 2020. A similar program in Mexico, "Proyecta," has the goal of sending 100,000 Mexican students a year to the United States by 2018. Just over 14,000 Mexicans come to the United States on exchange programs today.

"I'm convinced this is a way to strengthen our ties," Kerry said.

## Falling From First Place

Mexico was once the top location for U.S. students studying in Latin America. Strong family ties and plentiful trade between the two neighbors made it a natural choice. But the numbers have dropped with the spike in drug violence, especially during the presidency of Felipe Calderon, who left office in 2012. Calderon stepped up attacks on drug networks when he was president. He served at the same time Napolitano was in charge of homeland security for the United States.

Once the exchanges are postponed or stopped, colleges set up relationships with programs in other places, said Shannon O'Neill, who works at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. The result can be a long-term drop in the number of students who participate. Even if violence drops off, "it can be hard for the numbers to rebound," she said.

Current Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto argues that violence is down. However, several pockets around the country contradict his depiction. The western Michoacan state and the state of Tamaulipas bordering Texas have been plagued with killings. Morelos and Mexico state surrounding Mexico City are two other hot spots.

## A Real Fear Of Violence

Justin Bogda, 21, did an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in the summer of 2013 while studying at the University of Southern California. He said when he told his family about his plans, they were frightened.

"They said, 'Oh my God, there's all the violence,' because of what they see on the news,'" said Bogda, who is from New Jersey. He said that in places like Mexico City, it's more the perception than the reality.

The Institute of International Education reported 8,360 Americans studied in Mexico in the 2000-2001 school year. That dropped more than 50 percent to 3,815 by the 2011-2012 school year.

"It's the perception of safety, that's the main reason," said Allan Goodman, the president of the Institute of International Education.

## Get To Know Your Neighbor Better

Today, laid-back Costa Rica is the No. 1 pick of U.S. students. Nearly 8,000 Americans participate in exchanges there. The increase in students there may also be due to the popularity of environmental studies in the United States. Costa Rica's rain forests and national conservation programs provide opportunities for study in that area, Goodman said.

The Mexican government realizes that students may think it is a dangerous country. It said as much in a document describing the "Proyecta" plan. It also pointed to a language barrier. There's a lack of English speakers in Mexico and Spanish speakers in the United States. One additional obstacle is that most Americans know nothing about educational opportunities in their neighboring country to the south, the document said.

Goodman said both countries would benefit from more student exchanges. The growing number of Americans with Mexican backgrounds makes it all the more important.

"To have Americans growing up and know nothing about our Spanish-speaking citizens ... means that our education is incomplete," he said. "Knowing Mexico to me is as important as taking another course in economics."
