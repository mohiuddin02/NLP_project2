Wars of the future will be fought with American women on the front lines and the public has no problem with it.

Most Americans favor the Defense Department's decision to lift a ban on women in combat jobs and do not believe it will hurt military effectiveness, a new poll shows.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced the policy change last week, explaining that the decision was influenced by the role women have already played in risking life and limb in wars of the past decade.

Women comprise 14 percent of the active duty military. According to the Pentagon, 152 female troops have been killed while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

## Ban Hurts Career Advancement

Still, the Army, which is the largest of the four branches of the military, currently excludes women from 25 percent of active-duty jobs, including those in artillery, infantry and armored units. Most of the other jobs off-limits to females are in the Marines. The Pentagon said it expects to open up many jobs to women this year, but that commanders will have until 2016 to ask for exceptions. The commanders will be required to justify any exclusion of women.

Servicewomen complained that the ban prevents them from advancing their careers. Serving in a combat-facing unit is a stepping-stone to higher rank and leadership commands.

Major Mary Jennings Hegar was awarded the Purple Heart for her injuries and another medal for heroism and valor after her helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan. But medals were not enough; she wanted a promotion. Because the Air Force did not consider her experience as combat, she was prevented from competing for a combat-leadership role.

## In Modern Warfare, No One Is Safe

Military experts say the line between combat and non-combat is getting blurry. In past centuries, opposing armies met on the field of battle. Infantry units went to fight, while support units stayed behind. Nowadays, the U.S. military has been fighting insurgents, who plant roadside bombs, hide in cities and towns, and launch attacks among civilians or against military bases. Soldiers who drive fuel trucks, provide medical support or even sort mail can come under fire in modern warfare.

Linda Brashears was serving in an Army postal unit when she suffered a brain injury in a mortar attack during her tour in Iraq. She said she wouldn't have been interested in serving in a front-line infantry job, but believes many other women will welcome the opportunity.

"A lot of people think we should still be sitting behind a desk, but the world is changing," Brashears told USA Today.

In fact, not many people do think female troops should be confined to desk jobs.

Sixty-six percent of people polled by the Pew Research Center said women should be allowed to serve in fighting units, while just 26 percent said that women should not. Pew surveyed the 1,005 adults between Jan. 24 and 27, a few days after the Pentagon's announcement. Pew said both women and men were equally supportive of the move, but that older Americans were less in favor of women serving in combat than were younger Americans.

Nearly half those surveyed said the decision would make no difference in the effectiveness of the military and 29 percent said it would make the armed services more effective. Only 15 percent of survey respondents said it would make military effectiveness worse.

## Counting Pushups

Opponents of the change say that women do not have the physical strength necessary to qualify for the combat jobs. They warn that lowering the fitness requirements will only help the enemy.

Senator John McCain, a Vietnam War veteran, said he supports Panetta's decision but had some concerns. "It is critical that we maintain the same high standards that have made the American military the most feared and admired fighting force in the world," McCain said.

Army Staff Sergeant Jennifer Hunt was injured in 2007 when an improvised explosive device (IED) blew up her Humvee. "Right before the IED went off, it didn't ask me how many pushups or situps I could do," Hunt told The Wall Street Journal. "Right now, the women who are serving are being engaged in combat, so their physical restrictions aren't a barrier."

According to The New York Times, the Pentagon has no plans to lower its fitness requirements. Men and women have the same situp requirements in the Army, although female soldiers can pass their fitness test with fewer pullups and a slower 2-mile run.

Critics also complain that having women in combat units will be too distracting for the men and could damage morale. Advocates argue that including more women will help end harassment and discrimination of female troops that has plagued military culture.

## What's The Fuss?

Representative Tammy Duckworth was elected to Congress after serving in Iraq as an Army National Guard helicopter pilot. During her tour of duty she lost both legs. She told National Public Radio that the arguments against allowing men and women to serve together reminds her of a time when black soldiers were forbidden from serving alongside whites, or when Japanese-Americans were segregated into their own battalions.

"That was the thought in World War II, that you couldn't integrate the military," Duckworth said. "So I think, you know, down the road, we're going to look back in the distance and say, boy, that was a lot of fuss over nothing."
