American children and teens eat a lot of fast food.

A new report measured how much. The government did the report. It found that 1 out of 3 children and teens eat fast food every day.

Out of 100 children and teens, 12 get almost half their calories from fast food. Calories are how people measure how much energy food gives you. Ten children and kids get at least one-fourth of their calories from fast food. Just more than 11 get fewer than one-fourth of their calories from fast food.

## Too Many Calories Lead To Weight Gain

Too many calories make people gain weight. Getting too many calories from fast food can be bad. Fast food might not be as nutritious as other foods.

The government wanted to see if some children and teens ate more fast food than others. It turned out that boys and girls both ate fast food. Poor and rich children and teens also both ate fast food.

Even weight did not have much to do with it. Thin and heavy children and teens got about the same number of calories from fast food.

## Older Children And Teens East More Fast Food

Scientists found one big difference, though. Older children and teens were more likely to eat fast food.

Young children were less likely to eat fast food. Nine out of 100 younger children ate fast food each day. They were ages 11 and younger.

For teens and older children it was different. Nearly two times as many older children and teens ate fast food. They were 12 to 19 years old.
