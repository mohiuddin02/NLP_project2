ST. LOUIS â€” Kids at Lincoln Elementary School don't have to turn in their homework. They don't have to answer questions in class. They don't get points for trying.

But they must know their math, reading and science if they want to get good grades.

This year, the school changed how it grades its students. The change came after most students failed a state test. This came as a big surprise. Everyone thought the kids were doing great since they got good grades.

The school knew it had a problem.

## New Way Of Grading

The school now grades students on what they know. They don't get points for turning in homework. Students also can redo their work. They can even take tests again.

"There are kids that are good at playing the game of school," said Julie Williams. She is the principal of Lincoln Elementary in Missouri. Some kids get good grades. They raise their hands a lot in class. But that doesn't mean they really know the subject.

But some parents don't like the new system. They worry their kids wouldn't do homework if they didn't have to turn it in.

"That's not real life," said Paul Bozdech. He is the father of a middle schooler.

 Ken O'Connor used to be a teacher. Teachers don't help kids by giving them grades they don't deserve, he said. "At some point, they are going to fall on their face," he said.

The usual way of grading can hide failure. A student might earn a D in math. But he might get a C if he turned in homework.

## "What's Best For Kids"

The change is scary for many teachers. Even teachers who like it say homework is important.

But teachers say the new way works.

Becky Stevenson is an English teacher. She said her students used to worry about getting good grades. Now they really want to learn.

Lincoln Elementary now does much better on state tests. In 2013, most students passed reading and math. Twice as many passed as in 2010.

The new grading played a big part, the principal said.

"It's clear to us this is what's best for kids."
