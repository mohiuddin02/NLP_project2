GUATEMALA CITY â€” For more than 1,000 years, the people of Guatemala have told stories and expressed their vision of the universe through their colorful textiles.

In modern times, however, they have been discriminated against because of the traditional clothes. The distinctive fabrics, patterned with brightly colored animals and landscapes, mark them as part of the country's poor and native Mayan civilization.

Now, these embroidered Mayan textiles, called huipiles, are being rediscovered in some of the country's finest shops. Young Guatemalan designers are using them for everything from evening gowns and purses to handmade shoes. They are sold as far away as Dubai in the Middle East.

For many here, the use of huipil fabrics is part of a wider embrace of the country's Mayan roots. Musicians, designers and even politicians are adopting Mayan languages and themes. This trend is also seen in other countries with strong native traditions, such as Bolivia and Mexico. There, the clothing and culture of indigenous peoples, who have lived in those lands for thousands of years, are overcoming longtime prejudices.

## "I Am Proud Of My Dress"

Adela Qel is a 45-year-old indigenous Mayan woman in northwestern Guatemala who wears a huipil. She is proud that the fashion world is accepting the bright clothing.

"It doesn't bother me that they use the typical clothing because if they like it, I can't be mad about this," said Qel.  "I am proud of my dress."

The fabrics come in dazzling colors. Woven in bands and geometric patterns, they are often worn as tunics or dresses. In Guatemala's design houses, the fabrics are fashioned into ties, pumps and purses. They stand out from the usual sober colors displayed in high-end stores.

The Maria's Bags label has seen surprising success with its designs based on Mayan textiles. The label sells its purses in Bloomingdale's department stores around the world.

Fashion designer Eduardo Figueroa said modernizing the Mayan designs helps non-native people appreciate this ethnic fashion. Already, new clothes based on Mayan textiles are in the wardrobes of Guatemalan political figures and entertainers. And Guatemalans living in the United States and other countries have particularly embraced the designs, possibly as a cure for being homesick.

## Grabbing The Spotlight At Miss World 2012

Figueroa has won international recognition for the dress he designed for Guatemala's Miss World 2012 competitor. It is a bright orange gown with a spray of floral design at the shoulders. Fashion designer and Project Runway judge Nick Verreos rated the outfit as one of the contest's best.

"I am inspired by color and Guatemalan textiles are rich in color," Figueroa said. "There were people who would tell you that they thought that traditional textiles were just for cushions and tablecloths."

He tells them that the textiles can be used in many creative ways.

Shoe designer Karim Corzo said the trend helps the communities that make the fabrics.

"They allow us to give work to the women who weave them and sell them," Corzo said.

Guatemalan rapper Tzutu Baktun Kan believes Guatemala is moving back toward its cultural roots. Those traditions reach back more than 1,000 years. Back then, Guatemala sat in the heart of the Mayan Empire.

"What we are trying to do is strengthen the Mayan languages that little by little are not being spoken," said Kan, who performs in the Mayan language of Tzutujil. Strengthening the languages, he says, helps break the ties of racism.

## A Means Of Self-Expression

Not everyone, however, embraces the old traditions.

Eduardo Ortiz is a high-fashion clothing designer. He says he will not use traditional Guatemalan textiles. They aren't his style. Likewise, he says, some Guatemalans won't accept them.

"Some people think they will look too indigenous with this type of clothing," he said.

Under Spanish colonial rule, native Guatemalans were forced to wear traditional outfits. Their designs were particular to the region they lived in. This was so the authorities could better identify them, and control them.

Over the years, though, the embroidery of the outfits became a means of self-expression, said Alvaro Pop. Pop is a United Nations expert on indigenous cultures. The designs incorporated elements such as the Mayan calendar and images of magicians who people believed could take animal form.

The world views and stories of the Mayans, their thoughts and ideas, are expressed through their outfits, Pop said.

## Trendy, With A Price Tag To Match

In recent decades, the fabrics have became more modern. More colors are mixed into the designs.

This is so more Guatemalans would be willing to wear them, Corzo said.

The new fashion doesn't come cheap. A pair of high-fashion shoes runs from $50 to $150. A gown can cost between $300 and $800. The price, according to the designers, is a result of a design's uniqueness and the quality of the handmade products.

Pop said some of that money should go back to the communities, which are among the country's poorest and most ignored. One of their greatest remaining possessions, he said, is their ancient culture.

Ethnic fashion is trendy around the world, but designers have to be very careful not to simply copy the patterns without paying the indigenous designers, Pop said. "Each textile they make is absolutely unique," he said. "They don't make it twice and (their ideas) should be paid for, too."
