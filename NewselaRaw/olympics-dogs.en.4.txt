SOCHI, Russia—The dogs are all over the streets of Sochi.

They roam in packs. Dozens of them have shown up in the new mountain villages the Russian government has built for the 2014 Winter Olympics.

The pooch problem is a big story.

Free-roaming dogs are a global issue. But it has been put in the spotlight in Sochi. There were reports that Olympic organizers hired people to kill at least 2,000 animals. The news helped bring in interest in protecting the animals. Most of the dogs are friendly — which explains why a number of visiting athletes are trying to help.

## "Bring This Puppy Home"

"It makes me sad seeing dogs on the streets," said Brita Sigourney of California. She competes in the ski halfpipe.

Sigourney found two young dogs near the athletes village. It was love at first sight. She returned to the spot a few days later to check on her new friends. Only one dog was there.

"The workers around said the other disappeared," she said.

Sigourney wants to bring more than a medal back from the Sochi Games.

"I wish I could bring this puppy home," Sigourney said.

Many share that feeling. Silver medalist freeskier Gus Kenworthy plans to take five dogs home that he picked up on the streets.

"I've been around animals all my life," said Kenworthy, of Colorado. "It's hard to watch."

Amanda Bird, U.S. bobsled and skeleton press officer, also plans to bring home a pooch. You have to have an international health certificate to bring home dogs. You also have to have proof that the dog has had a rabies shot. Bird's husband already has picked out a name: Sochi.

## Volunteers Rescue Dogs

Kelly O'Meara works for Humane Society International. She said most dogs in Russia end up homeless because they are abandoned.

Sochi has grown a lot in the past seven years.  Thousands of workers came and brought dogs with them to guard the construction sites. But local people say the workers left without taking the dogs.

Dina Filippova lives in Sochi. The part-time lawyer quit her job to lead a campaign to save street dogs.

"We have a lot of volunteers who rescue dogs and keep them in different places," she said.

Dogs have to be driven out of Sochi at night. They are taken to safe places where they can find good homes.

Filippova guesses that she has saved about 500 dogs over the past few years. She is keeping a handful in her apartment. She also has about 24 more in short-term homes.

The city opened a shelter in the past month. But Filippova says that was done as a show for reporters.

Nadezhda Mayboroda opened a private shelter called PovoDog. She said she has about 20 dogs there and is trying to expand.

She has been trying get officials to build a permanent city-run shelter. She has been trying for five years.

"Still, nobody wants to help," Mayboroda said.

## Bird And A Dog

Bird plans to visit PovoDog on Monday to pick out which one she wants.

She said she didn't come to Sochi to adopt a dog. "But I couldn't ignore the presence of the stray dogs."

Bird dreams of someday owning enough land to build a place for animals to be safe. She doesn't know if she will get a puppy home to Tennessee. Her airplane doesn't allow dogs. Bird is hoping someone will bring the animal home for her.

Mayboroda made it clear that strays are an international problem. They are not just found in Sochi. But the nice weather along the Black Sea allows the dogs to live on the streets without many problems.

"Food is everywhere," she said.

A friendly hound was hanging outside the door of a cafe in the Olympic Park on Sunday. The dog probably would have agreed.
