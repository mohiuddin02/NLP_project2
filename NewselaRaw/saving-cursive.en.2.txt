COLUMBUS, Ohio — Linden Bateman is fighting to keep cursive writing, or script, in American classrooms.

Penmanship. Handwriting. Once upon a time, it separated those who could read and write well from those who couldn't.

But now we live in the digital age. More and more, people are communicating by computer and smartphone. Handwriting often isn't called for anymore.

Recently, states introduced new educational standards for public schools. It's called the [Common Core](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Common+Core) and it lays out what students need to know to succeed in college and in careers.

Penmanship lessons were dropped from the list.

## Conveys Intelligence And Grace

But at least seven of the 45 states that adopted the new standards have changed their mind. They are now trying to restore cursive instruction.

Bateman, a 72-year-old state representative from Idaho, is just one supporter of cursive. Cursive, he says, conveys intelligence and grace. It also triggers creativity and builds brain cells. He himself handwrites 125 letters each year. Using a fancy cursive, of course.

"Modern research indicates that more areas of the human brain are engaged when children use cursive handwriting than when they keyboard," said Bateman. "We're not thinking this through. It's beyond belief to me that states have allowed cursive to slip from the standards."

State leaders who developed the Common Core left out cursive for various reasons. In this digital-heavy age, there is an increasing need for children to master computer keyboarding. And there is evidence that even most adults do not use classic cursive in everyday life. Instead, they use some mixture of cursive and print.

"Stop and think for a second about what are the sorts of skills that people are likely to be using in the future," said education expert Morgan Polikoff. "It's much more likely that keyboarding will help students succeed in careers and in school than it is that cursive will."

States that adopted Common Core are allowed to offer courses that were left off the list of preferred offerings. But in many schools these days, classroom time is limited and the pressure to get good grades is high. Optional offerings tend to get dropped in favor of what's required.

## Constitution Written In Cursive

That's why at least seven states are making cursive required. These states are California, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Utah.

Cursive supporters point to recent brain science: Research indicates that the fluid motion employed when writing script enhances hand-eye coordination and develops fine motor skills. This in turn improves reading, writing and thinking skills.

They further argue that scholars of the future will lose the ability to interpret valuable writing from the past if they can't read cursive. Such writing includes ancestors' letters and journals, and important historical documents.

"The Constitution of the United States is written in cursive. Think about that," Bateman said.

All the fuss seems a bit loopy to some members of Generations X, Y and Z. People their age have moved more and more from handwriting to computers.

The volume of first-class mail at the U.S. Postal Service fell in 2010 to its lowest level in a quarter-century. At the same time, computer use — and the keyboarding it involves — was growing more and more necessary.

Some 95 percent of teens use the Internet. And the percentage using smartphones to go online has grown from 23 percent in 2011 to 37 percent today. The volume of text messages among teens rose from 50 a day on average in 2009 to 60 a day on average two years later.

## Many Write On Their Computers

But teachers don't think that's a bad thing. Seventy-eight percent believe the Internet and cellphones encourage their students' creativity and personal expression.

Still, says researcher Kristen Purcell, most teachers "encourage their students to do at least some of their writing by hand."

Teachers gave two main reasons, she said. The first is that most standardized tests are still in paper-and-pencil format. Teachers also believe that having students write by hand helps slow down their thinking. This encourages deeper and fuller thinking while they're writing.

Many teens prefer to write on the computer, which they find faster and neater. But many still use handwriting for notes, letters, journals, short stories or music lyrics — as well as for school.

"I find it hard to think creatively when I am typing," a high school boy from the Pacific Northwest said in 2008. "So I like to handwrite everything, then I put it on the computer. I don't know, that is just how I am."

Adults unable to write cursive might think back to the experiences of Jacob Lew. In 2013, President Barack Obama nominated him as treasury secretary. But there was a problem.

Lew's signature looked more like a series of loops than an actual name. And as treasury secretary, his signature would appear on U.S. dollars.

"Jack assured me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible" in order not to devalue our money, the president joked at the time.
