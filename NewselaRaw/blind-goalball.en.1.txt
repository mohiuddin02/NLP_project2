BERKELEY, Calif. — Growing up blind, the closest Ann Kwong came to a competitive sport, even in gym class, was a marshmallow-eating contest. Judith Lung, another blind woman, never learned how to throw a ball.

"I never knew what it was like to block a ball and take one for the team," said Kwong, a senior at the University of California (UC), Berkeley.

Now she does. And it happens to be a nearly 3-pound rubber ball with bells inside that comes bouncing and jingling toward her at as fast as 50 miles per hour.

## Keep Your Eyes Off The Ball!

College sports teams are all but off-limits to the disabled, but UC Berkeley hopes to open the door with goalball. The sport is a bruising and slightly bloody game played by sightless — and sighted — players. They rely on their other senses — sound, touch and hearing — to hurl a ball about the size of a basketball across an 18-meter court and into the goal.

This fall, Cal became the first in the nation to establish a competitive college goalball team. It has been less than two years since the school began teaching students, both blind and sighted, how to play.

Supporters of goalball hope the coming years will lead to advances in sports for disabled people like the Title IX anti-gender-discrimination law did for women. The 1972 Title IX law ensured equality for women in school sports. Before Title IX, schools did not have to spend as much money or give equal attention to girls' sports as boys' sports. As late as the 1960s, for instance, women were forced to play half-court basketball.

## A Civil Rights Issue?

"I would argue that this is one of the civil rights issues of the 21st century," said Derek Van Rheenen. He is goalball's faculty sponsor and directs UC Berkeley's Cultural Studies of Sport in Education.

Between 35 and 50 blind students attend the university, said Matt Grigorieff. He is a graduate student who founded Athletics for All at the university to include people with disabilities in sports.

At a recent game, a referee reminded everyone to be quiet. Silence is an important rule, since the athletes need to be able to hear what's happening on the court.

The referee rolled the ball to the team's star, freshman Will Slason, and blew his whistle. As his two teammates crouched beside him, Slason took a running start and whipped the ball in a bowling motion to the other end of the court. With a thump, it hit the chest of Jessica Adams, who had slid to her side on the floor to block the ball.

## No Peeking Allowed

Adams, who briefly played varsity volleyball at Cal, is the only player on the goalball team with full vision. Like everyone else, though, she wears blackout eyeshades and can see nothing during the game. The court lines are marked by twine covered in tape, so the players can feel their positions.

"For sure, the first time you play it's scary. It's easy to get disoriented," Adams said. "It's also scary playing against Will."

Known for his power and athletic skill, Slason wrestled in high school before coming to Cal. He said he loves the discipline, teamwork and "never-give-up attitude" of team sports. Slason is legally blind but can see enough to get around — just not to play sports where, he said "I have to catch a ball flying at my face."

Players have hip, elbow and knee pads to protect them from all the diving and sliding that goes on in the game, but nothing shields their eyes or noses. They quickly learn to guard their faces with outstretched arms during rallies.

## Bloodied But Unbowed

If players let their guard down for a moment, they can end up with a bloody nose.

"People with disabilities are seen as these fragile people, which isn't the case at all," Kwong said.

The team also has an adorable service dog, Van Dyke, who sports a team uniform. Invented after World War II for disabled veterans, goalball evolved into a competitive sport and for decades has been part of the Paralympic Games, which are the Olympics for disabled people. The best goalball players throw the ball at up to 50 miles per hour and the pace of the game can be dizzying. Matches have two halves, each of 12 minutes, but the clock stops for penalties.

## Opponents Needed

For now there are no other college goalball teams to compete against, so the Cal team plays Paralympic club teams, many with far more experienced athletes.

But Portland State and CSU Long Beach are building their goalball programs, and other universities have expressed interest in following Cal's lead, Grigorieff said.

He dreams that one day soon the NCAA will create a college-level league for sports like goalball, which include athletes with and without disabilities.

"It's easy to say it's going to be too complicated," Grigorieff said. "We're showing that it can be done."
