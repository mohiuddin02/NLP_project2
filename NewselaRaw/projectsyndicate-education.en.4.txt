PARIS, France — The world is changing fast. Technology is a big part of that. Technology makes life easier for most people. However, not everyone around the world knows how to use these tools, like computers. The world's education system needs to improve. Everyone should have the training to use technology.  

Some countries offer a good education. Yet that is not the case everywhere. In some countries, kids cannot go to school or the schools are not good. This needs to change. All kids, no matter where they live, should be able to go to a good school. 

Education is very important. It helps people have better lives. It also helps countries become richer. The world used to be more divided. There were just rich countries and poor countries. Now, education has improved. Some poorer countries have improved their education. When people are educated, it is easier for countries to work together and for them to buy things from one another. 

## Education Makes Lives Better

Education can change a country's economy. The economy is how a country makes money and spends it. Countries with good education systems have better economies. More jobs can be found. When a country educates its people, the people are healthier. They have longer lives. 

It is important that everyone can go to a good school. However, it is also important that schools teach kids the right things. 

One key skill is how to think. Today, it is easy to find information on the Internet. Schools should teach students about what to do with the information they find.

## Teamwork, Listening Are Important

Teamwork is also important. Schools should help students to learn to work with one another. Having these skills is important at jobs today. Everyone has different opinions. People do not always agree with one another. Successful adults know how to listen to different opinions. Listening to ideas and working together are important skills. 

The main goal of education should be to get a job. There are certain skills students need to get jobs. Teachers play a big role in teaching those skills. Teachers can help students learn how to communicate and work together. They can also give advice on getting jobs. While grades are important, schools should set students up for success after graduation. 

Technology is changing fast. The education system must change, too. Students and teachers need to look toward the future. It will not be easy, but it is necessary.
