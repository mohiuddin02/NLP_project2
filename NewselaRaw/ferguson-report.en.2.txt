FERGUSON, Mo. â€” A Justice Department report released Wednesday accused the Ferguson Police Department and courts of unfairly targeting African-Americans. The report found that police searched people without a legal reason, abused their authority and routinely violated civil rights.

Also Wednesday, the Justice Department announced that former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson will not face any federal charges over the shooting of a black teenager named Michael Brown. On Aug. 9, Wilson, who is white, killed Brown even though he was unarmed. Brown's death set off months of protests and led the Justice Department to begin its six-month investigation into policing in Ferguson.

Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday said that the Ferguson police and courts had "severely undermined the public trust." They created a "tensely charged atmosphere, where people feel under assault, under siege."

Now, the city must respond to the report.

## Culture Of Police Brutality

Will leaders agree to make the more than two dozen changes the Justice Department recommended? Will they challenge the findings? Could the city afford to follow the government's recommendations, which could be expensive? Could it afford not to?

If city leaders had answers to these questions on Wednesday, they did not say.

At a brief news conference, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles read a statement, but did not take any questions. He said the city had suspended two employees and fired another for writing racist emails. The city also stopped charging some court fees and hired three African-American women.

"We must do better," Knowles said, "not only as a city, but as a state and as a country."

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson did not speak at the news conference, nor has he returned phone calls seeking comment. The report depicts his department as tolerating a culture of police brutality and using the police officers to bring in money through court fines.

On Tuesday, three federal Department of Justice officials went over the report with top Ferguson officials. They stressed that the process of reaching an agreement with Ferguson has only begun. The department still can go to court to force the city to change.

## Abused By The System

The 102-page report discusses dozens of cases of people abused by the system.

In one of those, a 32-year-old black man was sitting in a car after playing basketball. A police officer stopped him because his windows were too dark and ordered him out of the car and asked to search it.

When the man refused, citing his constitutional rights, "The officer reportedly pointed a gun at his head, and arrested him," the report says.

Ferguson police expect and demand obedience even when they have no legal right, the report said.

## Blacks And Whites Treated Differently

African-Americans make up 67 percent of the population in Ferguson. They accounted for 85 percent of all traffic stops. They received 90 percent of traffic tickets. Also, 93 percent of the people arrested by Ferguson police over the last two years were black. Many of them were arrested just for walking down the street.

The report says African-Americans and whites were treated differently by the Ferguson police and courts. At each point, the police department "enforces the law more harshly against black people than others," stated the report.

The investigation found seven racist emails that had circulated among police and court employees from 2008 to 2011. One of them depicted President Barack Obama as a chimpanzee.

Even as recently as a month ago, officers violated people's right to free speech, the report says. On Feb. 9, several people were peacefully protesting outside the Ferguson police station.

Two Ferguson police vehicles sped out of the parking lot, and an officer announced, "Everybody here's going to jail." A man who recorded the scene was himself arrested for interfering with police. Officers pushed him to the ground and began handcuffing him. A video showed the man was neither interfering nor resisting.

## Raising Money Through Court Fines

Also, the report says Ferguson used its police and courts to raise money. Often, this came at the expense of people who were poor and African-American.

The report said Ferguson used its police department as "a collection agency" to bring in money for the town.

The department has recommended 26 reforms to the city's police department and court system.

Proposed police reforms include requiring a supervisor to approve arrests for many minor charges. The report suggests changing the rules about when officers can use force. Officers should also be trained in how to reduce violence and how to figure out when they are discriminating against people. The report also recommended involving regular citizens in police decision-making.

Officials said that Ferguson has already begun training for "bias-free policing." It also has implemented changes in police and court policies.

Justice Department officials said they knew that police departments, including Ferguson's, are short of cash.

But "the cost of not doing this, not just monetarily, but otherwise, are pretty severe," a Justice Department official said.
