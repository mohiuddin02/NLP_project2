LOS ANGELES â€” It has been 11 months since Beth Capper's son Ezekiel was born. Since then Capper, a Los Angeles mom, has gone days at a time without food to keep up her supply. It's not drugs or alcohol or even baby formula that Capper needs. It's diapers.

"There's no way around buying them," said Capper. The 41-year-old single mom doesn't work because of a disability.

Like Capper, many mothers across the country cannot afford to keep their children in clean diapers. According to a report published in the journal Pediatrics, this is a problem that affects a large number of low-income Americans. Nearly 30 percent of mothers questioned for the study live in New Haven, Conn., and do not have enough diapers for their children.

It's a big problem that often goes unnoticed.

"I call it the silent epidemic," said Caroline Kunitz, who runs L.A. Diaper Drive. An epidemic is a problem that affects a large portion of the population. Kunitz's organization will distribute 1.5 million diapers around Southern California this year.
## A Constant Need

In Los Angeles, organizations report that the need for diapers is constant. These same organizations also report that diapers fly out of warehouses as soon as they're delivered.

When word spread that a Los Angeles-based organization was handing out diapers directly to parents, desperate parents came to its office. The problem was that no diapers were being handed out. It was a big mistake. But parents didn't find out about the mistake until they had formed a long line, said Norah Weinstein, who works at the organization. The organization also received 3,000 voicemail messages that day.

Parents in need can get financial support from the government to pay their health-care costs. That health program is called Medicaid. Another program helps parents in need pay their rent. There is even a program that helps parents pay for food. But there are few places for parents to go when they need help paying for diapers.

On average it costs $18 a week to keep a young child dry and clean. A single mother earning $15,080 a year in a minimum-wage job would have to spend a little over $900 a year on diapers, according to the Pediatrics study. Minimum-wage work usually pays $10 and under per hour.

Many families that earn [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) can't afford to buy mass amounts of diapers at stores like Costco and Target. And cloth diapers are often not an option because they require many trips to the laundromat. Those trips can become very expensive over time.
## Talking To Moms

Co-authors Megan Smith of the Yale School of Medicine and Joanne Goldblum of the National Diaper Bank Network have been researching the diaper problem in the United States. They went to schools, stores, bus stops, beauty parlors and other locations in New Haven to talk to mothers.

Smith and Goldblum asked the women about their health and medical care. They also asked the women about access to basic needs like food, housing and diapers.

They found that over 25 percent of the women in the study were in need of diapers. In order to get diapers for their children, the women had to ask for help from organizations, friends or family. Latinas had a higher level of need than African-American and white women. Women 45 or older, who the team assumed were mostly caring for grandchildren, also had greater need.

Women who said they had a lot of difficulty managing stress or sadness were nearly twice as likely as others to report diaper need, said Smith. "The inability to provide a diaper increases the stress levels of mothers incredibly," she said.

Nearly 8 percent of the women in the study reported that they "stretched" diapers when they needed more diapers. Stretching a diaper is removing a dirty diaper, tossing out the solid waste, and then returning the diaper to the baby's bottom.

Wearing the same diaper for too long can lead to problems. Those problems include skin rashes and bacterial infections that require medicine.
## Diaper Need Hurts Wallets

Diaper need also affects families' economic well-being, Smith and Goldblum said. Most child-care providers require that parents supply diapers. When families can't, children miss days in day care and parents miss days at work or school.

In 2011, Representative Rosa DeLauro introduced a bill in Congress. She wanted to make it easier for parents to use federal money to get diapers. In a letter to government officials, DeLauro mentioned that more than 1 in 5 mothers have had to stay home with their child because they didn't have diapers to send to day care.

"Losing out on day care makes it even harder for parents to put in a full day's work," she wrote. "And so they fall further behind."

DeLauro's effort failed. Critics like radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh told his radio audience that the bill "gives a new meaning to the term 'pampering the poor.'"

For now, parents in need of diapers will have to ask organizations for help.
## Diapers For Attending Classes

Capper gets free diapers through Children's Institute Inc. Many of the 25,000 children and families served by Children's Institute receive diapers as a reward. In exchange for attending parenting classes, parents get diapers, said Megan Aubrey, who works at the Institute.

The promise of diapers motivates parents to keep showing up for class, said Aubrey.

"No one wants to have their child in a soiled diaper all day long," she said. "It's a basic thing, but it's really empowering."

But when parents graduate out of the program they're, for the most part, back on their own.
