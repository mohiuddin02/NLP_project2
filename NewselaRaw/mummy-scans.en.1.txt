ST. LOUIS â€” A mummy rolled down hospital hallways here on Sunday.

Amen-Nestawy-Nakht, a 3,000-year-old Egyptian priest, was getting a type of 3-D X-ray, called a CAT scan, at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. It was probably his second. The last one was a couple of decades ago, when technology wasn't what it is now.

A team of art museum officials and university doctors hoped this round could show his cause of death and new information on his health. They also hoped maybe a few artifacts would be left inside his cartonnage, the colorfully painted plaster shell that protected his body. Grave robbers made off with the bulk of the valuables, probably thousands of years ago.

The St. Louis Art Museum hired movers to pick up Amen-Nestawy and two other mummies on Sunday. The movers loaded them into special foam cases, took them to the hospital, and put them onto gurneys. A team of Washington University professors, doctors and radiologists donated their time. The hospital donated its space and the 3-D X-ray scanners.

## Looking Through The Wrappings

The scans are the best way to look at the mummies, said Michelle Miller-Thomas, a radiologist. She works with X-rays. It's the only way to look inside them without unwrapping and maybe damaging them, she said.

The results could help the team understand ancient Egyptian health and even modern-day health. For example, some mummies still have arteries, blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. Sometimes scientists can tell if they had hardened while the mummy was alive, a sign of bad health.

The museum will use the video and images to imagine what the mummies looked like when they were alive, said Lisa Cakmak of the St. Louis Art Museum.

The St. Louis museum owns the mummy of Amen-Nestawy, who probably lived in the ninth or 10th century B.C. Two others were on long-term loan to the museum from Washington University's Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum. Pet-Menekh was a priest from the third or fourth century B.C. Henut-Wedjebu was an upper-class woman from the 13th century B.C.

## Something's Afoul Here

By Sunday afternoon, the team had scanned two mummies. One of them stunk, but doctors weren't exactly sure what was causing the odor.

Then the technicians wheeled Amen-Nestawy into the scanner and one remarked that the mummy was tall.

"And the feet are really tall," said another technician. "This is going to be interesting."

But the mummy fit just fine into the circular scanner opening. The doctors crowded into the control room and stared at the computer. And then Amen-Nestawy's insides came up on the screen.

## Mummy Mugged By Grave Robbers

Doctors will be studying the results for a few months. But there were some fascinating details: The priest's body was shorter than his wrappings. His head had slipped down and his spine was broken so badly it could not have happened before he died. The doctors said it may have been broken by grave robbers.

As the giant machine scanned the mummy, the computer displayed shapes in black-and-white. It picked up a round object, in the middle of his chest, that robbers didn't get. Doctors said it looked like an amulet, a small piece of jewelry buried with mummies in hopes of ensuring dead Egyptians a safe, healthy and productive afterlife.

The scan will plot the exact size and shape of that object. Doctors will take its measurements to Washington University's 3-D printer and make a plastic model of it. Miller-Thomas said that means that soon someone will hold a plastic copy of that ancient Egyptian amulet, for the first time in 3,000 years.
