PHOENIX â€” Peter Rork feels like Santa Claus with his sled.

"I've got all kinds of goodies in back of my plane," Rork said.

Rork's co-pilot is Doyle, his black Labrador retriever. His sled is a small Cessna airplane. And his cargo sometimes barks.

Rork and Doyle live together in Wyoming. They spend their free time flying dogs around the country. Their last flight in March included 30 small dogs traveling from Arizona to a shelter in Idaho.

## Too Many Chihuahuas

Rork started Dog Is My CoPilot. It takes unwanted dogs from one state to another. When there are too many of one kind of dog in one area, the extras are sent to another area to be adopted. The idea is to rescue the animals.

Many Chihuahuas fill Rork's plane.

Arizona has too many Chihuahuas. People can't adopt them all, said Melissa Gable. She is with Maricopa County Animal Care and Control.  Sending them to a place with less Chihuahuas means they'll get adopted quicker.

In February, Arizona Chihuahua Rescue sent 25 Chihuahuas away. They went to an animal rescue group in Pennsylvania.

Judy Zimet is with Dog Is My CoPilot. It flies to 10 states in the Western U.S. It was started two years ago. In that time, Rork has flown more than 1,000 animals to no-kill shelters in other states. A no-kill shelter will not kill animals. Many shelters will kill animals that aren't adopted. They also kill the animals when the shelter is full to make room for new ones.

How are dogs chosen? It comes down to supply and demand. In some states, the groups take big dog breeds to cities with only little dog breeds. San Francisco, for instance, does not have a lot of large, floppy-eared dogs.

## Going West To East

"Arizona is Chihuahua country for us," Zimet said.

Before, people would go to an shelter and not find what they wanted. So, they'd end up going to a puppy mill or a dog breeder, she said. Dogs are often kept in bad conditions at puppy mills. "But now people can find what they need at the shelters."

Kari Nienstedt is in charge of the Humane Society in Arizona.

"I think it really kicked into high gear after Hurricane Katrina," Nienstedt said. Hurricane Katrina was a monster hurricane that hit New Orleans in 2005. Many pets were separated from their owners. Homes had to be found for the pets.

"Up North there are a lack of puppies and small dogs. So sometimes they're shipping from South to North. Sometimes they're shipping from West to East," she said. It's a great opportunity to keep animals alive.

## Solving A Serious Problem

Michael Morefield is with the Arizona Animal Welfare League. Maricopa County has the second-largest rate of killing stray cats and dogs in the country. The first is Los Angeles County.

Chihuahuas and pit bulls are the most common breeds that are killed.

"We have a very serious problem in Maricopa," he said. The group recently sent dogs to Canada, he said. One of them was adopted within three hours.

Jonathan McDonell is with HALO Animal Rescue. He said Dog Is My CoPilot is very successful.

Leigh Carter also works at HALO. Last Friday, HALO sent 30 dogs to Idaho. Already 12 of them have been adopted.

Rork supports Dog Is My CoPilot mainly out of his own pocket. He knows the animals he leaves behind likely won't live. So he tries to pack as many dogs into the plane as possible.

"It's like a puzzle trying get all the (animal carriers) in the plane," he said. "It really is a labor of love and money, but I enjoy it."
