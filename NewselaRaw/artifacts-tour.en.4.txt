PITTSBURGH, Pa. — Archaeologists study human history. They do it by looking at things people used many, many years ago. The things have been buried for a long time. 

Archaeologists have learned new things about Pittsburgh. It is a city in Pennsylvania. They have looked at what is buried under Pittsburgh. 

Archaeologists found signs that Native Americans lived near a river in the city. The river is now called the Allegheny River. The people were traders. They were there a thousand years ago. They only stayed for a short time. People from Europe came later. Archaeologists found that Europeans built homes near Pittsburgh's three big rivers.

## Digging Up Things

More people from other countries came to the city later. These people would run the city.

Casey Campetti is an archaeologist. She took people on a walk in the city. Casey pointed out things that had just been dug up. The things show what the city was once like.

Archaeologists found about 18,000 things used by humans long ago. They were found where a new road was being built. These things are called artifacts. The artifacts included houses. There were also outdoor bathrooms. They are called outhouses. Archaeologists also found where Native Americans once lived.

Archaeologists do three things at construction areas, Casey said. First, they look for discoveries. Second, they say if a discovery is important. Then they decide what to do with important artifacts.

## Finding Old Toys

Pittsburgh has much bigger buildings now. Builders first dig a big hole. Archaeologists are finding artifacts in the holes. They come from different times in history. 

Archaeologists found toys by where a tunnel was being built. There were marbles and dolls. Stone tools and arrowheads were nearby. They belonged to Native Americans. The Native Americans lived there thousands of years ago. 

Other things were found before a hotel was built. Workers dug 20 feet. Artifacts were found in the hole. Now the hotel on top of it has the artifacts. Anyone can look at these pieces from the past.
