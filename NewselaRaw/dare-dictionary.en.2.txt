The end may be near for the half-century-old Dictionary of American Regional English. In a few months, the funding will run out and job losses will be announced.

"It's a shame," said Grant Barrett, co-host and co-producer of the public radio show "A Way With Words." "It's one of the great reference works."

The dictionary is often referred to by its acronym DARE. It includes words from 1,002 communities across the country. These words come from newspapers, novels, maps, menus, diaries, newspaper death notices and, most of all, from long interviews with people.

Planned in 1963 by its first editor, Frederic Gomes Cassidy, the project lasted much longer than its first deadline of 1976. Cassidy died in 2000 at the age of 92.

## Words Came From All Around The World

DARE, based at the University of Wisconsin, finally finished its last volume including "Z" in 2012. A digital version was published in December 2013.

The dictionary shows a language as diverse as the country itself. It includes 79 regional terms for dragonfly and the histories of some not-so-pretty words. Inside DARE's covers is America's story about immigrants and the words they brought with them when they came to live in a new country. For example, the Irish  brought us brogan, a heavy work shoe; the Italians brought vino, a term for wine; the Germans gave us hausfrau for housewife; and the Polish brought over paczki, a filled doughnut.

Discovering such words may seem like an unusual goal, but it can be useful.

A couple of months ago, Douglas Kelling, a 68-year-old doctor in Concord, North Carolina, was examining an 80-year-old woman when the patient turned to him and asked: "Doc, how's my ticklebox?" The confused doctor asked what she meant by "ticklebox." "Well, my heart, course," the woman answered.

In almost 40 years of practice, the doctor has heard patients use many regional terms for illnesses. But "ticklebox" was a new one. Kelling believes the dictionary is valuable in helping him understand his patients better.

## "An Important Gift To The Nation"

For years, DARE has had money problems. This time, though, the project will begin its year in July with a little less than $100,000 â€” not even 20 percent of its usual annual amount of money. The university may also have to cut its spending.

John Karl Scholz, head of the university's College of Letters and Science, declined to comment on the dictionary's situation. Chief Editor Joan Houston Hall, who has devoted almost 40 years to the project, recently sent layoff notices to all four DARE staff members. Without more money for the dictionary, she also will lose her full-time job.

"I've lost many nights of sleep trying to figure out where we're going to get funding, and in recent months I just haven't thought of any place left to go," she said.

"I believe in this project. It has been an important gift to the nation and there is still work to be done."

If she can't find more funding, Hall said she may work for 20 percent of her salary and spend the next year organizing the dictionary's contents.

## Language Differences Remain

The sense of doom is not obvious at the dictionary's offices on the sixth floor of Helen C. White Hall at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where research continues and words are as alive as ever.

Hall scans the digital version of DARE, looking up the word bittern, a marsh bird, and admiring the more than 50 regional alternatives, including belcher-squelcher, dunkadoo, conk-onk, fly-up-the-creek and wollerkertoot.

These differences in language go against the idea that the country is losing its regional differences and that the language is coming closer to a one-size-fits-all form.

"Every time you crack open a copy of DARE, that myth is shattered," said Barrett, whose radio show reaches hundreds of thousands of listeners in 31 states. "You find history and culture. You find a continuous connection to the past. DARE has information about all of the other languages that have contributed to English.

"It's a giant mirror that shows us who we are and where we've been."

## Traveling Words And Phrases

The dictionary shows that words continue to migrate across the country. Hall has discovered that in the 50 years since the dictionary's first survey, Wisconsin residents have begun to change what they call a fizzy drink.

"Fifty years ago it was almost totally pop," Hall said, pointing to a map of the state. "Now soda is coming from the eastern United States and it's pushing out pop."

For years, fishermen and word experts could not agree on what fish the word scrod described. Associate Editor George Goebel traced the word back to the middle of the 19th century. He discovered it was not a term for a species of fish back then, but rather for the process of lightly salting and grilling a fish.

Goebel also has been working to modernize the dictionary's storage and editing systems. Many of the entries are still kept on the original paper slips collected in the 1960s by DARE field workers. They traveled the country for interviews in "word wagons." From paper slips, Goebel has been creating databases.

He is doing this to save the dictionary's future, he said. "If there is one. We have to go as if there is."
