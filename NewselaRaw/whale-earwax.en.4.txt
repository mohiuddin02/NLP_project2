Scientists have a new tool for learnings about whales and life in the ocean. It's a giant piece of earwax.

It comes from a dead blue whale. It's smelly and full of the stuff you find in belly fat â€“ lipids.

But the scientists are using the wax to learn when a whale develops certain hormones. The hormones are made in the body. They can help tell a lot about how a whale lived.

Scientists also learn what chemicals the whale swam through. So they can also see what chemicals are still in the water today. The chemicals are dangerous. They are called pollutants. Some of the pollutants have not been made for years.

## Details From A Smelly Plug

Whales can show a lot about waters they swim through, said Sascha Usenko. He is a scientist at Baylor University. Usenko helped write a report about earwax. Whales live a long time. Their bodies gather in and keep bad things from the water, he said.

Researchers often study slices of a whale's body to learn about chemicals in the water. The slices they look at are fat tissues. It is also called blubber. They even study the stuff that whales shoot from their blowholes.

But blubber has its limits. It usually only shows what the whale gathered over its lifetime, said Gina Ylitalo. She is a Seattle-based scientist. It doesn't really tell scientists when an animal came into contact with the chemicals. It does not show what hormones its body made over time.

But Usenko realized that earwax has a lot of lipids. So does fat. So the hormones and chemicals found in a whale's blubber would also end up in its ear canal.

Wax builds up in the ear over time forming a plug with layers. You can count the layers to figure out how old a whale is. It's just like counting a tree's rings.

But Usenko wondered if scientists could do more.

## Reading The Layers Like A Book

The team used an electric saw. It cut up a 10-inch earplug. The plug was pulled out of a nearly 70-foot-long male blue whale. The animal died after a 2007 accident with a ship.

The wax is "pretty heavy and strong," Usenko said. The earwax is mostly made up of lipids and the stuff found in hair and nails. It "doesn't necessarily smell great. When we were pulling it out, some of the crew actually just left."

The plug had 24 layers. They were light and dark stripes, Usenko said. The lighter bands have more lipids. They could come from times when there was more food. The darker parts may be a sign of times with less food.

The whale's body made much more testosterone when it was around 10 years old. The information helped researchers say when a male becomes an adult.

Researchers also looked at a hormone called cortisol. The hormone is released when an animal is stressed, or anxious. Cortisol levels jumped shortly after the whale's testosterone shot up. The change could be because it had to fight other males to find a mate.

## Tracking Poisonous Chemicals

The animal produced more cortisol over its life. Scientists said there could have been a lot of reasons that happened. The whale could have been more anxious because there was less food. It could have been living in more pollution. There could have been more noise to disturb it.

Scientists also found signs of poisonous chemicals in the earwax. The chemicals showed the long-term effects humans have had on the ocean.

DDT is an insect killer. You couldn't sell it in the U.S. after 1972. One reason was because it was suspected of causing a deadly disease in humans. DDT was found in the whale. But this whale was born after the chemical's use was stopped.

Many of the pollutants in the whale's earwax probably came from its mother's milk, Usenko said. Some chemicals jumped in the whale's first months of life.

The researchers saw peaks in the chemical mercury too. One occurred when the whale was about 5 to 6 years of age. Another happened when it was about 10 years old. The whale seemed to travel up and down the California coast. So it might have been swimming through regions where there was more mercury pollution, the scientists wrote.
