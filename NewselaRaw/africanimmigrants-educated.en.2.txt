NEW YORK â€” In Guinea, West Africa, Nasser Diallo had a law degree and a good job working as a reporter for a radio station. That all came to an end in 2009, he said, when the military opened fire at a protest he was covering.

Diallo never went home again. After he heard that the government was hunting him, he fled to Paris and then to the United States. Once here, he couldn't find a good job.

## Back To School

"I had to make a very, very tough choice to go back to school and restart from scratch," said Diallo, 33. "I didn't have a choice. I was going nowhere. By the time I'm going to graduate, I'll be maybe 50."

Diallo is part of America's rapidly growing population of black immigrants from Africa. Many are highly educated and without good jobs. A handful of states are trying to help immigrants like Diallo. However, many African immigrants face obstacles, including obtaining licenses to work in educational, medical and other professions.

At home, they were doctors, lawyers, accountants or professors. Here, they are cabdrivers, parking lot attendants, cashiers or nannies. They often live in poverty. As a group, though, they are more likely than any other immigrant group to hold at least a university degree, according to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), which is based in Washington, D.C.

"We've all heard about brain drain," said Jeanne Batalova, who is with the MPI. "This is brain waste."

## Finding Work Takes Hard Work

According to the MPI, one in five college-educated immigrants from all countries is unemployed or underemployed. In other words, they hold jobs that do not pay well or do not match their qualifications.

Other immigrant groups face similar challenges. African immigrants have a harder time in the American workforce, experts say.

Africans from relatively wealthy, English-speaking countries such as Nigeria and South Africa have an easier time in the system, according to Jeff Gross. He is with the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA).

But others struggle. Among recently arrived African immigrants, two out of five do not have good jobs, compared to one out of five college-educated U.S. workers, according to the MPI.

The reasons are complicated. They range from a lack of professional contacts to cultural barriers to bad advice to racial discrimination.

## "Barber Bill" Trims Red Tape

Some states are trying to make the process easier. Last year, Michigan passed a "Barber Bill." In the past, barbers needed 2,000 hours of training to get a license. Now, experienced barbers who can prove they have recent experience and training need fewer hours to get a license.

In February, a bill was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly declaring that legal immigrants cannot be denied a professional license. Some cities have become part of a Welcoming America network and made new rules to help immigrants. Shelbyville, Tennessee, which has many immigrants from Somalia in Africa, was one of the first cities to begin doing, said Rachel Peric. She is Welcoming America's deputy director.

"This should be looked at as going across generations," said Tadd Wamester, who is with Upwardly Global. "Investing in parents is also investing in children."

Black African immigrants are a rapidly growing population. Between 2000 and 2013, their numbers jumped from 574,000 to 1.4 million. African immigrants now make up about one-third of the black immigrant population. Their numbers are expected to grow.

## "You Have To Survive"

When they arrive in the United States, many Africans feel a lot of pressure to get a job, fast. In 2013, according to the MPI, three-quarters of them had jobs, a higher proportion than the overall foreign-born population or native-born Americans.

The pressure to find a job, any job, means that they often find work beneath their skill level, social scientists say. When he first came to the United States, Diallo said, he stayed with his uncle, who urged him to just drive a cab. "You have to survive," his uncle told him, "you don't have to aim high."

Back home in Gambia, West Africa, Haddi, the owner of Fatima's African Hair Braiding and Boutique, said she had a college degree and a job at a bank. Twenty-six years ago, she moved to New York to join her husband and eventually she found work at a factory. Later, she opened her own hair-braiding salon on the side and put two children through college.

"I want my children to have the education I didn't have," said Haddi. "Yes, I went to college. But I want more for them. All parents want more for their children."
