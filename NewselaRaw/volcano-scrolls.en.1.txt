One summer day nearly 2,000 years ago, Mount Vesuvius, located in what is now southern Italy, began spewing molten rock and volcanic gas in a catastrophic eruption. By the time it ended two days later, cities and towns near the volcano had been destroyed.

Some buildings and objects did survive the catastrophe, however. Among them is a collection of charred, rolled-up scrolls, which had once served as some of the books of the Romans. They have long been considered too fragile to safely unroll, so the contents of many of them have remained a mystery. It seemed as if they might be forever unread.

Until now. Using an advanced kind of X-ray technology, scientists for the first time have been able to read words inside the papyrus scrolls without having to unroll them. Their findings are described in a new study published in the journal Nature Communications.

## Amazing To Have Survived

The new breakthrough is giving hope to scholars who have been unable to read these delicate scrolls without serious risk of destroying them.

The scrolls come from a library in Herculaneum, one of several Roman towns that, along with Pompeii, was destroyed by the eruption, which occurred in A.D. 79. The library, a small room in a large villa, held hundreds of handwritten papyrus scrolls. All were carbonized — turned into dark, crumbly carbon — by a furnace-like blast of 608-degree-Fahrenheit gas produced by the volcano.

The book collection, the study authors wrote, "is a unique cultural treasure." The library itself is the only ancient library to have survived together with its books. Most of the texts that have already been examined were previously unknown to scholars, as they were not "copied and recopied" and handed down through the generations, as many ancient texts were.

Scholars have been very eager to read these rare and valuable scrolls, which could provide many clues about a lost literary past. The problem is, the scrolls are so delicate that it is nearly impossible to unroll them without harming them. Despite the risk, researchers have tried to open them in various ways — sometimes successfully, and sometimes not.

## Ink, Paper Combined

In the 1980s, the so-called Oslo method was used to open two scrolls. The method had serious problems, though, the authors of the new study wrote, because it "required the rolls to be picked apart into small pieces."

Any further attempts to physically open the scrolls were called off after that, because too many of the texts were ruined.

Researchers had also tried to X-ray the scrolls before, reasoning it might allow them to be read while avoiding the damage unrolling causes. The problem was that the ancient writers used ink made of carbon. Because the papyrus was carbonized from the blazing heat, both paper and ink are now made of roughly the same material, and thus both appeared the same when X-rayed, making it practically impossible to tell ink and paper apart.

However, a team led by Vito Mocella realized they could use a different technique, called X-ray phase-contrast tomography. Unlike standard X-ray scans, X-ray phase-contrast tomography reveals certain shifts in the X-ray light that occur when the light passes through different substances. It creates a 3-D image that allows the researchers to see the raised bumps of the ink on the papyrus.

Because the words were just a little higher than the paper, the scientists were able to make out a few words and letters from two scrolls, one of which was still rolled.

## Not An Easy Read

Reading the scrolls was still very difficult, however. The paper inside the rolled scroll was thoroughly warped by the blast of heat from Mount Vesuvius, and some of the letters are probably distorted beyond recognition.

Nonetheless, the researchers were able to read a number of words and letters. On an unrolled fragment of one scroll, they were able to make out the words for "would fall" and "would say." In the twisted, distorted layers of another papyrus, which was still rolled up, they could pick out individual letters, including alpha, nu, eta, epsilon and others.

One of the newly examined scrolls has a distinctive handwriting style that resembles writing found in a scroll containing a text written by the philosopher Philodemus. The researchers think both scrolls were written around 75 to 50 B.C.

If they are right, then the newly examined scroll "is quite likely to contain a text by Philodemus," the study authors wrote.

The newly discovered method should give other researchers a safe and reliable way to explore ancient texts that until now were off-limits to them.

The new method should prove to be very useful in gaining an understanding of "the many papyri still unopened," the study authors wrote. It may also, they added, allow researchers to study other as yet undiscovered texts — perhaps even scrolls from "a second library" that could exist beneath the one in Herculaneum.
