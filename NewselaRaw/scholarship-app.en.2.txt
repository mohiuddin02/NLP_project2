PHILADELPHIA — Christopher Gray couldn't afford to go to college, or even to apply to college. His single mother was out of work, and there were two younger children to think about – then ages 2 and 3.

But the Birmingham, Ala., student loved [entrepreneurship](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) — that is, helping and creating businesses. He dreamed of attending college somewhere in the Northeast, where many major businesses are.

So it was up to Gray to find his own solution. "I had to deal with it myself," recalled Gray, now 21 and about to start his junior year at Drexel University in Philadelphia.

Because he didn't have a computer at home, Gray went to the local library for hours every day. For three months he looked for college scholarships he could apply for. Gray, an A–B student in high school who had started his own company, had astounding success.

## $1.3 Million In Scholarships

He received 34 scholarships worth $1.3 million – enough to pay for years of school, plus cover his living expenses with some left over to invest. Gray was soon given the nickname "Million Dollar Scholar."

Now, Gray has found a way to help other teens get scholarship money. He and two friends have developed a mobile-phone app called Scholly — short for "scholarships" — for both the iPhone and Android.

The app has been available for only about a month, but several thousand downloads have already sold. Gray and his friends decided to keep the price at just 99 cents. This is because they are more interested in helping students than in making money.

All the money earned right now is going back into the company, said Nick Pirollo, 23, one of Gray's partners. He is a computer and electrical engineering major from New Jersey who graduated this month. He updates the app and manages the website Myscholly.com.

## An Exhaustive Scholarship Search

As a high school student in Birmingham, Gray did very well. He graduated with an A average while leading the local Bible club and running his company, Genesis. Gray's company, which helped students find ways to volunteer, was non-profit. That type of company does not try to raise any more money than the amount it needs to keep going.

Gray wanted to apply to Harvard and other top schools, but could not afford the application fees.

His guidance counselor suggested he apply for six scholarships, to help him pay for college. He got all of them, but knew he needed more. Gray looked at hundreds of Web sites, checking to see what different scholarships required. Many scholarships were meant for other kinds of people: "It was frustrating." But many looked for excellent grades combined with leadership and community service. Gray had all three.

"I had 600 volunteer hours," he said. "And because I started a nonprofit, that made me stand out."

Gray's biggest prize was the Gates Millennium Scholarship, which will pay for all four years of college, plus graduate school. This was followed by a $20,000 scholarship from Coca-Cola. Gray also received a $20,000 Horatio Alger Scholarship and the $10,000 Axa Achievement Scholarship.

Smaller awards came from Wal-Mart and Lowe's. And they just kept coming.

"My mom was elated. I did a little jumping around," Gray said.

## An App To Make It Quicker

Gray is now an entrepreneurship major at Drexel. The money he was awarded pays not only for his tuition, but also for his housing and dining, supplies at the Apple store, clothing, travel and for other needs.

Gray has appeared at national conferences and in newspapers and magazines, including _U.S. News &amp; World Report_. As a result, hundreds of students and parents have emailed and called for advice. Working with Mayor Michael Nutter's office on education, he has also advised students at Philadelphia public high schools.

"That's what inspired me to make the app," he said. "It was taking hours of my day trying to help. It just became too much." Gray has uploaded 500 scholarships on the app and continues to add more.

Gray wants to make it easier for the other children in his family than it was for him. "I'm trying to save up to put them in a better environment," he said. He aims to get them into a private school by fifth grade.

As for Gray's career plans, his goal is to have his own business by the time he graduates in two years. Thinking like a true entrepreneur, he hopes "not to have to get a job when I graduate."
