Humans are impressive creatures, but we are not that great at estimating time. Our sense of how much time is passing often depends on what is going on in our lives, what we have going on in our day or even on our mood.

This causes a lot of strange things to happen, like the "return-trip effect." When you go somewhere new and come back again, it often seems that the trip back took less time than the trip there. This is particularly strange because in reality, you traveled the same distance both ways.

New research suggests that the "return-trip effect" actually exists.

## How We Think Of Time

A study done by researchers from Japan uncovered interesting results. They split participants for the study into two groups and put them in a dimly lit room to watch a 20-minute movie. The movie showed a cameraman walking around a city and recording his journey. Some of the people in both groups were asked to tell the researchers every time they thought three minutes had passed.

The researchers then showed a second movie, but this time the movie was different for both groups. The first group watched a cameraman complete a round-trip — he walked to one destination and then took the same route back. The second group watched a cameraman take two different trips.

The purpose of the study was to see how humans estimate times in two ways. The first was to see how we estimate time when we are trying to be aware of it. The second purpose of the study was to see how we think of time when we reflect back on a period that has already passed.

## It's The Journey

The study found that the two groups did an equal job at predicting how time was passing during the experiment. When they were asked to think about how time passed after the experiment was over, however, their answers were very different.

The first group remembered the second part of the cameraman's journey to be shorter. This is because they watched him take the same route back from his destination as he took to get there. The second group, which watched the cameraman take two different trips, did not experience the "return-trip effect" that the first group experienced.

The study suggests that "the return-trip effect" has something to do with memory and reflection. It is triggered by the way people talk and remember an event, and to experience the effect, you need to be aware that you are making a return trip.

It is not completely clear why this happens, but psychologists — doctors and scientists who study human behavior — have a few theories.

## Time Flies

One idea is that the "return-trip effect" has to do with paying attention to time. When you try to pay attention to time, time seems to take forever. However, when you are distracted by other, more interesting things, time passes more quickly.

These psychologists present an interesting idea. By paying attention to the here and now, we may be able to actually slow the brain's idea of time and make our lives seem longer.

Psychologists also have another theory. On the way there, you do not know the route, but on the way back, you recognize sites you saw before and that makes the trip go by faster. Yet people do not experience the "return-trip effect" on trips they take regularly, like to jobs, because they already know the route and have an accurate estimate of how long the journey will take.

But this may not be the whole explanation for the return trip effect. Some research has found that people can experience the effect even when they are in unfamiliar territory.

## Mixing Up The Route

In a 2011 study, psychologists asked a group of cyclists to bike to a fair. They then split the group in half after they arrived. One group rode home on the same road that they bicycled in on. The other group took a different route, but it was exactly the same distance back as the first group. Both groups reported feeling the "return-trip effect."

This study concluded that people are often too positive on their first journey about how fast the trip will be, which makes the trip out seem to take longer. On the way back, they change their expectations too far in the other direction and expect it to be extra long, which actually makes it seem much shorter when it turns out to not be as long as they expected.

In the end, the "return-trip effect" may be a combination of all of these things.
