NEW YORK â€” Television news anchor Brian Williams hosted the NBC evening news show "Nightly News." In the past, he was one of the most trusted news reporters in America. Now, he has been suspended without pay for being dishonest.

Williams was punished for his description of being shot at in a helicopter during the war in Iraq. Recently, soldiers pointed out the lie and Williams apologized on air. Still, the apology was not enough to save his job. NBC will not allow Williams to go on television for six months.

Williams hosted America's most popular newscast for a decade, and the show won many awards.

Even though he apologized, it was not enough. The false statements damaged people's trust in him.

## "His Actions Are Inexcusable"

"Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News," Steve Burke, president of NBCUniversal, said in a statement. "His actions are inexcusable."

NBC News staff members were saddened by the events. Another news anchor would take Williams' position for now. Lester Holt, who reads the news on the weekends, will now host the show on weekdays. NBC News investigations editor Richard Esposito was leading a review of Williams' actions.

NBC News President Deborah Turness confirmed that Williams "misrepresented events."

She did not refer to Williams' news reports on Hurricane Katrina in 2005. His coverage of the hurricane helped him win a journalism award. In his reporting, he said he defended himself against violent people at the hotel where he stayed. However, local news groups and officials say they don't believe his story.

Turness said the network still had "concerns about comments that occurred while Brian was talking about his experiences."

## Will He Come Back?

The question now is what happens during the six months Williams is off the air.

One NBC News official said it would be "a period of reflection" for Williams. It will be up to viewers to decide whether they want him back.

Joe Klein worked at CNN and CBS. He thinks there is a chance Williams can win back his job and continue his career. "There is a hope that the audience misses Brian so much that they want him to come back," Klein said.

While other programs at NBC news have experienced viewer declines in recent years, Williams' show has stayed at the top. In December, Williams was rewarded with a five-year contract that pays him about $10 million a year.

Many say Williams was not fired because of the success of "Nightly News."

## Damaged His Reputation

The NBC News official said the company was split about what to do with Williams.

Some people thought Williams should be fired. His problems with the truth had damaged his reputation and NBC News. Others thought they should give him another chance after a long suspension.

Williams agreed to the suspension.

The six-month suspension is meant to stop the media coverage on Williams. Many people were talking about him on late-night comedy shows.

Judy Muller is a professor of journalism at the University of Southern California. She was also a television reporter for a long time.

Muller said that Williams was expected to be an entertaining news anchor. Americans want newscasters "to be more than somebody who reads the news or reports it."

This "is not entirely Brian Williams' fault," she said.
