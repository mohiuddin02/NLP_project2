MINNEAPOLIS â€” Simulators aren't just for pilots anymore.

Doctors at the University of Minnesota are using simulators to improve their surgical skills. They use these 3-D tools to practice for difficult cases, such as brain tumors. And they are working with medical device companies. The goal is to develop new software to train the next generation of doctors.

It may be the biggest change in medical training since the early 1900s.

The researchers hope to build lifelike models. They will allow medical students to get hands-on experience. They'll be able to learn from their mistakes without harming patients, said Dr. Robert M. Sweet. Dr. Sweet runs the University's Medical School Simulation Programs.

## A Practice Run Before Surgery

Soon, surgeons will be able to make custom models of their patients' diseased organs. Surgeons are doctors who perform operations on patients. They will eventually practice tricky operations before ever cutting the patient open.

"Have you ever seen a pitcher not warm up before their first pitch, or a musician not warm up before they go on stage? Never!" Sweet said. "Why would a surgeon be any different?"

An added benefit: Simulators collect information that can be used to study ways of doing surgery and find common mistakes. For instance, a 2011 study using simulated training found a "hangover effect." That is, doctors who had gotten drunk the night before an operation did worse.

Simulators came along about 15 years ago. Before, the only way for doctors to get hands-on experience was to cut into living patients. They had to work under the watchful eye of an older surgeon.

Sweet, 44, said the idea for simulator training came to him as he was learning surgery.

"Being from the video game generation, I thought that there might be a good way to do it with a video game," he said.

Sweet dropped by the school's technology lab and they built one. But early simulators were crude compared to the ones being developed now.

## Simulator Success Story

Yunhe Shen is a professor at the University. He is in charge of developing code that provides users with instant feedback. It imitates what surgeons would feel and see if they were operating on a live patient.

Simulators could play a big part in doctor training. Medical residents are doctors who have finished medical school and are training in hospitals to get more experience. But, residents are limited in the number of hours they can work. This is to avoid mistakes from being too tired. Practicing on simulators can help.

Dr. Travis Pagliara, a third-year resident, said the machines are incredibly lifelike.

"I'm moving in every direction of space, whether I twist my wrist, whether I push in, pull back, both hands are doing things separately," he said. How he moves his body affects what happens on the screen.

Pagliara trained on a simulator before he stepped into the operating room. Then Pagliara had to do an operation for the first time. Sweet watched over him during it. Sweet said most first-timers last less than a minute before he has to take over.

"Travis blew me away," Sweet said. He said Pagliara had natural skill. But, he added that the simulator made an important difference.

Travis agreed. "I wouldn't have lasted 15 seconds if I hadn't done that," he said.
