WASHINGTON â€“ Thousands of people come to FBI offices across the country every year looking for a job, only to be turned away.

The reason is not because they do not have the right work experience or education, or because they have a criminal record. They are turned down because they failed lie-detector tests.

Lie-detector tests are run on a machine called a polygraph. Many scientists disagree with the FBI's rule of rejecting candidates who fail the polygraph. Experts say the testing does not reliably show when somebody is actually lying, especially when they are applying for a job.

"I was called a lazy, lying, drug-dealing junkie by a man who doesn't know me, my stellar background or my societal contributions," wrote one applicant in Baltimore.  He said he was told he qualified for a job except for the test.

The government uses the tests on people looking for jobs. It also uses it to question criminals.

## A Sweaty Problem

All polygraph testing is controversial. But many scientists are especially critical when it is used for job screening. They say those questions are often more general than they are in criminal investigations. General questions are more likely to lead to reactions that might seem like lying.

There are also problems with the measurement of sweat by a lie-detector machine used by the FBI, McClatchy found. Many other federal agencies and police departments across the country use the same machine.

The people who give the tests also look at levels of breathing and blood pressure to decide whether someone is lying. But many see the sweat measurement as a really true sign of lying.

The maker of the machine says that the problem is rare. The company also points out that other machines that use the same technology might have the problem as well.

But lawyer Gene Iredale said that the problem could mean that agencies such as the FBI are making decisions in criminal cases based on "completely inaccurate information." The tests are not allowed in court, he noted.

## Polygraph Use Is Widespread

A spokeswoman said the Bureau finds the tests to be  "a relevant and necessary tool." Records show the FBI tests about 13,000 people a year for job screening, criminal investigations and national security inquiries. According to the records, the Bureau has at least a 30 percent failure rate in its job screening. As many as four of every 10 people who apply to be a special agent get turned down because of their test results.

The Bureau is not alone in its reliance on the testing. The Philadelphia Police Department says that it will not hire someone who does not pass its polygraph.

Other police departments say they do not rely entirely on a polygraph test to decide if they should hire someone.

However, even those who don't have a rule barring applicants who failed the polygraph couldn't say what exactly they would do.

"We have to feel comfortable hiring someone," said Kathy Lester, who is in charge of the Sacramento Police Department's hiring. "If we feel somebody is deceptive based on (all) the circumstances, then we can't hire them."

## Failed Test Follows People

James Wedick, a retired FBI agent who is now a private investigator in Sacramento, called the Bureau one of the "worst culprits" in its reliance on the testing. He said he had repeatedly seen highly qualified people turned away who had been excellent law enforcement officers. The result follows them even if they try to apply elsewhere. Police departments and federal agencies often weigh whether someone previously failed, even if they have not tested the person themselves.

"Many of these people work their entire adult lives to get a job with the Bureau," he said. "These are people who haven't done anything wrong and they've got stellar resumes and they're told, 'Sorry. You can't get a job because of the polygraph.' It's ludicrous."

Documents obtained by McClatchy demonstrate that the Bureau is rejecting people even as the applicants insist they have never done anything wrong. The documents also show that some applicants view the rejection as illegal discrimination. In fact, half a dozen applicants who filed the complaints McClatchy obtained thought they were discriminated against because they are African-American.

"I believe I was discriminated against as a black female," wrote one woman who applied to the Memphis, Tenn., FBI office and was told she had failed two polygraphs.

The tester said the woman seemed to be lying about drug use. After she was granted another test, the second tester said she passed. A supervisor overturned that conclusion. In all the cases reviewed, the Bureau countered that the tests showed the applicants were hiding some sort of wrongdoing that was not discovered during the usual background investigation.
