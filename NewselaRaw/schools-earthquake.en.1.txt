YELM, Wash. — Students and geologists huddle around a computer, watching jagged lines scroll across the screen and measuring a mini-earthquake at their school in Yelm.  

The Lackamas Elementary School students are not experiencing an actual earthquake. Their 11- and-12-year-old classmates caused it by leaping into the air together, and landing with a thud that vibrated the ground under their feet.

Geologist Recep Cakir explains that he and his crew are measuring the way seismic waves move through the soil. The scientists work for the Washington Department of Natural Resources and want to estimate how hard the ground will shake in future earthquakes.

The work is part of a pilot project to determine how well several Washington public schools will stand up to a major quake.

## Sizing Up School Safety

The project is evaluating the seismic safety of 15 schools in three districts in the western part of the state. The scientists have a $45,000 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a department of the federal government. In addition, structural engineers are volunteering their time to inspect buildings.

John Schelling works for Washington's Emergency Management Division. He says the bigger goal is to develop a standard process that could be applied to schools across the state. "The time is right to look at the state of the science and really assess how vulnerable one of our most precious assets is -- our kids," Schelling says.

Over the past 25 years, scientists have discovered that the Pacific Northwest is subject to huge earthquakes and tsunamis. An offshore fault called the Cascadia Subduction Zone could cause the disasters. There is also the possibility of powerful, shallow quakes at faults under Seattle, Everett, Tacoma and other Washington cities. 

## Losses Could Be In Billions

Many of the state's schools predate modern building codes that take those hazards into account. The state's Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) used a FEMA model and an estimate of the mix of building types across the state to calculate possible damage. The state found that a magnitude-9 Cascadia quake could possibly cause more than $4 billion in damages and loss of services at school facilities. It could also kill 117 students and staff and injure more than 3,000. Earthquakes are measured on a magnitude scale that compares the size of earthquakes. A magnitude-9 quake would be very strong.

A similar analysis by FEMA estimates half the schools along Washington's coast would suffer medium to high damage. However, no one really knows how widespread the risk is or which schools are in the greatest danger.

## Washington Lagging Others In School Assessments

"Washington is really the only state on the West Coast that hasn't completed a detailed, comprehensive assessment of all school facilities," Schelling says.

California first started evaluating and upgrading schools in the 1930s. British Columbia, Canada, made seismic safety a priority a decade ago and has spent $2.2 billion to strengthen high-risk schools.

In Oregon earlier this year, a survey found that 1,100 school buildings were potentially at a high or very high risk of collapse in a major quake. Oregon's Legislature then set aside $300 million to upgrade schools and other critical facilities.

"I think it's pretty safe to say it's a similar story in Washington," says Cale Ash of Degenkolb Engineers, who's helping coordinate Washington's project and donating time to inspect school buildings. "The two states have similar ages of construction."

## Double Duty As Emergency Shelters

Ash also notes that in addition to keeping kids safe, school upgrades can make sure that the buildings can be used as emergency shelters.

In Washington, the seismic safety of schools is primarily the job of school districts. Thanks to taxes approved by voters, Seattle has retrofitted the majority of its older school buildings and several projects are in the works. In poorer districts there is little money to pay for upgrades. For example, a survey identified seven schools and administrative facilities at high risk of collapse in the city of Aberdeen.

Many districts have not evaluated the seismic safety of their schools. The Washington State Seismic Safety Committee recommended that Washington fund a statewide survey, but the State Legislature failed to act.

## Setting A Baseline For Threats

OSPI recently analyzed earthquake, flood and other natural hazards confronting schools across the state. Among its findings is that 32 schools and school facilities sit in the likely path of a Cascadia tsunami. However, only 25 of the state's 295 school districts have signed on for a more detailed analysis of the threats they face.

Schelling says, "It's important to get a baseline assessment of where we are statewide, so we can understand how pervasive the problems are." He says the state could then pass the information on to districts so they could set priorities.   

During the pilot project, engineers are inspecting each school, looking for structural weaknesses and hazards like bookshelves that are not bolted to the wall. Those observations will be combined with the data that Cakir and his team of geologists are gathering on how solid or shaky the ground is at each site. A report on the pilot project is expected in February.

Expanding the survey program across the state would cost about $13 million and take about eight years, says Tim Walsh, chief hazards geologist for the Washington Department of Natural Resources.
