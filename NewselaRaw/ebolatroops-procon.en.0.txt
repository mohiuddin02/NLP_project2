### PRO: U.S. troops are unrivaled in carrying out humanitarian missions

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama was right to dispatch U.S. military units to help combat an Ebola outbreak in West Africa. But he did it for the wrong reasons.

Obama called it a "national security" mission — a clear misuse of the term. Americans should be wary of Washington's growing tendency to make every project a priority simply by appending "security" to the issue.

National security efforts by design are statist, centralized, top-down activities. So when the government says it wants to focus on climate security, energy security, food security, or any other pet project — what it is really saying is the government plans to step in and take over.

For most of life's challenges and hazards — even those where we might want the government to take some action — we certainly don't want Washington to take over.

True "national security" issues arise due to human-controlled actors — whether states or al-Qaida — that threaten the violent destruction of assets or interests vital to the United States. Other types of challenges — be they bad bugs or bad weather — are just problems to be solved.

The challenge of keeping Ebola from becoming a global problem is not principally a security problem. Helping West Africa deal with Ebola is a humanitarian mission — not a national security deployment.

It is, of course, wholly appropriate for the U.S. to provide humanitarian assistance when we have the means to do so and it does not conflict with America's interest.

America's humanitarian response to the 2004 Tsunami in the Asia-Pacific dwarfed the assistance provided by most countries.

Further, the U.S. military undertakes these kinds of missions quite frequently, both at home and abroad. Be it sandbagging during storms or delivering supplies and rescue services after disaster strikes, our military is skilled at alleviating non-military emergencies. It is not the principal job for our armed forces, but these are appropriate auxiliary missions — tasks to be done on an as-needed and as-available basis.

The right measure of these missions is whether or not they are suitable, feasible and acceptable.

Without question, the West African crisis is a suitable use of U.S. forces. The Pentagon can quickly deploy expertise, support and infrastructure that will help local organizations stop the spread of the disease.

And there's self-interest here as well. The best way to keep more Ebola cases from checking in at the nearest Holiday Inn is to help quell the outbreak at its source. Alternative containment strategies — like banning travel and yanking visas — are much blunter instruments.

The West African deployment also passes the "feasible" and "acceptable" tests. This is not to say the mission poses zero risks to our troops.

Even medical professionals who presumably try to take all the right precautions have caught the disease. But, our troops are disciplined, and they should know the right risk-mitigation measures to take.

They are also brave, courageous and willing volunteers. They understand there is danger going in harm's way. That is part of the job.

Rather than just invoking the name of "national security" and moving on, the White House should have classified the initiative correctly — as a humanitarian mission — and explained the rationale for this auxiliary mission to the American people.

Instead all they got was a banal declaration and a ludicrous promise that Ebola would never appear on U.S. shores.

Words are important, and so are actions. Mislabeling missions, as Obama did earlier in calling our offensive against the extremist group Islamic State a "humanitarian" mission, suggests a dangerous confusion about the nature of true national security risks and the principle function of our military.

It also raises concern about the conduct of this mission. Has the White House organized operations efficiently and sent enough assets to West Africa? Or is the president simply throwing some troops at the problem so he can say he's done something?

### CON: Sending U.S. troops to battle raging Ebola is a rank injustice

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama is using American troops to combat Ebola to show the world he cares enough to send our very best. But our soldiers aren't Hallmark greeting cards.

Like many of Obama's foreign policy initiatives, his Ebola plan has a ready-shoot-aim quality to it.

Here are reasons why our military isn't the best vehicle for rendering assistance:

Our military is already overextended. The president has decided to cut the Army from its wartime high of 570,000 soldiers to 440,000. The administration's Quadrennial Defense Review said this "strains our ability to simultaneously respond to more than one major contingency at a time."

That assessment came before the president announced plans to send 4,000 soldiers to West Africa, a number sure to grow given the president's recent authorization of a National Guard call-up. It was also before military operations were launched against the extremist group Islamic State, a campaign that may ultimately require ground forces.

In light of these developments, Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno recently questioned the wisdom of continuing with the force reduction plan.

Military intervention in West Africa risks a quagmire. Though the media has focused on the military's humanitarian role in the Ebola crisis, it would also likely have a security one.

The Council on Foreign Relations' Janine Davidson noted, "As the disease spreads, so does panic — and panic leads to violence." Maintaining order will pose serious risks.

For one, it would require a significantly greater U.S. commitment than announced so far, stretching our military even further. The World Health Organization forecasts new Ebola cases could rise by 10,000 per week by December. That's a lot of panic and violence to subdue.

For another, it could place our soldiers in an impossible position, such as one in which Liberian soldiers recently found themselves. They had to choose between their safety and the public's when quarantine-triggered violent rioting left four people wounded and one 16-year-old boy dead.

Imagine U.S. soldiers being forced to make the same choice: Having to shoot unarmed, possibly infected Liberian civilians or allow Ebola to spread.

A key difference between this proposed mission and our experience in Iraq is that human beings would be the roadside bombs.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) isn't ready. One-hundred percent of the Ebola patients who contracted the disease on U.S. soil were full-time health care professionals who did so while treating the disease under the guidance of the CDC. The CDC has flubbed its dress rehearsal, and clearly is not ready for the big show.

Militarization of humanitarian aid risks involvement in internal disputes. All three countries at the center of the Ebola epidemic are politically unstable.

Sierra Leone and Liberia have only in recent years emerged from civil wars. Guinea was ruled by a military junta until 2010. Both Liberia and Guinea have canceled upcoming elections. We're told these countries are so unstable that a U.S. travel embargo alone could send them careening into chaos.

"You isolate them, you can cause unrest in the country," said the National Institutes of Health's Anthony Fauci. "It's conceivable that government could fall."

Foreign populations in these circumstances could perceive our military as taking sides in internal disputes. Think Somalia 1993 and you get the idea.

Meanwhile, the Obama administration remains opposed to travel bans, the one measure that might provide Americans some protection.

Our soldiers are being placed at enormous risk all because the president is unwilling — to borrow his own words from another crisis — to "plug the damn hole."
