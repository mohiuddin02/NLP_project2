WASHINGTON â€” While U.S. public school students make up many different races and cultures, their teachers are most likely white.

Almost half the students attending public schools are nonwhite. Meanwhile, fewer than 1 in 5 of their teachers is nonwhite.

New research is calling attention to this. Researchers call it a "diversity gap" at U.S. elementary schools, middle schools and high schools. A group called the National Education Association (NEA) that studies education organized the studies. They want more to be done to help teachers better mirror the students in their classrooms.

Teachers are always pushing their students to do better, said Kevin Gilbert. He is a school district official in Mississippi. It becomes easier for students to believe "when they can look and see someone who looks just like them, that they can relate to," said Gilbert. "Nothing can help motivate our students more than to see success standing right in front of them."

White students would also benefit from having nonwhite teachers, said Ulrich Boser. He is the author of the group's report.

This is even true in a places where there aren't a lot of minority students, he said. "It's important for our social fabric, for our sense as a nation," Ulrich said. Students need to work with "people who think, talk and act differently than them" but still help them do better in class.

## School Populations Are Changing

The government said there were about 3.3 million teachers in American public schools in 2012. It said almost all of them were white, fewer than one-tenth were Hispanic and fewer than one-tenth were black. Almost none of them were Asian.

Students are a different story. In 1993, three out of 10 public school students were minorities. In 2003, minorities made up four out of 10 public school students.

The study's most recent figures show that number is now at about half.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan said most public school students in the United States this fall are expected to be nonwhite. It would be the first time that ever happened.

Hispanics have passed blacks as the largest minority group of teachers. There are also more Hispanic students than African-Americans in the public school system. Hispanics are the largest minority group in the country and the fastest-growing.

Jan Alderson is a high school science teacher in Kansas. She saw the changes at her school.

The school has very few minority teachers, she said. But almost half of the students are minorities. "It's a beautiful blending, it's just teachers who don't have that cultural background."

## More Teachers Needed

Teaching used be one of the only good-paying jobs that African-American college graduates could get, said LaRuth Gray. She works with a group at New York University. Gray tries to improve the quality of education.

Over time, the country integrated, she said. Minorities could get other professional jobs. Education jobs became less attractive and fewer African-American students thought about becoming teachers, she said.

"It's not seen as the ideal career to have," said Gray. Gray also helps the National Alliance of Black School Educators work with the government.

Supporters say it's going to require willingness from leaders for things to change. Most states already are trying to increase the number of minority teachers. The results have been "disappointing," the NEA report said.
