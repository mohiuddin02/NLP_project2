CORDOVA, Md. — Missouri farmer Mike Geske wants a drone.

It might look like a remote control airplane, but for Geske, this high-tech machine is no toy.

Geske has traveled to Maryland to watch a drone demonstration and learn more about how farmers can put these "unmanned aerial vehicles" to work.

He is considering buying a drone to monitor his farm's irrigation pipes — a job he currently pays three men to do. Using a drone instead would save him lots of money on labor and fuel.

Nearby, farmer Chip Bowling tries flying one of the drones. Bowling, president of the National Corn Growers Association, wants to use a drone to help him keep an eye on which of his Maryland fields need extra spraying for pests.

Bobby Hutchison is interested in using drones on his farm, but he doesn't want to buy one himself. He hopes the man he hires to walk his fields and observe his crops will invest in a drone to help make the process more accurate and efficient.

## Small Aircraft Can Replace Human Workers

Farmers are eager to start using drone technology. "I see it very similar to how I saw the computer when it first started," says Hutchison, 64. "It was a no-brainer."

The small, relatively inexpensive vehicles could replace humans in a variety of ways around large farms. Drones can gather details about crops and send updates to sprayers and other farm equipment. Information from drones can lead farm machines to problem spots, reducing the amount of water and chemicals that farmers need to use in other areas.

Farmers might become some the biggest customers for drones. A trade group called The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International says agriculture could account for 80 percent of drones sold for business purposes.

## Drones On Farms Are Taking Off

For years, farmers couldn't take advantage of drones because the government had not established guidelines for how to use them. But now drones are finally starting to take off on farms. Since January, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given more than 50 projects permission to explore agricultural uses for unmanned aerial vehicles.

Companies that put farm drones to work say quick technological improvements have helped their businesses grow.

Bret Chilcott runs AgEagle, a company in Kansas that sells unmanned aerial vehicles and the software to help operate them. AgEagle took its first orders last year, and now several hundred people are on a waiting list for their products.

According to Chilcott, drone technology made a huge leap during just that short period of time.

"Last year, users had to land their aircraft and then take the data to the computer," he says. "Now the data appears on your iPad or hand-held device a few minutes after flight."

## Some Say Drones Will Transform Agriculture

That data could be pictures, 3-D images of plants, temperature readings of crops or animals or other observations. Information like that used to take days to collect — or might not have been collected at all. Now it can be can be gathered in minutes or hours from overhead. In some cases, it can even be combined with information collected by other high-tech farm machinery.

Chilcott believes drones will transform the way farmers raise their crops. "In five years we won't have to blanket a field with chemicals," he says. Instead, drones will show farmers where there are problem spots that need to be treated.

For now, most farmers are still not allowed to operate unmanned aerial vehicles.

The FAA is working on rules that would allow the drones to be used regularly for business while maintaining certain safety and privacy standards. Earlier this year, the FAA proposed a plan that would allow farmers to fly drones that weigh less than 55 pounds. Farmers would have to pass a pilot's test and a background check. They would also need to keep their drones within sight and could only fly them during the daytime.

## Are Drones On Farms Safe?

PrecisionHawk of North Carolina is another company the government has allowed to start experimenting with drones. Right now it is unclear exactly how the business will work. Farmers might hire services that have unmanned aerial vehicles, or every farm might get its own drone. Most likely, it will be a combination.

PrecisionHawk's Thomas Haun says the proposed rules are appropriate. "It's pretty spot on for where the technology is right now," he says.

Some people have concerns about the guidelines. Pilots of crop dusters and other planes that operate around farms worry that the rules do not go far enough to ensure safety.

"We can't see them," says Andrew Moore of the National Agricultural Aviation Association. Moore's group wants unmanned vehicles to include tracking systems or lights to help airplanes figure out where they are.

## Even With Regulations, Many Farmers Ready For Change

Their requests were not included in the FAA proposal, which also poses challenges for eager farmers.

For example, Geske's farm is 2,100 acres, so using drones to monitor all of his irrigation pipes won't be very efficient if he has to keep them within sight. He's still interested, though, because the men he hires now use a lot of fuel and their trucks tear up his land and roads.

"You can wait forever on advancing technology," Geske says.
