The world is struggling with wars, brutality and treason. With all these problems, it will be difficult for the Nobel Peace Prize committee to find a deserving winner, some say.

The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the most prestigious awards in the world. It is awarded to people or groups that have contributed to making the world a more peaceful place.

Where on the planet can a man, woman or organization be found to have lessened the bloodshed and cruelty? The world has seen violence in the usual locations as well as new places.

The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced in Oslo, Norway, on Friday.

Political officials in the Middle East failed this year and last year to stop the violence. The Middle East is a region in Western Asia. The region has seen fighting between Israel and Palestine, as well as a civil war in Syria. It is unlikely that a political official will win the prize.

## Failed Peace Talks In Middle East

John Kerry is an official from the U.S. He attempted to stop the fighting between Israelis and Palestinians but it did not succeed. The conflict goes back a long time, and there recently was deadly fighting in the Gaza Strip.

The 4-year war in Syria has not ended either. Lakhdar Brahimi, a political official for the United Nations (U.N.), tried to bring an end to the Syrian war. The U.N. is an international organization to keep peace around the world. Brahimi held peace conferences to bring the two sides together to discuss a deal, but these did not succeed. He quit in May. His replacement, Staffan di Mistura, has not been able to bring about another peace conference.

Controversial actions have led at times to some people receiving a Peace Prize. In the past, protesters and whistleblowers — people who reveal secrets about the government — have received a Nobel. But most of this year's known controversial nominees have already been passed over.

A former employee of the U.S. government, Edward Snowden, is charged with leaking secrets about the government. Snowden is currently hiding in Russia. His act was praised by some as revealing government secrets. But he was also denounced by others for an act of treason, or betraying his country.

## Record-Breaking Nominations

Despite the lack of obvious deserving recipients, there were a record-breaking 278 nominations this year. It is up by 19 from last year's previous record. Among the nominees are 47 organizations. The Nobel Committee keeps this list secret for 50 years, but nominating individuals and agencies often reveal their nominee to the public.

When there is no individual who stands out, speculators have put forward some names as worthy recipients.

The Peace Research Institute Oslo issues a list of possible winners each year. For 2014, it suggested a Japanese peace group, an independent Russian newspaper and Snowden, the whistleblower.

Japanese People Who Conserve Article 9 is an organization that wants to keep peace. In Article 9 of Japan's constitution, the country promises to avoid military force. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to change the constitution to allow for military force.

Another nominee for the peace prize is the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. The newspaper has criticized the Russian President Vladimir Putin strict policies. Six of the newspaper's journalists have been murdered since the newspaper was founded in 1993.

## An Activist, A Doctor, A President

Other nominees who also have a chance of winning the prize include activist and Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai. She was shot by the Taliban, a terror organization, because she defied their attempts to prevent girls from getting an education. Another possible nominee is gynecologist Denis Mukwege who works as a doctor for females. He has treated thousands of female victims of violence and torture in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country in Central Africa.

Uruguayan President Jose Mujica has also been nominated. He gives away 90 percent of his salary to housing programs for the poor and has legalized marijuana and gay marriage. Another contender for the Peace Prize is Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the top official of the U.N. He has been praised for bringing attention back to climate change in a world widely distracted by war.

One person has long been out of the world's attention. But the Guardian newspaper thought Helmut Kohl of Germany deserves late recognition. Kohl was the chancellor of West Germany in the late 1980s when the country was still divided. He brought the country together peacefully through pro-democracy movements and skilled political discussions.

"Modern-day revolutions rarely end happily," the Guardian newspaper stated, giving examples of failed revolutions in Egypt and Ukraine. "Helmut Kohl was no revolutionary, but the startling revolt that happened on his watch had a happy ending." The newspaper noted that reunited Germany is one of today's great success stories. Germany is Europe's biggest country, biggest exporter, and its engine of growth.

The Berlin Wall that divided Germany fell almost 25 years ago. The Guardian newspaper thinks it would be fitting to honor Kohl with the prestigious Nobel Prize.
