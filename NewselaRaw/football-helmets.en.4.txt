CHICAGO â€” The National Football League on Sept. 5 settled a lawsuit. They had been accused of failing to prevent brain injuries.

The lawsuit may be over, but there is still much confusion over those injuries, called [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions). To get an idea of this, take a look at the Guardian.

The Guardian is a padded cap. Football players can strap it around the outside of their helmets. Its aim is to soften the force of blows to the head.

Elmhurst College football players wear the Guardian during practice. They say it makes a big difference.

## Trying To Increase A Helmet's Protection

"It gets rid of those little small hits you get in practice," said player Nick Spracklen, 20. "It keeps your head fresh, keeps those headaches away. You leave practice without a headache, your whole day is better."

But safety questions still remain. Scientists and others continue to argue over the best way to protect players from head injuries.

Into this storm have stepped a few small companies that sell helmet pads. They say pads are a way to increase protection. So far experts are split: Some believe that extra padding makes sense. Others say stricter testing is needed.

For years, the way football helmets were tested was pretty simple. Companies strap one to a dummy head. Then, they slam the head into a post. If the tests show a fractured skull would be unlikely, the helmet passes.

Such tests are good at showing a helmet's power to prevent fractures. What they don't show is the likelihood of preventing a concussion. No one has figured out how to predict that.

## A Complicated Injury

Concussions are complicated injuries. Also, some people are more likely than others to get a concussion. This is particularly true if they've already been hit in the head.

Such uncertainties led to new ways to protect athletes. One of those ways is the Guardian.

The Guardian is made by Georgia-based POC Ventures. Its inventor is Lee Hanson. Hanson claims the Guardian reduces the force of a hit by one-third.

Hanson admits the Guardian can't prevent concussions altogether. But he says more padding will help players.

Rob Vito does things differently. His company, Unequal Technologies, also sells pads, but these are attached inside a helmet. They strengthen the padding that's already there. Vito mockingly calls that padding nothing but "couch foam."

John Thorne is coach of the football team at North Central College in Naperville. Some of his players started using the Unequal pads this year. However, it's still too soon to tell how well they work.

## How Much Will Extra Padding Help?

"I've been coaching football for 45 years, and I'm always looking for a way to make the game safer," Thorne said. "We're hoping this is a good technology. It seems to make some sense."

Steven Rowson is an engineer who has worked on rules for making helmets safe. He says the idea behind the new products does indeed make sense.

"Adding padding is going to reduce acceleration to the head," he said. "When you reduce acceleration to the head, you reduce the risk of concussion."

But it still not really known just how much the pads can help.

Coach Joe Adam plans to keep Guardians on his players' helmets, though. He said the shells have proven their worth.

"I can just go by results," he said. "In 21 practices, we've had one concussion. I think that's on the lower side for teams in our area."
