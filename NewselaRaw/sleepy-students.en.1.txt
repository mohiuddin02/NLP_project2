CHICAGO — Most weeknights, Nicole Bankowski gets about five hours of sleep. Along with taking four AP classes, Bankowski edits the school newspaper, sings in the choir, and is treasurer of the student council.

Bankowski has so much to do that she usually doesn't start her homework until 10:30 p.m.

"It's probably not the healthiest way to live, but it's the only way to get everything done," said Bankowski, a high school senior.

The new school year has just started, but students are already sleep-deprived — they aren't getting the 8.5 to 9.5 hours a night they need to grow and learn.

## "National Public Health Crisis"

Last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics called on schools to start later so students can get more sleep. The group, made up of doctors who treat children and young adults, called students' lack of sleep "a national public health crisis."

According to Judith Owens, a sleep expert at a children's medical center in Washington, D.C., starting school later in the day is an effective way to reduce the negative consequences of sleep loss.

The pediatricians group recommends that schools start at 8:30 a.m. or later. Today, more than eight out of 10 schools start earlier than that.

Most Chicago-area high schools start at 8 a.m., though some start as early as 7 a.m. Many student athletes have early practices at 6 a.m. For all these students, fatigue is a way of life.

According to researchers, students don't only lose sleep because they're too busy. It's also because of changes in young peoples' bodies. As students start puberty, their internal circadian clocks change, and it can be harder for them to get to bed early.

"The 10-year-old who went to bed at 9 p.m. becomes the 13-year-old who can't get to sleep until 11," Owens said.

## Too Early Lunches?

This shift in sleeping patterns comes at the same time that young peoples' bodies and minds are changing quickly and school is becoming more intense, making it a "perfect storm," according to Owens.

Early school start times also push everything else forward, disrupting family schedules. Students at some high schools have lunchtime as early as 10 a.m. These students come home very hungry, then don't want to eat dinner with the family at a normal time.

"At this age, kids don't talk to you that much — so you look forward to having that one meal together," said Diane Zezulak, the mother of a freshman.

Students may need more sleep, but school administrators say there are many reasons changing school start times is difficult, from bus schedules to parents' commutes.

David Schuler, superintendent of a Chicago school district, explained that starting school later means ending school later. That can cause problems for after-school activities that contribute to a student's success. Sports like softball, soccer, golf and football would be affected by a schedule change.

At one school district in the Chicago area, classes start earlier as students get older. Elementary schools start at 8:15 a.m., middle schools at 8 a.m. and high schools at 7:45 a.m.

## Burning The Candle At Both Ends

The issue of student sleep "is on our radar screen," according to Michelle Fregoso, a district spokeswoman. The district is doing a thorough study of how to best structure students' time during the school day and school year for their learning and well-being, she said.

Studies from the past 20 years have shown that a good night's sleep is crucial for both emotional and physical health. Children who regularly don't get enough sleep have a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and even Alzheimer's, Owens said.

But students today face intense competition: "you snooze, you lose."

Bankowski is taking a full class schedule — including AP calculus, economics, environmental science and literature. She's often burning the candle at both ends — staying up late and waking up early. During her busiest times, she doesn't get to bed until 3 a.m.

"I can't go to sleep until it's all done," she explained. College applications are starting this month, and Bankowski expects to be even more worn-out.

"I have to take my future into consideration," she said. "It's more important than going out or taking a nap."

## Grabbing A Charleston Chew

Matt Shapiro is another sleep-deprived student. President of the student council and a captain of his school's speech and debate team, Shapiro is up at 6 every morning, but he always fights off the fatigue when it hits him in class. "I once nodded off in the third grade … and I never forgot how badly I felt. I never let it happen again."

For Lauren Ward, a high school senior who plays soccer and is on the student council, there's no empty space in her day. Her mother takes her and her brother, a sophomore, to school at 6 a.m. because he has a football conditioning class at that hour.

Ward's secret to staying awake is Charleston Chew candy bars. But even with the candy, it can be tough for Ward to stay alert through the school day.

"Really, it's usually third period before I start feeling like a human," she said.
