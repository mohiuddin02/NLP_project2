WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Samantha Cunningham was traveling to a music festival when she noticed she had left her medicine behind. She has asthma, which makes it hard to breathe sometimes. The medicine could help her breathe and save her life if she had an asthma attack. She was halfway through a five-hour drive and had few choices.

Cunningham could go back home and pick up her inhaler, but she would be late for the concert. She could pay more than $100 to see a doctor and get her medicine on the way. She could also go without it and hope there would be emergency equipment at the festival if she had an asthma attack. That did not seem like a very good idea, she said.

Then a friend suggested American Well. It is a service that lets doctors see patients on video through the Internet or a smartphone. Cunningham downloaded an app, entered her information and soon, she was discussing her problem with Dr. Minoti Parab. She is a doctor who sees only "telemedicine" patients like Cunningham on her home computer.

The app and visit with Dr. Parab took about 30 minutes and cost far less than a regular office visit. Cunningham got a new asthma inhaler at a drugstore and arrived on time for the concert. "It was really a perfect solution," she said.

## Caring And Sharing

It's also a perfect example of telemedicine, using technology to care for patients and share information from far away. Patients, businesses and hospitals all use telemedicine.

Technology is solving more health problems. Robots help treat emergency room patients. New phone apps let users get eye exams with their smartphones.

Telemedicine could cut unnecessary emergency room visits. It could also cut about one-third of doctors' visits, a study found. Telemedicine is expected to grow, as patients get comfortable with it.

Telemedicine could grow even more if Medicare would cover more of the costs. Medicare is the health program for people age 65 and older, paid by the U.S. government. It already pays for some telemedicine services for people who don't live near a doctor.

Some possible laws being talked about in Congress would pay for more telemedicine services under Medicare. Congress has not approved them yet. It is not clear what offering the extra services would cost the government.

## From Video Calls To Phone Apps

"The numbers don't lie," said Dr. Til Jolly. Soon, there will not be enough doctors around the country in all the places we need them, so we have to figure out a better way, he said. Jolly is an officer at Specialists On Call. It is a telemedicine company with more than 200 doctors in 33 states.

Video calls are common in telemedicine, but phone apps are the new frontier. Apps are useful for mental health uses. Centerstone is one telemedicine company that offers mental health services. The company said patients did well using its phone app. The app can spot when patients have signs of emotional trouble and warn the person treating them.

Patients really liked the apps, said Bob Siegmann, a Centerstone official. They felt they could control their mental illnesses better, he said.

Still, it's hard to judge how much the apps helped by themselves, said John Torous, a doctor.

It's hard to decide now what are good and bad apps, Torous said. There are not enough studies about them. "For most of these things, we just don't know," he said.
