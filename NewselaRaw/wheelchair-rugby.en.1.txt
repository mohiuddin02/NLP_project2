AKRON, Ohio — The gladiators' legs were tucked inside their machines. On their hands, they placed a foam-like wrap, followed by gloves and metallic tape, sticky side up, ready to do battle.

Wheelchair rugby was originally called murderball because it's a fierce game with metal-on-metal and even skin-on-floor contact.

The six guys who make up this wheelchair rugby team practice for about three hours each Friday night in Tallmadge, Ohio. All are quadriplegics, meaning they have varying loss of use in all four limbs, mostly from injuries suffered in accidents.

Nathan Gay was 16 years old when he was accidentally shot in the neck by his friend, who was putting away a shotgun after hunting.

Austin Geib was 15 years old when he was injured by a pull-up bar that fell and broke his neck while he was hanging upside down on it.

Adam Sweeney, who was in high school at the time, was injured in a car accident in which his brother was killed. Yianni Thallas was about 20 years old when he got hurt diving off of a roof into a pool.

Stephen Zuravel was only a teenager when he was severely injured in a one-car accident. Jamal Saxton was born with muscular dystrophy.

## Like Demolition Derby

Such serious disabilities can be devastating, because what once was natural, like buttoning a shirt, is now a chore, or impossible. For some, being depressed can take a toll and finding an escape from their suddenly less active lifestyles can be a challenge.

"I have been competitive all of my life, but once I broke my neck, I didn't know what I was going to do," said Geib, now 18, who attends high school online. "This (wheelchair rugby) brought back that competitive edge."

The sport is a mix of basketball and demolition derby, where cars crash into each other.

"It lifts my spirit and makes me feel normal," said Gay, 27, a recent Kent State grad from Streetsboro, Ohio. It was a comment that was repeated by most of his teammates.

Zuravel, 23, decided to attend practice because he was in search of something that would push his physical limitations. "I remember when I was on my way there, I shoved a couple of pieces of pizza down and thought to myself, 'This isn't going to be hard. I've done marathons (on a hand cycle).' So I was pretty cocky going into it. Very quickly I was humbled," said the University of Akron mechanical engineering student from Stove, Ohio, laughing.

"Sometimes when I go to tournaments there are guys twice my age who I'm having a hard time keeping up with on the court," he said.

Adam Sweeney, 34, who has a master's degree in social work from Youngstown State University, said there was only one thing missing after his accident. "I accepted my life right away. I decided that I was still going to get everything that I've ever wanted — a job, a house and a wife. And that's what I have," said Sweeney, a service support administrator for Mahoning County's Board of Developmental Disabilities.

When he heard about rugby, Sweeney thought rugby was the last piece to get his life back to normal.

## The Akron Rhinos

The athletes play for the Buckeye Blitz wheelchair rugby team in Columbus, Ohio. Come next season, they will break off to become their own team, the Akron Rhinos. And that means they are aggressively looking for new players who have some form of impairment in at least three limbs.

Zuravel is known by his teammates as "Queen Bee." That's because of his nudging and encouragement of players to do their best, as well as his drive to continuously persuade others with physical disabilities to give the game a try.

Coach Megan Haas, 24, works at a private school for children with autism in Springfield Township, Ohio. She explained that exercise for those with spinal cord injuries is more important than for those who have never been hurt.

"We can walk everywhere (but) they can't. With a physical disability like they have ... they are dependent on somebody else after their accident," said Haas, who has a master's degree in adaptive physical activity. "It's so awesome to see people with disabilities play at a competitive level and become more independent.

During a recent practice, Sarah Lucas, an independent home care provider for Austin, explained the tape gives the players a better grip. Each player wrapped layer after layer of the stuff around his hands and arms.

"Because most don't have fingers that can grab, the tape helps," said Lucas, of Conneaut, Ohio. Additionally, she added, the sports pre-wrap, gloves and tape keep the skin on their hands and arms protected from injury.

In their armored wheelchairs, the players went onto the court inside, looks of determination on their faces. The Queen Bee kept a close eye on his teammates, as the chairs slammed into each other with a thundering smack.
