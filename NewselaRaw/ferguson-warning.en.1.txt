CLAYTON, Mo. — Lawyers for Michael Brown's family on Thursday morning said the family supports Missouri Governor Jay Nixon's call for calm once a grand jury announces its decision about whether to indict the Ferguson police officer who shot the teen.

The attorneys said the governor's appeal should have been aimed at police as well.

Anthony D. Gray, a Brown family lawyer, repeated the governor's call against "looting and rioting."

Gray added: "Law enforcement should have been equally condemned by the governor for this conduct at the same time he was admonishing the demonstrators. A strong message of zero tolerance should have been conveyed to all."

## Secret Proceedings

Brown, 18, was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. Many in the region fear that the earlier unrest is only a taste of what's to come if the grand jury investigating the case decides not to indict Wilson. The lawyers also said they do not trust the secrecy of the grand jury process. The grand jury's decision is expected by the end of November.

Another lawyer for the Brown family, Benjamin Crump, said Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch had too much control over the grand jury.

"The grand jury will do whatever the prosecutor wants them to do," he said. "This has always been about what evidence he presents and how he presents it."

Because a grand jury convenes in secret, Crump said, important elements of an open court process cannot be witnessed by the general public.

"We won't know what emphasis is placed on a key piece of evidence," he said.

## Calling For Reasonable Restraint

Crump told reporters he wanted to thank police "in advance" for "not having a repeat of the horrific encounters that took place in August." He said police sometimes went too far and violated the rights of peaceful protesters and the media.

Crump said Nixon's job as governor is to ensure laws are enforced equally, but said there have been "questionable outcomes." Gray said police need to use "reasonable restraints" when dealing with demonstrators.

"History is clear," Gray said. Demonstrators who were "simply exercising their First Amendment rights" became "victims of assault rifles being pointed in their face, being manhandled, being tear-gassed, hit by rubber bullets, falsely arrested, including members of the media." These actions occurred before the demonstrators acted "uncivilized," he said.

Crump and Gray spoke less than an hour after Dr. Michael Baden entered the courthouse to testify before the grand jury. Baden, a nationally known medical expert, has examined Brown's body for his family. The grand jury is hearing testimony in the case of Wilson.

Crump criticized the grand jury's secrecy. He insisted that Wilson, 28, should have been charged by prosecutors long ago for the "shooting of an unarmed teenager."

Brown's parents were in Switzerland early in the week to talk to the United Nations, and they did not attend the Thursday news conference in Clayton.

Gray said that the parents wanted to encourage "all of those that support the justice for Mike Brown to remain vigilant yet peaceful, calm and dignified."

But soon, Gray and Crump turned their attention to Nixon.

## Preparing For The Announcement

On Tuesday, Nixon talked about how police are preparing for what might come with the grand jury's announcement. The governor said his office and the area's top law enforcement agencies were "working around the clock" to keep residents and businesses safe while allowing protesters to exercise their rights after the grand jury's decision is announced.

Nixon said the "pillars of safety and speech" will mark how law enforcement responds to any unrest. Nixon said he had yet to call up the Missouri National Guard, but that the guard was "available if we determine it is necessary."

McCulloch has said the grand jury probably would complete its work in mid- to late- November.

Nixon was joined by Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief.

Belmar said the possibility of lives lost as a result of civil unrest keeps him up at night. It was remarkable, he said, that no one died, or was seriously injured, during the height of the protests over Brown's death in August.

Protesters repeatedly have asked Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case, but the governor has refused. Protesters have said McCulloch — who had several family members in the St. Louis police department — is too close to the police to handle the case fairly.
