WASHINGTON — This summer, Greg Hurley is going to Beirut, Lebanon, to teach music.

Hurley is a viola and violin teacher from North Carolina. Every summer for the past five years, he has gone to places that were once war zones. There, he teaches students who already have some musical training. The program is like a summer camp. At the end of his visit, the students put on a concert.

Every year, the U.S. government  helps send musicians, dancers and teachers overseas. They hope the artists will spread goodwill for America around the world.

The idea to send artists abroad got its start during the 1950s. Then, the United States sent jazz greats Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong and others overseas.

The programs have exploded since then. The latest rage is hip-hop.

## They Speak One Main Language: Music

Hurley says the experiences he's had in Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Thailand have been life-changing for him. He thinks the experiences have changed the lives of his students, too.

"It's opened my eyes to other places," he said.

The teaching is slower because the students don't speak English. The teachers must use their hands and the language of music. In the end, it all comes together for the big final concert.

"It's always great," Hurley said. "You've worked so hard to pull it off in two weeks' time. The parents are proud. The kids are proud."

The Beirut program has 100 students, including several from Syria and Iraq.

"I think it brings goodwill toward us, and goodwill happens person by person," Hurley said.

## Hip-Hop Dance Styles Are Popular

Oklahoma City musician Kyle Dillingham plays the fiddle. With his band, Horseshoe Road, he plays Western swing, folk music and bluegrass for foreign audiences. His band recently completed a 16-day tour in Liberia, in West Africa. It performed for Liberia's president. It also played in a place that had no electricity.

"At the heart of what we do is sharing our music with these people," Dillingham said.

Hip-hop artists are the most requested groups by foreign nations. Rodney Hill and a troupe of dancers were in Central Asia earlier this year. In 2012, they performed in Egypt, Israel and Palestinian territories. Hill also held master classes and gave talks.

The surprise may be that hip-hop is now so well-known because of social media. The students were even able to notice differences in styles. West Coast hip-hop has a more laid-back feel than East Coast hip-hop, Hill said.

"They knew it on YouTube and multimedia," Hill said.

## He Wrote The Book

Mark Katz, a music professor, is leading a new two-year program for the government. It's all about hip-hop.

Katz, who has written a book about hip-hop DJs, says hip-hop is now global.

Katz has taken hip-hop teams — disc jockeys, rappers, beat makers and dancers — to India and Serbia.

In India, Katz said, the students loved everything about the experience.

"They meet Americans," he said. They get a better "view of what Americans are like," Katz said. "The idea is they will think positively of the U.S."
