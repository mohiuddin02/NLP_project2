FORT WORTH, Texas â€” The story of how Rose Will Monroe became famous didn't start off well. Her husband was killed in a car wreck. She piled her son and daughter into a bus in 1942 to go look for work.

She was trying to escape being poor. Monroe was determined to find work at the Willow Run airplane plant in Ypsilanti, Mich. She wanted to fly a plane. But with two children, she wasn't allowed.

Monroe was a "tomboy" daughter of a carpenter, who built things with wood. She landed a job at the airplane plant. She used a 6.8-pound tool called a rivet hammer. It puts rivets into planes to hold them together, like nails do.

Monroe was just one of many women workers during World War II. She came to represent them all. Monroe became "Rosie the Riveter," symbolizing the hardworking women who built planes. Monroe and her co-workers built 8,685 bomber planes. That's about one about every 56 minutes. These women who worked in plants became known as "Rosies." They helped win the war.

## A Mix Of Many Women

Another plant where women built planes was in Fort Worth, Texas. It's a long way from Ypsilanti. But "Rosies" in Fort Worth did just as well.

They built 1,803 planes at the plant there. The plant is now run by Lockheed Martin Corp. About 30,000 people worked there during the war. Lockheed Martin isn't sure how many were women.

"Rosie the Riveter" was really a mix of many women. She was first popularized by a song. Soon, "Rosie" came to represent all women defending the country. "There were quite a few faces of Rosie," said Victoria Croston. She is Monroe's daughter. She told her mother's story in honor of Women's History Month on March 20.

Geraldine Hoff Doyle was the strong-armed model for the "We Can Do It" picture. She only worked for a few weeks at a plant owned by Westinghouse Electric Corp. Doyle played the cello. She realized she could hurt her hands working in the factory, Croston said. So, she stopped.

The drawing wasn't well known during the war. But it became famous in the 1980s as symbol of women seeking more work, promotion and better pay.

There was nothing glamorous about the hard work during the two years Monroe worked at the plant. During the week, her son and daughter stayed at a co-worker's home. Monroe lived in workers' housing at the plant.

## Inspiring Today's "Rosies"

After going back home, she had a number of jobs before she became a home builder in Indiana. She also lived out her dream of flying in 1972. She later taught her daughter to fly.

Monroe's story is inspiring for today's "Rosies."

The "Rosies" led the way for women who work at companies that build planes. Women make up 2,667 of Lockheed Martin's 12,500 workers in Fort Worth. Among them are Lorraine Martin, head of the F-35 plane program in Fort Worth. Janet Nash is in charge of building F-35 planes. Another woman, Marillyn Hewson, is the head of the company.

"The work they did was incredible. Can you imagine holding that 6.8-pound rivet hammer for eight hours?" said Nash. She noted that a rivet hammer now weighs 2.5 pounds. Nash's grandmother was a "Rosie." She worked in a plant during World War II.

"Those Rosies, when they went home, they were tired," said Nash. She started working at Lockheed 32 years ago. Now she is one of 12 women near the top of the company. She is the boss of about 2,000 people who work at the plant building F-35s.

Women's jobs in her business "have changed a lot since I started," Nash said. She was the first woman in charge of producing planes. When you are the first of something, "you want to make sure you do the right things," she said.
