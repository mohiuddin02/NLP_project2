School sports are not free. Children can only join teams if their parents pay money to the schools. The money that is owed is known as a fee.

A new study shows that sports fees cause a serious problem. Children who want to play sports are not able to if their parents cannot afford the fees. The children may end up being less healthy.

## A Big Problem

The new study found a big difference between poor and rich families.

Around half of the richer families had a child who played school sports. The story was very different for poorer families. Only 3 in 10 had a child playing school sports.

Sarah Clark is an expert on children's health. Sports are a fun way for kids to exercise, she said. "They're with their buddies. They're learning teamwork."

Playing sports is certainly good for children's health. Regular exercise helps prevent kids from putting on too much weight. Being very overweight can cause serious health problems.

## Can't Pay? Can't Play

The new study found that fees are keeping many children from playing sports. Parents whose children were not playing sports were asked why they were not. One in 7 said the cost of fees was a reason.

Sports fees are also becoming a bigger problem. Fewer poor students are playing school sports than in 2012. Even students from richer families are playing sports less.

Many parents said their children were playing sports less because of the fees. Only half as many parents said the same thing in 2012.

## Equipment Costs Even More

Clark said that schools do sometimes lower fees for students who don't have enough money. However, some students who would like to play sports do not say anything about it. They know money will be a problem. So they do not even try out for a team.

The average school sports fee is $126 for each child. However, some parents pay more than $400 for each child. Fees go up a lot when the cost of equipment and travel is included.

Clark has two boys of her own. Both played several different high school sports. She has experienced the high cost of school sports too.

"I remember I hit $1,000 in fees before Christmas" one year, she said.
