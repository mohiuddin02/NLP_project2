Alex Rodriguez's fall from the ranks of baseball royalty hit bottom on Aug. 5. Major League Baseball suspended him for using performance enhancing substances. The ban covers 211 games — the rest of this season and the entire 2014 campaign.

Rodriguez was once expected to become baseball's all-time home run king. Now, he will forever be remembered as the central figure in one of the game's worst scandals.

Twelve other players were given 50-game suspensions. They all had a connection with Biogenesis, the Miami-area clinic that provided players with banned substances from 2009 until last year. The League says the New York Yankees slugger was one of them.

Rodriguez, 38, is a three-time most valuable player (MVP) and fifth on the all-time home-run list. He can still suit up and play while he appeals the ban. The announcement came as Rodriguez returned to the big-league lineup after months of rehab for a serious hip injury.

## All-Stars Caught In Probe

"The past seven months have been a nightmare — probably the worst time of my life,'' the third baseman and Miami native said. His voice cracked as he spoke about returning to the game during a news conference in Chicago.

"I am thrilled and humbled to have an opportunity to put on this uniform again and to play Major League Baseball again," he said.

The League's announcement on Monday ended a lengthy and hard-hitting probe. MLB offered to pay witnesses to help gather evidence against players suspected of cheating. Ultimately, it persuaded the clinic's founder, Anthony Bosch, to cooperate.

Bosch turned over material including emails, ledgers and phone records, that allegedly confirmed ballplayers were doping in violation of the players' labor contract. Most of the evidence has not been made public.

The case also caught All-Stars Nelson Cruz, Jhonny Peralta and Everth Cabrera. Some are calling the punishments the most sweeping since the 1919 Black Sox scandal, which involved a scheme to rig the World Series.

"We pursued this matter because it was not only the right thing to do, but the only thing to do," Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said.

## "I'm Fighting For My Life"

Most of the players negotiated the terms of their suspensions over the past month. They chose to admit responsibility, sit out their suspensions immediately, and return as quickly as possible to the diamond.

Rodriguez had vowed from the beginning to fight the allegations.

"I'm in the toughest fight of my life and it's not going to get easier,'' he said Monday. "I'm fighting for my life.''

He declined to answer questions about the use of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). In the past, he has said he had not used PEDs since his days as a Texas Ranger.

The League says that he kept using testosterone and human growth hormone (HGH), however. Testosterone is a hormone and HGH is a protein. Athletes take both to try to build muscle, but both have potentially dangerous side affects, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Rodriguez's punishment was also based on his effort to cover-up and obstruct baseball's investigation, the League said.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami last week said it was conducting a criminal investigation into the clinic. It is looking at the possible illegal sale and distribution of drugs, including to high school athletes. It is possible that Rodriguez and other players could be made to testify before a grand jury, if the case rises to that level.

## A $275 Million Contract

Rodriguez has a $275 million contract and is the highest-paid player in baseball. He previously admitted taking PEDs when he played for the Rangers in 2001-03. This was after the results of a confidential drug test were leaked. But has never been disciplined.

Rich Hofmann, Rodriguez's high school coach at Westminster Christian in Miami, said it was a sad day. "Each one of us, depending on where we are in our lives, have decisions to make and we have to live with them. Unfortunately, he has to live with his and that will be" what he is remembered for.

Rodriguez had been rehabbing with a Yankees minor league team until Monday's call-up to the majors. He accused MLB and the Yankees of trying to end his career so that the team won't have to pay him the balance of his contract, estimated at about $60 million.

Though the players union has helped the MLB in its effort to clean up the sport, Executive Director Michael Weiner said the union would defend Rodriguez. Weiner said Selig did not "act appropriately'' in his case, but did not elaborate.

The scandal broke in late January. One of Bosch's partners, Porter Fischer, went to Miami New Times with records containing the names of major leaguers and other athletes who were buying steroids, testosterone and other prescription-only substances from the clinic. After the newspaper published the story, the League launched an all-out effort to build cases against the players.

Other players who received 50-game suspensions in addition to Cabrera, Cruz and Peralta were: Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Antonio Bastardo and New York Yankees catcher Francisco Cervelli.

The latest suspensions follow the July 22 ban of Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, who was suspended for the rest of this season.
