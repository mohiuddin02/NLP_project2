Some soccer players use their head to hit the ball. If a player heads the ball too hard, they can harm themselves. People used to think that heading the ball was the main way soccer players injured their heads and brains. A brain injury is called a concussion. Now scientists think many more concussions happen when players run into each other. Concussions also happen when players are too rough to each other.

The scientists learned this by getting information from soccer coaches. They looked at 100 high schools across the nation. Many soccer players participated in the research.

For every 10 boys, about 7 got a concussion from rough play. Among girls, it was about 5 out of 10. The number was smaller for heading. Only 3 out of 10 boys got a concussion from heading. For girls, it was 2 out of 10.

## Make Soccer Safer By Stopping Rough Play

Dawn Comstock is a scientist. She works at a university in Colorado. She thinks it is important to make the game safer.

She says coaches need to make sure rough play is not allowed.

The scientists learned something else, too. Girls were more likely to get concussions playing soccer than boys.

No one is sure why. Boys' necks may be stronger. Their heads are less shaken by a bang.

## Girls Are More Likely To Report Their Injuries

Also, girls are more likely to tell their coaches if they bang their heads. Boys might not always tell.

More people play soccer in the United States today. It was not always this way. In the past not as many people played. They preferred football or baseball. Back then, only boys played soccer, too.

Today, boys and girls in high school can play on soccer teams.

Soccer matches have become rougher. More players are hurting their heads. Comstock says the best way to stop concussions is to not allow rough play.

## Choose Good Coaches Who Keep Soccer Safe

Parents need to make sure kids have good coaches. The coaches should not allow rough play, she says.

There is a chance of kids getting hurt while playing soccer. Still, playing soccer is worth it. Sports are good for health, Comstock says.

"We want more kids to play sports. We just want to keep them as safe as possible."
