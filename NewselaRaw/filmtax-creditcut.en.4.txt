WASHINGTON â€” Many U.S. states give special offers to movie companies to get them to shoot movies in their states. Now some states think the offers cost them too much money. The offers are called tax credits. The credits let movie companies pay lower taxes to the states.

Louisiana is one example. A movie with Mark Wahlberg is going to be filmed there. People who live in the state may be thrilled to see the star. But state officials wonder if the tax credits make sense.

Louisiana was the first state to offer tax credits. It started them in 1992. Now, 39 states offer tax savings for movie and television companies.

## Movies May Bring More Jobs

The tax credits are also called incentives. Some people think states should offer incentives. They say people in the state get jobs when a movie is made. Workers like carpenters and drivers get hired by movie companies. Other people don't think the states should offer incentives. They say those jobs do not last. They say many studies show that states never make back the tax money they give away with the credits.

The Louisiana House voted this month to set a limit on film tax credits. The governor still has to decide if he wants to sign the law. The law would offer only $200 million a year. Right now there is no limit. The state does not have enough money to run itself for the whole year.

Other states also are looking at reducing film tax credits. Some may get rid of them completely.

In Massachusetts, Governor Charlie Baker called for ending the state's tax credits. Its program offers $80 million in film tax credits a year. He wants to use the money for a tax credit for poor people instead.

## California Wants To Keep Film Work

Other states are actually increasing the incentives they offer.

California is worried that other states are using tax credits to attract moviemakers away from the state. So, last year it tripled the money available for movie companies. It now offers $330 million.

Movie companies shop for the best tax deals. They make states compete against each other.

For example, Netflix's "House of Cards" last year threatened to stop filming in Maryland. Then the state agreed to keep giving more tax credits. The state gave out $62.5 million in credits between 2012 and this year. Most of the credits went to "House of Cards" and HBO's "Veep."

Todd Lewis works on a film being made in Louisiana. He said tax incentives are almost the first thing movie producers think about when deciding where to shoot. Lewis said Louisiana's incentives are especially good.

A group called the Louisiana Budget Project looked at the tax credits Louisiana offered. It said the state paid $231 million in credits in 2011-12. The state has paid more than $1 billion in the past 10 years. The study said the spending was a bad idea. It said that taxpayers have paid $60,000 for every movie job that was created.

But a group representing moviemakers disagreed. It said that in 2013 movie companies supported 10,800 jobs in the state with their spending.
