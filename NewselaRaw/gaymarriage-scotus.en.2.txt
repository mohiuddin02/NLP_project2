WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court expanded same-sex marriage in the United States Monday, effectively making gay marriage legal in 30 states. Unexpectedly and without comment, the justices decided not to hear appeals from five states seeking to prohibit gay and lesbian marriages.

As Chief Justice John Roberts began the court's new term, he did not say a word about the issue. His silence frees gay and lesbian people to marry in those five states. The states are Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.

Same-sex couples in six other states should be able to get married soon. The states are Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming. All of these states tried to ban same-sex marriage. In each case, federal appeals court judges ruled that the states could not discriminate against gay people by preventing them from getting married.

However, the appeals court rulings were put on hold while the Supreme Court decided whether to hear the cases or not. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the U.S. and its decisions are final, meaning no one can appeal them.

## Court's Ruling Not Nationwide

The Supreme Court's action did not make same-sex marriage legal across the entire country. Still, those 11 states would bring to 30 the number of states where same-sex marriage is legal. Same-sex marriage is also legal in the District of Columbia.

Evan Wolfson is the president of Freedom to Marry, a same-sex marriage advocacy group. He called on the high court to "finish the job" and make same-sex marriage legal through the U.S. Wolfson said the court's delay in letting gay people marry  "prolongs the patchwork of state-to-state discrimination." He said it's harmful and insulting that gay people in so many states are not allowed to get married.

Ed Whelan is with the Ethics and Public Policy Center. The group opposes same-sex marriage. He criticized the Supreme Court for not hearing the appeals of the five states and called the court "irresponsible." Whelan said that so many states have same-sex marriage that the court would have a hard time eventually banning it.

The situation was changing rapidly Monday in many states.

— In Virginia, marriage licenses could be given to same-sex couples as early as Monday afternoon.

— In North Carolina, lawyers for same-sex couples planned to ask a judge to allow same-sex marriage.

— In Oklahoma, one of the largest counties will give marriage licenses to same-sex couples as soon as it receives an order from the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

## Both Sides Say Settle The Issue

People on both sides of the issue had expected the justices to decide gay marriage cases this term.

They both say that the justices have an obligation to settle an issue of such national importance. That responsibility should not be left to lower court judges. Because the Supreme Court did not hear the cases, these lower court judges made the decision.

Two other federal appeals courts could issue decisions any time in same-sex marriage cases. These appeals courts are in Cincinnati and San Francisco. Judges in the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit are weighing pro-gay marriage rulings in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. They seem more likely to support state bans on gay marriage than the appeal court judges in San Francisco. The judges in San Francisco will decide whether Idaho and Nevada can ban gay marriage.

James Esseks is with the American Civil Liberties Union. He thinks the Supreme Court would hear a case if a lower court upholds a state's ban on same-sex marriage.

For the Supreme Court to hear an appeals case, four of the nine justices must vote to take it up. However, for a ruling in a case, a majority of at least five justices out of the nine is needed. It's not known how many justices voted to hear the gay marriage appeals case.

Four of the justices take a more liberal approach to issues, like gay marriage, and four justices take a more conservative approach. Each group tends to vote the same way. Justice Anthony Kennedy is more or less in the middle. It appeared that neither side of the court wanted to take up the issue of gay marriage at this time. It also may be that Kennedy did not want to rule on same-sex marriage now. He would likely cast the deciding vote and break the tie.
