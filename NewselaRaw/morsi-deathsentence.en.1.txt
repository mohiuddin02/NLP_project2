CAIRO — On Saturday a Cairo court sentenced former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi to death. Morsi was accused of conspiring with foreign religious extremists to break out of prison and overthrow the Egyptian government.

The verdict marks a stunning blow to the pro-democracy revolt that sprang up in Egypt four years ago. At the time, thousands of Egyptians rose up against a corrupt police state. The president at the time was named Hosni Mubarak, and he was a brutal leader. Many of the people who were against his leadership, including Morsi, were Muslim. Morsi is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is both a religious and a political group.

Security forces had arrested Morsi during the 18-day rebellion in 2011. He escaped from prison several days later. He was then elected president in the country's first free and fair democratic election in 2012, before Egypt's military forced the Islamist leader out of office in a dramatic coup d'état a year later.

## 2011 Revolt Now Seen As Criminal

Saturday's verdict appeared to criminalize the events of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. The court claimed that Morsi and fellow Islamists conspired with foreign Islamist groups to escape incarceration and stage a violent revolt against the state.

More than 100 other people were accused, most of whom are not in Egyptian custody, and were also sentenced to death on the same charges. In a separate case, 16 other defendants were given the death penalty. They were accused of leaking state secrets to Iran while Morsi was in power. The judge in those cases did not sentence Morsi, postponing his final verdict until next month.

"Today will be remembered as one of the darkest days" in Egypt's history, Amr Darrag, a senior Brotherhood official and former member of Morsi's cabinet, said in an email. Darrag is living in Turkey to avoid prison.

## "Lies, Hearsay And Paranoid Conspiracy Theories"

Saturday's judgment was based on "lies, hearsay and paranoid conspiracy theories," the statement said. It is "another deeply disturbing attempt to permanently erase democracy" in Egypt, Darrag said.

In recent months, Egyptian courts have sentenced hundreds of people to death in a series of mass hearings that rights groups have said defy international standards for fair trials. Tens of thousands have been imprisoned.

Morsi's death sentence marks a stunning turnaround for the Islamist leader and the Brotherhood group from which he hails. The movement secured a majority in Egypt's parliament in 2012. Morsi's presidency had offered hope that the country could break the military's decades-long control of government.

However, Morsi proved to not be an effective leader. While he granted himself sweeping powers, he failed to bring state institutions under his control. When massive crowds took to the streets to demand Morsi's resignation in June 2013, Egypt's defense minister and current president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, ordered his arrest.

El-Sissi then presided over a widespread crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and others who opposed his rule.

Last month, another Egyptian court sentenced Morsi to 20 years in prison. It charged him with inciting violence against protesters of his government in 2012.

## Charges Included Foreign Connections

Saturday's ruling found Morsi guilty of a supposed grand conspiracy. He was accused of working with operatives from Iran, as well as foreign fighters from both Palestine and Lebanon, who want to push out Egypt's government and make the Muslim Brotherhood more powerful.

The court alleged that Muslim Brotherhood operatives were trained by fighter groups and Iran inside Gaza, a strip of land bordering Egypt and Israel. It said they later used their expertise to stage the prison break north of Cairo. The court also said that Morsi and the other accused were "looting poultry and livestock" from prison grounds. Thousands of prisoners around the country escaped during the uprising four years ago, after Egyptian security forces withdrew from the streets in the face of a popular revolt.

Because the court's proceedings were closed to the media, it is unclear what proof the court had to prove such a conspiracy. Some of the people charged included fighters who had been jailed in Israel or were dead at the time.

Only 27 defendants appeared in court Saturday. Morsi arrived smiling and wearing a blue prison uniform.

As the verdict was read, Morsi and the other defendants chanted against the military.
