CARACAS, Venezuela â€” Helena Siso spent hours in line to buy groceries. She did not know why the stores were short on groceries and she did not care. She just wanted the government to do something about it.

Siso said it can drive a person crazy. She spent three hours in line to buy toilet paper and she had to come back the next day to get corn flour. She said she does not want the government to give her anything. She just wants the government to save her from the long lines.

## President Didn't Say Much

Many Venezuelans were angry after a speech by their president, Nicolas Maduro. He had no solutions to fix Venezuela's weak economy. The government is running low on money, and people are having a hard time buying things they need to live. Maduro defended how Venezuela's socialist government is handling things.

In a socialist economy, the government owns many businesses. People cannot buy and sell things on their own easily. The government sets prices for many items, including food. Venezuela has been a socialist country since Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998. He opposed the United States government. He also took over many Venezuelan businesses. Maduro was Chavez's vice president and became president after Chavez died in 2013. Maduro has continued most of Chavez's plans.

## Groceries Are Expensive

Venezuelans have to wait in long lines for sugar, cooking oil, soap, rice and other things that are in short supply. Meat can be particularly hard to get. Last year, the price of food and other items people need to live went up faster than anywhere else in Latin America.

Experts believe Venezuela's economy will get worse this year. They blame a drop in the price of oil. Venezuela is a huge oil producer. It sells oil in other countries to help its economy. But the price of oil has dropped by half in the past few months, so it will make less money this year.

Maduro defended the socialist system in his speech. He said it is fair because it spreads money around so everyone gets some. Maduro blames the United States for his country's economic problems. He claims the United States is producing more oil to make Venezuela's oil worth less and hurt the government.

A construction worker named Ramon Diaz was standing in line at a supermarket in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. He said that many items such as milk never get to the government stores where they are sold at fixed prices. Instead, thieves steal them before they get to stores. Then they sell them on the black market at three times the government price.

Siso said the lines are getting longer and tougher, as people get more angry. She said she will not go shopping in her neighborhood. The "law of the jungle" rules there, she said. People push, shove and punch to take everything and leave nothing for the rest, she said.

## Times Will Remain Tough

Jose Delgado, a janitor, was also standing in line. But he was one of the few people who defended the government. He said the stores are short of items because people buy more than they need, so everything runs out fast.

Delgado is one of the many people who supported the late Hugo Chavez and still supports the government. Many Venezuelans said tougher times have not turned them against Maduro.

President Maduro said the minimum wage for workers will go up. The minimum wage is the least someone can get paid for doing a job. He also announced more scholarships for high school and college students so they can afford school.

The higher minimum wage did not impress many Venezuelans, who said it will not be enough.

Carlos Frias was not thinking about that as he stood in line at a drug store. He said he spends every day standing in line for milk and diapers. The country is broke and Venezuelans have to deal with it, he said.
