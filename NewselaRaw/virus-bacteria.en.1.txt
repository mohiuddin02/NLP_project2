LIVERMORE, Calif. — Imagine this: Your head aches, you're congested and simply getting out of bed is a chore. You pay a visit to your doctor, and within minutes he knows precisely which virus or bacteria is causing the symptoms, allowing him to prescribe the right treatment.

How does he find out so quickly and easily what ails you? By using a simple cheek swab, like a Q-tip, that he places in a tiny box.

Yes, this scene would be right at home in the "Star Trek" sick bay. But it may become normal in real-world clinics within the decade, according to Lawrence Livermore Laboratory chemical engineer Elizabeth Wheeler.

Wheeler's team of engineers, biologists and chemists is developing a method to recognize disease-causing pathogens quicker than ever before. The key: obtaining the bacteria or virus DNA and rapidly copying it so there's enough to identify what's causing your illness.

"It's basically like you're Xeroxing it," Wheeler said. "Once you've got enough of it, you can detect it."

## Heating And Cooling The Sample

The technique — called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) — isn't a recent phenomenon. Discovered in 1983 by Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis, it's been used for identifying human remains, food safety, and detecting bacteria.

Just as you learned in science class, DNA has two strands. With PCR, a special enzyme is added and the DNA is heated up to 94 degrees Celsius (202 degrees Fahrenheit). The strands break apart and the enzyme "fills in" the opposite strand.

The process involves alternately heating and cooling the sample in a device the size of two toasters stacked on top of each other. By doing so, it doubles the amount of genetic material with each cycle. In about three minutes it can run 30 cycles. That's how many times you would have to amplify the DNA to a size where it can be identified.

Wheeler, whose husband is a physician, said the project's goal is to have Fast PCR devices in every doctor's office. This would allow patients to submit a sample and have it processed while the doctor goes through his checkup routine. Before the exam is over — in about the time it takes to cook a bag of microwave popcorn — the physician would be able to decide on appropriate treatment.

"Everyone's been frustrated when you go in and it's like, 'is it a virus or a bacteria,'" Wheeler said. "You could run this and they can say, 'Yep, you have a bacterial infection, here's the antibiotic,' or 'it's a virus, go home and rest.'"

Dr. Stephen Bustin, a British scientist, literally wrote the book on the PCR technique. While reactions once took hours, Bustin said they're now routinely done in tens of minutes.

The amplification now takes only three minutes, but other preparations make the whole process longer. Within a year or two, he adds, getting results in less than 10 minutes will become commonplace.

"This opens up all kinds of diagnostic possibilities," Bustin wrote. These include "carrying out PCR evaluations of a patient's sample whilst (the patient is) talking to the doctor."

## Detecting DNA Even Earlier

Working on Fast PCR since 2010, Beer's team was responsible for speeding up the amplification part to less than three minutes. In that technique, cold water is passed over a porous copper platform holding the microscopic samples, rapidly dropping the temperature to 55 degrees C (131 degrees F). The platform is heated back up and the cycle repeats 30 times. The results are then matched to a known genetic signature.

As speedy as the procedure is now, Wheeler thinks the team can go even faster.

The Livermore researchers' next step is integrating optics into the device to detect the DNA even earlier, and finding more practical options to time-consuming sample preparation. Wheeler said the pieces are already in place to allow the entire process to be done in less than 10 minutes.

Dr. John Leamon, a biological researcher focused on health care, said rapid PCR could be a valuable tool in other areas where time is a key factor. It could be used to detect pathogenic agents during military conflicts, he said, or to monitor food supplies and crops. Scientists could take a food sample, test it for harmful bacteria within minutes, and remove the tainted supply before it even ships.

Lab officials believe it could be useful during outbreaks of diseases like SARS. Scientists would be able to test passengers entering the country within minutes, rather than quarantining them for days. SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, is a serious form of pneumonia.

Lab spokesman Steve Wampler said two unnamed companies have already expressed interest in licensing the technology. A consumer version of the device, he added, would take at least five to seven years to bring to market.
