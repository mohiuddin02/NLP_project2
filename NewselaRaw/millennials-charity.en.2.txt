PITTSBURGH, Pa. — Earlier this month, on the national day of charity known as Giving Tuesday, about 100 employees of Dick's Sporting Goods showed up at the Sarah Heinz House in Pittsburgh. They were there to clean, paint and decorate for the holidays.

Millions of people worldwide marked Giving Tuesday by making online donations to charities. Meanwhile, the group from Dick's worked side by side at the Sarah Heinz House with middle-school students who participate in clubs, lessons and other activities at the nonprofit facility. The group from Dick's included many people in their 20s and 30s, who are known as millennials.

"They completely cleaned and beautified gyms, kitchen areas and classrooms," said Deb Hopkins. She is the executive director of Pittsburgh Cares. The organization matches businesses and individuals with volunteer opportunities.

Being involved in a hands-on activity that helps a group in need is often as fulfilling for millennials as giving money, she said. "(Millennials) really want to see a direct impact."

## Giving From The Ground Up

Giving Tuesday was launched in 2012. It was started as something different from the shopping frenzy between Thanksgiving Day and and the following Monday, which is called Cyber Monday because of all the online shopping done that day. This year, Giving Tuesday generated an estimated $116.7 million from nearly 700,000 donors, according to its founders, the 92nd Street Y in New York.

It also sparked a wave of volunteerism like the spruce-up at Sarah Heinz House. According to a study released this month, millennials are more likely to give when charities provide such on-the-ground opportunities.

Millennials see giving their time, skills and network to a cause as just as important as giving money, said Derrick Feldmann. He is the lead researcher for The Millennial Impact Project. The project studied how nine nonprofits conducted their Giving Tuesday fundraising campaigns.

Based in Indianapolis, the project was launched in 2009 to study millennial behavior. Its research on millennial giving is funded by the Case Foundation, which is run by philanthropists Steve and Jean Case. Steve Case was a co-founder of America Online.

The project decided to study Giving Tuesday, said Feldmann, because it is a relatively new digital-based program. It has relied mainly on social media to generate contributions.

"It looks and feels like millennials should be a part of it and would be highly involved … so we try to find out whether that's true or not."

## Going Beyond Social Media

The researchers recruited nine nonprofits. These included Rutgers and Otterbein universities, the University of North Carolina and WBEZ public radio in Chicago. They studied the nonprofits' marketing efforts leading up to Giving Tuesday and how they promoted it the day of the event.

Nonprofits that used digital-only campaigns limited to emails and social media posts "didn't get the highest response rate" from millennials, Feldmann said.

But when nonprofits linked Giving Tuesday to actual events, they got the biggest response from millennials, he said.

The University of North Carolina (UNC) offers one example. A student-giving council and a young graduate leadership council hosted on-campus Giving Tuesday events.

UNC created its own Twitter hashtag, "#TarHeelTuesday," for the day. It also encouraged students to volunteer with a student ambassadors program and to share their photos on Snapchat.

The university raised about $236,000. Its goal was only  $150,000. About $23,000 came from millennials, who accounted for 29 percent of all donors.

A combination of digital, community and self-organizing strategies that let millennials "own that day and experience it firsthand will get a good response," Feldmann said.

## Learning The Habit Of Giving

In addition to the Dick's event at Sarah Heinz House, Pittsburgh Cares organized other Giving Tuesday activities, including some involving sorting and packaging toys for the U.S. Marine Corps' Toys for Tots program.

An evening event at the regional Toys for Tots storage facility was designed for families. The idea was to let children help their parents choose and pack toys for boys and girls in need.

"Millennials very much want their children involved," Hopkins said. "I get four or five calls a day from people looking for volunteer opportunities for kids as young as 5 years old."

The idea of linking giving to hands-on participation in charitable causes is not limited to millennials, though, she said.

"I wouldn't say they want that experience more than other people. They are more tech savvy, but we see a tremendous amount of activity among baby boomers and our retired and senior volunteers."
