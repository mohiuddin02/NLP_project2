WASHINGTON —  More than a million drones have been sold in the past few years. A growing number of the unmanned aircraft, however, are turning up in the skies near airports and airliners, raising the risk of a collision.

Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). They are piloted either by onboard computers or remotely by a person on the ground.

There have been daily drone sightings near planes, helicopters and airfields, aviation officials said.

The number of sightings is a sharp increase from just two years ago when drone reports were still unusual.

## "So Far We've Been Lucky"

Many of the reports are filed with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by pilots and airport officials.

The reports show the difficulty the FAA faces trying to control drones. They pose a great danger to aircraft. If one collided with a plane or was sucked into an engine it could cause a crash. Small drones usually are not visible on radar to air traffic controllers. Drones made of plastic are especially difficult to spot.

The FAA's near-total ban on their use has been mainly ignored. Real estate agents use them to take overhead pictures of houses for sale and farmers use them to monitor crops. Rules to expand the use of drones by businesses are expected to be proposed before the end of the year.

"It should not be a matter of luck that keeps an airplane and a drone apart," said Rory Kay. He is a former chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association safety committee. "So far we've been lucky."

## Near Misses

The FAA requires drones and model aircraft to fly under 400 feet in altitude. People operating them must keep the aircraft within sight and at least 5 miles away from an airport. Small drones often are hard to tell apart from model aircraft.

Businesses and government officials operating drones must get special permission from the FAA to fly them.  Exceptions are made for some government drones. The military flies drones in remote areas.  The government Customs and Border Protection department flies high-altitude drones along the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada to watch for people trying to cross the borders illegally.

In March, Jim Williams, who heads the FAA drone office, caused a stir. He told a group of drone manufacturers that an airplane nearly collided with a drone over Tallahassee, Florida. The pilot of the Canadair Regional Jet reported a camouflage-painted drone at an altitude of about 2,300 feet. The FAA has not been able to find the drone or identify its operator.

## Other Recent Incidents

— The pilots of a plane flying at about 10,000 feet reported seeing at least one drone pass less than 500 feet above the plane. The drone was moving slowly toward Allegheny County Airport near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was described as black and gray with a thin body, about 5 feet to 6 feet long.

— Air traffic controllers in California received a report from a helicopter pilot. The pilot reported a camera-equipped drone flying near the giant Hollywood sign in Los Angeles.

— Controllers in Florida received a report from the pilots of an Airbus A319 airplane that they had sighted a drone below the plane at about 11,000 feet. The drone was described as blue and red and was not spotted on radar.

— Pilots spotted a drone 500 feet to 1,000 feet away during a landing at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina. The drone was described as the size of a large bird.

— A 5-foot-long drone with a camera crashed near Dallas Love Field airport in Texas. Police said they are looking for the drone operator.

## Safety Lessons

The FAA plans to teach some of the drone operators about safety, the agency said. Some irresponsible operators have been threatened with fines.

Michael Toscano is the president of a group representing drone manufacturers and other people in favor of the use of drones. Toscano said some people misuse drones because they don't understand the safety risks or simply do not care.

"As unfortunate as it would be that we have an incident, it's not going to shut down the industry," he said.
