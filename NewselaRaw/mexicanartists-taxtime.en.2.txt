MEXICO CITY — When tax time comes, artist Teresa Cito doesn't worry. She knows the state isn't after a single peso. Instead, what the taxman wants is a donation of her artwork.

An unusual program in Mexico allows painters, sculptors and other artists to donate artworks to the state instead of paying money. The program, begun in 1957, has helped the government build a huge collection of modern art. It has also left artists such as Cito content: They are free from the bother of tax forms and the worry of owing large sums of money to the government.

The program is simple: If an artist sells up to five pieces in one calendar year, he or she donates one of equal value to the state. If he or she sells six to eight pieces, two pieces are donated — and so on, up to a total of six pieces donated per year.

Cito specializes in colorful oil paintings, as well as chalk drawings on paper. She doesn't try to give the state her lesser works, because she knows whatever she donates will be exhibited, perhaps in a government ministry or museum, or even abroad.

Cito said she always tries to offer the government "a nice piece" that represents her work well. She had much praise for the program, which is known simply as Payment in Kind. "I admire it very, very, very much. The government says, 'Pay your taxes in artwork. Keep on painting.'"

## Tax Payments Proudly On Display

Hundreds of artists take part, and it's hard to find one with even the faintest hesitation about doing so. Many hail the program as both highly positive and unique in the world.

"I think it's fantastic," said Naomi Siegmann, a sculptor born in New York who has lived in Mexico for 50 years. Her tax payments are on display "in offices all over the country, government offices as well as public buildings."

Siegmann said she got a thrill when she saw one of her pieces gracing a public space.

"I walk in and see my work," Siegmann said, and "I think, 'How nice!'"

She added, "Every big artist is in this program — I mean the top, top artists. It's not just the new artists, the beginners."

## Who Has Time For Accounting?

The program is thought to have arisen from a 1957 meeting between tax official Hugo B. Margain and artist David Alfaro Siqueiros. Siqueiros told Margain that an artist friend was facing jail time for not paying taxes.

Siqueiros argued forcefully that "a painter knows nothing about accounting or complications of tax law," Margain later wrote. "The only thing we have," Siqueiros said, "are pictures." Perhaps, he suggested, artists could "pay our obligations to the government with the delivery of some paintings."

"It doesn't seem like a bad idea, I told him," Margain wrote.

The program was approved, and since then the Mexican government has taken in well over 4,000 works of art.

A committee of artists and art experts looks at proposed donations. Their goal is to decide whether they fairly represent the body of work of a given artist.

The program has generated good will among artists. It also has helped build a splendid collection of works by some of Mexico's best-known artists and has helped beautify many public buildings.

## Good Art, Bad Art

If the program has a fault, it's that the state takes too much art. Some of that art is of poor quality and ends up gathering dust in vaults. Lopez Beltran said changes were in the offing to reduce the number of donations and to ensure they were of higher quality.

"There are many very bad artists who pay in kind," said artist Victor Guadalajara. Perhaps, he said, "the committee doesn't have members with the background or level" to judge what's good or bad.

Of course, not every artist who makes a living from selling his or her work is enormously talented. Mexico has plenty of artists who sell their work at park fairs or in markets. They, too, have a right to take part in the program even if the state finds itself swimming in work that might not belong in a museum.

Still, the overall collection contains works by some of Mexico's most famous painters and sculptors.

What's more, widely known artists try to donate work they're proud of.

"They are aware that their pieces may be exhibited not only in Mexico but also abroad," said government official Jose San Cristobal Larrea. "They don't dare donate works of bad quality."

San Cristobal said authorities were careful not to pass judgment on the work collected from artists. They are conscious that high artistic talent isn't always immediately obvious.

"Artists who aren't important today might be important tomorrow," he said.
