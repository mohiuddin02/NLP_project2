WASHINGTON â€” The growing number of Americans who speak languages other than English at home is causing a fight between two strong groups.

On one side, a group of states and cities are adopting laws that make English their official language. In those places, government documents must be written only in English.

On the other side, are the regions and places with a large number of people who come from other countries and speak many languages.

That group supports laws that make government documents easier for non-English speakers to understand.

The United States is one of the few countries in the world without a national official language. Yet, 31 states have a law requiring that all state government communication must be done in English.

Many people like that idea.

## Being Able To Adapt

English helps unite people, they say. They also believe that knowing English well is important for immigrants. It makes it easier for them to adapt to their new country.

Karin Davenport works with a group that wants immigrants to learn English. She explained that choosing English as the official language of a state does not stop people from speaking other languages. But if no one asks immigrants to learn the language, they may end up being "isolated."

In Pennsylvania, some lawmakers have a similar opinion.

English gives immigrants a better chance to make money and it helps them mix with others, said Daryl Metcalfe, a state politician.

The number of non-English speakers across the country is rising fast. It is difficult to make everybody follow the same rules even in places where English is the official language.

## California Has An Official Language

In California, for example, English is the official state language. All government communications there must be done in English. Yet, California offers many documents in other languages. The state's Department of Motor Vehicles website even has an entire version in Spanish.

California is now pushing to have medicine bottles carry instructions for people who don't read English. Some worry that something bad could happen if there is a mistake in the instructions. Others say having the instructions translated makes it safer for patients.

Drugstores that receive government money must offer to do some translating for people. And a growing number of drugstores are also beginning to do the translations because it attracts more customers.

The need for translations "is something that's not going to go away," said Evan Weibel of Language Scientific, a company that offers translation services for drugstores.

## "Things Are Changing"

The number of people speaking other languages in the United States is growing fast.

Almost 21 percent of the United States population, or nearly 61 million people, speak a language other than English at home, according to a government report. In 2000, that number was just 18 percent.

More than 40 percent of Californians speak a foreign language at home. In West Virginia, just 2 percent of the population speaks another language in their home.

"Things are changing," said Patricia Gandara, a professor of education at the University of California-Los Angeles.

The United States is becoming a place where many languages are spoken, she explained.

Even as the number of people speaking other languages grows, a large number of people continue to support English as the nation's official language. They continue to ask states and cities to officially adopt English.

A group named ProEnglish wants to make English stronger in the state of Arizona.

They are supporting a college student who was suspended after she complained that members of her class were speaking Spanish during group work.

ProEnglish did not agree with the suspension because English is already the official language in the state. They say the case is a good example of why it is important to have an official language.
