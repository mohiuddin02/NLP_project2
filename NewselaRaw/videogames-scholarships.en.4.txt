CHICAGO â€” Derek Micheau loves sports. He dreamed of being a baseball player. Then, in his third year of high school, he got hurt. He had to give up his dream.

In the end, he was still able to play sports in college. In fact, he received a scholarship from Robert Morris University Illinois.

A scholarship is something that helps students pay for their education. Sports scholarships are sometimes given to talented athletes.

Micheau doesn't play football, basketball or tennis, however. He plays video games.

Robert Morris is the first U.S. university to offer scholarships for video-game players. Thirty-five gamers were given scholarships this fall.

## Worth Thousands Of Dollars

"My mom thought it was a scam," said Michaeu, a 20-year-old freshman from Olympia, Washington. His mother thought the school might be lying to get more students and make more money from tuition.

But it's not a scam. Each student at Robert Morris normally pays more than $30,000 a year for classes and housing. Micheau's scholarship pays for half of that. His talent as a gamer saved him thousands of dollars.

Robert Morris has many sports teams. These teams play against other college teams. To help their teams win, schools often look for talented players. Scholarships are one of the ways that schools attract these players.

Why do colleges spend money to attract athletes? One reason is that college sports teams can give a school a sense of pride. When a school's team wins, it gives the school's community something to celebrate.

## Spending Money On eSports

Sports scholarships are not new. Scholarships for video games are. Robert Morris' scholarships are part of its new electronic sports program, also known as its "eSports program."

Robert Morris has spent a lot of money on the program. The school built a new eSports center. The center cost $100,000. It has high-tech computers and fancy gaming chairs.

College gamers play "League of Legends." It is a team game. Two teams play against each other. Each team tries to knock down the other team's tower. The first team to knock down the other team's tower wins.

Robert Morris' "League of Legends" team is like any other college sports team. Players wear official sweatshirts and jackets. They learn from five coaches. Its two teams are undefeated. They have never lost.

## "Taking It Seriously"

"We're definitely taking it seriously." said Kurt Melcher, who works in the athletics department. "We want them to do well," he added.

It was Melcher's idea to offer scholarships to gamers. These scholarships have gotten Robert Morris a lot of national attention. They have been discussed on several news programs.

The popularity of eSports is on the rise. For example, thousands of people buy tickets to watch "League of Legends" matches. The 2014 finals drew more than 40,000 fans to watch the games live. Millions of other people watched online.

Will other schools start offering eSports scholarships as well? Maybe. Gaming is so popular that eSports scholarships may become common.

Nancy Donohoe works at Robert Morris. She says that the scholarships are "kind of cool." She pointed out that video-game players do not usually get a lot of attention. Scholarships could change this. Someday, gamers might be just as popular as basketball and football players.
