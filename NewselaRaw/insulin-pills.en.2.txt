CHICAGO, Ill. â€” For nearly 100 years, daily insulin shots have been a life-saving treatment for people with diabetes. Now scientists are testing an exciting new theory: What if the same medicine could actually prevent the disease, and in the form of a pill instead of a shot?

Thirteen-year-old Hayden Murphy is helping researchers determine whether insulin pills can prevent Type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood.

People with diabetes have high levels of sugar in their blood. Insulin helps the body keep the levels of sugar just right for activity. Most people have enough insulin so their body keeps track of their sugar levels for them. People with diabetes need shots of insulin so they do not get sick.

So far, Hayden has been able to avoid getting diabetes. His little brother, Weston, has not been so lucky.

## "The Daily Reminders"

At just 5 years old, Weston has to avoid playing too hard and eating too little. Both can cause dangerous changes in his blood sugar levels. The little boy's family must prick his fingers several times a day. They check his sugar levels by placing a drop of his blood onto a test strip and inserting it into a small machine.

Hayden got involved in the insulin pill study after his doctor gave him a blood test. The test results showed that he had a high risk of developing Type 1 diabetes.

Hayden said he was very upset when the doctor gave him the news. "He has the daily reminders. He sees what his brother goes through," said the boys' mom, Myra Murphy.

Now Hayden swallows a small white capsule of insulin each day. Doctors check his blood every once in a while for signs of diabetes.

"I hope it doesn't come to me," he said. "I really didn't want it to come to Weston."

## Many Countries In New Study

Hayden is one of more than 400 children and adults participating in the insulin pill study. The study is funded by the U.S. government. Eight other countries are helping, too. Doctors in partner countries help register new participants who have a high risk of developing Type 1 diabetes.

This international effort to explore diabetes prevention is not the first experiment involving insulin pills. It is the result of a smaller study that was recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Children who took insulin pills in that study showed changes in their body's ability to fight disease. Researchers think those changes might help prevent diabetes. The experiment did not last long enough or look at enough people for them to know for sure.

The new international study is much larger and more thorough. Researchers believe it will provide answers about whether insulin pills can keep children from developing Type 1 diabetes.

"Does it prevent indefinitely? Does it slow it down, does it delay diabetes? That also would be a pretty big win," said Dr. Louis Philipson, a diabetes expert at the University of Chicago.

## Managing The Insulin

Diabetes cases are on the rise. About 1.25 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is far more common, affecting 30 million people in the United States and more than 300 million people worldwide.

Both types raise long-term risks for damage to the kidneys, heart and eyes.

When a person has Type 2 diabetes, their body cannot use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that keeps blood sugar levels stable. It helps the body turn food sugars into energy. Type 2 diabetes can sometimes be treated with a healthy diet and exercise.

In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops making insulin altogether. Doctors treat Type 1 by replacing insulin in small doses over the course of a patient's lifetime. This is usually done with shots or a small pump.

When a person has Type 1 diabetes, their immune system attacks their insulin-producing cells. That is why some researchers believe the disease might be caused by viruses and other infections. Genes are also thought to increase risks for the disease.

Diabetes expert Dr. Wendy Brickman explained that the pills in the study are an attempt to outsmart patients' immune systems. Researchers use the pills to sneak insulin into the body. They hope that treating insulin like food will trick the immune system into leaving it alone.

## Hoping It Doesn't Run In The Family

Results from the prevention study are not expected until 2017. If the pills work, they will most likely be less expensive than having diabetes for a lifetime.

After three years in the study, Hayden shows no signs of diabetes. He and his family are thankful, but they are still concerned.

They have another son, 9-year-old Daxton, who also has an increased risk for diabetes because his little brother has it.

The boys' mom says she worries every time her sons seem thirstier than usual. Doctors first noticed that Weston was thirsty a lot before they realized that he had Type 1 diabetes.

She does not want her other boys to have the same life-changing challenges that Weston must deal with.
