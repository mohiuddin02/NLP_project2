CHICAGO — The advertising for freshly pressed and blended juices promises instant energy, weight loss, a flood of vitamins and minerals — all in a single, portable, gulpable serving.

Health-minded consumers seem to have bought the claims — and with them, gallons of juice.

Jamba Juice, which sells juices and smoothies, reported $55.1 million in revenue in just 13 weeks. Beverage giant Coca-Cola picked up on the juice trend early and bought juice-maker Odwalla in 2001. In 2007 PepsiCo purchased Naked Juice.

Raw vegetable and fruit juices make up about 10 percent of sales at the health food restaurant chain The Protein Bar, said founder Matt Matros. His customers ask for juice, he said, because they believe it is an important part of their healthy diets.
## A Dangerous Trend?

Tools for juicing at home are also a big business. And more than 40 books related to juice or smoothies have been released in the last 30 days alone on Amazon.com. The majority mention health, weight loss or both in their titles.

But according to dietitians and nutrition scientists, juice is far from the healthiest way to consume fruit. One expert went so far as to call its popularity a dangerous trend.

"The fruit juice industry has essentially taken the 'apple-a-day' mentality and used it to sell fruit juices as healthy," said Barry Popkin, a professor in the department of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Popkin and other experts would rather see people eating whole fruit. Because most juicing methods remove the produce's fiber, drinking juice omits one of the key benefits of eating fruit. At the same time, it delivers huge amounts of sugar and calories.

"Every one of the long-term studies ... shows that you increase your risk of diabetes and weight gain" with regular juice consumption, Popkin said.

One 2010 study found that those who consumed two or more servings of fruit juice per week had a 29 percent higher risk of developing diabetes than those who didn't drink juice regularly. This elevated risk was not far behind the 42 percent increased risk for weekly soda drinkers.
## A Lot Of Calories

Unlike juices, smoothies do provide fiber, as the entire fruit often goes into the blender, skins and all. But they still contain a lot of calories. Choosing a vegetable-based juice or smoothie is one way to reduce the sugar content, health advocates say.

Some experts do argue for the benefits of juices. Elizabeth Ward, a registered dietitian on Jamba Juice's Healthy Living Council, said that because of the vitamins and minerals, juices are a good alternative to beverages like sodas that contain only calories.

Ward and Karen May, a spokeswoman for Naked Juice and Tropicana, agree that most Americans don't consume enough produce. But according to them, juice products are a good way to help fix that.

"Orange juice is a convenient and great-tasting way to help people meet nutrient needs," May said. It provides "vitamin C, potassium and calcium … in fortified varieties."

But according to Lara Field, a pediatric dietitian at the University of Chicago Medical Center, the sugar in fruit juice far outweighs any possible benefit from the concentrated vitamins and minerals.

"Eating too much fruit can make us gain weight, just like eating too much candy," Field said.

Plus, by not getting the fiber in fruit, juice drinkers miss out on the optimal health benefits, said Bethany Doerfler, clinical research dietitian at Northwestern Medicine.
## "Eat More Fiber"

Americans already are harming their health by not consuming enough fiber, said Joanne Slavin, professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota.

Diets higher in fiber are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and lower body weight, Slavin said. Yet most American adults only achieve half the recommended daily fiber intake, which is 25 to 38 grams.

"I want people to eat more fiber," Slavin said. That includes choosing whole fruits over juice.

Eating fiber also contributes to a feeling of fullness, or satiety, that helps prevent people from overeating. One 2009 study found that people who ate apple slices before lunch felt more full than those who drank apple juice. They then consumed 15 percent fewer calories during lunch.

But the same study suggests fiber isn't the only factor affecting satiety. A third group of participants in the study consumed applesauce containing about as much fiber as that found in the apple slices. That group still consumed more calories at lunch than those who ate raw apples — though not as many as the juice drinkers.

Field offered one explanation: Juice, smoothies and applesauce don't require chewing, which research suggests helps signal the body that it's eaten enough calories for the moment.
## A Bowl Of Kale

But experts admit it can be challenging for adults to eat the suggested 1-½ to 2 cups of fruit and 2-½ to 3 cups of vegetables a day.

"Sitting down to a bowl of kale is intimidating," said Doerfler, and that's one possible reason juices and smoothies are so popular.

Americans do not eat enough fruits and vegetables, so drinking the different juices is better than nothing, said Cornell University nutritionist Christina Stark.

Doerfler said smoothies and juice could be a less scary way to shift to a more plant-based diet. Predominantly vegetable-based blends are a healthier choice, with a small amount of fruit added to make a juice or smoothie tastier, she said.
