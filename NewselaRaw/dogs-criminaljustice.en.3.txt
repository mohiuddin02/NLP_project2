Sometimes people hit the animals they own. Some owners do not give their pets enough to eat. Being cruel to an animal is against the law in America. People can be arrested for hurting animals. Many get sent to jail. What happens to the animals they own in the meantime?

For years, the courts and police in Chicago, Illinois, had a problem. They failed to take good care of the animals whose owners were involved in court cases.

Mostly dogs, the animals were abused or neglected. They were taken from their homes when their owners were arrested. The cases moved slowly through the courts. The animals would remain locked up as evidence, sometimes for years. When the cases were finally settled, the dogs were usually put to death.

## People Step In To Free The Dogs

Animal rights supporters in Chicago were angry. They thought this was unfair. "The dogs did the time but not the crime" is one of their favorite sayings. They made a plan to save the animals. In 2010, a group called Safe Humane Chicago started the Court Case Dogs program. The program helped to treat the dogs and make them better. It found new homes for them.

The approach was the first of its kind in the United States.

When the program was started, only 2 out of every 10 of the jailed dogs got out alive. Today, 7 out of 10 dogs are saved. So far 760 dogs have gone through the program.

Cynthia Bathurst is in charge of Safe Humane Chicago. "These are the dogs everyone should care about," she says.

## Court Case Dogs Star In A New Book

A new book tells the stories of these dogs and the people who are saving their lives. It is called "A Ruff Road Home: The Court Case Dogs of Chicago." Written by Susan Russell, the book has stories of more than 20 dogs that have been abused. It shows them in their new homes, safe and loved.

"Some of the dogs were fought," says Russell, a writer and lawyer in Chicago who helps at animal shelters. "Some of the dogs were dumped in trash cans. Some of the dogs belonged to hoarders. Some were beaten mercilessly. Every one of these dogs had a terrible start."

Her book shows that dogs can be strong. It also shows that people care, she said.

The book took three years to write. Many people gave their time and skills for free. Safe Humane Chicago sells the book on its website. Every cent from the sales of the book goes to Safe Humane Chicago.

## Lucky Bruno, DJ and Dolly

At the heart of "Ruff Road" are the stories of the dogs.

There's Bruno, the first dog in the program. Bruno spent more than a year in a kennel after he was rescued from a man who was kicking him down the street. Bruno is now with a loving family. There is a dog named Dolly. She was locked up in a basement before the Chicago police found her. There's also Derek Jeter - known as DJ. He is a terrier mix who had been abused on videos that were posted on the Internet. He has found a couple to love him, too.

Then there are the people who work in the program. They are helped by many others who work for free. The families who take in the animals are also special.

The dogs are strong, but the people show how it can be done, Russel said.
