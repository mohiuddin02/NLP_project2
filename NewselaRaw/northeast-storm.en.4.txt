NEW YORK â€” A terrible blizzard was threatening the Northeastern United States. The storm was expected to arrive on Monday afternoon. It could dump as much as 3 feet of snow over the area. Cities and towns from Philadelphia to Boston could be in trouble.

On Sunday, people were getting ready for the storm, which was named Juno. Many people lined up at hardware and grocery stores to pick up emergency supplies.

The storm was moving along the East Coast. Tens of millions of Americans live in its path.

New Jersey, New York City, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts will probably have the worst weather. Schools and businesses in those areas may be closed all week.

## Areas In Danger

New Yorkers were getting ready for the storm on Sunday evening. Many were rushing to buy food, water, batteries and snow shovels.

Bill de Blasio is New York City's mayor. He said city road crews were getting ready for the storm. The blizzard could turn out to be one of the worst storms in the city's history, he said.

The blizzard was expected to arrive on Monday. Areas along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean from New Jersey up to Maine will be in danger. Some areas might get up to 4 inches of snow every hour. There could be strong winds.

Governors and mayors across the area said people should get emergency supplies. They also asked that people check on elderly and disabled neighbors. They could be in danger.

## "We Are Prepared"

Mayor de Blasio urged New Yorkers not to drive. He said people should use buses and trains instead.

"We need to prepare," de Blasio said. The storm could be "worse than we've seen before."

Officials in Hoboken, New Jersey, were also preparing. They were expecting up to 30 inches of snow and heavy winds. The city was opening warming centers and shelters.

Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy said the state's government was getting ready for the storm. He added that people in the area should be prepared too.

Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said his city was already prepared. Workers were standing by with 700 pieces of snow-removal equipment.

"Our city has been through blizzards before," Walsh said. "I am confident we are prepared."

The mayor asked Bostonians to help. He said they should remove snow and ice from sidewalks and curbs.

## "Don't Go Outdoors"

Use common sense once the storm starts, officials in New York City said.

Joseph Esposito runs the city's Office of Emergency Management. "Don't go outdoors if you don't have to," he said. "You should not be out in this storm."

De Blasio said that 6,000 miles of city streets will have to be cleared of snow. Traffic "will be delayed," he said.

He added, "This could be a storm the likes of which we've never seen before. Be careful. Stay safe."
