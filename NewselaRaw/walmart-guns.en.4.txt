AUSTIN, Texas — On Jan. 1, a new gun law began in Texas. The new law lets people carry guns openly. They must have a permit though. Before, people could carry guns but they had to be hidden.

The new law has caused a problem for stores that sell alcohol. These stores that sell alcoholic drinks must check with customers who carry guns. The stores need to ask if the customer has a permit. The permit is an official paper from the government that allows people to have guns.

## People Have Strong Feelings About Guns

In the United States, people have very strong feelings about guns. Some people think guns should be allowed. Others do not. The Texas law is making stores take sides. People who like guns will not shop at stores that will not let them carry their guns. They say no one should be punished for following the law. People who do not like guns are also taking action. They are avoiding stores that allow customers to carry guns. They say no one should have to shop where they feel unsafe.

The Texas government has signs for stores that want them. The signs say that no guns are allowed on the store property. 

Some stores and restaurants have these signs. They will not let customers carry guns. Others decided to let them. 

## Trying To Make Both Sides Happy

Some companies want to make both sides happy. They are against guns in their Texas stores. Yet, they will not put up the signs. Target and the coffee store Starbucks do not have signs.

Some groups are against the stores that allow guns. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America is a group against guns. Alexandra Chasse is with the group. She said stores should put the sign up. It is the best way to care about safety.

On Sunday night, Ashley Bravo de Rueda walked into a Wal-Mart. She wanted to buy baby supplies and dog food. She had her gun on her hip. She was quickly stopped by a store worker. The worker told her she was welcome to carry her gun. The worker then asked to see her permit.

Bravo de Rueda said she was surprised. Still, she showed the worker her permit.

Bravo de Rueda said she was following the law. She was not doing anything wrong. She thought she should not have been stopped.
