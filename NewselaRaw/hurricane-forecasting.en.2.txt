ORLANDO, Fla. â€” The National Hurricane Center (NHC) hopes to improve tropical predictions up to 15 percent this season. To meet this goal, it's arming itself with a juiced-up weather model and a supercomputer ready to run 213 trillion calculations per second.

The two powerful forecasting tools should allow the center to better determine how storms are structured. Knowing the structure of a storm helps to better predict where it might be headed and how strong it might get.

"If you don't have the structure of the storm right, it's hard to tell how it will interact with its environment," said James Franklin. He is the NHC's top hurricane expert.

A primary goal will be to improve forecasting how strong a hurricane will become. The Hurricane Center has struggled in this area for decades. A math-based computer program called The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model, or HWRF, should help to make it easier.

## Adding Radar Into The Mix

The model has been used for the past six years. But this season, it has been improved to accept massive amounts of atmospheric information.

The change has already paid off. The upgraded model has shown a slight improvement over its previous version in predicting the strength of the four storms so far this season, said NHC spokesman Dennis Feltgen.

The machines using the model also have improved a great deal. The problem-solving power of a supercomputer in Virginia nicknamed "Tide" and a backup in Orlando named "Gyre" has been more than doubled. The machines now make 213 trillion calculations per second, up from 90 trillion.

The combination of HWRF and Tide alone should significantly sharpen strength forecasts, Franklin said. But the quest doesn't end there. The HWRF also has been programmed to take in Doppler radar information from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) aircraft. The Hurricane Center is a division of NOAA.

## Capturing A 3D Image

The radar should capture a three-dimensional view of how a storm is structured. Then the HWRF should be able to determine how much thunderstorm activity is around the core and whether a system might weaken or burst with strength, Franklin said.

"Hurricanes are about arrangements of thunderstorms, how they interact with each other, how they distribute heat," he said. "If you can put that kind of structure into the model" you can better forecast a hurricane's strength.

Better forecasts are very important. Forecasters still are unable to predict when a system might rapidly get bigger. If it does so just before landfall, coastal residents could be caught by surprise as they were in 2004. Then, Hurricane Charley jumped from Category 2 to 4 in the five hours before striking southwest Florida. That's the difference between a hurricane with extremely dangerous winds and a major hurricane that will cause catastrophic damage, according to a widely used hurricane scale.

The NHC has also overestimated a system's power. In 2006, Ernesto was predicted to hit South Florida as a hurricane. It arrived as a weak tropical storm.

## Getting Better At Tracking

The Hurricane Center has steadily improved its track forecasts. Five-day forecasts are as accurate as three-day forecasts were in 2000. But the combination of HWRF and the supercomputer should improve path forecasts between 5 and 15 percent this year, Franklin said.

The upgraded HWRF and supercomputer should also improve other types of predictions. Forecasts from heat-wave warnings in South Florida to blizzards in North Dakota should be better, NOAA officials said.

The forecasting improvements were spurred by Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the U.S. East Coast last October. Congress allotted $24.3 million after that storm as part of a disaster relief bill. Additional funds are to be spent for another massive upgrade by 2015. Then the supercomputers are expected to be able to conduct almost 2,000 trillion calculations per second.

"This is historic in terms of capacity increase," said Louis Uccellini. He is the director of the National Weather Service which is a part of NOAA. "I believe we will have more accurate forecasts, especially for extreme events."
