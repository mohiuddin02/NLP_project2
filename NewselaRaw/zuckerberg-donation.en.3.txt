Mark Zuckerberg is the head of Facebook. He helped start the company when he was a student at Harvard University. Today, Facebook is used by 1.5 billion people every month. It has made Zuckerberg a very rich man. 

Zuckerberg recently made a big announcement. He said he and his wife will give away most of their money. His wife's name is Priscilla Chan.

The couple promised to give away around $45 billion. Their gift is one of the largest ever made. The money will be used to help children learn and stay healthy.

Zuckerberg made the announcement in a letter written to the couple's first child, a daughter named Max. Still, the letter was meant for everyone to see. It was posted on Facebook.

The couple said Max's birth made them decide it was time to start giving to others. They want to help all children become the best they can be. The baby was born just before Thanksgiving. Her full name is Maxima Chan Zuckerberg. 

## A Young Billionaire, Large Donation

Zuckerberg's announcement is unusual for two reasons. First, at 31 years old, he is still young. Second, he is giving away a huge amount of money. 

Zuckerberg is not the first business leader to give away a huge amount of money.

In 2010, billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett introduced the Giving Pledge. The idea was to get the world's billionaires to promise to give away most of their money. The money is supposed to be used to help others. 

Gates has already given away $31.5 billion. Buffett has given more than $22 billion and plans to give away nearly all his money.

More than 130 billionaires have joined them so far. Judy Faulkner, the founder of a health-records company, is one of them. She plans to give away almost all of her money. 

Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia is another billionaire who has stepped forward. He is one of the richest men in the world. The prince has said he will give away all of his money.

On Nov. 9, Zuckerberg agreed to the Giving Pledge as well. However, he did not say then how much money he planned to give away.

## Gift Pledged To Improve Learning

In their letter Zuckerberg and Chan said technology can improve the way children learn. Much of the money they plan to give away will be used to help make that happen.

The couple said they "grew up in classrooms where we all learned the same things." It did not matter that some students learned more quickly than others. It did not matter that students had different interests. Everyone was taught the same things, at the same speed. 

As a result, some students did not do as well as they could have. Others grew bored.

New technology such as computers can improve teaching, the couple said. It can make learning more focused on the needs and interests of each student.

## Customizing Education To The Student

Zuckerberg and Chan have already given $15 million to a company called AltSchool. The company is trying to start a new chain of schools. The schools will use technology to help students learn in the way that is best for them.

Zuckerberg and Chan also plan to open a free school for poor children. The school will be in East Palo Alto, California. It will offer health care along with classroom learning.

Chan is particularly interested in health care. She is a children's doctor. She also used to be a teacher.

The couple's letter to Max was meant to be read by many people. Still, it ended with some words just for her.

It was signed simply: "Love, Mom and Dad."
