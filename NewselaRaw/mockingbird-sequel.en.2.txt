NEW YORK — Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a classic read in schools and book clubs around the world. It was also her only novel, until now.

The characters from that book will return in a new novel by Lee that will be released this summer.

The new novel, "Go Set a Watchman," was written by Lee in the 1950s. It featured Atticus Finch and his daughter. She then wrote "To Kill a Mockingbird" using the same characters. "Mockingbird" was published, became a hit and won awards. But "Watchman" was lost along the way.

## How It Came To Be

The publisher is planning to print 2 million copies to start. This 304-page book comes more than 50 years after Lee's first.

In a statement released by Lee's publisher, she explains how this novel came to be.

"In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called 'Go Set a Watchman,'" said Lee, 88. "It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort.

"My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became 'To Kill a Mockingbird') from the point of view of the young Scout.

"I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it.

"After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years."

The deal to publish "Watchman" was negotiated between Carter and Michael Morrison, who is the head of HarperCollins Publishers. Financial details were kept private.

## Characters Have Grown Up

The new book is set in Maycomb, Alabama, the fictional town introduced in "Mockingbird." While "To Kill a Mockingbird" is set in the 1930s, "Watchman" is set in the mid-1950s, roughly the same time that Lee was writing the story.

While Lee was writing "Watchman," the civil rights movement was beginning to gain force. In 1953, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools — schools separated by race — were unconstitutional. Rosa Parks was arrested in 1955, leading to the yearlong Montgomery bus  boycott in which people avoided riding the bus in protest.

"To Kill a Mockingbird" follows 6-year-old Scout Finch, her brother Jem, and their father Atticus Finch. The father is a local lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of serious crimes.

The new book revisits the same characters about 20 years later.

"Scout (Jean Louise Finch) has returned to Maycomb from New York to visit her father, Atticus," the publisher's announcement reads. "She is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father's attitude toward society, and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood."

## It Will Go Down In History

The story mirrors Harper Lee's own life. Lee is from Monroeville, Alabama, and lived in New York in the 1950s. She now lives in her hometown. According to the publisher, the book will be released as she first wrote it, with no changes.

"To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of the most beloved novels in history. It has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. It was released on July 11, 1960, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961.

It was adapted into a 1962 movie of the same name, starring Gregory Peck. He won an Oscar for his performance as the courageous lawyer, Atticus Finch.

The book has occasionally been banned over the years because of its language and racial themes. Still, it has been required reading in many middle schools and high schools, and is common in book clubs.

The fact that it was Harper Lee's only book seemed to make "Mockingbird" even more special.

## Another Look At Southern Life

Lee is unlikely to do any publicity for the book, her publisher said. She has rarely spoken to the media since the 1960s. At the time, she told one reporter she wanted "to leave some record of small-town, middle-class Southern life."

"To Kill a Mockingbird" was one record of history and now, "Go Set a Watchman" will be another.

"This is a remarkable literary event," Harper publisher Jonathan Burnham said in a statement.

"The existence of 'Go Set a Watchman' was unknown until recently, and its discovery is an extraordinary gift to the many readers and fans of 'To Kill a Mockingbird.'

"Reading in many ways like a sequel to Harper Lee's classic novel, it is a compelling and ultimately moving narrative about a father and a daughter's relationship, and the life of a small Alabama town living through the racial tensions of the 1950s."

The new book also will be available as an e-book. Lee has openly expressed her preference for paper. Still, she surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow "Mockingbird" to be released as an e-book.
