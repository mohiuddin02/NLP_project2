NEW YORK â€” McDonald's is the world's biggest hamburger restaurant company. It has more than 34,000 restaurants around the world.

But there's a problem. Some people don't think its food is healthy. That concern is hurting McDonald's business. So McDonald's is starting to change.

McDonald's says it will start giving customers healthier choices. People will be able to get something instead of french fries when they order a meal. They will be able to order a salad instead. Or they can get fruit or a vegetable.

McDonald's will make the change early next year.

## Cups Of Corn

Don Thompson runs McDonald's. He announced the change with former President Bill Clinton.

McDonald's wants to make other healthy sides, Thompson said. The company already sells cups of corn in some places. It also sells kiwi on a stick. McDonald's may sell these foods in more places. It may also sell other fruits and vegetables.

A lot of people are eating healthier these days. McDonald's wants to catch up with them.

McDonald's has made a lot of changes. It now lets people have egg whites in breakfast sandwiches. It is also selling chicken wraps. Happy Meals menus offer juice, water or milk for a drink, not soda.

## Stop "Tricking" Kids, Girl Says

McDonald's hopes these new dishes will be popular. It thinks they may please a lot of people. Particularly people who want fresh and healthy food.

McDonald's has another big problem: The way it sells to children. Its ads usually show toys and movie characters. Often you don't see the food at all in an ad. Because the kids like the toys and the movies, they want the food. Some people think this isn't right.

A 9-year-old girl made headlines recently. She stood up at a McDonald's company meeting. She asked Thompson to stop "tricking" kids.
