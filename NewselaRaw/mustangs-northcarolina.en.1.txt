COROLLA, N.C. — As retired Washington, D.C., police officer E.T. Smith patrolled the beach in his four-wheel-drive truck on a recent morning, he kept an eye out for wild mustangs and the people who like to harass them. The horses have survived on this narrow barrier island for some 500 years. They are thought to be descendants of colonial horses that swam to shore when Spanish ships ran aground on the shoals and sandbars of North Carolina's Outer Banks. They have withstood centuries of hurricanes and nor'easters on this isolated spit of sand, marsh and woods, and have become a huge draw for visitors.

But the horses now face serious threats, say those who manage the herd: a boom in luxurious, but affordable vacation homes on this once-pristine stretch of coast, and federal policies that are leaving the mustangs severely inbred and starting to suffer from genetic deformities.

"Mass interaction with people is a killer," Smith said. He stopped to pick up a "Happy Birthday" balloon that a tourist left behind on the beach.

## Inbreeding Is Dangerous To The Herd

The government has described the herd, some of the last remaining wild horses in the Eastern United States, as pests that compete with federally protected birds for resources. The battle over the herd on this island comes as horse advocates and the Interior Department clash nationwide. On the other side of the country, the government is rounding up wild horses in the West and confining them at the urging of cattle ranchers who say the animals deplete the range.

In North Carolina, the mustangs are left dodging tourists and construction, and suffering birth defects. Gus Cothran, an expert in horse genetics at Texas A&amp;M University, published a DNA analysis in 2012 warning that the Corolla herd was becoming dangerously inbred. Horses were breeding within their own families because there were not enough outside horses around. This can cause deformities.

Two of eight foals, or baby horses, born last year had birth defects, according to the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, which manages the herd through agreement with the local and federal governments. One, with multiple fractures in its legs and fetlocks, was so severely crippled it had to be euthanized.

Two foals have been born this year in the herd of 101 horses. One had a genetic defect that forced him to walk on the tips of his hoofs.

Medical treatment saved that horse — which the herd managers named Vivo, a gangly dark colt with a star on his forehead whose name is Spanish for "alive" — from being crippled and euthanized. Vivo, though, can no longer live free.

## Horses Are Caught In Politics

Once a wild horse is removed from the beach and exposed to domestic horses as part of veterinary treatment and recovery, there is a risk of bringing disease back to the herd. So Vivo and his mother are confined to a facility on the mainland, near Grandy, North Carolina, poking their heads through a fence as visitors approach.

"We have one of the highest levels of inbreeding and lowest levels of genetic diversity of any wild herd anywhere. We are down to one maternal line, which is very dangerous," said Karen McCalpin, the executive director of the Corolla Wild Horse Fund.

Representative Walter Jones, a Republican from North Carolina, has taken up the cause. The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed his bill in 2012 and 2013 to allow the herd to grow to 130 horses and to let the Corolla Wild Horse Fund bring a few horses from the Shackleford Banks, on another island at the far southern tip of the Outer Banks, to put some fresh genes into the herd.

But the bill has been opposed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and it went nowhere in the Senate.

The issue is that at least some horses cross into the island's Currituck National Wildlife Refuge, although the most sensitive parts are fenced off. Flocks of endangered migratory waterfowl and nesting sea turtles use the refuge, and the government calls the horses a "nuisance."

## Fresh Genes Are Needed

Pressure is growing for a solution. The Southeast regional refuge manager for the Fish and Wildlife Service, David Viker, tried to calm people in a recent interview. Viker said the agency was going to work with equine geneticist Cothran on a new study to look at the potential for bringing fresh genes into the Corolla herd and how many horses the habitat could support.

He said the Fish and Wildlife Service hadn't wanted to make horses a focus of the refuge at the expense of caring for other animals. The agency will look for answers because the Corolla herd is "such an important icon in that part of the world," he said.
