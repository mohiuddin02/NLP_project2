### PRO: Looking for a quick political fix to look like it's in control

ARLINGTON, Va. — As the Ebola epidemic deepens in West Africa and has put U.S. citizens on alert, critics are increasingly questioning the Obama administration's response to the crisis. So far it has been ineffective.

Health officials complained that the public was being misinformed about the crisis and then blamed the unfolding tragedy on spending cuts. That was bad enough.

Then the Obama administration appointed someone with weak medical qualifications as Ebola czar. The appointment only confirmed that the White House is just looking for a quick political fix, to make it seem like it has things under control.

In an hour of need, our various national and international public health administrators dropped the ball. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) have all failed at their roles.

## Spending Its Money Unwisely

That's due to the way government agencies generally spread around public resources, like the money the receive from the government and their large staffs of health workers. The agencies whose job it is to fight the epidemic on the front line have also done a poor job of working together.

Take the CDC. Its mission is to "develop and apply disease prevention and control." Yet that takes a backseat to more political concerns like fighting obesity and gun violence.

From 2004 to 2014, CDC spending grew by almost 30 percent, from $8.3 billion to $10.7 billion a year.

Yet its National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, which aims to prevent diseases like Ebola, receives roughly $400 million a year, just a tiny sliver of total CDC funding.

The CDC's climate change and chronic disease programs, which aim to prevent smoking, alcohol abuse and poor diets, receives roughly $1.6 billion each year.

While these are real problems, they take away from the CDC's original mission and away from responding to disease outbreaks.

## Put The Money Into Research

The same is true at the NIH. Its director made inaccurate public statements blaming budget cuts for its lack of preparedness. In fact, the agency has plenty of money.

The amount of money the NIH gets from the U.S. government has actually risen. In 2000, its total budget was $24.1 billion. By 2014, that grew by roughly 25 percent to $29.7 billion.

Much of NIH's budget goes to projects that have nothing to do with researching vaccines for emerging diseases like Ebola. Instead, its money goes to projects like studying the behavior of feces-flinging chimpanzees or designing condoms.

But funding for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH department that actually researches infectious diseases, has not gone up. It has remained at roughly $4.5 billion a year since 2003.

These are only symptoms of a deeper problem. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office reported that NIH's broad range of activities, large staff and back-to-back funding increases make "wasteful efforts" likely.

## WHO Fell Down On The Job

Then there's the WHO. Doctors Without Borders, the group doing much of the work on the ground in West Africa, asked the WHO for help in July. The WHO ignored the request.

The Associated Press recently obtained a WHO document admitting that "nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall."

The problem? Its African office leaders were appointed for political reasons not because of their skills. The WHO acknowledges this.

The co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, Dr. Peter Piot, agreed, saying that "the regional office in Africa didn't do anything."

Poor government planning and unaccountability are wasteful and inefficient in the best of times. As the Ebola crisis shows, they can be downright deadly in the worst of times. It's time our public health officials learned from these mistakes.

### CON: CDC is doing its job on the front line in fight against Ebola

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Ebola is a recent and scary event for most people. Their thinking might also be that the Ebola horse has left the barn and our government, specifically the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is not riding it.

For others who have watched Ebola emerge, however, we see the good work the CDC is doing, even though our lawmakers don't support it with enough money.

The story of Ebola is truly one of a worldwide lack of public health infrastructure — health care workers, hospitals and equipment. There is a lack of trust in working with African nations which have just gotten out of wars. Health care workers fighting the outbreak are exhausted. We've also hid from our duty as a global community to fight disease outbreaks wherever they might be.

CDC Director Tom Frieden said we must beat Ebola by stopping it in West Africa.

## The Responsibility Of Us All

Is the CDC doing a good job responding to Ebola? Yes, and they'll need our help. A short explanation about public health is in order.

First, public health is our responsibility to assure the health of the nation. CDC is our primary national health agency and, as such, is in charge of investigating causes of disease. However, it is not the lead U.S. agency for fighting disease in the rest of the world.

Fact: Most of the health work done around the world is by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), like Doctors Without Border, which are run on donations from other groups and nations.

CDC is an easy target for our fears around Ebola because it is likely the only U.S. public health agency we know about. We are generally clueless to the many health successes it's involved in such as clean water, air, safe workplaces, trained health workers and responses to outbreaks.

We fail to notice that measles outbreaks in schools are quickly handled, thanks to local public health departments; or the progress made in reducing infections acquired at hospitals.

## When Something "Goes Wrong"

We become aware of public health when something "goes wrong," and then blame the government even when we dodged our duty to support public health.

Our ignorance was made clear by the mounting fear since Thomas Eric Duncan became known to us as the first Ebola patient in the United States.

The CDC responded quickly, providing health officers to find everyone who he came in direct contact with. It also provided steps to control hospital infections, Ebola screening checklists, laboratory rules, quarantine rules and is now managing the airport screening processes.

As Ebola was emerging in West Africa, CDC epidemiologists, the doctors who study epidemics, were soon on the ground there investigating. CDC still could send hundreds of epidemiologists, health educators and public health advisers to West Africa.

If we recognize anything about the CDC's Ebola work, it is likely only that of crisis response. We do not see the longer term improvements in public health infrastructure because we have not made this a major goal and spent money to make it happen.

## Training Front-Line Health Workers

Has CDC done a good job responding to the Ebola outbreak? Absolutely, and they are not done yet.

Have we? No. We've just complained and made demands to close our borders. Those actions, paired with our almost uncaring attitude toward West African nations facing the disease, will likely make it harder to stop Ebola.

To be successful in our fight against Ebola, Americans must call upon their government to spend money in public health infrastructure here and in West Africa.

They must expect our U.S. hospitals to train, prepare and supply the front-line health workers to recognize Ebola, protect themselves and control the spread. And they must support the NGOs that are doing the work on the ground.

This is more than an emergency response. It is a move toward public health infrastructure here and abroad. CDC is doing a good job, but they are not alone in this, and all Americans must engage fully as members of our global community.
