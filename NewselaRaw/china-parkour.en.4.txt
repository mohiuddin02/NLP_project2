URUMQI, China â€” There are two groups of people in China who do not like each other. A new sport is helping them become friends. The sport is called parkour. It started in France. Parkour was used to train soldiers.

The sport is popular in a part of China called Xinjiang. There are two groups of people in Xinjiang. One group is Han Chinese. Most of the people in China are Han. The other group is the Uighurs. Uighurs are part of the Muslim religion. Most of China is not Muslim. Many Uighurs do not trust the Chinese government. Uighurs say the government treats them unfairly.

## Playing Sports Together

Han and Uighurs are becoming better friends through parkour. Parkour is like acrobatics. People flip and jump.

It is easy to find Han and Uighurs practicing their tricks in Xinjiang's capital. They jump. They flip in the air. They use benches and rooftops for their tricks.

Jin Xiaolong helped start a group in Xinjiang. The group now has 25 people. Many started as teenagers. They learned about parkour from Internet videos.

The Chinese government watches over the younger Uighurs. The government is afraid Uighurs may do bad things. People say young Uighur men attacked police and ordinary men recently.

## Angry At The Government

Some Uighurs are not happy in China. They do not like the rules that tell them how to dress. There are rules against men wearing beards. The Muslim religion of the Uighurs say that men should have beards though.

One famous Uighur teacher is Ilham Tohti. He said that Uighurs are sometimes treated unfairly. They may not be able to get jobs because they are Uighurs. The Uighurs grow to not like the government. They also do not trust the Han.

## Friends Through Parkour

Still, some Han and Uighurs are becoming friends over parkour.

Timothy Grose is a professor who studies China. Grose said an Uighur and a Han might become friends. However, they also stick to ideas that they learned growing up in their families.

Will these friendships last? It is hard to say. Both Han and Uighurs get in trouble with their families. They are told not to hang out closely with each other.
