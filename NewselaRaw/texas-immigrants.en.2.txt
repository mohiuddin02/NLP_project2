HOUSTON, Texas â€” Last year, only 150 young immigrants and refugees, who left their countries because of violence or war, started the school year at the Las Americas Newcomer Middle School. The school is located in Houston's low-income Gulfton neighborhood. This year, the school for grades 4 through 8 had 325 students ready to begin classes. Most of them were newly arrived from Central America.

"It's put a burden on me because I've run out of space," Principal Maria Moreno said. The school's dozen portable classrooms were set up behind another middle school. She hired five new teachers and a social worker. The school converted offices into classrooms and bought extra computers.

Moreno still had to turn away more than 100 students who wanted to attend Las Americas this year.

"That's not going to stop," Moreno said. She knows that because her school cannot accept them, the students will have to apply somewhere else nearby. Las Americas  has students from 23 countries who speak 17 languages. Arabic, Nepali and Swahili were more common than Spanish until recently.

She doesn't know if the school next door will be equipped to handle them.

## Texas Has A History Of Helping

Educators across the country are having to make changes. School districts have had to add English-as-a-second-language programs, or ESL, to help new immigrants. Oakland, California, has even hired an employee just to provide social services to these students.

The recent surge of immigrants is felt most strongly in Texas. More than 66,000 unaccompanied young people crossed into the United States illegally in the past year. Most of them entered through Texas' Rio Grande Valley on the border with Mexico.

According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, 37,477 of those children have settled with hosts across the country as of July 31. The largest number of these children, 5,280, went to Texas. Of those, 2,866 have been placed in the Houston area.

Texas has long served students who were in the country illegally. A 1982 Supreme Court case held that the state could not deny them an education. Texas also absorbed 35,000 students displaced from Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.

The current wave, though smaller, presents special challenges to educators. Many of these students, Moreno said, are fleeing countries that are in disarray and they need counseling and other social services.

## Paying For It All

One 14-year-old Honduran boy traveled as far as Guadalajara, Mexico, with his mother. There, she ran out of money and told him to hop cargo trains, alone, the rest of the way.

Most students don't speak English. Some native Central American children barely speak Spanish, like the Honduran boy who spoke Mayan Quiche and kept asking Moreno in Spanish, "How do you say this in Spanish?"

Houston public schools plan to expand the Newcomers program. They have already enrolled 1,825 new students from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

Some Texans fear that the schools cannot afford the newcomers. Texas Education Agency officials, who oversee the state's more than 1,200 school districts, say they have already budgeted to cover the extra students. They can also draw from a state fund with an extra $263 million if new costs arise.

Agency officials estimate that it will pay districts $9,473 to educate each ESL student this school year. That's $1,573 more than the Agency paid for the typical student.

If most of the young immigrants placed in Texas enroll in school, the total cost of educating them could be more than $50 million.

## Some Schools Still Have Room

Federal officials say it is difficult to estimate how many of the young immigrants have enrolled in schools. The U.S. Department of Education has released suggestions to schools, but has not counted the total costs.

Dorie Nolt, a Department of Education spokeswoman, said it's hard to calculate the costs of educating immigrant children at a district or state level. It is even more difficult on a national level.

"It depends on a range of local factors," Nolt said.

Those factors include the number of ESL students already in a school and the level of community programs and state support. Another key is a school's existing population, Nolt said. Some districts in cities may currently have room for more students.

"There was this concern at first that there was going to be this flood of kids," Nolt said. Some districts in cities have seen a lot of new, immigrant students, but the vast majority have not, she added.

## Progress Often Starts Small

Congressman Lamar Smith, a Republican, and some other Texans complain that the migrants will stretch schools that are already full.

"Regrettably, American taxpayers will be asked to foot the bill for the burden on these school districts," Smith said.

In the Houston area, some counties and cities have recently criticized federal efforts to house migrant children in short-term shelters. Others have directed officials not to cooperate with federal authorities to maintain the shelters.

Moreno tried to ease these concerns by speaking to community groups opposed to the changes.

"What's better than having an educated child who can get a job and pay taxes?" she said. "You want them to be educated and fend for themselves."

Moreno said she stopped to talk recently to the 14-year-old Honduran boy who rode the trains north. He has transformed himself, in a few short weeks, from class clown to dedicated student, she said. Moreno took that as a sign of progress.
