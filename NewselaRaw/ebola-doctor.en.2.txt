WORCESTER, Mass. — Dr. Rick Sacra was given a second chance at life one year ago. He was cured of a deadly disease that has killed thousands.

On September 25, 2014, the 52-year-old Massachusetts physician stepped out of an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital. He had been successfully treated for the deadly virus Ebola.

Sacra caught Ebola while delivering babies in a hospital in Liberia, a country in West Africa. After being rushed back to the United States, he spent three rough weeks in the Omaha hospital. He suffered through fevers, vomiting, diarrhea and aches, never knowing if he was going to make it.

"Of course I knew that I might die," Sacra said this week. "It made me very aware of how grateful I am for every day I'm given."

Sacra says he is now "100 percent" recovered and is feeling fine.

## No Regrets

Most West Africans who catch Ebola and manage to stay alive are not as lucky as he is, Sacra added. Many still have serious health problems. Often, people view them with fear and avoid them.

Sacra says he does not regret a thing, and he would do it all over again if he had to. "Some risks are worth taking," he says. "Even if I had died due to Ebola last year, I would not have changed what I did."

Sacra has spent many years working as a doctor in some of the world's poorest countries, where trained doctors are very badly needed. It did not take him long after he recovered from Ebola to get back to work.

Sacra is now immune to Ebola — once you have had the disease, you cannot catch it again. He has returned to Liberia three times so far this year.

## Doctor Keeps Returning To Liberia

In April and then again in July, Sacra returned to the Liberian hospital where he caught Ebola. He has worked there for parts of every year over the last 20 years. The hospital is located just outside the capital city of Monrovia.

Sacra is now back in the United States but plans to return to the Liberian hospital again in November.

So far Ebola has killed more than 11,000 people. Doctors say it is now under control, but it has not been completely wiped out yet. Just weeks ago, Liberia was declared "Ebola-free" for the second time this year. Neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea, however, continue to see a few new Ebola cases each week.

## Need For Medical Help Is Still Great

Sacra says Liberia's need for trained doctors and nurses is just as great now as it was during last year's Ebola outbreak. Many Liberians stayed away from hospitals at the peak of the outbreak, because they were afraid they would catch the disease. Now many are just starting to return to hospitals, seeking treatment for other serious health problems.

The sudden rush of new patients is hard for many of Liberia's hospitals to handle. They just do not have enough doctors and nurses.

Sacra has no plans to stop his trips back to Liberia, which he travels to four times a year.

"When Liberia is on its feet again and it doesn't need help anymore, I'll probably move on to someplace else," he said. "But as long as the needs are there and I can make a difference, I think I ought to keep doing it."
