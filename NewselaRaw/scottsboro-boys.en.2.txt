FAIRHOPE, Ala. – The state of Alabama can't rewrite a long history of hate and violence, but with the help of one determined woman it has closed the chapter to one terrible story.

On Thursday, Alabama's parole board pardoned the last of the long-dead Scottsboro Boys. They were nine black teenagers falsely accused of sexual assault.

The pardon cleared their names of a crime they were accused of in 1931.

The Scottsboro Boys case stands out in history. It divided some residents here and united others, led to two major Supreme Court decisions, and helped spark the civil rights movement in the decades that followed.

## A Book About Nine Boys

All the while, though, justice remained undone for some of the boys as they became men, went into hiding, and eventually died with their reputations in ruins. That changed only after a long fight by a Scottsboro woman named Sheila Washington.

In the mid-1970s, when Washington was 17, she found a package under her parents' bed. It was a pillowcase, which held something rolled in layers of plastic. She unwrapped it, and a book tumbled out.

"An old, thin paperback," she said Thursday. A book about nine boys who were black, like her. What she read changed her life.

In the depths of the Great Depression, young people throughout the South hopped trains looking for work. In March 1931, on a train to Memphis, nine teenage black boys, a few white boys and two white girls had hopped on at various stops in Georgia and Tennessee.

Someone got jostled, a fight started, and the outnumbered white boys jumped off and went to the police. In Paint Rock, Ala., authorities boarded the train and arrested every black male, ranging from 13 to 19 years old. They also found the two white girls, who claimed they had been assaulted by the boys.

As Sheila Washington read about one of America's greatest legal injustices, her father caught her with the book and snatched it from her hands. She heard fear in his voice. "You don't need to know about that," he said. "Just keep quiet about this now."

She would hear people say "keep quiet," again and again, for years, about the Scottsboro Boys.

In 1978, her brother died in Kilby Prison, where the Scottsboro boys had been held. Guards had killed him, she said, after he had killed a white man in a fight.

Finding the old book, her father's fear, her brother's death, were dark moments that hardened inside her as a young woman. She began work on a project on the Scottsboro Boys, developing a museum as a way to remember their suffering. People in town expressed outrage. "They said I was disgracing the good name of Scottsboro," she said.

After almost 20 years of work, she opened the Scottsboro Boys Museum and Cultural Center on Willow Street, where visitors could learn about the case out in the open.

Along the way she she realized that civil rights leaders had given up on the boys, she said. "After Rosa Parks, everybody shifted to her case, because it looked better and smelled better," she said. Even after it became clear that the Scottsboro Boys had committed no crime, they still lived with the accusation.

Their nine trials had taken just two days at the Scottsboro courthouse, before an all-white jury, argued by a defense lawyer who didn't know Alabama law. All but the youngest teen received the death penalty.

## Case Heard By The Supreme Court

Afterward, the Communist Party USA intervened with legal help for an appeal, and the case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where it led to two historic decisions: that jury members cannot be automatically excluded by race, and that people facing trial have the right to a proper lawyer.

In 1937, one of the girls on the train took back her story, saying she had never been attacked. That led to five of the boys' convictions being overturned. One of them, Clarence Norris, received a pardon in 1976.

By then, the remaining boys had died, but Sheila Washington felt they still deserved to have their names cleared. She went before the Alabama parole board but was told there was no process for pardons for dead people.

So she approached state Sen. Arthur Orr, a white Republican whose greatest remembrance of the case, he said, came from a television special about one of the judges.

Orr was moved by Washington's plea. "Alabama is such a different place now," he said Thursday. "This felt like a chance to do something."

He drew up a bill that would allow for pardons for dead people in cases of race discrimination. In April, when Orr presented his bill, he said, the state legislators were all on the same page – Democrats and Republicans. The law passed unanimously.

On Thursday, when the parole board granted the pardons, people burst into applause. Republican Gov. Robert J. Bentley issued a statement saying, "The pardons granted to the Scottsboro Boys today are long overdue."

Sheila Washington said the decision felt like the satisfaction of a lifetime's work. "I believe the boys can rest now," she said.
