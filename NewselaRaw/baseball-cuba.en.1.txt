HAVANA, Cuba — Cuba has produced some of the world's great baseball players. Many Cuban-born players do not play in their own country, however. Instead, they choose to play abroad where they have the potential to earn more money. Recently, officials have put new policies into effect aimed at keeping Cuban players from leaving.

The island's national league began its 54th season on Sunday. For years, talented players have been leaving Cuba to play overseas, chasing dreams of riches in countries like the U.S. The result on the national league has been noticeable. With so many gifted players leaving, the overall talent level of the league has gone down.

"There's no way that economically Cuba is going to keep enough top players in the country to have the quality of league they had five or 10 years ago," said Peter C. Bjarkman, author of "A History of Cuban Baseball, 1864-2006." He added that although the league has not been destroyed, it seems to be on a steady decline.

While departing stars get the most attention, Bjarkman said that the loss of dozens of younger, barely known players each year has been more devastating to the league's long-term health.

## Cuba's Rules Change

Up until recently, the rules have prohibited players from signing contracts in other countries. For five decades, Cuban players were banned from playing professionally outside of Cuba. The result was that players who wanted international careers left the island illegally. Doing so meant not only abandoning Cuba's national league but also abandoning Cuba itself.

In September 2013, however, Cuba established a new policy. It was a compromise of sorts, giving players more freedom in the hope that fewer of them would emigrate. It allows ballplayers to sign offseason contracts in countries like Japan and Mexico. The only requirements are that a large chunk of a player's salary will go to the state, and players must return to play in Cuba throughout the year. In addition, the Cuban league also gave raises to on-island athletes.

Several baseball officials and players on the island said that they are confident that these reforms will help. They argue that the new rules will allow players to continue to play in Cuba while also expanding their careers abroad. As a result, fewer players may decide to leave Cuba for good.

Some players have taken the league up on its offer. Star third baseman Yulieski Gourriel, outfielders Alfredo Despaigne and Frederich Cepeda and pitcher Hector Mendoza played this season in Japan, all with the agreement of Cuban officials.

Overall, however, the reforms do not seem to be working.

Despite the new policies, Cuban players still have to choose between playing in the United States and remaining Cuban citizens - they cannot do both. A 52-year-old U.S. embargo bars athletes from paying Cuban taxes on money earned in the majors. Therefore, Cuban players still cannot compete in the United States without permanently leaving the island.

## Big Leagues, Big Money

The appeal of the majors is strong for Cuban players, even as the reforms offer alternatives. For one thing, the salaries offered in the United States are hard to pass up.

This summer, outfielder Rusney Castillo left Cuba and signed a $72.5 million, seven-year deal with the Boston Red Sox. This topped outfielder Jose Abreu's $68 million, six-year contract with the Chicago White Sox last October.

Compare these salaries to the salaries of players who are legally playing outside of Cuba, but not in the United States. Third baseman Yulieski Gourriel's Japanese contract is for $1, far less than what stars make in the United States.

As American paychecks continue to attract Cuban players, it seems that the talent drain in Cuba's national league may only get worse. This year alone, 13 Cuban players signed new major or minor league contracts, up from 10 the previous year. Of the players on Cuba's star-studded 2013 World Baseball Classic, a quarter have left Cuba in search of major-league deals.

The contracts for six of the top-earning Cuban-born major leaguers — Jose Abreu, Yasiel Puig, Castillo, Yoenis Cespedes, Aroldis Chapman and Jorge Soler — total close to $280 million. And there's more to come.

Outfielders Yasmani Tomas, Gelkis Jimenez, Adriel Labrada and Alejandro Ortiz and pitchers Diosdany Castillo, Yasmani Hernandez and Carlos Portuondo all recently left Cuba for the major leagues.

## "Playing With The Best"

Money is not the only attraction. Industriales pitcher Odrisamer Despaigne, 27, left Cuba in February and three months later agreed to a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres.

"I needed new challenges, that's why I left my country, to achieve my dream of playing with the best in the major leagues," he explained.

While playing in the United States can offer many rewards, it is not an easy thing for Cuban players to do. Typically, baseball players quietly stop playing in Cuba, then establish residency in another country. From there, they look to get hired by American and Canadian teams.

Illegally leaving Cuba can be dangerous and expensive. A series of lawsuits and a federal investigation launched in Miami this year have revealed that many ballplayers are smuggled out of Cuba by human-trafficking groups in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Such dangerous journeys have not stopped young Cubans from dreaming of playing far from home, however.

"I'd love to be great one day," 15-year-old Ernesto Medina said as he recently played in Havana. "To start, I'm dreaming of playing for Industriales, the greatest Cuban baseball team in my opinion, and afterward of course I'd like to play in the major leagues." As long as players like Medina continue to dream of making it in the United States, Cuba's national league may be in trouble.
