WASHINGTON â€” One of the most famous paintings of George Washington is getting a good cleaning.

The painting is known as the "Lansdowne." It shows Washington when he was serving as America's first president.

In Washington's time, photography had not yet been invented. Instead of posing for photos, important people used to have paintings made of them. Without paintings of Washington, we would not know what he looked like.

The Lansdowne is a picture of Washington that was done in 1796. It was painted by Gilbert Stuart.

It can be seen at the Smithsonian museum. It has been on display there since 1968. The Smithsonian is a museum of American art and history in Washington, D.C.

## Careful, Slow Cleaning

Over time, paintings can get dirty or damaged. This is what has slowly happened to the Lansdowne. It was painted more than 200 years ago. Since then, a thin yellow coating has built up on the surface of the painting.

Experts will carefully remove the yellow coating. This will make it easier to see the picture's original colors and details.

The project to clean the Lansdowne will take some time. Work will begin in 2016 and will take more than a year. Afterward, the painting will look like much like it did when it was first completed.

The Lansdowne is an important part of the Smithsonian's collection. It shows one of the most famous leaders of American history.

## Washington All Dressed Up

In 1775, the American Revolution began. The war started because the American colonies did not want to be part of Great Britain anymore. George Washington led the Revolutionary Army to victory in 1783.

The colonies then became the United States of America. Washington became the first American president in 1789.

The Lansdowne is one of the best paintings we have of President Washington. There are few pictures of his whole body. It shows Washington standing in a black velvet suit. This was how he dressed as president. Other pictures show him in a military uniform.

The artist painted several copies of the painting. One copy ended up at the White House. The White House has been the home to American presidents since 1800.

The painting at the White House soon became part of American history. It played a small part in the story of America's next war with Britain - the War of 1812.

## George Is Saved!

In 1812, war broke out again between the United States and Great Britain. In 1814, British troops took control of Washington, D.C. They set fire to much of the city, including the White House. The president at the time was James Madison. His wife was Dolley Madison. Before the White House was burned, she famously rescued the Lansdowne painting.

Because of its history, the Lansdowne is a popular piece of the Smithsonian museum's collection. About 1 million visitors see it each year.

Once the cleaning is finished, visitors will be able to see the Lansdowne in full color and detail. If all goes well, Washington will look much like he did in 1796.
