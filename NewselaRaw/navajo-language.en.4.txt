WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. â€” When Jay Tsosie was a boy more than 60 years ago, teachers punished him for speaking Navajo.

When he was caught whispering Navajo to classmates, they washed his mouth with soap. Some days, Tsosie had to write on the blackboard 100 times: "I will not speak Navajo." Tsosie is now 77.

At the time, a government group was trying to stop Native Americans from speaking their native language. Government teachers tried to force Indian children to forget their identity.

Now, the Navajo language has become a big issue in the election for tribal president. The Navajos are the country's largest American Indian group. The tribe has 300,000 members.

## "Go Out Into The World"

Last week, tribal judges said candidate Christopher Deschene could not run for president. His rivals claimed he could not speak Navajo well enough. Under tribal law, the president of the Navajo Nation must be able to speak Navajo.

"Our sacred language defines us as individuals and as a Nation," the judges wrote.

Some support the court's ruling. They say that speaking Navajo is extremely important. The rule was made because the government had tried to destroy their language.

A 94-year-old woman who said she was Deschene's grandmother said he speaks Navajo well enough. "I understand him," she said in Navajo.

Others say the rule punishes younger Navajos. They are doing just what their own tribe encourages them to do. They are getting an education in the outside world.

Along the way to Gallup, New Mexico, is the Code Talker Highway. It is named for Navajo soldiers. During World War II, they used Navajo as a code for secret messages. Billboards along the route show pictures of young Navajos. The billboards say, "Climb the Ladder," "Go Out Into the World" and "Learn English."

## Protests About Court's Decision

Deschene was born in Los Angeles but grew up in Indian Country. He earned advanced degrees in engineering and law. He also served in the U.S. Marine Corps.

Many here say Deschene should be praised, not blamed. There were protests that Deschene was not allowed to run for president.

Art Huskey is 71. He says Navajos teach their kids to get an education. Then the kids come back and help their people, like Deschene. "Part of the sacrifice might be forgetting some of their Navajo," Huskey said.

Nearly every Navajo first-grader used to speak Navajo. Now, only about three children in 10 can speak it. Huskey said only one of his four children speaks Navajo, and none of his grandchildren.

Huskey was among the many people protesting Thursday in Window Rock, Arizona. Window Rock is the capital of the Navajo Nation. The protesters held signs. Some of the signs were in English and some were in Navajo.

## She Feels Completely Navajo

Mattie Christensen was one of the protesters. She said she feels completely Navajo, no matter what she speaks.

Sarah White, though, said the tribal president should speak Navajo. "That's the only way you're going to feel and taste the experience of everyday Navajo life."

Tsosie still speaks Navajo. He will not teach his grandchildren the difficult language, though.

"What's the use?" Tsosie said. "We've been discouraged from using our language all our lives. Why make this an issue now when we have a bright young lawyer who wants to return to lead our tribe? Speaking the language is not going to do him any good, other than talking to the old folks."

Eventually, a tribal officer ordered people to remove their signs. "It doesn't look good" to the outside world, said Tribal Police Sergeant Stanley Ashley.

In the end, the signs stayed. Three elders read a sign, but couldn't tell what it said because it was in Navajo. Finally, one spoke up, "Somebody here wrote this sign. We should be able to figure this out."
