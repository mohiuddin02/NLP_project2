Eels are a type of fish that look like snakes. They have a special power. They can zap fish with electricity.

Electricity is a strong force. It can be very useful. It is what makes light bulbs shine. Without electricity we would not be able to see at night.

Electricity can also be very harmful. The lightning that shoots out of the sky during a storm is a kind of electricity. Lightning can kill if it hits you.

Eels that use electricity are known as electric eels. They use electricity to knock fish out. Once the fish are too weak to move, the eels swallow them up.

Scientist Kenneth Catania has just discovered something amazing. Electric eels have a special trick. It makes their electricity much stronger.

## Eels Bend Bodies Like Letter "U"

The eels bend their bodies into a curved shape. Doing that makes their electricity twice as strong.

Catania has studied electric eels for a long time. He noticed that many eels curl up when zapping a fish. They bring their head toward their tail. The shape they make is like the letter "U."

Catania noticed that young eels curl up often. Young eels are much smaller. They have much less electrical power.

Bigger, older eels almost never curl up. They do it only when they attack a very large fish. Such fish take extra power to knock out.

## Curling Up Makes Power Stronger

Catania thought he knew the reason for the curling. He guessed the eels were doing it to strengthen their electric power.

Both the head and the tail help an eel send out electricity.

Perhaps eels curl around so they can use both ends to zap fish, Catania thought. The two ends might be working together. If so, they would be much stronger than one end alone.

## Scientist Tests His Idea

Catania decided to test his idea. He took a fish and put it near an eel. The fish had electrodes attached to it. The electrodes let Catania see how much electricity passed through the fish.

The eel attacked the fish several times. Sometimes it curled its body. Sometimes it did not.

There was a big difference between the two ways of attacking. The fish was hit with much more electricity when the eel curled its body. Curling made the electricity more than two times as strong.

Next Catania wants to answer one more question. Why does electricity not hurt the eels themselves? Scientists have no idea how they stay safe.
