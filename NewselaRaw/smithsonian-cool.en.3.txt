WASHINGTON â€” Flashback to the 1940s. The setting is a jazz club. A saxophonist performs on stage wearing his sunglasses at night. "I'm cool," he says, relaxed in the moment.

Lester Young was the lead saxophonist in Count Basie's orchestra and soul mate to jazz singer Billie Holiday. At the time, he was just throwing out some jazz slang. But after he used the word cool, everyone else did too. Being cool would become an American and global craze. But what does it mean to say someone is cool?

Over the past five years, curators at the National Portrait Gallery have been working on this. They set out to examine how that idea of cool has shaped American arts and culture. A new exhibit opening Friday is about the image of cool. It is comprised of 100 photographs of people who defined cool as a word for rebellion, self-expression, charisma, edge and mystery.

"American Cool" traces the idea further back to the "granddaddies of cool," Walt Whitman and Frederick Douglass. It then unfolds through the generations, leading to Jay-Z, Johnny Depp and Madonna.

"These are the successful cultural rebels of American culture," said Joel Dinerstein, a professor and jazz scholar at Tulane University. He co-curated the show and teaches a college course on the history of being cool.

## Four Rules Of Cool

The exhibit's idea came out of the 2008 presidential election. Then the buzz was about how Barack Obama gave off a cool, relaxed power that appealed to a new generation, said co-curator Frank Goodyear III. No presidents made the list, but curators considered Obama, Clinton, Reagan and Kennedy.

What might seem like a made-up list of 100 celebrities was actually much-debated. It was narrowed down from 500 names, the curators said. They created four rules that meant someone was cool. To be included, a person had to have an original artistic vision with a signature style, rebel against society, be instantly recognizable, and have a lasting cultural effect.

Jon Stewart was chosen over someone like talk show host Johnny Carson. Stewart's signature style for spoofing the news and comedy was considered more original. It's been copied in Egypt and beyond.

The 100 who made the cool cut include musicians, actors, athletes, comedians, activists and writers. At the roots of cool, there's dancer/actor Fred Astaire, writer Ernest Hemingway and artist Georgia O'Keeffe. That period was followed by the birth of cool in the jazz years with musicians like Young, Holiday, Muddy Waters and Duke Ellington. Landing in the same period were Audrey Hepburn, Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra. Music from 10 jazz, blues and rock-and-roll artists plays throughout the galleries.

In the 1960s and 1970s, to be cool was to be against authority and open to new ideas. Figures like Bob Dylan, Muhammad Ali, Angela Davis and Andy Warhol fought against racism, the Vietnam war and mainstream culture.

Throughout the show, there are more men than women represented.

The idea of being cool was very much owned by men "until very recently," Dinerstein said. "This notion of sort of having edge and charisma and mystery" really was not applied to women. When it was, it was in a bad light. The 1970s was the period when this began to change, he said.

## Cool Images On Display

"American Cool" is an exhibit about history, race, being male and female and integration. And it's about photography as the figures each shaped their public images through photographs by Richard Avedon, Annie Leibovitz and other leading photographers. Most of the images are black and white.

The most difficult section to curate was what remained of cool from the 1980s onward, Goodyear said.

"There are some who thought that cool died in the '80s," Goodyear said. The period was identified with people chasing money and the growing power of companies.

Being cool was more important than being rich before then. But more recently being cool and being rich go together. Someone like Jay-Z is "selling in" to have more power in the culture, rather than selling out, Dinerstein said. "Hip-hop totally crosses that over in which bling becomes positive," he said.

It was extremely difficult to choose just 100 people. So the exhibit also includes a list of 100 names that didn't make the cut. Curators argued about those 100 the longest.

Dinerstein said the curators want the list to inspire discussion. Grandparents can tell their grandkids who jazz drummer Gene Krupa was and why he's important. "People who are young can tell their grandparents who Jay-Z is and why he is important."

"American Cool" will be on view through Sept. 7 in Washington. The National Portrait Gallery is part of the Smithsonian Institution.
