WASHINGTON â€” Some leaders in Washington, D.C., want to get rid of the $1 bill. They want people to use $1 coins instead. They say coins last longer, and it would save the government money.

But, the Federal Reserve says, "Don't bet on it."

The Federal Reserve is the bank of the U.S. government. It's nicknamed "the Fed." And it controls the country's money.

The Fed studied the cost of switching from paper money to coins. It tried to figure out if it was worth it.

## Dollar Coins Won't Save Money

It found that the dollar bill should still be used. It shouldn't be switched for a dollar coin. The Fed says that the dollar bill lasts longer than people realize. And replacing it with a dollar coin would cost the government $1.2 billion over 30 years.

That's because coins cost more to make.

But, Canada and Britain have already switched some paper money for coins. And most of Europe has as well. They've replaced paper money with coins just for small amounts of money.

Last year, another government agency did a study. It said a switch could save billions of dollars. Those savings would come over 30 years.

The Fed's own study said the dollar coin won't save money.

The dollar bill is made from cotton and linen. It is stronger than it used to be. It now lasts about 70 months, the report said. Paper money only lasted 18 months in 1990.

The bills that other countries replaced lasted less than 20 months.

## Keeping Bills Makes More Sense

A dollar coin can be used for 30 years. But, it also costs much more to make.

A dollar bill costs about 5 cents to make. A dollar coin costs about 33 cents. So, it would cost billions of dollars to switch from paper to coin.

Still, the government could make money on the switch. But, only if dollar bills didn't last long.

But they now last 70 months. So, the dollar bill makes more sense to keep, the Fed said.

In addition, the shift to a dollar coin would have other costs. Banks would need extra space to store the coins. That could cost millions and millions of dollars each year, the Fed said.

And, the Fed says, people don't really like the $1 coins. About 1.4 billion of them are sitting in the Fed's vaults.

The Fed says surveys show that most Americans like the dollar bill. They like it more than the coin. Those surveys found that people might stop using cash if there was a switch to coins. They might use credit cards and other ways of paying instead.

A group in favor of the coins disagrees. It said other surveys have shown about two-thirds of Americans support a switch to a dollar coin. But, they support the switch when they're told that it could save money.
