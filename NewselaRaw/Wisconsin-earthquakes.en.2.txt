MILWAUKEE — To understand earthquakes, scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are going directly to their source miles below the Earth.

It is a bold plan. Earthquakes occur at fault lines. Fault lines are where the huge plates of rock that make up the Earth's surface bump up against each other.

The geologists are drilling through miles of rock at dangerous faults in New Zealand and Japan. These are faults that could erupt at any moment, causing giant earthquakes.

"These are the natural disasters that kill the most people on the planet. So we need to know as well as we can how they work and whether there are ways to (reduce) their effects by early warning or detection," said Harold Tobin. He teaches geoscience at the university. Geologists study rocks and the matter that makes up the Earth.

## Following The Chain Of Events

Scientists are seeking to understand the chain of events that cause big earthquakes. The scientists will take samples of rock from the faults and record the conditions down deep in the Earth. If they are lucky, they will catch a quake in action.

Earthquakes are some of the most destructive and deadly natural disasters on the planet. They also are some of the least predictable. Scientists can say how likely a fault is to experience a quake, but they can only predict earthquakes over the span of decades. This is not very helpful for people living in the area who have only moments to take cover.

Scientists don't know how — or even if — it might be possible to predict earthquakes. Part of the problem is they know so little about how earthquakes start. Earthquakes begin deep below the surface of the Earth, too deep for researchers to go.

Typically, earthquakes are studied by measuring seismic waves. Seismic waves are waves of energy that occur when the plates bump up against each other. This information is useful. But it's not direct — sort of like trying to figure out what's inside your birthday present by shaking the box. You would know much more if you could unwrap it and look directly at what was inside.

This is why the scientists want to drill down to the fault line. They will bring up core samples of rock as they drill to study. Then they will place instruments in the hole to measure seismic tremors and other factors. These include the pressure, temperature, and strains on the rocks, as well as the water underground.

## This Fault Is Coming Due

"If we want to understand earthquakes, it's one of the few kind of direct ways we can get evidence about what faults are like," said Clifford Thurber. He is a professor in the department of geoscience at UW-Madison.

Thurber and Tobin are part of a group of international scientists working on the Deep Fault Drilling Project. The project is located in at the Alpine Fault in New Zealand.

The New Zealand fault has been quiet since 1717. It typically causes a major quake every 300 or 400 years. Scientists think the area is due for an earthquake soon. They estimate a 28 percent chance of a quake in the next 50 years. Beginning in October, the geologists will drill nearly a mile deep into the Alpine Fault.

## Drill, Analyze, Wait

Drilling such deep holes, however, is not easy. This is especially true for faults that are under water. Many of the most dangerous faults that cause tsunamis — earthquakes that create huge tidal waves — are under the sea.

Tobin is co-chief scientist of the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) in Japan. He spent seven weeks at sea last winter on a scientific drilling ship called the Chikyu. The ship drilled into the Nankai Fault off the coast of southern Japan.

Tobin and his fellow scientists took round-the-clock shifts, analyzing the information and samples of rock that came out of the drill hole. At times, they braved harsh winds and waves as high as 30 feet. The scientists have already drilled a mile and a half down below the seabed. They plan to drill three miles down.

Instruments will remain in the holes for decades. They will collect information and wait for a quake that could strike at any time.

## Lessons Are Learned

The UW researchers also were involved in an earlier experiment, called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD). Scientists drilled a 2-mile-deep hole through the famous San Andreas Fault in California. The San Andreas fault has caused many earthquakes throughout the state.

The experiment recovered the first samples of rock at the level where small earthquakes begin.

However, scientists encountered many problems. Drilling was more expensive than expected. Also, the instruments quickly broke. Their failure was caused by harmful gases, crushing pressures and high temperatures at that depth.

The lessons scientists learned there will be useful to the experiments in New Zealand and Japan.

Scientists there will not drill down to where major quakes begin. Instead, the drills will stay closer to the surface, where they have already uncovered important information.

"We're seeing rocks much closer to what they are like down where earthquakes do their thing," Thurber said.
