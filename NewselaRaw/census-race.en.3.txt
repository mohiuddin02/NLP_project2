WASHINGTON — Every 10 years, the government counts the number of people in each state. It's called the census. A form gets mailed to every U.S. house and people answer questions about themselves. One question asks about people's background.

For many Americans, checking the right box on the form is easy. They quickly mark off "black," "white," "Hispanic," "Asian," "American Indian" — or all of the above.

But for Americans of Middle Eastern and North African background, or "MENA," it's a real head-scratcher. For more than 100 years, the MENA community has been labeled "white" by the Census Bureau. Yet, they range in skin tone from pale to deepest ebony. They come from 22 different countries, from Iran to Egypt to Morocco. Most are Arabs, but many are Iranians, Turks and others.

## Some People Feel Invisible

The MENA community is now asking the Census Bureau to create a separate "MENA" box for the 2020 count. "White," they argue, makes them almost invisible to the government. Census numbers decide how states get money from the government. The money pays for education and health programs, and even for translators at hospitals or voting booths. Without correct numbers, the MENA community says cities and states cannot pay for the programs people need.

"Education is obviously a key point," says Sarab Al-Jijakli, a community organizer in Brooklyn, New York. He says one-quarter of public schoolchildren in a Brooklyn neighborhood may be of Arab background. "Are the services being given in that school really serving the local community?"

Additionally, some say being labeled "white" prevents the MENA community from receiving help given to minorities. For instance, government programs give additional money or preference to minority businesses.

"We're counted as 'white,' but we're not treated as 'white,'" said Samer Khalef, the president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee." He says many in the MENA community are watched more closely than whites and sometimes treated like terrorists.

## How We Are Identified

The Census Bureau does count the Arab-American population by using an ancestry question on the form. Based on that, there are about 1.6 million Americans of Arab background. But the Arab-American Institute says it does not count everyone. They estimate the number of Arab-Americans to be 3.7 million. Counting non-Arabs such as Iranians, Turks and Armenians would bring the MENA population up to 5 million, says Helen Hatab Samham, who works at the Arab-American Institute.

She says the categories now don't fit. "More of us would identify as people of color."

Currently, the census form lists five races — black, white, Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and one ethnic category, Hispanic. But Hispanics, like the MENA population, can be of any race.

Race is an idea that is always changing. From the 1890s through the 1930s, an African-American with a mixed-race background, for example, could be classified as everything from "mulatto" to "black" to "Negro." Meanwhile, the "East Asian" category separated into Koreans, Filipinos, Japanese and "Hindus," or South Asians. The stakes were high: Except for freed slaves given citizenship in 1864, non-whites were not allowed U.S. citizenship for many years.

## Race Categories "Shift Over Time"

In 1909, George Shishim, a policeman living in California, fought to claim U.S. citizenship. Because he was born in Lebanon, the United States considered him to be "Chinese-Mongolian" and not qualified to be a citizen. The Syrian-Lebanese community rallied behind him and hired a lawyer. Studies were done to prove that the Arab population is "white." A judge agreed, and Shishim was sworn in as a citizen.

Today, "white" is defined by the government as "any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa."

Adding a new category to the census form can be a long process. The Census Bureau will test a new MENA category in 2015 and 2016.

"'White' is a made-up category, 'black' is a made-up category. Categories shift over time," said Akram Khater, a professor at North Carolina State University.
