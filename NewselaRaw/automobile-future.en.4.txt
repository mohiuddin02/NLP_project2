PALO ALTO, Calif. — Ford Motor Company is a carmaker. It has always been in Detroit, Michigan. Ford has been there since it started in 1903. Now, it has opened a center in Palo Alto, Callifornia. There are many high-tech companies in that part of California.

Dragos Maciuca runs the new center. He used to work for the Apple computer company. Now, computers are a big part of car making. Because of this, he said the new center makes sense. 

There are 100 workers at Ford's California office. They test self-driving cars. The cars do not need humans to drive them. Computers do the driving. 

Other carmakers have also opened offices in California. Toyota, Honda, BMW and others are there.

## Some Cars Can Drive Themselves

The move of car companies to California is no surprise. The state is a leader in making self-driving cars. Some of the best computer programs for cars are written there. It also leads in making "green" cars. The word "green" can mean something that is better for our air and water. California gives money to green car companies to help them to grow.

As companies move to California, so do jobs. There have been thousands of new jobs there since 2011.

Still, there are many more autoworkers in Michigan than in California.

California is important to carmaking. It is a huge state. Californians buy a lot of cars.

## Costs Are Higher In California

Still, car companies in California have problems, too. Workers and land cost more there than in many other states. Companies might want to be in a place where those things cost less money.

Toyota is the world's largest carmaker. It builds cars in many places. It is moving thousands of jobs away from California. It will build more cars in Texas over the next two years.

Other companies have moved to Nevada. That state offers money to companies that move there. Nevada gives the companies money because they want more companies in their state. They want the companies to offer jobs there.

Even with these problems, automaking is growing in California. Car companies are adding jobs. 

Exciting things are happening with carmaking in California, too. Karma and Tesla are two car companies in California. Their cars can be charged by being plugged in, like a phone. They do not need any gas.
