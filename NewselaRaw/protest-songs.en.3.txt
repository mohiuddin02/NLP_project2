BERKELEY, Calif. â€” Protesters around the country are raising their voices. They are chanting sayings like "Hands Up! Don't Shoot!" And for the first time in years, they are also singing to express their anger and pain.

In the last few weeks, grand juries in New York and Missouri decided not to indict, or charge, police officers in the deaths of two black men. A grand jury is made up of a group of citizens. They decide if a person should be formerly accused of a crime. The men, Eric Garner and Michael Brown, were killed over the summer by white police officers trying to arrest them. Protests over their deaths have broken out in cities across the country.

Protest songs have not been heard in the United States since the 1960s. Then, singer and protester Pete Seeger helped make "We Shall Overcome" an important song of the 1960s civil rights movement. The civil rights movement fought for equal treatment of black people in the U.S.

## Singing Old Songs, And New

Now, old songs are being sung by a new generation of protesters. New songs are being written and shared. Some of the songs are by major artists.

"Facts aren't fueling this fire. Feeling is what is fueling this fire," said Daniels Watts.  He is a Broadway performer who starred in a protest flash mob in New York City's Times Square. "Until we express those feelings and those feelings are understood, we aren't going to get too far."

One of the new protest songs was written six weeks ago by Luke Nephew. He is a 32-year-old New York poet. His song starts, "I still hear my brother crying, 'I can't breathe.' Now I'm in the struggle singing. I can't leave."

Hundreds of people sang those words last week as they blocked bridges and got arrested in New York. They were protesting the grand jury's decision in the Gardner case.

## A Song For A Protest

Nephew first introduced the song at a meeting of protesters way before the grand jury decision. The protesters taught it to people in their groups. They wanted as many people as possible to sing along during protests. A recording was posted on YouTube. There were links to it on Facebook and Twitter.

One of the activists, Jose Lopez, said they told people, "Make sure you are taking this back to your organizations. Make sure you are learning this."

Singer and radio host Darlene McCoy started a protest group called Mothers of Black Sons. She was at home watching television when she heard the protesters in New York singing as police were arresting them. McCoy wrote down the song's words and immediately recorded herself singing it. She posted it on Instagram and challenged other singers to do the same. At least one version has been viewed nearly 750,000 times.

Some protesters are finding new meaning in the words of old popular music. They are singing "A Change is Gonna Come" by Sam Cooke and Michael Jackson's "They Don't Really Care About Us."

Nephew wonders why music has not been a part of American protests since the 1960s. He thinks people are no longer used to singing together. Also, younger Americans are turned off by older songs about things that happened in the past.

## "Requiem For Mike Brown"

Questlove is the drummer for the hip-hop band the Roots. Through Instagram and Twitter, he urged fellow musicians last week "to be a voice of the times that we live in." He noted that "protest songs don't have to be boring or non-danceable."

Several musicians have already released songs in memory of Brown and Garner. They include Alicia Keys and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morelo.

Amateurs have gotten into the act too. In St. Louis, a group interrupted a classical music performance of Brahms' "Requiem," the Catholic religious service for the dead. The protesters sang a song they called "Requiem for Mike Brown." They also scattered little paper hearts from the balcony.

Protest songs were an important symbol of the 1960s. It is not clear whether any of the new protest songs will come to have the same meaning.

This may not happen immediately, said Ian Peddie, an English professor at Georgia Gwinnett College in Georgia. Peddie studies popular music and human rights.

It takes time for ideas to spread and for people to write good songs.
