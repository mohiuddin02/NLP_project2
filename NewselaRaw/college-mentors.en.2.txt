SEATTLE — Nearly 900 fifth-graders filled Western Washington University's gym one day in October.

Buzzing with fifth-grade energy,  the gym had all the excitement of a pep rally before a big game. It rocked with the sound of the college band as the school's Viking mascot high-fived his way across the room.

These 10- and 11-years-olds are on the brink of an important phase of life. In the next few years, how they see themselves — as smart, average, college-bound or not — may determine whether they go to college.

Western's goal is to convince these kids that higher education should be in their future.

## Aimed At Fifth-Graders

Much of the national conversation about college-going rates has been focused on high-poverty, inner-city schools. But in Whatcom County, where the university is located, the number of high school graduates who go to college is lower than the state average. And that is low to begin with.

Fewer than 1 in 4 high school graduates at two school districts, for example, go to four-year colleges. Just a little over half of all graduates in surrounding districts go to college at all. And the majority head to two-year community colleges. They have even higher dropout rates.

Western isn't the first university to use college students to help younger students. What sets the program apart is that it starts in fifth grade. That is a critical year when students start to compare themselves with their peers.

Three times a year, Western sends about 400 student-mentors into 29 schools in a program called Compass 2 Campus. Since it began five years ago, the program has reached into 350 classrooms and touched the lives of about 9,000 school kids.

The college mentors, or guides, spend the first three weeks learning how to work with preteens and teens from different cultural backgrounds. They spend the remaining seven weeks working in classrooms as tutors and role models. A mentor acts as a guide and role model to another, usually younger, person.

## Stepping In, Helping Out

The university won't know if the program works until its original group of fifth-graders graduates from high school.

But Compass 2 Campus is building what experts say is a key part of getting more kids to go to college: creating a college-going culture in schools.

One day last fall in a social studies class at Shuksan Middle School in Bellingham, three Western student-mentors watched a lesson on the Middle East.

The mentors are trained to watch for academic hiccups. These are moments when a student stumbles on an idea or a project. And then the mentors step in and help out.

"They're smart, they're college students, they've done this before," said the teacher John Sage. "I love having them in my room."

Shuksan Principal Jay Jordan asks his teachers to set aside time so the mentors can talk to students about college.

"Hey, 35 college kids in our school, four hours a week — that's a great connection," Jordan said.

As the mentors talk about being students at Western, they are also imparting a subtle lesson: I'm a college student. I'm like you, just a few years older. Study hard, and you can go to college, too.

Eleven years ago, Cyndie Shepard's husband was the head of the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. She met a fifth-grader who misbehaved.

Shepard asked him what he planned to be when he grew up. Defiant, the boy crossed his arms and said he expected to end up in jail — just like his father.

Shepard was stunned that a 10-year-old could have such a bleak view of his future. But researchers know that by middle school, students have strong ideas about their own skills and potential.

Studies have linked better jobs and higher salaries with college education. Going to college is also connected with lower prison rates.

Last year, more than 170 student-mentors from the Green Bay campus participated in the program Shepard and others developed. It is called Phuture Phoenix.

Slightly more Phuture Phoenix high school graduates have been going to college during the last two years. This is at a time when college enrollment has started to level off and drop in many states, including Wisconsin.

Washington is ranked 46th nationally in the percent of students who go to college full time after high school. This is according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES),

This has led policymakers to try a variety of measures to get more kids to go to college.

At the heart of Compass 2 Campus lies two ideas. The first is that middle school students form strong ideas about their own skills and their potential. The second idea is that starting in fifth grade, schools can encourage more students to go to college.

Between elementary and middle school "is the place where we see the strongest negative changes in achievement and motivation, consistently," said Eric Anderman. He chairs the Department of Educational Studies at Ohio State University. He also has done extensive research on this issue.

"Right around the fifth grade, it's a really, really important time to plant those seeds and get kids thinking about their futures," he said.
