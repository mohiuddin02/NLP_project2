MIAMI â€” Archaeologists who for months have been uncovering mounting evidence of an ancient and extensive [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) village have concluded it's probably one of the most significant prehistoric sites in the United States.

And it's smack in the middle of downtown Miami.

The archaeologists are working under the direction of veteran South Florida archaeologist Bob Carr. So far they've painstakingly dug up eight large circles consisting of uniformly carved holes in native limestone. They believe the holes form the foundation for Tequesta Indian dwellings dating as far back as 2,000 years.

They have also discovered rows of hundreds of such postholes stretching across the site. Carr believes they may form the foundation for other structures, possibly boardwalks connecting the dwellings. The village site borders a rocky outcropping that his team has concluded was the original shoreline where Biscayne Bay and the Miami River met, a spot long ago filled up with soil.

## Preservation Vs. Development

"What's unusual and unique about the site is that it's this huge chunk of land where a major part of this ancient Tequesta village site is preserved,'' Carr said. "It's one of the earliest urban plans in eastern North America. You can actually see this extraordinary configuration of these buildings and structures.''

The finds have not been widely publicized. But, they have already placed public officials and a big downtown developer in a major predicament. The Tequesta village site covers roughly half of a vacant, two-acre city block on the north side of the river. A developer, MDM Development Group, plans to build movie theaters, restaurants and a 34-story hotel on the site. The project would cover most of the block, including the full archaeological site.

The city of Miami granted MDM zoning and development approvals for the Met Square project, though not a final building permit. At the time the plan was approved, the full extent of the archaeological finds was unknown. The site has now yielded thousands of Tequesta artifacts, including bone and shell tools. Remnants of industrialist Henry Flagler's 1897 Royal Palm Hotel, which gave rise to the city of Miami, have been newly uncovered.

State and local historic-preservation officials are pressing the city to revisit the Met Square plans to consider possible alternatives that would salvage all or part of the archaeological site. That could require a major, costly redesign of the Met Square project.

MDM, which already has leases and agreements for the theaters, restaurants and hotel, says it could lose a substantial amount of money if that happens. The developer has offered to carve out the limestone holding one or two of the larger circles on the site. The circles would be displayed in a public plaza. Recently, MDM officials have discussed doing more in meetings with planners and preservation officials. But, they have made no promises or commitments.

"We will do our utmost,'' MDM director Ian Swanson said. "There is no easy answer to this at all.''

## Designated Archaeological Zone

While recognizing the site's importance, Swanson said there are still "ambiguities'' over precisely what it was. He said the artifacts taken from the site and stored at the HistoryMiami museum will provide historians years' worth of study and analysis.

Carr works for MDM, which by law must pay for the archaeological survey. He has recommended to his client that as much as possible of the site be preserved in place.

"If you have a necklace filled with pearls, what makes it valuable is its entirety, not four or five pearls,'' Carr said.

Preservationists say MDM took a chance when it purchased the property a decade ago. It was aware that the site was inside a designated archaeological zone. Though the site was covered by a parking lot for 70 years, Carr and other archaeologists long suspected it was once part of a Tequesta village given previous finds of burial sites and dumping grounds in the immediate vicinity.

The predicament echoes the battle to save the Miami Circle, a set of postholes discovered by Carr in 1998 on the south bank of the Miami River, opposite the recently uncovered Tequesta village site. Archaeologists concluded the circle marked the site of a Tequesta council house or ceremonial structure from as long as 2,000 years ago.

After an international uproar, and facing a lawsuit by preservationists, a developer who planned to build a condo on the site sold the property to the state for $27 million. It has since been turned into a park, though the circle was buried as a protective measure because the state lacked money to exhibit it properly.

## "Birthplace Of Miami"

The city's historic preservation board has legal authority over archaeological sites. It is scheduled to debate what to do about the Tequesta site.

Preservationists and city board members say there is growing support for measures to save and create a major exhibit around at least some of the archaeological site. State officials say it would likely be deemed a National Historic Landmark, like the Statue of Liberty and Miami's Freedom Tower. Some local officials and preservationists believe it might also be named a World Heritage site by UNESCO, an agency of the United Nations.

Making the site even more significant, they say, is that Carr's team has uncovered other artifacts at the site. Two later historic structures were built over the Tequesta village. A well and artifacts from Fort Dallas, a military base used during two of the Seminole Indian wars in the mid-1800s, were discovered. Also found were brick column bases of the Palm Hotel, which prompted the founding of the city of Miami.

"It's extremely important,'' said city preservation board member Gerald Marston of the site. "If they gave it a name, it's the birthplace of Miami.''
