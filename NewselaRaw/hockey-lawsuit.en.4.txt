The players also say that fighting caused their injuries. Their court case aims to bring attention to the violence of the game. Besides money, they also want more study of their health problems.

The retired players are Dave Christian, Reed Larson and William Bennett. They filed a lawsuit. They say the National Hockey League has promoted fighting. The league also tried to make the risk of injuries that came from fighting seem like it was not important, they said.

Charles "Bucky" Zimmerman is the lawyer who filed the lawsuit. He thinks the league could have a legal problem because it celebrates violence. He hopes that the lawsuit will change how the league treats violence.

The lawsuit has much in common with one filed by old football players against the NFL. Hockey players have also filed lawsuits in Washington and New York.

Bill Daly is the NHL's deputy commissioner. He said the league disagrees with the lawsuits.

The union that represents the players did not comment.

## Allowing Fighting To Sell Tickets

Zimmerman also worked on the legal case against the NFL. That league agreed to pay $765 million to thousands of past players. That agreement is still awaiting a judge's approval. Still, news about it helped convince the past NHL players to make their case.

"We've seen it in football. It's now here in hockey," Zimmerman said. The leagues knew about the injuries. They did not protect the players, he said. He added that rules still have not been changed to prevent fighting.

The lawsuit says the NHL hid the risks of concussions from the players. A [concussion](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) is a brain injury. It is caused by a blow to the head. The lawsuit said that because of the NHL's actions, players were at a much higher risk for developing health problems. These include memory loss and trouble thinking. Players even could have brain-related diseases because of the league's actions, the lawsuit said.

Some argue that the NFL case is different than the NHL case. They say hockey players are risking their own health because they fight.

Zimmerman disagrees. The fighting would not exist if the NHL had not allowed the fighting as a way to sell tickets, he said.  Zimmerman said that the players don't make the rules. The league does. "If they would outlaw fighting, there wouldn't be people who would fight."

Zimmerman said he thinks more players will join the legal fight.

"The light went on for them as the football players' story was becoming more told," Zimmerman said. "I think the hockey players started to see that their story was going to be heard and told. It's not that we haven't known about football players or hockey players getting hurt." But now it is more important to do something about it, he said.
