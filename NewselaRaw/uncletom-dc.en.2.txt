NORTH BETHESDA, Md. â€” A house near Washington, D.C., has an important link to the fight to end slavery in America. The house and the log cabin attached to it was the home of the man who inspired the book "Uncle Tom's Cabin."

The house was once part of a plantation and it was the home of Josiah Henson, a slave who escaped and wrote the story of his life. His story inspired writer Harriet Beecher Stowe to create the book character of Uncle Tom.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" was published in 1852 and became a huge success. It was the best-selling book of the 19th century after the Bible. The story, about the difficult lives of slaves, helped the abolitionist movement trying to end slavery, which historians say contributed to the U.S. Civil War. But the book was censored and rejected in the 20th century because many critics believed it to be very negative toward African-Americans.

Today, the book and Josiah Henson are both getting new interest. In 2006, "The Annotated Uncle Tom's Cabin" took a second look. The new book was written by Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard University professor of African-American studies known for his PBS television programs about race.

## Log Cabin's History

The Maryland county where the house sits bought it in 2006 for $1 million. Officials thought that the log cabin was there when Henson lived on the plantation, from 1795 to 1825, when he was sent to Kentucky.

But a scientific analysis of the wood in the cabin, which was used as a kitchen, found it dated to 1850. That is still old, but not the connection to the man behind "Uncle Tom's Cabin" that some had hoped for.

"We were surprised," Shirl Spicer, museum manager for the Montgomery County Department of Parks, said as she led a tour of the house, cabin and grounds. "We weren't disappointed. We were excited to have this public-owned property related to Josiah Henson."

The main house dates between 1800 and 1815, during Henson's time there. Spicer said there was an older log kitchen that burned down. Documents show the house and land belonged to Isaac Riley, Henson's owner. Archaeologists digging on the grounds have found objects from the 19th century, such as flatirons and milk bottles.

## Henson's Plantation Beginnings

The country officials are now focusing on Henson. They changed the name of the property to Josiah Henson Park, instead of Riley House/Uncle Tom's Cabin. The farmhouse is being turned into a museum, and the site as a park that will have a visitors center. It will cost $5 million to $6 million and should be finished in the next three or four years. There are plans to return the log kitchen to its 1850s condition.

Henson, who lived to age 93, was born in southern Maryland. As a child, he was sold to Riley in 1795, a move that reunited him with his mother. As a young man, he gained Riley's trust. He supervised the farm in North Bethesda, which grew wheat, corn, apples and tobacco, and he sold the produce at markets.

## Freedom In Canada

By 1825, Riley was suffering business problems. He put Henson in charge of escorting his slaves to his brother's Kentucky plantation. When the group of slaves went through Ohio, which did not allow slavery, Henson refused to set himself or anyone else free. He later tried to buy his freedom. But he discovered that his owner had no plans to free him.

Instead, Henson was sent with Riley's son New Orleans, the largest slave market in the country. Desperate, Henson was ready to kill the owner's son. But when the son became ill, Henson nursed him. They returned to Kentucky, where Henson realized he would have to escape to gain his freedom. Northern states did not allow slavery, but escaped slaves were returned to their owners as property, so Henson would have to flee to Canada to be free.

Henson and his family made it to Canada and he established the Dawn Settlement, a shelter for former slaves. Henson's son taught him to read and write when the former slave was in his 40s, leading him to write the story of his life. The book was a success and fame followed, even a meeting with England's Queen Victoria in 1877.

## Book Made An Impact On Society

In Stowe's book, Uncle Tom endures hardships and ends up being whipped to death for not revealing the location of escaped slaves. "Uncle Tom's Cabin" had a great effect on people at the time.

"It was a runaway best-seller," said Tess Chakkalakal. She directs the Africana Studies Program at Bowdoin College, which owns the home where Stowe wrote the book. The book's effect on society was greater than even its sales. In the mid-1800s, there were few options for entertainment so people would often read out loud. Because of this, there were about 10 readers for every copy of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" sold.

President Abraham Lincoln reportedly said to Stowe when he met her in 1862, "So you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war!" The quote has become famous, although there's no proof that Lincoln actually said it.

Violet J. Harris is an education professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. "'Uncle Tom's Cabin' will always have a place in American literary culture and history because of its impact on individuals," Harris said.
