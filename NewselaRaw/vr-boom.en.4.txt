SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” Virtual reality (VR) technology lets users enter new worlds. The worlds are made by computers. Putting on a headset lets you step into these places.

VR can be used for many things. It will change video games forever. It can also be used in music and in many other ways. There are a few problems that the makers of VR headsets need to fix. They must fix these problems before people can buy their headsets.

Jack McCauley made a VR headset. He works for a company called Oculus. He said headsets can sometimes make people sick. This happens for many reasons. One reason is because there is sometimes a difference between what your eyes see and what your ears hear and feel.

## Getting Eyes, Ears To Work Together

Our ears help us balance. Our eyes and ears work together. If one of them senses something different than the other, it can make us feel ill. If VR is done correctly, it can make users feel good. When it is not done correctly, VR can make a user ill.

There is also a problem with the pixels. Pixels are the building blocks of any digital image. It takes many of them to make an image. The screens in headsets are very close to the eyes of the user. The user can sometimes see the pixels. It is like looking though a screen. This ruins the trip to virtual worlds.

Game developers must learn new ways to make games. It will take some time.

## Sound Can Help People Feel Less Sick

Nick Whiting makes video games. He is working to help people not feel sick.

Game makers are using sound to help people feel less sick. Sounds can make users look in a direction. The game makers can use sounds to make a user look somewhere. They can make them look in directions so they will not get sick.

## Not All Games Work Well

Not every kind of game will be in VR soon. Flying and racing games work well with VR. Shooting games do not. They are too fast. They will need to be slowed down to work.

VR technology can also connect people. VR can make people think they are right next to someone else. This will let friends who live far away talk through VR headsets.

VR can also be used for music. Users can watch a concert through a VR headset. It will make them feel like they are really there.
