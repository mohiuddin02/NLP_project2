Students at John Champe High School in Virginia are learning all about managing their money.

Virginia was one of many states that started to offer more personal-finance courses after the Great Recession for 2007-2009. The level of wealth and number of jobs fell during that time. The state wanted to help students avoid the problems that many of their parents experienced with money. Supporters argued that American children were falling behind in understanding money. They needed a new kind of education in a more complicated world of money, or finance.

A 2012 study looked at 18 countries and found that U.S. teenagers were in the bottom half in knowing about money. The United States was ahead of France and Spain, but below Russia and China.

Seventeen states now make high school students take personal-finance courses, or classes about managing their money. Only seven states did in 2007.

Virginia students now have to take personal-finance class. The high school Class of 2015 was the first that needed the course to graduate.

## Virginia Earns An A

Northern Virginia has one of the best personal-finance education programs in the country, says a group called Working In Support of Education. The group designs personal-finance lessons for high school students. Champlain College also gave Virginia an A for its level of personal-finance instruction. Only five states earned the top grade.

Many in Northern Virginia fought against requiring the class. They said that each school district should make its own choices. Some also worried that an extra class would make more work for busy students.

Some students at John Champe High were not happy, either. It is a very good school. Almost all of its students graduated last year.

One student hoped to add another Advanced Placement course to her schedule. She thought it could make her more appealing to colleges looking for students who took challenging classes. The course could also give her a chance to earn college credit ahead of time.

"I was kind of angry" about having to take the finance class, said Jisoo Jang, a Champe junior. However, she values the skills she has gained in the personal-finance class. She learned how credit cards work and how to avoid being cheated.

## Financial Lessons For Life

The class is taught by former lawyer Mary Doherty. Students learn about personal-finance problems that could affect them at every stage of their lives. Many already have jobs. They will get help filing tax forms for the first time. The students will learn about problems that could come with using credit cards. They also learn to plan ahead about using their money.

Students learn about the cost of college and how they can get college loans. They will learn about different ways to save money for retirement, too. Retirement, when people get old enough to stop working, may be far away. Experts believe it is an important topic that many people put off until too late, though. Doherty said the class is so useful that other teachers and some parents ask whether they can sit in.

The class shows many students what things really cost. One said she imagined she would probably take on $5,000 in debt for college. She learned that college graduates often enter the working world owing $20,000 or more.

"This class is like a wake-up call," senior Lainie Gibbs said.

Teacher Toni Fasan used to be a banker. She said the biggest surprise for her students is when they learn about budgeting. That is when they learn how much it costs to live and pay bills. She said one student guessed it would cost $75 to support a family of four for a month. It costs much, much more.
