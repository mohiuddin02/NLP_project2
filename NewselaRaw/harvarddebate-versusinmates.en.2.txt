BOSTON, Mass. â€” Harvard University's debate team lost to a group of New York prisoners.

The showdown took place at the Eastern New York Correctional Facility. Inmates, or people who have been convicted of crimes, live at this maximum-security prison. They can take college courses, and even earn college degrees from nearby Bard College. Professors from Bard teach the classes. The inmates have formed a popular debate club. Last month, the Correctional Facility invited the Harvard students over for a friendly contest.

The Harvard debate team was named this year's national debate champion. The team was also crowned world champion in 2014.

The inmates' debate team is also building a great reputation. In the two years since they started a debate club, the prisoners have already beaten teams from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York and the University of Vermont. The annual contest with West Point has grown into a big deal.

## Education Behind Bars

At Bard, those who help teach the inmates aren't particularly surprised by their success.

Students in the prison are held to the exact same standards as students at Bard College, said Max Kenner. He runs the Bard Prison Initiative, a program that helps educate men and women in prison.

"Those students are serious," he said.

The professors do not look down on these students, Kenner pointed out.

## Harvard Caught Off Guard

Against Harvard, the inmates were asked to defend a position they opposed. They had to argue that public schools should be allowed to turn away students whose parents entered the United States illegally. The inmates brought up arguments that surprised the Harvard team.

Three students from Harvard's team responded by arguing that U.S. public schools should admit these students.

A panel of judges declared the inmates winners.

"The fact that we won is nice, but it isn't the most important thing," said Kenner, adding that the club is meant to help students express what they've learned.

## Losers Like It On Facebook

Shortly after the loss, students on the Harvard team posted a comment to their team's Facebook page.

"There are few teams we are prouder of having lost a debate to than the phenomenally intelligent and articulate team we faced this weekend," they wrote. "And we are incredibly thankful to Bard and the Eastern New York Correctional Facility for the work they do and for organizing this event."

## Inmates And The Ivy League

Inmates can earn various college degrees through the Bard program. About 15 percent of the all-male inmates at the Eastern New York Correctional Facility take the classes.

Graduates of the program have even continued their studies at Yale and Columbia universities, Kenner said. Like Harvard, Yale and Columbia are part of the Ivy League - a group of eight private colleges and universities on the U.S. East Coast that are known for their academic excellence and history. Seven of these eight schools were founded before the American Revolution in 1776.

While in prison, the New York inmates learn without the help of the Internet. Instead, they rely on books provided by the college.

"They make the most of every opportunity they have," Kenner said.
