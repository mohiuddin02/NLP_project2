SEATTLE— Jim Chatters tried to keep his head down after the bruising battle over a skeleton he studied was over.

Chatters was the first scientist to study the skeleton known as Kennewick Man, unearthed in eastern Washington almost 20 years ago. He was caught in a fight over race and cultural identity, stirred up by the 9,500-year-old bones. His claim that the mystery man didn't look anything like modern Native Americans infuriated Northwest Tribes, who consider the remains those of an ancestor. They sued for the right to rebury who they call the Ancient One.

Now the archaeologist is back in the spotlight with another set of ancient bones. This time he has DNA evidence that helps resolve a long-standing puzzle about the first Americans. The findings also suggest — but don't prove — that the tribes may have been right about Kennewick Man all along.

The new discovery comes from a spectacular underwater cave on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Divers came across a trove of ancient animal bones and one of the oldest, most complete human skeletons in the Western Hemisphere.

## Changing His Mind

Chatters published a paper with a team of experts. They report that the human remains are those of a teenage girl. She apparently fell to her death into the limestone cavern between 12,000 and 13,000 years ago, before slowly rising seas engulfed the formation.

The divers who found the skeleton named her "Naia," Greek for water nymph.

The young woman's skeleton shares many of the physical traits that led Chatters to question Kennewick Man's relationship to modern Native Americans. "They look a lot alike," he said.

Both skeletons have narrow brain cases, short faces and prominent foreheads. These are also found in people from the Pacific Rim, Australia and Africa.

[Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) more closely resemble people from northeast Asia. That fits with genetic studies documenting their descent from Siberians believed to have migrated east into the land mass that once linked Asia and Alaska. From there, they are believed to have expanded into the Americas beginning about 17,000 years ago.

The bones of the Western Hemisphere's oldest inhabitants — called Paleo-Americans — have an unexpected appearance. To explain why, Chatters and other scientists hypothesized that the Americas were colonized twice in prehistoric times. First, came people from Southeast Asia or even Europe, then migrants from Siberia.

But DNA extracted from Naia's teeth changed his mind.

## Link To Native Americans

Genetic tests show a clear link between the girl in the cave and modern Native Americans.

The study is the first to make that link. It proves there is at least one Paleo-American who is descended from the same ancestors as modern Native Americans, said anthropologist Brian Kemp.

That means the physical differences must be due to evolution. The earliest humans to arrive changed to adapt to their new environments in the Western Hemisphere.

"For nearly 20 years, since Kennewick Man turned up, I've been wondering why these early people looked so different from Native Americans," Chatters said. "This is one step toward resolving that issue."

The study supports the traditional view. Naia will help scientists argue that most of the people who colonized the Americas had their roots in northeast Asia, said anthropologist James Dixon.

"It's a very sound piece of work, and it makes a lot of sense," he said.

But that doesn't rule out the possibility of colonists from other parts of the world, he added.

## The Fate Of Kennewick Man

DNA has only been extracted from four sets of human remains in the Western Hemisphere older than 10,000 years. Naia's skeleton, which includes all the major bones and a full set of teeth, is the most complete.

Alberto Nava, one of the divers who discovered the skeleton in 2007, said he and his team swam through a mile-long tunnel before reaching a chamber the size of a basketball arena. They named it "Hoyo Negro," or Black Hole. It was so vast their underwater lights barely penetrated the darkness.

Naia's bones were lying on a small ledge. The girl probably fell through a sinkhole into the chamber. At that time it was above sea level, Chatters said. Her pelvis was broken. "I think she died almost instantly, if not instantly," he said.

Over the past three years, Chatters worked with divers and Mexican scientists to study her skeleton. The bones are fragile and their position in the cave is important to piecing together the scientific puzzle. As a result, much of the analysis was conducted underwater by professional divers.

The researchers estimated that the cave was flooded about 10,000 years ago. That's when the last ice age came to an end and melting glaciers raised sea levels around the world.

Naia's tooth was shipped to Kemp's lab at WSU to get the DNA. He didn't think it was going to work because the it was in such bad shape. But he was wrong.

In the first pass, the scientists only sequenced a tiny fraction of girl's genome. But they hope to extend their investigation soon, Kemp said.

The new study didn't deal directly with Kennewick Man. But the findings raise questions about the fate of the skeleton that remains locked away at the University of Washington's Burke Museum.
