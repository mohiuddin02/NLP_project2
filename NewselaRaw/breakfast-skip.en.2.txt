WASHINGTON â€” Several years ago, researchers tested the idea that skipping breakfast can make you fat.

What they found might surprise some food experts. Indeed, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, the federal government's advice book, recommends having breakfast every day. "Not eating breakfast has been associated with excess body weight," it states.

As with many nutrition tips, though, the bit about skipping breakfast is based on scientific guesswork, not fact. Indeed, it may be completely untrue, as an experiment showed.

At 8:30 in the morning for four weeks, one group got oatmeal, another got frosted corn flakes and a third got nothing. The only group to lose weight was the group that skipped breakfast. Other experiments, too, have likewise challenged the federal advice. They showed that skipping breakfast led to weight loss or no change at all.

Overweight people, who skipped breakfast daily for four weeks, lost weight, the researchers from Columbia University concluded. Their paper was published last year.

## Guessing On Effects Of Skipping Breakfast

A closer look at the way that government nutritionists adopted the breakfast warning shows how guesses can become hard-and-fast rules.

This year, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines are being updated. The Dietary Guidelines are important because they influence school lunches. Also many people look to them for healthy eating advice.

The notion that skipping breakfast might cause weight gain entered the Dietary Guidelines in 2010.

The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee collected research on skipping breakfast. Some of it suggested that breakfast skippers might be more likely to gain weight.

## Traditional Experiments Are More Reliable

One of the key pieces of evidence, for example, examined the records for 20,000 men who work in health care. Researchers showed the men who ate breakfast were less likely to gain a lot of weight.

The committee used this and other experiments, known as "observational studies," to support the idea that skipping breakfast might cause weight gain. In "observational studies," subjects are observed.

In traditional experiments, people are randomly assigned to get one or more treatments. One group of subjects receives no treatment at all. This is called a randomized-controlled trial and it is considered the gold standard in research.

## Observational Studies Are Cheaper

Observational studies in nutrition are generally cheaper and easier to carry out than traditional experiments. But they can be much less reliable.

For example, suppose breakfast skippers have a personality trait that makes them more likely to gain weight than breakfast eaters. It may look as if skipping breakfast causes weight gain even though the cause is the personality trait. These are called confounders, because they confound, or confuse, the study's results.

In observational studies, scientists try to adjust for factors that they can measure, like age, drinking alcohol, exercise, employment. Breakfast skippers in the health care worker study, for example, tended to drink more, smoke more, and exercise less. The scientists adjusted their numbers. But they are not exact, and the groups may be different in another way the scientists didn't realize.

## "Is This Really Science?"

Observational studies have received heavy criticism.

S. Stanley Young is a former director at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. He has estimated that over 90 percent of medical studies cannot be repeated later by other experiments.

"Wow. Is this really science?" Young said. "Every observational study could be challenged."

The 2010 Dietary Guidelines committee did mention one randomized controlled trial on the question of breakfast. That experiment, conducted on children in Mexico, "found no relationship" between no breakfast and weight gain.

But the committee also gave weight to several observational studies.

It said that there is some evidence that children who do not eat breakfast are at greater risk of being overweight and obese. The evidence was even stronger for teens. Obesity is being extremely overweight.

It was hardly proof, but it was enough to convince the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services. The breakfast recommendation became part of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines, under its advice for losing weight.
