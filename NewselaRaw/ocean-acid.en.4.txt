SANTA BARBARA, Calif. â€” Scientist Gretchen Hofmann has a tank full of wriggly sea urchins. These purple animals live underwater. They are not known for their speed.

But urchins react quickly to changes around them. The oceans are now changing fast. So scientists are studying urchins to learn how life under the sea will handle the change.

Humans burning coal, gasoline and oil has produce a gas called carbon dioxide. It is also known as CO2. The gas is absorbed by the oceans. CO2 makes the water more acidic. This is dangerous for animals and fish that live under the waves.

Sea urchins are very tough. Lots of animals are in danger of dying out. But urchins may live through the years ahead. They show how nature is amazing when it faces big challenges.

## An Important Clue Observed

Hofmann works at the University of California. She has studied urchins for many years. She said that the animals can change very quickly. But she is worried that the harmful conditions in the ocean could push them too far.

Which plants and animals can can stay alive depends on many things. These include where they live and how many of them there are. Not everything will make it and some plants or animals will die out forever.

In the late 2000s, urchin fisherman Bruce Steele feared for the animals. He had a good reason.

Urchins eat seaweed. Otters and humans eat urchins. Steele is a scuba diver who has scooped up the animals from the seafloor since the 1970s. He sells the urchins to sushi restaurants.

Steele heard about the sea getting more acidic. He saw right away what it could mean for his business and the ocean he loves.

So Steele told Hofmann about the urchins. The scientist started looking into his worries. Her first experiment was putting baby urchins in water with lots of carbon dioxide.

Hofmann found that the babies often got smaller in the water. Body size is very important for sea urchins. Bigger urchins can swim faster and get more food.

But Hofmann also saw that not all of the babies had shrunk. Some did not change size at all. Hofmann knew that this might be important.

## The Case Of The Changing Moth

Animals can change quickly to match their surroundings. In Manchester, England, a moth changed from mostly ivory color to black in just a few years.

In Manchester two hundred years ago, the dirt from factories darkened the light trees. There were two types of moth. One type was ivory colored. The other type was black. Most of the moths were ivory.

But ivory moths were easy to see on the dark trees. The lighter insects were spotted by birds, but the black moths were difficult to see.

The ivory moths were eaten, while the black moths did well. So the most common moth color changed from ivory to black. When pollution went down, the tree trunks grew light once more. After this, the number of ivory-colored moths increased.

Like the moths, Hofmann thought that some urchins could handle changes better than others. It all depends on the carbon dioxide levels in the water the animals are used to.

## A Mystery Yet To Be Solved

The carbon dioxide levels are also higher or lower in different parts of the ocean. In Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, there is a lot of CO2 in the water. The urchins there are used to it. But in Southern California, the animals have experienced much less carbon dioxide.

So Hofmann mated "wimpy" Southern California urchins with "tougher" males from the north. These "kids" did not shrink in the acidic water.

Researchers in Stanford also looked at urchins. They compared the animals in different types of water. They also found that some urchins were getting used to higher levels of carbon dioxide.

The urchins have shown they can match their bodies to the changing ocean. But the scientists still don't know how much the urchins can take. The sea is continuing to fill up with carbon dioxide.

The scientists also don't know how many urchins will die before they have adapted.
