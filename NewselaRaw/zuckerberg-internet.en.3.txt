Mark Zuckerberg announced a big plan to try to bring the Internet to billions of poor people earlier this week. Zuckerberg is the CEO of Facebook. It was his latest move to show he is a tech boss who can also tackle public issues.

He's not the only wealthy CEO promoting the power of technology to change the world. But the Zuckerberg group's plan to get everybody in the world on the Internet is a really big idea. It makes him one of the most well-known voices for Silicon Valley's unusual blend of business and doing good. And he is only 29 years old.

Still, some people scoffed. They said Zuckerberg was promoting Facebook's own interests. He just wrapped it up in noble-sounding words, they said. It's not the first time that people have questioned his efforts.

Helping more people get online is clearly in Facebook's interest, said longtime Silicon Valley observer Paul Saffo. It also shows a recent thing that is happening in business, he said. Rich business people used to wait until they retired to support causes.  Now they're expected to do it while running their companies.

## 'Net, Hyperloop, Loon

Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk recently promoted his idea for the Hyperloop. It's a futuristic transportation system that he hopes someone else will build. Google CEO Larry Page spoke at his company's annual software conference in May about using software and information to solve problems like world hunger. Google is also pursuing its own ideas for delivering cheap Internet service to the world's poor area. Those include using a fleet of radio-equipped high-altitude balloons under its Project Loon.

Page said the people at the conference were all there because they believed technology could improve people's lives.

Page often avoids the spotlight. But Musk and Zuckerberg have both learned to use their fame. Zuckerberg announced his new coalition on his personal Facebook page Tuesday night. That drew worldwide attention to the group. He also gave interviews to the New York Times and CNN. CEOs of other companies involved in the effort haven't been widely quoted on the project.

The same sort of thing happened when Zuckerberg launched the group FWD.us earlier this year. The group is pushing for changes in how people are allowed to come to and stay in the United States. Some of the changes would help the tech industry. He announced it in an essay in the Washington Post. A number of famous tech bosses and bankers signed on to FWD.us. But it's widely viewed as Zuckerberg's.

## "Don't Pretend To Be Saints"

The Internet.org group currently includes Facebook and six companies that make cellphone equipment and computer programs. They plan to work together to build lower-cost phones and make apps that are faster and cheaper to use. They also plan to come up with ways for companies to make money by providing telecommunication service in poor areas.

The group doesn't include any service companies. Facebook is the only Internet company involved. Still, one expert said the effort could help cut some of the costs that keep two-thirds of the world's population offline.

Others had more questions about  Zuckerberg's plan.

They noted that Facebook could have more members if more people are online. Then it could make more money selling ads. "Don't pretend to be saints. We are not stupid," commentator Alexis Madrigal wrote in the Atlantic. He was expressing the thoughts of one Internet post.

Madrigal also raised another issue. Getting more people on the Internet expands the reach of American spying efforts, he said.

## Zuckerberg Criticized for FWD.us

People also had comments after FWD.us aired television ads that supported lawmakers who backed immigration reform. In some cases, the ads praised their unpopular political positions.

"That was an extraordinarily bad idea," Saffo said. But, he added, "I think there's a lot less risk" in the new effort. "You don't see anybody demonstrating against" people getting on the Internet.

Wealth and position bring responsibility, Saffo said. "And the earlier that he's been successful, the sooner the public expects him to step up." Saffo added that Zuckerberg is "clearly still finding his way."

Zuckerberg has acknowledged Facebook stands to benefit from putting the Internet within reach of more people. Indeed, its growth rate is slowing in the developing world.

Still, Zuckerberg argued in a position paper: "The unfair economic reality is that those already on Facebook have way more money than the rest of the world combined, so it may not actually be profitable for us to serve the next few billion people for a very long time, if ever. But we believe everyone deserves to be connected."
