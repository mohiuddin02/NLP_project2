LOS ANGELES — For decades, scientists have debated whether Santa Catalina Island is sinking or rising.

Now there is a new study that makes the case that the island is sinking, just very, very slowly.

The study's author, Stanford University graduate student Chris Castillo, says Catalina could be completely submerged in 3 million years. He also claims the movement could pose a tsunami risk for Los Angeles and Orange counties. Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or underwater landslides.

Castillo said the potential threat should be investigated further. He said his conclusions came from underwater images of Catalina made by Stanford University last year.

## Photo Evidence

The images show ancient beaches that Castillo said have sunk below the ocean's waves. They also show evidence of a large underwater landslide that occurred off the island's northeastern shore about 500,000 years ago.

If an underwater landslide happens again, with tons of rocks and dirt plunging toward the ocean floor, that could create a tsunami, he said. Such a tsunami would likely head toward the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and the Orange County coast.

In fact, Castillo said the images suggest that the side of Catalina closer to the mainland is sinking faster, so the island is tilting at a slight angle toward Long Beach and Orange County. The tilting makes it more likely that a landslide could happen again, Castillo said.

## Dating Underwater Landslides

Further research is needed to better understand how big the tsunami would be, Castillo said. "It's still something that could do significant property damage, especially for the marinas. If you see something that could be dangerous, you need to find out more about it."

The California Geological Survey's tsunami program manager, Rick Wilson, agreed that a tsunami could have struck the coast from Catalina when the underwater landslide occurred about 500,000 years ago. However, he said the agency is more interested in underwater landslides that happened in the last 10,000 years; a half-million-year-old landslide is considered to be very old.

"If it's half a million years, it's ... something that, maybe, it doesn't have the potential to repeat right now," Wilson said. "We try to really focus on sources that happened either in the last 10,000 years or have the potential of occurring again in the very near future."

Castillo disagreed that there was less of a risk and said there could even be a higher risk because there have not been any landslides in a long time. "The whole island is tipping, so there definitely is a risk," he said.

## Earthquake May Have Lifted Catalina

Catalina was once part of the sea floor, Castillo said. It began rising from the ocean as a result of heightened earthquake activity on the nearby Santa Cruz–Santa Catalina Ridge fault zone. About 1 million years ago, however, the fault zone became less active, resulting in the island's gradual sinking, he said.

Castillo estimates Catalina is sinking an average of 1 millimeter — around 4 one-hundredths of an inch — every five years.

Castillo's research comes amid a century-old debate on Catalina's fate. Catalina is unusual in that, unlike other Channel Islands off the coast of California, it does not have ancient flat beaches that have been lifted by earthquake activity. In 1897, one researcher also suggested that Catalina was sinking.

Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey came to a different conclusion. A study published in 2012 reported what the authors said was strong evidence that the island was rising up like many other places in Southern California.

The lead author, geologist Randall Schumann, said the presence of ancient flat beaches under the ocean water is not proof that Catalina is sinking. The island could still be uplifting; it is just that sea levels have risen since the last Ice Age, Schumann said.

## Fossil Finds Would Be Helpful

The fact that Catalina does not have ancient, raised flat beaches above sea level, as other Channel Islands do, can be explained in two ways, he said. One, Catalina is moving up so fast that the ocean never has time to cut a flat beach on the shoreline. The other reason: Ancient flat beaches have been washed away by powerful streams falling off steep hills.

What would help definitively determine what is going on is finding fossils deposited at the sea level thousands of years ago, he said. Then, scientists could use that date, and how high that fossil is today, to determine if the island is lifting up or sinking down.

Schumann said, however, that those kinds of fossils just have not been found on Catalina.

So far, no one has been able to produce indisputable evidence of either rising or sinking, Schumann said.
