WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme Court is this country's highest court. On Monday, it ruled on an important case. The case involved a young Muslim woman and the clothing store Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.

The court said companies cannot refuse to hire someone because of his or her religion. Companies must allow different religious practices in the workplace.

Workers cannot be treated unfairly because of their religion, the court declared. Such unfair treatment is known as discrimination.

Many religions have rules about how people should dress. Companies also often have rules about how their workers must dress. Sometimes the two sets of rules do not match.

On Monday, the court said companies must be willing to change their rules when necessary. They must make sure that workers are able to follow their religion at work. Changes to workplace rules are known as accommodations.

The court was considering the case of Samantha Elauf. She is a young Muslim woman.

## Muslim Girl Wore Scarf When She Asked For A Job

In 2008, when she was 17 years old, Elauf tried to get a job at an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store in Oklahoma. She wore a black headscarf when she went in to talk to the store's bosses. Many Muslim women wear such scarves every day. They do it for religious reasons. They believe it is wrong for their hair to be uncovered when they are outside the home.

Elauf did not get the job. The store's bosses thought her scarf did not fit in with the company's look. They did not care that Elauf feels she must wear a scarf to be true to her religion.

Elauf accused the clothing store of discriminating against her and treating her unfairly. She said it did not hire her simply because she is Muslim.

In court, the clothing company said it wanted all its workers to have a certain "look." After all, it is a clothing store. Headscarves just did not fit in with the look it wanted.

The company also said Elauf did not mention her religion. It said it did not discriminate against her because of her religion. It did not even know she was Muslim.

The Supreme Court did not accept the company's claims. Justice Antonin Scalia said they were not believable. The store must have known that Elauf wore the headscarf for religious reasons, he said.

The court ruled that it did not matter whether or not Elauf mentioned her religion. What counted was that the company must have known. It simply wanted to avoid making any accommodations.

On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled in Elauf's favor. The vote was 8 to 1.

Experts in workplace discrimination said the court's ruling is very important. It could have a big effect on future cases.

## Companies Must Make Changes On Their Own

From now on, workers will not have to ask for religious accommodations, said lawyer Michael Droke. It will be up to companies to make changes whether they are asked or not.

The court's ruling was welcomed by many religious groups.

Abercrombie &amp; Fitch was not happy about it, however.

Carlene Benz works for the company. She denied it had discriminated against Elauf. She said the company does let workers wear headscarves for religious reasons if they ask for that accommodation.

On Monday, Justice Clarence Thomas was the only judge to side with Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.

Thomas said the company's dress rules covered all workers equally. It is not discrimination to want someone to follow the same rules as everyone else, he said.
