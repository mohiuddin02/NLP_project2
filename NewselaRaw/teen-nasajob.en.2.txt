BOSTON, Mass. â€” Moshe Kai Cavalin isn't your typical teen. He has two college degrees, but he's too young to vote. He flies airplanes, but he's too young to drive a car alone.

These are just a few of the contrasts in Moshe's life. He is 17 years old and lives in San Gabriel, California. He has a lot of big accomplishments for someone so young. He graduated from community college at age 11. Four years later, he had a bachelor's degree in math from the University of California, Los Angeles.

## NASA Calls, Grad School Waits

This year, Moshe started online classes to get a master's degree in a computer science field called cybersecurity. A master's degree is a more advanced degree than a college degree. He put that goal on hold for a while, though.

Moshe began working at NASA, the United States space agency. He helps develop technology so NASA can watch over its airplanes and drones. Drones are like remote-controlled planes that are controlled by someone on the ground.

Between all that, Moshe has racked up a long list of extracurricular achievements. He just published his second book. He drew from his experiences of being bullied for being different. He wrote about other young people's stories, too. He plans to get his pilot's license this year. At his family's home near Los Angeles, he has many trophies from martial arts tournaments.

## Growing Up With A Global View

Still, Moshe insists that he's more ordinary than people think. He credits his parents for teaching him well over the years and giving him the freedom to choose his after-school activities. His varied interests come from his diverse cultural background, he said. His mother is from Taiwan, a country in Asia. His father is from Brazil, a country in South America.

"My case isn't that special. It's just a combination of parenting and motivation and inspiration," he said one day after working at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. "I tend to not compare myself that often to other people. I just try to do the best I can."

His parents say he was always a quick study. At 4 months old, he pointed to a jet in the sky and said the Chinese word for airplane, his first word. Moshe was home schooled from a very young age. After studying an advanced field of math called trigonometry, at age 7, he ran out of challenging material. Then his mom started driving him to community college.

Daniel Judge teaches math at East Los Angeles College. Moshe was his student for two years.

"I think most people just think he's a genius. They believe it just comes naturally," Judge said. Moshe, however, has worked harder than any other student he has ever taught, Judge added.

## Born To Code

Moshe's quick rise has not been without twists. Early in college, he dreamed of being an astrophysicist. However, when he started taking advanced physics classes, his interest in studying the stars, planets and galaxies faded. His fascination in writing code led him toward computer science. A computer programmer, or coder, is someone who writes computer software.

Becoming a coder has been a better fit, Moshe said. He was surprised when NASA offered him a job. Earlier they had rejected him because he was so young. Yet this time, Moshe was perfect for a project, says his boss Ricardo Arteaga. The project combines math, computers and aircraft technology.

"I needed an intern who knew software and knew mathematical algorithms," Arteaga added. He also needed a pilot who could test the software while flying a single-engine airplane.

In the office, Moshe is a quiet worker with a low-key sense of humor, Arteaga says. They laugh over science jokes. Some days Moshe runs simulations, or tests in which airplanes and drones are about to collide. He finds ways to route them to safety.

"He's really sharp in mathematics," Arteaga says.

## Big Birthday Countdown

In conversation, Moshe chooses his words with care. He is not easily excited, at least not until he discusses how much he dislikes being called a certain word.

"One word I don't take too kindly is genius," he said. "Genius is just kind of taking it too far."

Moshe plans to finish his master's degree in cybersecurity. Then he hopes to get a master's in business at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Later, he wants to start his own cybersecurity company.

For now, though, he is counting down the days until his 18th birthday. That's when he will be able to get a California driver's license.
