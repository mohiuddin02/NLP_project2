LAWRENCE, Kan. — Michael J. Zogry is a professor at the University of Kansas. Not long ago he found what is believed to be the only audio recording of James Naismith. Naismith invented the sport of basketball 124 years ago. In the recording, Naismith says the first game he organized was a bit of a disaster.

## Peach Baskets And A Soccer Ball

Zogry got the three-minute audio in November from the world's largest library, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. It was part of a radio show from a New York station. The program, called "We the People," was recorded in 1939. Naismith described how he set up the game with two peach baskets at a YMCA school in Massachusetts in 1891.

Naismith said he was given two weeks to make up a new indoor activity for his gym class. A "real New England blizzard" had his students climbing the walls. Their restlessness pushed Naismith to work faster.

"We tried everything to keep them quiet," Naismith said on the recording. The students were bored with playing a type of football in the gym. Naismith figured it was time to try his new idea using an "old soccer ball" and two teams of nine players each.

## Maybe We Need Some Rules ...

"I told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket," he said. "I blew a whistle and the first game of basketball began."

It didn't go smoothly. Naismith said the players almost immediately started tackling each other. Two young men suffered black eyes while another was knocked out, and he had to pull players apart, he said.

"I didn't have enough (rules), and that's where I made my big mistake," Naismith said.

Zogry said that Naismith likely invented the 13 original rules of the game shortly after that first crazy game.

"What we know is there was the first game, then there was a second game," he said. The players were nagging Naismith so it appeared that he fixed the rules quickly, Zogry added. 

## His Grandson Learns Something

Naismith's grandson, Jim, first heard his grandfather's voice after Zogry found the recording. It "changes just about everything that's been written about that first game," he said.

"When he turned those 18 guys loose, obviously they were having a good time, but obviously this was kind of try number 1. He commented and said he didn't write enough rules. It came out of that experience," Jim Naismith said. "That makes a lot of sense."

Rob Rains wrote "James Naismith: The Man Who Invented Basketball," with Naismith's granddaughter Hellen Carpenter. He said he had not heard of any other audio recording of Naismith. The recording suggests that the game "was modified much more quickly than we first thought," he said.

## Professor's Exciting Discovery

Zogry was surprised to discover the audio and realize it was the only existing recording of Naismith's voice. The media is everywhere in our lives today, so it's amazing that some recording are still lost,  Zogry said. To find a lost recording and share it with the public is "very exciting," he added. 

Naismith worked at the University of Kansas for 40 years. He was the school's first basketball coach. The 13 original rules were given to the school and will displayed on campus.
