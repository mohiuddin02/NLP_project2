ORLANDO, Fla. — Grades don't mean much to teacher Lynn Barrett.

An A-plus in reading, for instance, won't tell parents if their child can pronounce words with silent letters, she believes. And a C or an F can't explain how well a child understands vowels.

"Just because they got an A or a 92 on their report card in no way tells a parent exactly what they did," she said. "All that tells you is a number. It doesn't really give you any kind of depth of knowledge as to what they know."

On a recent day, Barrett's young students chatter softly while working in groups on their iPads.

The kindergarten through second-graders help one another work the iPad and explain tough ideas. There is no pressure to earn an A or fear of receiving an F.

## "I Pick Up Cues"

Barrett has taught at Seminole Springs Elementary School in Eustis, Fla., for nearly 25 years. During that time, she has never given out letter grades. With special permission from the School Board, she is the only one in Lake County who doesn't.

Education experts say she is unusual. Nationwide, teachers are grading kids based on rigid learning standards.

In contrast, Barrett's students are grouped based on skills — not their grade level. Instead of issuing A-to-F grades, Barrett pays close attention to their work to know how they are doing. She keeps each student for three years in her classroom. This lets her to get to know them more personally. She doesn't give students a lot of tests. She has more time to focus on where each student needs help.

"I take a good, hard look at sometimes how they're working and watch them as they're doing math, watch them as they're reading," she said. "I pick up cues on things that they need to work on."

Barrett's approach dates back to the one-room schoolhouse. One-room schoolhouses used to be common in rural areas. Different grades learned in the same room. The no-grades approach became popular with school systems in the 1990s, said Sandra J. Stone. She is an education expert who has studied classrooms such as Barrett's for more than 20 years. Researchers say that after the introduction of the federal No Child Left Behind law, teachers began giving out grades more.

The 2001 law required schools to follow certain educational standards. It sets what each grade is supposed to know and understand. The law requires a lot of testing to make sure students are learning what they are supposed to.

## Always Adjusting Her Teaching

John Fischetti heads the Consortium for Research on Educational Assessment and Teaching Effectiveness. He said teachers who don't grade typically end up knowing how their students are doing more than teachers in regular classrooms. They just do it in a different form. A teacher might rely on observation and detailed records about students instead of grades.

Letter or number grades make it easy for teachers to see who understood the lesson, Stone said. They can be used almost as a "threat" against not doing well. In classes without grades, though, students become more focused on learning.

"They're not being judged as to what that learning is or how far along that learning is," she said. "They're just engaged in the process."

It's not clear whether students in ungraded classrooms perform better or worse than students who are graded. Stone said they perform as well or better.

Barrett is constantly adjusting her teaching based on how students are doing. Her room is stockpiled with iPads, storybooks, fish tanks, snacks — even hula hoops.

Her students enter the class at or above grade level. They finish second grade capable of reading fourth-grade-level books, she said. She still teaches the educational standards, which are required by the state. She also gives all the tests required by the state.

## Learning Through Mistakes

Once a week she assigns a graded spelling assignment. She even rates students "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory" depending on how hard they try. But because grades aren't that important, her students can focus on what interests them without fear of failure.

"Make mistakes — you're going to make mistakes," she said. "If you make mistakes, you're going to learn more because we identify what are those mistakes, and that in itself is going to help them learn the next step. And I didn't have to put a bad grade on there to give them that message."

Researchers say Barrett's students also benefit because older students can help younger students. The older students teach the younger ones not just schoolwork but also social skills. Barrett said that because she keeps students longer, older students already know her classroom and show the younger students how to behave. This means she spends less time at the start of the school year establishing rules.

Parent Jennifer Zamfino has two children who have been through Barrett's class. When Zamfino's daughter was in second grade she would help kindergartners, which boosted her confidence.

"She kind of took them under her wing," Zamfino said. "It brought her such confidence."
