RIO DE JANEIRO â€” Pope Francis told residents of an often-violent slum in Brazil on Thursday that their leaders must do a better job of helping them.

Francis is the first pope from the Americas. In March he was elected spiritual leader to the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. His strong comments on Thursday spoke to the causes he cares about most: social justice and reaching out to the poor.

The [pope](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) was speaking in the Varginha favela, or slum. But he said he was appealing to public officials, those with more money and "all people of good will who are working for social justice."

"Never tire of working for a more just world, marked by greater solidarity," he said to enthusiastic applause from the rain-soaked crowd. "No one can remain insensitive to the inequalities that persist in the world."
## A Political Message

Varginha is a slum so poor and violent it is sometimes called the Gaza Strip, after the troubled hot spot in the Middle East. The government has made small improvements as a way to slow protests and riots. But the pope seemed to be saying that such efforts were not enough.

"You have a particular sensitivity towards injustice," the pope said to the young people in the crowd at a recently fixed up soccer field. "But you are often disappointed by facts that speak of corruption on the part of people who put their own interests before the common good."

"To you and to all, I repeat: Never yield to discouragement, do not lose trust, do not allow your hope to be extinguished. Situations can change, people can change."

It was the most political message yet in the pope's trip to Brazil. Enormous protests erupted in the country last month. People were angry about greedy and dishonest government officials. They protested all the money being spent on sports events. They called attention to the lack of basic opportunities and services such as education and health care.

Going to the slum was probably the trickiest event in the pope's week in Brazil. The trip was his first overseas journey since his election in March. It brought him to his native continent. The pope was born in Argentina. Today he lives in the Vatican, a country nestled within Rome that is run by the Catholic Church.

Security and planning were complicated. The recently paved streets inside the favela are narrow; large parts of the slum are nearly in ruins. Even though he has many fans there, the crowds in Varginha are unpredictable. Still, the visit seemed to go off without any major problems.
## Slum Cleaned Up For Papal Visit

"I'm so excited, I'm going to cry," Rosa dos Santos told reporters. She was one of the residents who greeted the pope.

"This is really important for us," said office worker Milena de Souza. "He's a representative of humility and caring and most importantly, true peace, which is something we need here. Because of all the violence we've had here, hopefully, the pope can bless us."

The neighborhood of about 36,000 people was still getting cleaned up less than a day before the pope arrived. Cement walls were being poured, and state workers were laying electrical cables. Military police have been out in full force for days.

"I am absolutely sure the only reason" for the improvements "is that the pope is coming," said Rita de Cassia.

Francis traveled to the slum on Rio de Janeiro's northern edge in a modest silver car, not a limo, seated in the back and with the window rolled down. He then transferred to an open-sided "popemobile" from which he waved at followers who swarmed the vehicle. He kissed the occasional baby hoisted in his direction.

Government sharpshooters lined the route.

Hundreds of residents and visiting pilgrims waited in cold, steady rain for the pope to arrive. Earlier in the day, he received the keys to the city and blessed some of Brazil's potential Olympic athletes. The 2016 Olympic games will take place in Rio.
## More Broken Promises Than Help

Varginha is built on old swampland. It is one of several favelas that have been "pacified." The drug lords who once ran the place have been removed or subdued by authorities. The government has set aside money for community centers, libraries and a train station.

But residents say they have received more broken promises than actual help. Basic services like sewers and garbage hauling remain woefully unavailable. They also complain that police are heavy-handed and abusive, treating everyone like a criminal.

After praying at the chapel, Francis entered a small, freshly painted home decorated with balloons in the Vatican colors of yellow and white.

Pope Francis is known for his down-to-earth ways and those characteristics were on display in Varginha.

"From the start," the pope said, "my wish in planning this visit to Brazil was to be able to visit every district throughout the nation. I would have liked to knock on every door, to say 'good morning,' to ask for a glass of cold water, to take a cafezinho, to speak as one would to family friends." Cafezinho is a strong Brazilian coffee served in a small cup.

He added, "But Brazil is so vast! It is impossible to knock on every door."

And so, he said, the favela would represent "every district of Brazil."
