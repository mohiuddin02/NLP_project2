SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. â€” The principal at a middle school in San Francisco, California, put the brakes on a school election. She did not like the results of a vote on who should be part of the student government.

Lena Van Haren is the principal at Everett Middle School. The school is mostly Hispanic. She said the winners did not represent the school's diverse population. She did not say immediately who won. First, Van Haren wanted people to talk about how to make sure all groups had their voices heard in student government.

Van Haren announced the winners more than a week after she knew the results. She said that she never planned to say that the votes did not count.

## Wanted: Hispanic And Black Voices

The principal gave one idea to make sure all groups get a voice. The school could add more students to the student council. The council is like Congress. It gives students a say in how the school is run.

The school has about 500 students. They are in sixth, seventh and eighth grades. More than half are Hispanic or Latino. About one of every 10 students is African-American, the California Department of Education says.

The school is in the city's Mission District. The neighborhood is changing. Workers at technology companies have moved into the neighborhood. They get paid very well. The workers' high pay makes it possible for them to pay more for apartments. Rents for homes in the area have shot up. The neighborhood is becoming more expensive, and some people are leaving.

Van Haren said African-Americans and Latinos were underrepresented on the student council. Not enough of them were elected, compared with how many people in those groups go to the school.

Van Haren said that she wanted to hear more from those students about their experiences at the school. She wanted their voices to be heard as part of the student council. Van Haren said she would miss something if some groups were not on the council. It would mean that she would not get a clear idea of what students think about the school.

## Parents And Two Points Of View

Todd David is a parent at the school. His son Noah is in eighth grade. David said that what the principal did was wrong. He said it showed students that their choice may not matter.

Van Haren sent an email to parents. She told them the votes had been counted. However, the results did not match up to the mix of students at Everett. She asked the students who ran in the election to meet with school leaders.

Van Haren said that there were many points of view to think about. She wants to have a more diverse student council. The council should represent all the groups at the school, she wrote.

Melissa Daar Carvajal has twin sons who are sixth-graders at Everett. She thinks Van Haren may have been wrong to delay announcing the election results. Still, Daar Carvajal thinks the goal of making sure that all people are represented was right. The election's outcome shows that some students do not have enough money to run for student council, she said.

"I think it's gotten people talking," she said. "I'd like to see them act. I'd like to see them go into the school and support the kind of democracy we all want."
