For years, the criminal justice system in Chicago failed to handle court case animals properly.

Court case animals were mostly dogs. They were victims of abuse or neglect and were seized when their owners were arrested. While the cases would move slowly through the courts, the animals would remain locked up as evidence, sometimes for years. When the cases were finally resolved, the standard method was to euthanize them, or put the dogs to sleep.

Animal rights supporters in Chicago were furious at the injustice of it.

"The dogs did the time but not the crime" is one of their favorite slogans, so they developed a plan to save the animals.

## More Dogs Are Getting Out Of The Slammer

In January 2010, Safe Humane Chicago launched the Court Case Dogs program. Working with Chicago's Animal Care and Control (CACC) and funded with money and staffed with workers through Utah-based Best Friends Animal Society, the program got the animals out of cages, rehabilitated and into homes.

The approach was the first of its kind in the nation. It is now fully run by Safe Humane, a not-for-profit group that works to encourage positive relationships between people and animals.

When the program was founded, only 2 percent of the jailed dogs got out alive. Today, that number is 70 percent, and 760 dogs have gone through the program.

They have had to work hard to get through a continuing image that the dogs are simply evidence, says Cynthia Bathurst, co-founder and president of Safe Humane Chicago. "These are the dogs everyone should care about."

## "A Ruff Road Home" Showcases Saved Dogs

The stories of these dogs and the people who are saving their lives is being told in a new coffee-table book, "A Ruff Road Home: The Court Case Dogs of Chicago" by Susan Russell. The book portrays more than 20 dogs that had been brutalized or neglected, and shows them in their new homes, safe and loved. It is available online for $40 at the Safe Humane Chicago website.

"Some of the dogs were fought," says Russell, a Chicago writer, lawyer and shelter volunteer. "Some of the dogs were dumped in trash cans. Some of the dogs belonged to hoarders. Some were beaten mercilessly. Every one of these dogs had a terrible start." But this shows the resilience of the dogs and the kindness of people, he said.

The hefty 105-page book features remarkable photography by Chicago photographer Josh Feeney, a master at capturing dogs' personalities.

He has done all this for free, Bathurst says, "and that's the message, too. It's all about volunteer work. You have volunteers from CACC, Safe Humane; they're all doing their parts of the puzzle. That's how good things get done."

Likewise, editors, the book designer and Safe Humane volunteers and partners donated their time and expertise on the three-year project. The finished book is beautiful, polished and moving, and every penny from sales goes directly to Safe Humane Chicago.

## Canine And Human Success Stories

In addition to the Court Case Dogs, the organization has programs that bring dog-training classes to disadvantaged neighborhoods; trains high school students who, in turn, instruct younger children on building good relationships with animals; works with young people in poorer, at-risk neighborhoods and in the Illinois Youth Center to train neglected and abused dogs; and pairs military veterans with court case dogs.

At the heart of "Ruff Road" are the stories of the dogs.

There's Bruno, the first dog in the program, who spent more than a year in a kennel after being taken away from an abusive owner who was kicking him down the street. Bruno now is the loving pet of a family in the north suburbs of Chicago. There is Dolly, who was imprisoned in a basement before being found by Chicago police. She has now earned her AKC Canine Good Citizen certificate under the tutoring of Steve Lackey, a former prisoner who has become a renowned trainer. And there's Derek Jeter - a.k.a DJ - a terrier mix who had been abused on videos that were posted online for entertainment. DJ, too, has found a couple to love him.

There is also a focus on the people. Bathurst oversees Safe Humane's operation along with experts in dog training and behavior, who are helped by an army of volunteers. Then there are the people who brought these animals into their families.

"The dogs show resilience, but the people show how it can be done," Russell says.
