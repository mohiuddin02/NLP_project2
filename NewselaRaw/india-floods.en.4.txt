NEW DELHI â€“ Flooding over the past week has killed more than 550 people in northeast India, officials said. Rescue teams spent the weekend trying to find survivors.

The floods centered in the state of Uttarakhand. Many tourists visit the state to see the Himalayan mountains and landmarks that are holy in the Hindu religion. Uttarakhand is home to the source of the Ganges river. Hindus worship the river as a holy goddess.

The two rivers that form the Ganges have become swollen by heavy rains. Entire families have been washed away by the waters.

More than 13,800 people were missing. Another 32,000 people were believed to be trapped. The flooding was a result of the monsoon. Every year, monsoon rains shower the region. The monsoons bring life; without them, there would be no crops. But the pounding rains can also be deadly.

## Sending Food Supplies

Google has set up a "person finder" app to help people track down the missing. They can also use the app to get up-to-date information about the flooded areas.

Jaspal Arya is the disaster minister for the state. He said the rescuers are responding to the flood as if it were a "war."

"Forty-five helicopters are combing areas to find people and drop food supplies," Arya said. The roads that would be used to bring relief have been destroyed, he explained.

Television news showed stranded people climbing down cliffs. Soldiers were helping them. Around 73,000 people have been taken to safety.

Police spokesman Deepak Pandey said there were about 8,000 people still trapped in the worst-hit district.

"Women, children and the elderly are being airlifted by helicopters," Pandey said.  "Able-bodied men are being helped to move out using a ropeway."

June is the peak season for tourism in Uttarakhand. Many of the visitors are pilgrims. They come to worship at the state's many Hindu temples. But this year the monsoon arrived two weeks ahead of schedule. Many pilgrims have been left stranded.

## More Rains On The Way

Indian weather forecasters said heavy rains are expected in the region starting on Monday. The foul weather will make the rescue effort harder.

Pandey said the next 24 hours will be very important for the rescue effort.

Officials said it may take another 15 days to get everyone in the region to safety.

The army was trying to repair roads and make temporary bridges to restore land-links to the cut-off areas. General Anil Chait in in charge of the rescue operation. The army's number one goal is to get people to safety and bring supplies to those who are stuck," Chait said.

A private helicopter being used to rescue stranded people crashed late Friday. Nobody died.

Kedarnath is a beloved Hindu temple in the region. The flooding turned it into a graveyard. Bodies are buried in the rubble surrounding the shrine.

## Families Wiped Out

Radhey Shyam went on a pilgrimage to Kedarnath with 13 relatives. Then the flood struck. He was the only one in his family who survived.

"My wife, my daughter and relatives were all swept away by the floods. Nobody is alive," he told television reporters. "Scores of people have climbed hill-slopes and are in forests, who need to be helped and rescued as soon as possible."

KB Rana's three-story business complex was swept away by the raging Mandakini river: "I have lost all that I had. It was washed away by the floods in a matter of minutes."

Other survivors complained that locals refused them shelter. There were reports of shopkeepers taking advantage of the disaster. They reportedly overcharged for bottled water and biscuits.

"We were scared of dying and just kept running for our lives. We don't know how many kilometers we ran. People kept telling us to run to save our lives," another survivor said.

Angry relatives blocked roads outside the airport in the state capital. They were protesting for more help and information from officials.

"I have been here for the past three days to get some information about my missing father and mother. But there is no official here to help us. It's an endless wait," Brajesh Singh said.

The floods are the worst the area has seen in 60 years. Indian press blamed construction, mining and huge power projects in the region for making the situation worse.

The disaster was "man-made"  broadcaster NDTV said. It reported that environmental laws had been broken in the region.

The _Times of India_ wrote that dams, blasting of mountains to build roads and construction near rivers were all to blame. India's mountainous states are being put at risk, the paper wrote.
