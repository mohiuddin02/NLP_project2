But the really dicey part, according to many health experts, is just beginning.

The law went fully into effect as of Jan. 1. Experts fear Americans getting health insurance for the first time under the ACA are likely to have problems getting easy access to a primary care doctor, dentist or mental health professional.

Primary care doctors treat a range of basic health problems and send patients to specialists if the problem is severe.

Some changes are in the works that may help matters. The use of new technologies and allowing mid-level medical providers to perform some functions usually reserved for doctors and dentists should improve health care access in the long run.

"In the meantime," said Linda Rosenberg, president of the National Council for Behavioral Health, "people are going to suffer."

## More Doctors Needed

The Health Resources and Services Administration is the federal agency charged with improving access to health care. According to it, nearly 20 percent of Americans live in areas without enough primary care doctors. Sixteen percent live in areas with too few dentists. And a whopping 30 percent are in areas that are short of mental health providers, who treat people for problems like depression.

Under federal guidelines, there should be no more than 3,500 people for each primary care provider; no more than 5,000 people for each dental provider; and no more than 30,000 people for each mental health provider.

According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), unless something changes rapidly, there will be a shortage of 45,000 primary care doctors in the United States by 2020. There will also be a shortfall of 46,000 specialists.

In some ways, the shortage of providers is worse than the numbers indicate. Many primary care doctors and dentists do not accept Medicaid patients because they get paid less to treat them. Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for poor people. It's being expanded to cover more people.

Many of the newly insured will be covered through Medicaid. Many psychiatrists, who treat mental health problems, refuse to accept insurance at all.

Christiane Mitchell, who works in government affairs at the AAMC, predicted that many of the estimated 36 million Americans expected to gain coverage under Obamacare will endure long wait times to see medical providers in their communities. Or, they will have to travel far from home for appointments elsewhere.

Mitchell said the AAMC pushed for the government to pay for the training of additional doctors. But, it didn't make it into Obamacare because of the cost.

## Baby Boomer Burden For Health Care

There are various reasons for the shortages. Certainly a big one is the aging of the baby boomers, who were born between 1946 and 1964. The growing medical needs of that large age group are creating a huge burden for health care workers. The retirement of many doctors in the boomer age group is compounding the problem.

The federal government estimates the supply of doctors will increase by 7 percent in the next 10 years. But the number of Americans over 65 will grow by about 36 percent, according to the government.

Money also is a factor in the shortages. During the course of their careers, primary care physicians earn around $3 million less than doctors in specialty fields, like surgery. That difference in pay makes primary care a less appealing path for many medical students.

In mental health, the problem is that much of the work is in government jobs. The pay there is far less than it is for providers in other medical specialties, who tend to work in private practice. As an example, according to the National Council for Behavioral Health, a registered nurse working in mental health earns $42,987. Yet, the national average for nurses is $66,530.

But financial factors are not the leading reason that medical students are avoiding primary care, Mitchell said. In surveys of medical students conducted by AAMC, students valued "work-life balance" more than money when they were choosing their specialties. Primary care often involves long hours and night and weekend calls. For this generation of students, that type of schedule is not very desirable.

"Half of the physicians in training are women," Mitchell said. "You find more of them are looking for a career that might be compatible with part-time hours, that don't involve being on call. Men are more engaged in child care today, and they have similar concerns as they consider their career choices."

## Best And Brightest Shunning Medicine?

Negative attention has made medicine in general a far less attractive career choice than it once was, according to Rosenberg of the National Council for Behavioral Health. Insurance headaches, pricey technologies, long hours and the risk of getting sued have scared off some talented students from going into medicine.

"Nowadays," Rosenberg said, "the best and the brightest are talking about becoming investment bankers or going off to Silicon Valley."

Despite the shortages, many believe that new technologies will extend the reach of medicine and help fix the problem.

For example, health care professionals can serve more people by using Skype or other technologies to examine, treat and monitor patients. Similarly, patients can be fitted with electronic devices that remind them to take their medications and give them advice.

These technologies are already keeping patients out of hospitals and doctors' offices.

Changes in the way medicine is delivered and better coordination of patient care are also expected to improve efficiency. And they may keep patients out of the hospital. These changes will make primary care physicians more important than ever.

And that might make primary care a more appealing — and well-paying — career choice.
