When Olivia Hernandez was in middle school, she decided to teach herself Korean.

She had became hooked on K-wave, South Korean pop music, television and culture.

Now a student at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Hernandez jumped at the chance to take a beginning class in the Asian language. She and other students are learning grammar and the proper way to address elders and bosses.

To make class more fun, the teacher usually shows a Korean rock music video. Once, Hernandez might have appreciated it only for the melody.

"Now I understand what they are saying. Now it makes sense," she said. Hernandez hopes to become a therapist and wants to use her Korean language skills in her job.

## Sharp Rise In Past Decade

According to a recent national study, the number of college students taking Korean classes is soaring. The Modern Language Association reported that students in Korean language classes rose 45 percent from 2009 to 2013. Overall, language studies declined 6.7 percent. Interest has dropped for many popular foreign languages, including Spanish, French and German.

A total of 12,230 students take Korean across the country. It is still far from the most popular foreign language. Many more take Japanese, Chinese and Arabic. Currently, just 154 colleges offer Korean, but that is 70 percent more than a decade ago.

"There's no doubt that Korean popular culture in film and music has captivated the minds of young people," said Rosemary Feal. She helps lead the Modern Language Association.

She said that students take fewer foreign language classes because colleges lack the money to offer them. Also, students feel pressure to focus on classes that will help them get jobs later on. They take science and business classes, for instance, instead of history. Speaking a second language is important, Feal said. People who know foreign languages, for instance, can earn more money.

## Video Hit "Gangnam Style"

Some of the interest in Korean language class is coming from the children and grandchildren of Korean immigrants, according to college officials. It is non-Koreans, though, who are driving the increase in class signups.

Some are drawn by the K-wave star Psy in his 2012 international video hit "Gangnam Style." Others are big fans of the KoreanTV series "Queen of Housewives." Students also may want to learn Korean because they are interested in working for Korean companies.

At UCLA, more people are signing up in both in the beginner Korean courses and in the "heritage" classes. The heritage classes are intended for Korean-Americans who know a little Korean but often don't know much grammar. Professors say they have waiting lists for the classes.

Los Angeles "is a great place to study Korean," said UCLA's head of humanities, David Schaberg.

In a recent heritage class, lecturer Jane Choi told her students about some of the complicated Korean ways to address people politely. She used illustrations from the "Calvin and Hobbes" comic strip. These examples showed how teachers and children in Korea speak to each other.

## Learning The Alphabet

Andrew Hahn is a senior at UCLA. He said his first language at home was Korean but that he does not speak it very well.

"As a Korean-American, it is only right to learn my native tongue and become comfortable with it. And it is a way to connect back with the culture," said Hahn, who is in the heritage class.

Learning Korean, he said, will help him later when he works. He hopes to become a lawyer.

Non-Korean students say that learning the alphabet is easy. Pronouncing some consonants can be difficult, though.

Freshman Michelle King grew up in Salinas, California. She did not know anyone whose family was Korean. She became a fan of K-wave boy band Super Junior and the group Big Bang.

King is drawn by K-wave music. It's "so different from American pop culture," she said.

## Singing K-Wave Songs

King now majors in East Asian languages and hopes to become fluent in Korean.

She and other members of a campus club of K-wave fans recently visited Koreatown in Los Angeles. They shopped at a music store and ate at a Korean restaurant. They also sang along to K-wave music at a Korean club.

It's still hard for her to read Korean song lyrics fast enough to keep up. She is learning another important lesson though. Knowing another language, she said, "breaks down barriers between people and teaches them to look beyond surface level."
