BISMARCK, N.D. â€” Theodore Roosevelt, a great outdoorsman and nature lover, created hundreds of national forests, parks and monuments during his presidency. His legacy though, is being preserved in cyberspace.

A devoted group of Roosevelt scholars and admirers are finishing a design for a library and museum to remember his life. Unlike other presidential libraries, however, the Roosevelt library will exist mainly online.

The physical library is expected to open in 2019 in Dickinson, about 35 miles east of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota. The national park is located partly on ranchland Roosevelt once owned. The library has already made thousands of notes, letters and photographs available online.

Roosevelt served as the 26th president from 1901 to 1909 and died in 1919. He was an author, a soldier, a hunter, an explorer and a naturalist. He loved the country's rugged wilderness. The teddy bear was named for Roosevelt after he refused to shoot an old black bear in Mississippi.

## No Traditional Library This

A presidential library collects the papers, records and artifacts of a president so people can better understand his presidency and the effect it had on the country. The National Archives in Washington, D.C., is responsible for overseeing all presidential libraries from Herbert Hoover, who served from 1929 to 1933, on. Any library for a president before Hoover must be built without the help of the federal government.

Roosevelt's papers, like those of other earlier presidents, are scattered across the country in private collections and at places such as the Library of Congress and Harvard University.

To bring them all together in one -- virtual -- place, the Theodore Roosevelt Center at Dickinson State University has digitally scanned about 50,000 documents. They range from Roosevelt's personal and presidential notes to letters and belongings. The university, which is spearheading the library project, hopes to add hundreds of thousands of more documents to the growing collection.

"It's very difficult to create a traditional presidential library for TR, because all the materials will never be gathered physically in one place," project manager Sharon Kilzer said.

She said the digital approach could be used for other libraries for presidents who predate Hoover.

"This could be a model through which the legacies of those other presidents are also preserved and made accessible to the public," Kilzer said.

## "A Very 21st-Century Idea"

Other libraries outside of the National Archives system have also digitized much of their material. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois, is a good example of that. But those digital collections add to an already-impressive collection of physical artifacts and papers on site.

The Theodore Roosevelt Library and Museum is expected to be open by the end of the decade. Scholars hope its digital collection will eventually include every Roosevelt-related item they can find.

"And I think that's an interesting phenomenon; it's a very 21st-century idea," said Daniel Stowell, the director and editor of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln. Stowell also sits on the advisory board for the Roosevelt library.

Stowell estimated that the Roosevelt library will eventually become the command center for scholars and fans of Roosevelt. In time, it will slowly collect more physical artifacts.

"Whatever topics you're interested in from Roosevelt's life and career ... the digital images are all brought together," he said. The digital records will be drawn from sources including Harvard, the Library of Congress and private collections.

## Gilded Age Goes Digital

Last year, the North Dakota Legislature set aside $12 million for the 56,000 square-foot library. The city of Dickinson has also pledged to chip in $3 million more. Those involved with the project, however, expect it'll cost more than $15 million.

Richard Woollacott is the project manager for Hilferty &amp; Associates that's finishing the master design plan for the library. He said he expects Roosevelt's library to look "like the Gilded Age, but updated with computers." The Gilded Age, a term coined by author Mark Twain, refers to the final three decades of the 19th century.

Woollacott said the library's physical exhibit's will include computer stations where people can look up more in-depth information. The idea, he said, is to customize the exhibit to individual visitors.

Roosevelt fell in love with the North Dakota wilderness, called the badlands, during an 1883 hunting trip. He returned the following year to raise cattle. He established the Elkhorn Ranch along the Little Missouri River about 25 miles east of the Montana border.

Organizers hope that learning about Roosevelt's life and experiencing first-hand the natural beauty of the badlands will help visitors understand Roosevelt. The area is often called the "cradle of conservation," inspiring him to protect more of the nation's untouched lands. "It was here that the romance of my life began," Roosevelt later wrote.
