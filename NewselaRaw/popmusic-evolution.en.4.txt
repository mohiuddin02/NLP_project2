Experts wanted to see how pop music changed over time. They turned to science for the answer.

They studied 17,000 songs from Billboard's Hot 100. It lists the most popular music each week. The songs were from 1960 to 2010. The team used computers to study the songs. They compared parts of the songs, like the notes or rhythm. Then they put the songs into different groups.

## Years Of Big Changes

It made the experts think of interesting questions. They wondered about differences in pop music. Are there different styles or does the music all sound the same?

They also wanted to know whether music styles changed slowly or quickly. They found three years of big changes. The years were 1964, 1982 and 1991.

The largest and most important change was hip-hop in 1991.

The team also found that people listened to different kinds of music.

## Sort Of Like Fossils

Scientists study fossils in the same way, said Armand Leroi. He is a scientist in London, England. He studies how life has grown and changed over time. Fossils are the bones and remains of ancient creatures like dinosaurs.

"Why are there so many creatures?" Leroi wondered. "Why are there so many songs?"

Leroi said the study was exciting. It told experts how music really changed, he said.

## Rock And Roll's Birthday?

The experts have another big question. They want to know when rock and roll really began. Many people think that 1955 was the birth year of rock. In 1955, "Rock Around the Clock" became the first rock and roll song to be the top hit. The song was by Bill Haley. But will science turn up a different answer?

Leroi said the team could have chosen many subjects.

He guessed they could have studied books. They are not as exciting as pop music, though. It is wonderful to look at music in a scientific way, Leroi said.
