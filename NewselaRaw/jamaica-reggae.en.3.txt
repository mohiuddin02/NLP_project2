KINGSTON, Jamaica â€” Renaldo Brown is practicing his flute under the trees. The 12-year-old is barefoot and dressed in donated clothes. But Brown is a student at a Jamaican music school famous for teaching many of this island's top musicians.

"It's challenging but I like it. I'm getting better 'cause I've been practicing nearly every day for two years," said the serious boy. Brown is from the tough Jamaican city of Spanish Town.

Renaldo is among two dozen boys at Alpha Boys' School who are discovering a new world through music. The boys from poor backgrounds have all been placed there by family courts. Some of the boys are orphans. Others are placed at the home because of neglect, abuse or because their parents can't control them.

Alpha has been a boarding school run by Catholic nuns since the late 19th century. Most of Jamaica's world-class music has come out of Alpha. The school offers hope to at-risk kids. Year after year, Alpha graduates leave Kingston to bring the sounds of Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae music to the world.

## "Whole Business Of Music"

Now the school is being squeezed. Rising costs and shrinking state support make it difficult to run. The money crunch has gotten so bad that the nuns say they will have to stop letting students live at the school later this year. Alpha's place in Jamaican music may not matter.

The school is building up its own money-making businesses. It recently started an "Alpha Wear" clothing line. There is also an Internet radio station. It draws 60,000 people monthly. Sister Susan Frazer said the online radio program isn't bringing in money yet. But it is expected to make some through people paying to support the station and through advertising.

Frazer said Alpha also plans to expand and update its training for young students. They want to make sure the famous music program survives.

But students will be taught more, she said. "It won't be just instrument playing, but rather the whole business of music."

Students at the school are taught self-discipline and pride while they study music. They learn to read music and understand harmony and composition. Alpha currently has about 85 kids, and 25 of them are in the music program. Other students take the school's more traditional classes like woodworking and tailoring.

Many former students have moved past rough starts in life to become top musicians. The four founding members of the important band The Skatalites are graduates of Alpha. So are the late jazz pioneer Joe Harriott and dance hall deejay Yellowman. Many others have found work as strong backup players and session musicians. They work in Jamaica and other countries around the world.

"If you go to France, you'll see Alpha boys playing music professionally. You go to Germany or New York, you'll see Alpha boys," said Winston "Sparrow" Martin. He is the school's longtime band teacher. He's also an Alpha graduate. He has provided a musical education to many boys at the school while working on his own international recording career.

## Upbeat Ska And Rocksteady

Classical, jazz and folk music have always been a part of the school's program. But in the 1950s, the Caribbean island heard American rhythm and blues through distant radio signals picked up at night. Alpha students changed the music. They took their trumpets, trombones and other instruments and created upbeat ska. That music later grew into rocksteady and reggae.

Alpha's music program dates back to 1892. Back then, boys played in a fife and drum corps. The corps evolved into a famed brass band under the school's longtime leader, Sister Mary Ignatius Davies. She supported her students' musical talents for years. Davies died in 2003 at age 81.

The current crop of Alpha boys are excited about the future. On a recent afternoon, band members practiced under a tall building. It was full of trumpets, saxophones and other instruments, some new and others battered and worn.

Renaldo played his flute in a circle with other advanced musicians, including a keyboardist and several horn players. During a break, Renaldo and most of his classmates said they dream of becoming pro musicians.

"A lot of other people from here have become musicians," he said with a half-smile, looking down at his bare feet. "Well, I hope I can, too."
