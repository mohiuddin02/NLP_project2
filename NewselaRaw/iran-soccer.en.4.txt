LOS ANGELES — Steven Beitashour is an American soccer player. He has always wanted to play in the World Cup. So when [Iran](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) asked him to join its national team, he said "yes."

"I just thought about soccer," Beitashour says.

Iran and the U.S. are not friendly to one another. If the U.S. team had invited him to play, he would have been just as happy to stay home in the U.S. But that did not happen.

Beitashour was born in California to Iranian parents. He has been dreaming about the World Cup since he was a kid. He is 27 now, so this summer's tournament in [Brazil](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Brazil) could be his last chance. The World Cup won't take place again until 2018.

The World Cup is "the biggest stage and the best players (are) playing there," says Beitashour. "Having an opportunity to potentially be there, it's just great."

## Not There Yet

He is not at the World Cup just yet though.

Beitashour played with Iran´s national team for the first time last October. The squad still has to play three matches before it picks the final players for the World Cup next month.

It's not certain Beitashour will get a spot. But being from the U.S. may help.

The manager of Iran's team is Carlos Queiroz from Portugal. But when he trains the players, he speaks English.

Queiroz also knows Beitashour well. When he started to train the team in Iran three years ago, he went looking for players with Iranian backgrounds all over the world. That´s how he found Beitashour and invited him to join the program.

Not all the players back in Iran were happy to have people born in other countries also playing with them. But that changed after they got to know each other and play in games together.

## "My Brothers"

Omid Namazi once worked with the Iranian team. He says that people did not get along very well at the beginning. But after the players from other countries showed how they could help Iran´s team, they were welcomed.

"Within five, 10 minutes I felt like they were my brothers," Beitashour says.

Beitashour grew up in California's Silicon Valley. The last time he had been to Iran was when he was 5. He still does not speak the language there, Farsi, very well. But he knows a lot about Iran because his parents kept many customs from the old country alive.

"The culture is still part of you," he says. "I definitely feel like I've got strong ties."

Iranian coaches first called Beitashour three years ago. They asked him to start preparing to visit the country. But at that time, playing for Iran wasn't part of his plan. That´s because the U.S. national team had also called him.

But Beitashour didn't get into a game with the U.S. team. His chances of being selected for the team did not look good.

## Jumping At The Chance

So when Iran called back, he jumped at the chance to play in a World Cup.

U.S. Coach Juergen Klinsmann explained that Beitashour´s ranking was not high enough. "In our ranking in the right back position, he was five, six, seven. So it was not realistic," he says.

Klinsmann played in three World Cups for Germany. He thinks Beitashour did the right thing accepting Iran´s invitation. "I don't want them to miss out on anything. If this is what they badly want, then absolutely fine," he said.

The next hurdle for Beitashour is being chosen to join the Iranian team.

The former trainer says his chances are good. "I have a good feeling that he´ll be on the squad come the World Cup," says Namazi.
