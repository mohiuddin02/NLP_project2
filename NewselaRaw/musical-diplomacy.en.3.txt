WASHINGTON — Every summer for the last five years, Greg Hurley has gone to places that used to be war zones. His trips aren't vacations though; the viola and violin teacher is going there to teach music.

This summer, Hurley is going to Beirut, Lebanon. He will be going to a kind of summer camp for students who already have some musical training. The students rehearse and put on a concert at the end of the visit.

Every year, the U.S. government helps send musicians, dancers and teachers overseas in hopes that the artists will spread goodwill for America around the world.

The idea to send artists overseas got its start in the 1950s. That's when the United States sent jazz greats Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong and others abroad to showcase the special American art form.

The programs have since exploded. The latest rage is hip-hop.

## It's All One Language — Music

Hurley says the experiences he's had in Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Thailand have been life-changing for him and he thinks the experiences have changed the lives of his students as well.

"It's opened my eyes to other places," he said.

The teaching is slower because the students don't speak English. Because of this, the teachers must use their hands and the language of music. In the end, it all comes together for the big final concert.

"It's always great," Hurley said. "You've worked so hard to pull it off in two weeks' time. The parents are proud. The kids are proud."

The Beirut program has 100 students, including several from Syria and Iraq.

"I think it brings goodwill toward us, and goodwill happens person by person," said Hurley.

The U.S. government pays for these kinds of programs.

"With than half of the world's population under age 30, it's especially important for us to provide avenues for connecting with youth," said Susan Pittman, a spokeswoman for the government.

## A Popular Program

The idea is to use the arts to push the U.S. government's interests in other countries. Performers and teachers have been eager to sign up for the program.

Oklahoma City musician Kyle Dillingham plays the fiddle. With his band, Horseshoe Road, he likes introducing foreign audiences to Western swing, folk music, bluegrass and jazz. His band recently completed a 16-day tour in Liberia, in West Africa. It performed for Liberia's president, as well as in a town with no electricity.

"At the heart of what we do is sharing our music with these people and giving these people a taste of American culture," Dillingham said. He also holds student workshops.

## Hip-Hop Goes Global

Hip-hop artists are the most requested groups by foreign nations. Rodney Hill and a troupe of dancers were in Central Asia earlier this year. In 2012, they performed in Egypt, Israel and Palestinian territories. Hill also held classes and gave talks.

The surprise may be that hip-hop is now so well-known because of social media. The students were even able to notice differences in style. For instance, they could spot West Coast style, which has a laid-back feel, Hill said.

"We did what we did; tell hip-hop through a story, and people gravitated to us," Hill said. "They knew it on YouTube and multimedia."

Mark Katz, a music professor at the University of North Carolina, is leading a new two-year program for the government, which is all about hip-hop.

Katz, who has written a book about hip-hop DJs, says hip-hop is global.

Katz has taken hip-hop teams — disc jockeys, rappers, beat makers and dancers — to India and Serbia. In September, he will go to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to Montenegro.

In India, Katz said, the students loved everything about the experience.

"They meet Americans," he said. Katz believes it shows a different side of America. He thinks it helps students see that not all Americans are the same. "The idea is they will think positively of the U.S."
