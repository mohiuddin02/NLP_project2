CHICAGO — Ten yoga mats, foam support blocks and a qualified instructor awaited the women who filed quietly into the recreation room. They slipped off their shoes and stood in place on the mats, prepared for the stretching routine to begin.

The only remarkable aspect of this beginners yoga class was its location: inside the barbed wire fence of the Cook County Jail. The women preparing to stretch were prisoners. Instead of yoga pants, they wore Department of Corrections–issued pink and gray uniforms.

"Lovely. That was cool," said 29-year-old Kristy Montgomery, after completing a tree pose.

Like many of the women in Montgomery's division, she has a history of drug use and prostitution. The weekly class, she said, is healing. "Every time, my body feels lighter. My mind feels lighter and feels freer."
## With Yoga Mats In Tow

Yoga and meditation sessions have been a regular feature at the women's jail for six years. It all began when a group of volunteers from a local organization started showing up with yoga mats in tow. Soon, they were leading classes for the female prisoners, according to Alisa Kannett, an administrator for the nonprofit group.

The company, which is called Yoga for Recovery, believes yoga can help prisoners feel better and act better, she said. That may make them less likely to commit crimes again when they are released.

Prisons across the country have been running yoga programs for years, sometimes because prisoners have asked for them. And the programs are now becoming even more popular, according to Gabriella Savelli, director of Prison S.M.A.R.T., which has helped start yoga programs at 36 prisons in 21 states.

An Oxford University study published this summer shows that yoga classes have many benefits for prisoners. They help prisoners feel calmer and happier. They make them less likely to act without thinking, and more able to pay attention. Also, practicing yoga just feels good.

Despite yoga's benefits, it can be hard to get some prisoners interested. This is particularly true for those who have never come across yoga before, Savelli said.
## Running His Own Yoga Practice

Marshawn Feltus said he's a perfect example. When he entered the Illinois River Correctional Center years ago, he knew nothing about yoga. And frankly, he said, he didn't much want to know about it, either.

"The few poses that I had seen, I kinda just glanced it over and said 'oh, that's white people exercise,'" Feltus said.

But his shoulders hurt from weightlifting. After a buddy persuaded him to attend a session, he instantly became a fan.

"If yoga was a lady, I would've definitely said 'I do,'" Feltus said of his first experience on a yoga mat.

Now out of prison, Feltus runs his own yoga practice, which opened in late June. He credits a big part of his recovery to the practice.

Still, for some prisoners, coming to yoga just means time out of their cells, said Rick Fahnestock. He oversees the yoga program at Illinois River Correctional, which houses about 2,000 male prisoners.

Fahnestock said he can expect at least 20 prisoners to attend the yoga sessions offered five days a week. Sometimes, as many as 40 men show up, he added.

At least three other Illinois Department of Corrections prisons also offer yoga to their inmates.
## Feel Better, Behave Better

Because budgets are tight, neither the state nor the city spends any money to run prison yoga programs. Instead, they depend on volunteers. At the Cook County Jail, Kannett oversees about 30 volunteers who lead yoga classes for women.

The yoga they teach is different from traditional yoga, Kannett said. She urges instructors to avoid touching prisoners if they need to adjust their positions. Many prisoners, such as those with a history of abuse, could be bothered by the touching, she explained.

"People who've been through trauma don't like to feel like someone's behind them," said instructor Marcelyn Cole. During what is called the savasana pose, people usually close their eyes. At a recent session at the jail, though, Cole told participants they didn't need to if it made them uncomfortable.

Yoga in jails is focused on making prisoners both feel and behave better, said Dr. Elizabeth Feldman. Feldman, who works for the Cook County Sheriff's Office, says yoga can help make prisoners less tense.

Some male prisoners enjoy yoga as a break from the military-style approach of other exercise, she said. It can help soothe cramped muscles. It can make prisoners, who sleep on hard metal beds, less stiff.

But yoga is not for everyone. Prisoners who have a hard time sitting still or following directions are not invited to yoga sessions, Feldman said. Nor are those who have committed extremely violent crimes.

Yoga is just one approach for reforming prisoners, Feldman said. "It's not the miracle cure of everything that ails society. It's one tool that might be helpful."
