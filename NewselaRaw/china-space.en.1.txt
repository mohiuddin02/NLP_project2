BEIJING — Many Americans reacted with a shrug when China landed its first lunar rover on the moon last month. After all, the U.S. sent men to the moon more than 40 years ago. And the Soviets — now the Russians — landed a rover there too.

But among lunar scientists, who study the moon, the Chang'e 3 mission has generated considerable interest. The Chinese lander and rover are equipped with ground-penetrating radar, cameras, a telescope, and radiation-sensing instruments. Scientists hope this will allow the mission to gather significant new information.

They're especially interested in the chemical composition and depth of the moon's soil.

Such data, they say, could shed light on the history of the moon and, by extension, Earth. It could also help scientists design equipment to mine the moon's surface for oxygen and other elements.

In addition, experts say, the Chinese mission is testing new equipment and technology that could be useful for future missions — manned or unmanned. And not just to the moon, but to Mercury or Mars as well.

## A Punch In The Eye

"The parts of the moon that have been explored are so minuscule," said Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut and International Space Station commander. "It's like saying you sent probes to the Earth, you looked at small areas of California and New York, and now you know everything there is to know. That's not the case."

Stephen Mackwell, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, noted that the Chang'e 3 mission landed in the right eye of the "Man in the Moon." That's a very different spot from previous U.S. and Soviet missions.

In the years since American and Soviet crafts visited the lunar surface, he said, orbiters launched by Europe, Japan, the U.S. and others have gathered extensive data about the moon's structure and composition.

Now, the Chinese rover, dubbed Jade Rabbit, may help validate and refine that data. Lunar scientists are hoping it will provide detailed information about the concentrations of elements such as titanium, aluminum, iron, potassium and sodium.

Scientists are also watching closely to see how the lander and the Jade Rabbit rover survive the frigid lunar night, which lasts about two weeks. The lander and rover went into "hibernation mode" on Dec. 25 and 26, respectively. And it will have to endure temperatures dipping perhaps as low as minus 292 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 180 degrees Celsius. The vehicles are supposed to endure two such long, cold nights during the course of the mission.

"This is very important for planning other missions, like one to Mercury, which could use a lander just like this one," said researcher G. Jeffrey Taylor. "Once you get down to minus 80 or 90, the electronics may not survive. They must be in containers with little radioactive heating units to keep things up to a certain temperature so they don't get damaged."

## LADEE Looking On From Orbit

Chang'e 3 also carries a powerful camera, which is to be used to monitor the Earth's atmosphere. It also has a telescope to observe galaxies and stars. Supporters of keeping a telescope on the moon say the thin atmosphere there and the moon's slow rotation will allow for long, uninterrupted observations of a target.

"This (telescope) is another great test," said Taylor. "Some people have said a telescope on the moon would be useful, others say it's not useful and that we should do them all in free space like Hubble and Keppler. It's been a debate. So now we'll find out if we can do observations from the moon really effectively or it's easier to do it another way."

The Chang'e 3 landing came more than two months after NASA's LADEE probe entered lunar orbit in early October. Initially, some American scientists were nervous that the Chang'e 3 landing would displace a lot of material into the atmosphere surrounding the moon.

They worried that the Chang'e 3 landing might interfere with LADEE's mission, which is to gather detailed information about the structure and composition of the lunar atmosphere.

As it turns out, Mackwell said, LADEE seems to have had enough time to gather some measurements. It can now monitor the changes in the atmosphere caused by the Chinese craft's landing.

"We don't understand a lot about the chemistry of the atmosphere, the residence time for the dust, how various chemicals move around," he said. So in a way, this Chinese mission has given LADEE a lot of interesting information to examine, he said.

## China's "Very Systematic Approach"

Mackwell and others said they were optimistic that the Chinese will share the findings of the Chang'e 3 mission. Although NASA is barred by U.S. law from working with China, academics from the U.S. and around the world have been exchanging questions and information.

Angel Abbud-Madrid, director of Colorado's Center for Space Resources, strongly disagrees with those who downplay Chang'e 3's landing as "been there, done that." He said those people are missing the larger point of China's "very systematic approach" to moon exploration: The eventual goal is landing humans on the surface.

"By the time they get there, it may be 50 years since we did it, and that may not be a big deal. But once you develop a system like this, once you have all the infrastructure, you are just increasingly raising your complexity," he said.

"You get rovers, then you send back samples, and once you send humans, you're going to want to spend more than three days there," he said. "Then you're going to figure out, maybe we can generate some oxygen on the moon. Then you can really start moving ahead from what was previously achieved."

He added, "Hopefully between now and then, we can talk about collaboration" with the Chinese.
