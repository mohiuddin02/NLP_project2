LOS ANGELES — Leon Prochnik has told hundreds of schoolchildren about his escape from the Nazis. It's a World War II story that sounds like a movie. But it's more like "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" than "The Sound of Music."

Prochnik was 6 when his family fled Poland. Adolf Hitler's German army invaded the country in 1939. They had to be smuggled out of the country because of their religion. They left behind a luxurious life made possible by their chocolate-making business.

"There was this big, giant tub of chocolate in the factory" that was used in Milka candy bars, Prochnik said. "When nobody was looking, I'd stick my arm in up to my elbow and then lick off the chocolate."

Today Prochnik is 80 and lives in Los Angeles. He uses that vat of chocolate to tell schoolchildren about a terrible time in history when Jewish people were killed or put in prison camps by the Nazis.
## "Kids Love Chocolate"

Today's kids are not always interested in hearing about this part of history, he said. They don't have any way to relate to it. "But kids love chocolate, and they pay attention when I tell them how that tub of chocolate helped me get through that dark chapter in human history."

Prochnik tells his young audiences that his life was once as sweet as the chocolate the family made. They had a full-time nanny, a cook, and rode in limos, he said. They had a four-story house and lots of toys.

His family was on vacation when Germany invaded Poland. His father received a telegram. It said that the Nazis were rounding up Jews, and that the family should not return home. The news hit the family hard.

"You have your favorite things at your home, and you know you're never going back there," Prochnik tells youngsters. The family stayed with relatives in another part of Poland, but the good life was over. They even had to sleep on straw. "Getting used to that was very hard," he explains.

"I'd put myself to sleep at night by thinking about that chocolate tub at the factory. It became my sleeping pill."
## A Rough Escape

Then the German army began hunting down Jews where they were staying. Family members used jewelry they had with them to pay smugglers to sneak them into Lithuania. There they hid in barns and filthy farm huts.

They stayed in rooms with goats and pigs, he said. "It was like coming from Beverly Hills" and living in poor people's houses in Mexico, sleeping on the floor.

One of Prochnik's older cousins got papers that let the family leave Lithuania for Russia. Then they went to Canada. But some of his Jewish school friends in Lithuania did not receive travel papers. Young Leon began having bad dreams. In the dreams, he was escaping the Nazis in a big tub of chocolate as his friends unsuccessfully tried to get in.

Another relative who had previously escaped to the West paid for the family's trip across Russia and a boat trip to Canada. Then the family moved to New York City and started a new chocolate business.

His family was never able to return to their Krakow home or the factory. German officials "claimed they had bought them from us," Prochnik said.

Once in New York City, the then-7-year-old was reassured by his parents that they were all safe. "I was no longer physically looking over my shoulder," he said. "But it took a couple of years in the United States before I stopped being afraid of the dark."
## Speaking With School Kids

As an adult, Prochnik became a writer, film editor and director. He first talked about his wartime experience when his wife invited him to speak to a class she was teaching at an elementary school. After that, the Museum of Tolerance asked him to speak to visitors there.

The museum teaches about the war and the treatment of the Jews. It also informs visitors about racism and other forms of prejudice. So far, about 1,000 children have heard about his escape from Poland.

Prochnik's wife, who is Catholic, persuaded him to return in 2003 to Poland for a visit. The family's chocolate factory was gone. But Prochnik was invited into the family's former mansion, he said.

Jesus Mendoza, a 17-year-old senior at Fillmore High in Ventura County, said he could relate to Prochnik's past because his immigrant family gave up a life in Mexico to come to this country for better schooling. Jesus's father has a third-grade education; his mother finished second grade, he said.

"I've never heard anyone who actually went through what people like my parents have," Jesus said. "I think people were shocked by the reality. For him the chocolate tub symbolized safety and hope — it made him feel comfortable."

Ninth-grader Aiyanna Pillado, 13, agreed. "The chocolate tub was his happy place," she said.
