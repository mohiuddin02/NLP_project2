WASHINGTON — The Freer Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. hopes to save Asian artworks for future generations. But first it has to save Grace Jan's job.

Jan works as a Chinese-painting conservator in the museum's Chinese Painting Conservation Program. As a conservator, she cares for and repairs very delicate, very old Asian paintings that are housed at the Freer Gallery. Her goal is to protect the paintings from being ruined. But due to a lack of money, Jan's position is at risk.

Before Jan came to the Freer, she studied at The Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. She completed an internship at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and then went to China. She spent seven months at the Shanghai Museum and four months at Beijing's Palace Museum working with the conservation staff there.

The Freer Gallery is part of the Smithsonian's museum of Asian art. The museum wants to see her become a high ranking Chinese-painting conservator, like her co-worker Gu Xiangmei. Gu, 62, is one of only four senior conservators in the United States.

## Passing On Crucial Knowledge

Gu and the other senior conservators are getting older and reaching retirement which worries W. Andrew Hare, the supervisor of East Asian painting conservation, whose specialties are Chinese and Japanese paintings.

"It's very important that we pass (their) knowledge to the next generation," Hare said.

Passing information on to the younger generation has been difficult due to the lack of funding. But good news came in September with the announcement of a $1 million challenge grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. A challenge grant means that the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation will give $1 million to Freer if the museum raises money.

Freer will need to come up with $750,000 by 2016 in order to receive the $1 million grant. If that happens, then the museum's Department of Conservation and Scientific Research will be able to provide a salary to junior conservators like Jan. The department is the only U.S. program that teaches conservators how to care for delicate Chinese paintings.

The money will not only keep the program running, but it will also give it a future. Funds will allow new generations of conservators to learn the skills needed to succeed in the field.

## Repairing And Remounting Paintings

Julian Raby, who works at the Freer, says that raising money and receiving the grant is very important. She says it will help keep talented people like Jan working at the museum. That in turn will protect important, historic Chinese paintings from ruin.

In 1904, Charles Freer gave more than 7,000 pieces from his personal American and Asian art collection to the Smithsonian. The collection came from the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Smithsonian decided to show the collection. It housed the exhibit in the Freer Gallery, which opened its doors in 1923.

Even with careful handling, 100 years can damage delicate artwork. The Freer rotates its art. Every six months, the paintings are swapped out for newly restored pieces. The originals won't appear in the museum again for five years.

"Once you've faded an image, you can't bring it back," Hare said. "So that ongoing care is very important to what we do."

The museum started the East Asian Painting Conservation Studio in 1932. Grants have funded the Chinese Painting Conservation Program, which began in 2001. The program offers instruction in how to repair and remount Chinese paintings. It also teaches students how to fix the silk on scrolls, and other museum operations.

For example, some of the older paintings in the museum were mounted on acidic paper backings, which eventually fall apart. They'll be remounted by museum conservators on new Red Star rice paper bought in China which is not acidic.

## Painstaking Work, And Training

Senior conservator Gu said that she started working with scrolls and paintings in 1973 while living in China. The Shanghai Museum chose Gu to work there when China restarted its arts programs after the Cultural Revolution.

Gu said she was lucky to be considered for museum training. "They were looking for a younger generation," she said. "We worked eight hours a day, six days a week," she said of her training years. "We worked like a team."

Teamwork is likewise important at Freer. Gu says that she trains younger conservators the way she was trained. She helps them learn with traditional, hands-on, practical, and sometimes repetitive, work.

"These are skills that are learned through hands-on practice," Hare said. "It takes years and years of experience working with a trained individual, working with actual art objects, to learn all the important details, all the methods, to get all the knowledge you need to carefully take care of these objects."

Jan began learning from Gu when she started at the Freer in 2009.

"I'm the first student to do Chinese paintings but … there's no position," said Jan, who added that other students at the Freer studied Japanese art conservation. "The Freer has been really great to support me the last couple of years. It's been a great experience."
