SANTA ANA, Calif. — Wayne Irving's daughter was 15 when she asked to get her driver's permit.

"I was already frustrated at how addicted to texting my daughter was," said the San Clemente, Calif., father of four, who at the time had just learned a grim fact: More than 7,000 Americans had died from texting and driving during the previous year.

Instead of just signing the required slip of paper, Irving decided to try to change things. He began work on a smartphone app to help solve the problem of texting behind the wheel. That app has since grown into a nonprofit company dedicated to combating an ever-expanding crisis.

Since 2009, when Irving was first inspired to develop Text Kills (textkills.com), texting and driving has surpassed drinking and driving as the No. 1 killer of U.S. teens.
## Signing The Yellow Bus

Now, Text Kills is on track to visit more than 30 high schools before the end of the year. The goal is to reach the 25 percent of teens who admit to sending or receiving at least one text while driving. The organization plans to gather several thousand signatures from drivers who pledge to avoid texting in vehicles for the next 12 months.

NASCAR drivers Kyle Busch and Joey Logano already have signed their names to the side of the yellow Text Kills bus that has been crisscrossing the U.S. since 2010. So have more than 100,000 others.

"At the time, we were just a bunch of engineers and [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) living day to day," said Irving, who had been invited to Washington, D.C., to showcase the Text Kills app at a U.S. Department of Transportation event. Lacking the money to fly, Irving and his four co-developers at Monster Arts in San Clemente took turns driving Irving's RV. Along the way, they visited college campuses, where they used a one-page fact sheet to spread the word about the dangers of texting while behind the wheel.

"We educated ourselves and hit the road," said Irving, whose first stop was the University of Denver in Colorado; 1,200 students showed up.

"Many of them had their own stories about texting and driving," Irving, 42, said. "One freshman's parents bought her a brand-new Ford Mustang two weeks before college, and she totaled it a week later. Another gal told us her cousin died three weeks earlier when he was texting; ran off the road and hit a tree. We couldn't believe that folks were opening themselves up to us."
## Thousands Of Tragic Stories

In the three years since, he said, "We've heard thousands of stories from kids and parents who have lost loved ones."

According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 11 percent of all drivers under age 20 who are involved in fatal crashes were distracted at the time, whether by texting, phone calls or listening to the radio. This was the largest percentage of any age group. Of those teenage drivers, 21 percent were distracted by cellphones.

Earlier this month, Text Kills became even more serious about its mission. It filed papers to become a nonprofit company and began an online fundraising campaign. Text Kills wants to raise cash to make a documentary to offer to schools across the country.

"Our goal is to produce this thing and distribute it [widely]," Irving said of the film. It will be offered "to all the educators in the country whose departments have anything to do with the social, technological, psychological or legal aspects of texting or talking on the phone while behind the wheel." The film is titled "Smartphones of Mass Destruction."

It's all part of the Text Kills plan to make students get its message. The bus has already visited 3,000 schools, where students interacted with various distracted-driving simulators. One simulator employs a 50-inch plasma TV mounted on the side of the Text Kills bus. Students are able to drive a car on the screen, just like in a video game.
## Driving Blindfolded

"We make them drive in a race car situation around the track and pick up a card that looks like a phone and read it out loud. They read it, and their eyes aren't on the road. Everybody else is watching them veer off the track and hit a wall, and their car is spinning around. It's a nice eye-opener," Ryan Foland, executive producer of Text Kills, said.

Another simulator has drivers attempt to keep a remotely controlled toy car on a track while blindfolded for five seconds — about the time it typically takes to send a text. Five seconds is longer than it seems: At 55 miles per hour (mph), 4.6 seconds is all it takes to drive the length of an entire football field.

Every time, the car goes off the road and hits somebody's ankle, Foland said.

"If we could get people to crash because of distracted driving in a controlled environment, it would have the effect of, 'Oh, I won't do that again,'" he said.
