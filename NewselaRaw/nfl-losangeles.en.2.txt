LOS ANGELES, Calif. — The scene was a normal one: a white airplane parked alongside a fence at Van Nuys Airport here. The one unusual part of the plane was the large blue horseshoe on its tail — the logo of the Indianapolis Colts.

It was a clear message. Only it wasn't to the people of Los Angeles, but to those back in Indiana worried that their National Football League (NFL) team might leave. The Colts wanted Indianapolis to build it a new stadium.

Three years later, in 2005, the Colts started building the $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium in downtown Indianapolis. The team paid only $100 million. The city and state paid the other $620 million.

Los Angeles had again been left without a team. The city has been more valuable to the NFL without a team than with one. Owners have used the threat of moving here to get new stadiums or improve old ones.

## Here We Go Again

For Los Angeles, news this week that the owner of the St. Louis Rams plans to build a stadium in nearby Inglewood sounded all too familiar.

More than half of the NFL's 32 teams have used moving to Los Angeles as leverage since the Oakland Raiders and Rams left the city after the 1994 season. Some just put out rumors that they were thinking of moving to Los Angeles. Others seriously considered the idea.

The tactic works. Since the last pro game here, 27 NFL stadiums have been built or undergone at least $400 million in improvements.

Rams owner Stan Kroenke hasn't promised to bring his team. Still, his stadium plan marks the boldest step toward an NFL return since the Seattle Seahawks worked out in the city in 1996.

Ken Behring, then the owner of the Seahawks, wanted a new stadium. He said he was worried about earthquakes in Seattle, so he was considering a move to Southern California. It didn't sound like a real reason to people since Southern California has had its share of earthquakes. The NFL threatened a fine of $500,000 each week if the team didn't return, and soon the Seahawks were heading back to Seattle.

The Seahawks eventually got a brand new home field there.

## Wait, Is This One For Real?

Kroenke's bid is different from past plans: It is the first time an NFL owner has had a stadium plan and a piece of land to build it on. Even experts on the history of football in California think the plan may be for real.

"The question really becomes: Los Angeles is the second-largest market in the country and can the NFL afford to continue to use it" as a threat, said Bob Graziano, the former president of the L.A. Dodgers baseball team. In the 1990s, Graziano worked on the idea of an NFL stadium at Chavez Ravine, where the Dodgers play. "Or at some point" can the league make more money with a team in Los Angeles, he asked.

The idea of using a city as leverage isn't new. Florida's Tampa-St. Petersburg area filled the role for years in Major League Baseball, until 1998 when the Devil Rays (now the Rays) arrived. After the National Basketball Association's Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, Seattle became a spot for basketball teams interested in better deals from their cities. Las Vegas is mentioned as a possible city for a National Hockey League team, pretty much for the same reason.

The NFL has returned to each major city that has lost a team in the league, except Los Angeles.

## "One Guy On The Outside"

Cozying up to Los Angeles hasn't always led to improved stadiums. The Raiders and San Diego Chargers, two of the most frequently discussed candidates to relocate, still occupy stadiums regarded as among the NFL's worst.

Even without a team or two in Los Angeles, the NFL is the country's most popular — and profitable — sport. The league pulls in more than $9 billion each year.

"What's happened over the last 20 years is that the NFL hasn't taken a hit by not having a team in Los Angeles," said former Fox Sports President Ed Goren. He pointed out that the worth of teams has increased tenfold during that time. The league makes more money from its contracts with television stations that show the games than ever before. He said keeping Los Angeles "open," with no team, has been a moneymaker.

"You always want one guy on the outside and you use him. It's just good business," he said.
