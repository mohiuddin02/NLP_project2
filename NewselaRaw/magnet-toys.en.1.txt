<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/LIFE_MAGNET-INGESTION_2_TB.jpg" /> ORLANDO, Fla. — Last month, Christin Rivas, a 14-year-old middle school student in Satellite Beach, Fla., was playing with a couple of small round magnets at her school.

She needed both hands to grab something, so she decided to hold the mini-magnets in her mouth. Someone made her laugh, and … gulp. Christin swallowed the magnets.

Five days later, Christin was at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, having the magnets surgically removed from her intestines. Along with the magnets, surgeons took out a small section of her colon and her appendix.

Christin used to be fascinated with magnets, the kind you can sculpt into shapes and use to perform magic tricks. Put a pen on a desk, hold a magnet underneath, and watch the pen move across the desktop. But Christen has found out the hard way what doctors and consumer safety advocates have been warning for years: Magnets are harmful if swallowed.

## Tots, Tweens And Teens At Risk

Warning labels about magnets have not stopped an increasing number of kids from putting them in their mouths or noses. The magnets can get stuck in their bodies, where they may cause serious harm.

It's not just children age 5 and younger that get into trouble with magnets. Also at risk are tweens and teens, like Christin, some of whom use the magnets to mimic tongue, lip, cheek or nose piercings.

"Kids swallow a lot of objects," said Dr. Tejas Mehta, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Arnold Palmer who treated Rivas. "Magnets cause more damage than anything else."

That risks soars when multiple magnets get swallowed and go down the gastrointestinal tract into the stomach and intestines.

Magnets will work so hard to find each other that their force can cause intestines to twist and become blocked. Eventually the intestine can perforate, causing infection, Mehta said.

Four out of five kids who swallow multiple magnets will need surgery to remove them, said Mehta. He has heard of kids swallowing magnets and needing massive bowel resections, a type of major surgery in which all or part of the large intestine is removed.

## Magnets Sold Online

From 2002 to 2011, magnet-related emergency-room visits among Americans younger than 21 increased by five times, according to a study in the Annals of Emergency Medicine.

During those 10 years, 22,500 magnet injuries were reported. Usually, the kids swallowed the magnets, but about one-fourth put the magnets up their nose, said Julie Brown, an emergency-room doctor at the University of Washington in Seattle, and lead author of the study. The magnets break loose from their casing and get stuck.

Based on data Brown has seen since then, the problem shows no sign of slowing.

"There is something very tempting about them," Brown said. "When playing with this fidgety toy, you want to put it in your mouth. You want to try to separate the magnets with your teeth."

To toddlers, they can look just like the silver-ball sprinkles that decorate cupcakes, she said.

Buckyballs, a set of 216 magnets that consumers can put together to form sculptures and chain jewelry, is one just culprit. Last year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission asked retailers and makers of Buckyballs and Zen Magnets, a similar toy, to stop selling them.

But you can still find them online, Brown said. She has researched this and claims that more than 3 million sets of the magnet sets have been sold. At 216 magnets per set, that's 600 million magnets out there just waiting to get stuck into someone's nose.

Other magnet-containing products are equally a problem, she said. There are metallic bulletin boards with little magnet pins, refrigerator magnets that look like actual candies or coffee beans, and fishing games that feature a magnet on a rod.

## "I Hit The Panic Button"

Some emergency room doctors don't know how serious the problem can be. When Barbara Rivas initially took her daughter to the emergency room at Wuesthoff Medical Center, the doctor ordered an X-ray, then sent Christin and her mother home, saying the magnets would pass out of her digestive system naturally.

That advice didn't sit well with Rivas, who did some online research.

"That's when I hit the panic button," she said.

After going to another ER, Christin was referred to Arnold Palmer Hospital, where doctors admitted her and tracked the magnets' path by X-ray.

Normally, food or foreign objects take six to eight hours to go from entry to exit, Mehta said. When the magnets Christin swallowed became stuck at the entryway of her large colon for 24 hours, doctors decided to operate.

Anyone who has surgery on the small bowel runs a 10 percent chance of developing a bowel obstruction later in life, Brown said. A bowel obstruction occurs when either the small or large intestine becomes blocked.  It is potentially life threatening.

"Don't even think about touching them or buying" magnets, Christin advised. "I messed up my intestines. I worry about that down the road."
