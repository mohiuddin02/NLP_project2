CHICAGO â€” Twelve-year-old Alexa Torres does not live in Mexico. She lives in Chicago. But she can still learn traditional Mexican music. Her school has a new mariachi program. Mariachi is a style of Mexican folk music.

This makes Alexa's father Jose happy. He loves mariachi. Now he can share some of his favorite music with his daughter.

"She's asking questions about her family, her background," Torres said.

Alexa goes to Richard Edwards Elementary School. In addition to math, English and history, her school teaches students about Hispanic arts.

It is one of five Chicago schools that added mariachi programs this year. The programs were introduced by a group called the Mariachi Heritage Foundation.

"It gives parents the opportunity to have a topic they can speak on," said Cesar Maldonado. He is the president of Mariachi Heritage Foundation.

## Lining Up For Mariachi

Mariachi music comes from various regions of Mexico. It is played on string instruments and trumpets. Players often wear brightly colored costumes. Songs can be fast or slow.

Maria Pulido teaches music at Richard Edwards. She has noticed that parents are interested in the mariachi program. There was a huge line of parents outside of her classroom at this year's parent-teacher conferences. They wanted to talk to Pulido about mariachi.

"Last year, I never had any parents come talk to me," she said.

Pulido is teaching students to play mariachi songs on violin. In the future, the students will also learn to sing in the mariachi style.

She says that parents are excited. When they hear their kids performing mariachi, they might think, "'Wow, I know that song. I used to sing that song when I was young,'" she said.

Many people from Mexico grew up playing and listening to mariachi. Kids in the United States listen to different music and watch different sports. Even the language is different.

## A Little Understanding

Mariachi classes have helped to bring some parents and children closer together. Children can talk to their parents about the traditional music. The parents feel happy knowing that something from their lives is being passed on.

Alexa said she now appreciates mariachi music.

"I find it more interesting because I understand now what goes into it," she said.

Starting a mariachi program is not easy. Marcia Neel organizes mariachi programs around the country. It is hard to start something new, she said. People are not used to seeing mariachi in schools.

She hopes that will change. "The key was to take mariachi from being an out-of-school thing and put it into the school day," she said.

## More Violins Will Be Needed

Money is also a challenge. The five new programs in Chicago cost $300,000. A lot of that money is spent on instruments. The five programs required 450 violins.

In January, the Mariachi Heritage Foundation will start programs in seven more schools. Nearly 40 Chicago schools want to add programs.

Chicago is not the only place where students are learning mariachi. Mariachi is taught in many parts of the country. There are programs in other states including Nevada, Texas and Arizona.
