LIVINGSTON, N.J. â€” New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is running for president. He says he will "change the world."

Christie made his announcement on Tuesday. He spoke from the gym at his old high school. Supporters cheered him on.

Christie belongs to the Republican Party. The Republicans are one of the country's two main political groups. The Democrats are the other.

Christie was once very popular among Republicans. His popularity has since faded, though. He hopes he will be able to make Republicans excited about him again.

## It Will Take A Lot Of Votes

Christie will first have to run against other Republicans in primary elections. Primaries are smaller elections to see who are the strongest candidates. If he gets the most votes in the primaries, he will then run against a Democrat. The main race is known as the general election. It is next year in November. The winner will become the new president.

Christie said he has been fighting for New Jersey for years. He now wants to do the same for the whole country, he said.

America is tired of "weakness" in the White House, Christie said. He thinks the country needs a strong president.

Christie said he is ready to "lead our country and to change the world."

## Tricky Traffic Jams

It may be very hard for Christie to win. He is much less popular than he used to be.

One reason is that many people in New Jersey are out of work. Christie promised to do something about it. People say he has not done enough.

Many are also angry at Christie for another reason. Three people who worked for him were caught pulling a nasty trick. They caused a lot of trouble for a New Jersey mayor. The mayor is a Democrat. He did not back Christie when he ran for governor a second time.

Christie's people purposely made traffic jams near the mayor's town. They did it by closing parts of the highway. The idea was to make people think the bad traffic was the mayor's fault.

Christie says he knew nothing about the plan. His workers pulled the trick without telling him, he says. Many people do not think Christie is telling the truth. Either way, the whole thing made him less popular.

Christie says he can work with both Republicans and Democrats. For that reason he would make a good president, he said.
