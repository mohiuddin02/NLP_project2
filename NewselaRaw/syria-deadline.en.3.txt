GENEVA â€” Syria has to get rid of its poison gas weapons, according to a deal struck Saturday by the United States and Russia. Syria President Bashar al-Assad has one week to show what kind of weapons his country has and where they are being kept.

There is a November deadline for getting rid of Syria's ability to make the weapons. All materials that could be used to make such weapons would have to be destroyed by the middle of next year. One U.S. official called the deadlines ambitious.

The agreement says international inspectors would be able to examine any sites in Syria immediately. Nobody would be able to get in the way. Their initial inspections are to be completed in November.

U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed the U.S.-Russian agreement. He called it an "important, concrete step" toward the goal of destroying the weapons. But he warned that "the United States remains prepared to act" if the peaceful solution does not work.

## Russia Calling The Shots?

The prospect of a U.S. military strike seemed just hours away only two weeks ago. Now it appears remote. A military strike could be authorized if Syria does not follow the agreement. But the U.N. Security Council would have to approve an attack. Russia can stop the council from saying yes through a veto. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said an attack was not an option for now.

Syria and Assad did not immediately react to the agreement. Syria probably will do what Russia has agreed to. Syria gets most of its weapons from Russia.

Syrian rebels were not happy with the agreement. They said it failed to hold Assad accountable for the deaths of hundreds of people killed with poison gas. But rebel Gen. Salim Idriss said his group would help the work of inspectors. It would hold its fire when inspectors pass through government-held areas where rebels are fighting.

Idriss heads the Syrian Military Council. The U.S. supports his group. But Idriss said the rebels would not agree to a general cease-fire. "In regions under our control, there are no chemical weapons," he said.

But it was unknown how other rebel groups would respond. Those groups include two that have ties to al-Qaida. They are also the Syrian rebels' best fighters.

## Two Rebel Groups Might Cause Problems

Magnus Ranstorp is an expert on terrorism at the Swedish Defense College. He said that both groups do not like the United States, Russia or the United Nations. They could target the attempt to control poison gas. Rebels from Central Asia and the Caucasus have fought bitter battles against Russia. They could try to cause problems.

"I think this is definitely a risk," he said.

The agreement is spelled out in a four-page document. It is a remarkable event in the 30-month Syrian Civil War. More than 100,000 people from both sides have been killed and 6.5 million people have been forced from their homes in the past 2 1/2 years. Until recently, there also seemed to be no way the United States and Russia could agree about how the conflict should be resolved.

Only two weeks ago, the United States appeared to be just hours away from sending cruise missiles into Syria. The strike was going to be punishment for a supposed Aug. 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of people. Russia was defending Syria. It insisted that the rebels, not the government, were responsible.

At one point, Russian President Vladimir Putin called U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry a liar. Last week, Putin wrote a column that appeared in the New York Times. It accused the United States of violating international law with its Syrian threats.

## Mistrust Between U.S. And Russia Remains

But the two countries took just two days to hammer out the agreement. There was little sign of bad feelings when the agreement was announced on Saturday.

The agreement itself also suggested that U.S. and Russian officials had shared information with one another during the talks. The agreement says the two sides had agreed on estimates of how much poison gas Assad had. One official said the negotiators had concluded that Assad has about 1,000 tonnes of poison gas. A tonne is a metric measurement equal to about 2,200 pounds.

Kerry still indicated the U.S. did not completely trust Russia. He recalled what President Ronald Reagan said about dealing with the Soviet Union: "Trust, but verify." Verify means you have to make sure.

"Verify, then verify" is the new U.S. motto, Kerry said.
