WASHINGTON -- U.S. shoppers who buy hardwood floors and furniture should check to see if its made from Russian timber. If so, they may be hurting a rare, [endangered tiger](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species).

These warnings are from a report by the World Wildlife Fund. The study is about loggers in eastern Russia. It shows how they threaten old-growth Mongolian oak trees and other species. The Amur tiger cannot survive without these trees, which form their habitat. Environmental groups estimate that there are only about 450 Amur tigers left in the wild.

The loggers abuse permits for thinning out diseased trees. They also just flat-out break the law by cutting trees down on protected lands. They sell the oak to manufacturers in China. Chinese manufacturers use the illegal wood in products exported to the United States and Europe, the WWF said.

## Breaking the Food Chain

This logging threatens the Amur tiger. The Amur tiger is sometimes called the Siberian tiger. Mongolian oak trees are an important part of the food chain that feeds the tiger. The oak drops acorns that are eaten by deer and wild boar. These animals are what the Amur tiger eats. So the tiger's food sources are disappearing with the trees. New roads being built by loggers. Those roads make it easier for poachers to kill the rare tiger and its prey.

"U.S. consumers can be part of this without knowing it," said Linda Walker. She works for the WWF. Other wood species cut down illegally are sent to China for use in finished products. They are then sold in the United States.

"There is no expert in the world who can tell from looking at the wood that this is a different species," said Nikolay Shmatkov. He is the Moscow-based coordinator for the WWF. Shmatkov deals with forests in Russia.  He was in Washington, D.C., on Monday to talk about Russian logging. WWF officials watching forests in Russia's far-eastern provinces have been threatened by companies that log illegally, he said.

The WWF and other environmental groups are angry. From 2004 to 2011, oak timber exports from Russia to China were two to four times too high.

Shmatkov estimated that from 2007 to 2008, Russian loggers cut 52.9 million cubic feet of wood more than they should have. This is all happening where the tigers live.

## Trade Conflict?

The issue could become a trade problem with Russia. The practice seems to go against 2008 changes to the Lacey Act. The Lacey Act is a broad nature-protection law from 1900. The new changes mean that American companies that import forest products have to be sure that the wood was gotten legally in the country it came from.

The changes mean that U.S. companies now have to also follow the laws in the exporting countries. They are also on the hook for wrongdoing by suppliers or middlemen. It is not enough to know that the product is coming from China. Importers must now know where the Chinese companies they do business with are getting their wood products.

The famous guitar maker Gibson recently got in trouble. It broke rules related to imported wood. Gibson and the government made a deal to avoid prosecution in August. The company paid a $350,000 fine and promised to do a better job buying wood from legal sources.

Gibson's use of rare wood was discovered by the Environmental Investigation Agency, or EIA. Sascha von Bismarck, who is head of the EIA says that punishing companies will send a clear message: the United States is closing the door to illegal wood and all the harm it does.

The State Department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture both have large outreach programs in other countries. The programs are meant to teach how to follow the Lacey Act's new rules.

To avoid making the problem worse, the WWF's Walker said consumers should try to buy their hardwood products from companies that sell products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Few Russian companies have such certification.

"Consumers can purchase FSC-certified flooring or furniture. That is the easiest way to ensure that they are not adding to the destruction of the Russian Far East's last tiger habitat," the WWF report said.
