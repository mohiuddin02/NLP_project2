LONDON — In a north London hospital, scientists are growing noses, ears and blood vessels in a bold attempt to make body parts in the laboratory.

Labs worldwide are pursuing the futuristic idea of growing organs for transplant. Mayor Boris Johnson showcased the London work as he announced a plan to attract more labs to do cutting-edge health and science research in the area.

So far, only a handful of patients have received the London-made body parts, including tear ducts, blood vessels and windpipes. Researchers hope to be able to use even more body parts soon on patients who need them. One of the researchers' goals is to attach the world's first nose made from stem cells. These are cells in the body that can be made into blood cells or skin cells.

"It's like making a cake," said Alexander Seifalian at University College London, the scientist leading the effort. "We just use a different kind of oven."

## From Forearm To Face

Britain has invested nearly $6.7 million to increase research in the London-Oxford-Cambridge area. The country wants to attract companies to the area for collaboration and to support research and manufacturing. A major center for biological research will open in London next year.

University College London is a partner in the campaign. On a recent trip there, Seifalian showed off the sophisticated machine that creates molds for various organs. The material used to make the organs is a chemical mixture called a polymer.

Last year, Seifalian and his team used that polymer material to mold a nose for a British man who had lost his when he got sick with cancer. They added a salt and sugar solution to the mold to recreate the sponge-like feel of a natural nose. Stem cells were taken from the patient's fat and grown in the lab for two weeks before being used to cover the nose framework. Later, the nose was implanted into the man's forearm so that skin would grow to cover it.

Seifalian said he and his team don't know when they'll be able to transfer the nose to the patient's face. They are waiting for approval from regulatory authorities. A regulatory agency enforces safety standards. They couldn't say when they might receive approval.

The material Seifalian uses for the organs has been patented — or protected by law. No other scientists are allowed to make the organs he created. He's also applied for patents for the lab's blood vessels, tear ducts and windpipes.

The team is creating other body parts including heart parts and ears. People born without ears will test the lab-made ones later this year in India and London.

## "Pretty Amazing"

Ears are harder to make than noses, according to Dr. Michelle Griffin, a plastic surgeon who has made dozens of ears and noses in Seifalian's lab. She says it's tricky to copy all the ear's lines and curves.

Today children who need new ears must have an invasive surgery, says Griffin. The operation involves taking cartilage from their ribs. Cartilage is elastic tissue covering the skeleton that turns to bone later in life. She added that the team plans to create an entirely artificial face. Scientists first must prove their polymer frameworks won't accidentally burst out of the skin.

Scientists have to perfect noses and ears before making more complicated body parts, explains Eileen Gentleman. She is a stem cell expert at King's College London who is not involved in Seifalian's research. Among the more complicated body parts to create are kidneys, lungs and livers.  She says the fact that Seifalian has created a functional windpipe and other body parts is "pretty amazing."

Some scientists predict certain lab-made organs will soon cease to be experimental.

"I'm convinced engineered organs are going to be on the market soon," said Suchitra Sumitran-Holgersson, a professor of biology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. She has transferred lab-made blood vessels into a handful of patients. By 2016, she plans to offer the surgery to more people. First, she must get approval from the government.

Seifalian hopes lab-made organs will one day be available for a few hundred dollars. Different sized noses could be manufactured so that surgeons could choose the size and then tailor it to their patients. "People think your nose is very individual and personal, but this is something that we could mass produce like in a factory one day."
