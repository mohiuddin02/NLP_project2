### PRO: Getting them ready for their day in court

INDIANAPOLIS — People have long crossed the border from Mexico to get into the U.S. without the proper permission. Nowadays, more and more of them are children from Central America. Many of them have been winding up in Indiana.

From 2004 to 2010, the federal government hired a youth jail center in Vincennes, Indiana, to hold immigrant children. It was supposed to house the most dangerous children.

These children arrived at the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village. Some were picked out at the border because of tattoos that made them seem like gang members. Others were stopped because they seemed to be on drugs or had committed crimes in their home countries. Some had caused trouble or run away from immigrant housing in the United States. A few had U.S. police records.

I run the Immigration Clinic of Indiana University's law school. I went to Vincennes with volunteer law school students. We went to provide legal help to these kids.

## Harsh Treatment At One Center

The U.S. government helped pay for my law students and me to meet with the children. We explained to them their legal rights and what they could expect in immigration court.

The government doesn't give children or adults the right to free lawyers in immigration court. As a result, we interviewed the children to match some with lawyers willing to work for free.

We found children fleeing abuse at home, gang violence and drugs. Some were mistreated in other U.S. holding centers.

These children were qualified to stay in the U.S. because they were abandoned or victims of crime. Some had been taken from their homes and forced to work. Many were reunited with family in the United States, while others went home voluntarily. Some were sent home.

At one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes protested peacefully against the conditions at the holding centers. The police were called in with riot gear, clubs and a police dog. Children were confined to their rooms, not allowed contact with others, and given other harsh treatment.

When they told my law school students of their bad treatment, we notified the U.S. government. It took immediate action. Soon after, the private holding center stopped housing immigrant children.

## Protecting Victims Of Violence

Our government's treatment of immigrant children is like what happened at Vincennes — it's just happening in a much larger way.

As the violence in Central America increases, children are gathering along the border to escape.

U.S. immigration and refugee law protects victims of violence. Certainly, it is not a perfect system. But Obama and White House officials are dedicated to protecting immigrant children within today's political and legal limits.

People afraid of being hurt can ask for protection in the U.S. It doesn't matter what country they come from. Our laws allow them the right to ask to stay here and be protected as refugees.

Not every child should be allowed to stay. But turning children away at gunpoint goes against our laws and our history. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their legal rights protected, allowed to stay when appropriate, and sent back home safely as necessary.

### CON: Keeping them out of the U.S.

WASHINGTON — There's an immigration disaster happening at the U.S.-Mexico border and President Obama is partly to blame. His poor handling of the situation encourages people to make the dangerous and illegal crossing into the U.S.

Obama should try to secure the border and discourage illegal crossings.

The president has been trying to please everyone. He wants to keep Latino leaders happy because he needs their votes and support. At the same time, he wants to convince Central Americans not to start the dangerous journey north.

The crisis has been made worse by talk in Washington that immigrants here illegally would be allowed to stay here. The talk started in 2012 when Obama decided to stop deporting youth with close ties to the United States. Then news spread that young children arriving at the border were being released until their hearings. It increased the rumors that immigrants would be allowed to stay.

## "Pull" And "Push"

Last month, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez blamed unclear U.S. immigration rules. The Central American leader said it can "pull" people to rush across the U.S. border.

Hernandez also explained what may "push" people to leave their countries: drug violence and deadly street gangs. Neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala face the same problems. Unfortunately, these are poor nations. Their governments are unable to deal with these challenges.

Supporters of immigrants say that more than half of those arriving recently may qualify for special permission to stay here. Such permission is granted to refugees, or people who are forced to leave their country because of disaster or violence. The supporters say the law requires the immigrants be allowed to plead their case in court.

A May survey by the Border Patrol found something different. Nearly all of the immigrants they interviewed made the trek because of rumors of weak border patrols. According to sources in Central America, so-called "coyotes" — criminals who make their living smuggling people — promise that the U.S. border is easy to cross. It brings in more business for them.

Part of how Obama handled the border crisis badly was to overuse a 2008 law that requires a complicated hearing if an immigrant asks for protection in the U.S. The law was designed to protect people who were being moved across the border by others. Usually, it was to force them to work in bad conditions for little or no money.

## A Stronger Border Needed

The current crisis is not about such people. It's about people who have decided to come on their own. Border guards should be allowed to use their judgment. Let them pick out the people who are truly refugees or victims of crime.

Of course, refugees must be protected. However, the United Nations should work with local governments to offer relief to refugees in their own country. It shouldn't wait for them to run all the way to the U.S. border.

One thing we all can agree upon is that no one should risk the thousand-mile journey through Mexico. Many migrants are abused, robbed, or killed along the way.

The appearance of a weak border persuades people to risk their lives. We must change that immediately.

Securing the border is Obama's job, but he wants to blame Congress. It's not the job of Congress. Obama must say strongly that illegal crossings will be stopped. He must declare that most new arrivals will be turned around. He must end the rumors that people who are already here without permission will be allowed to stay.

Blaming Congress only makes things worse. We all need to work together to end the crisis and fix an immigration system that is failing the country.
