MINNEAPOLIS â€” At first glance, the small farm near Lino Lakes, Minn., looks much like other charming hobby farms in the area. But it is unique in Minnesota and maybe the nation for now.

The patch of corn near the driveway is a special white variety handed down by generations of Oneida Indians. The black beans sprouting on nearby vines were grown for centuries by the Hopi. There's squash from the Lakota tribe, and corn from the Dakotas.

And then there's the group of city teenagers who are learning to harvest, cook and bring to market the plants that fed their ancestors.

The farm is the heart of an organization called Dream of Wild Health. This St. Paul, Minn., nonprofit is part of a small but growing national movement to collect and save seeds once cultivated by Indian communities.

## Seeding Health And Well-Being

The seeds are a direct link to Minnesota's earliest agriculture. And they're at the core of the nonprofit's mission to improve Indians' health and well-being. One way they hope to do this is by creating a new generation of health-conscious leaders.

"There is history in those plants," said executive director Diane Wilson, as she watched the teens pulling up vegetables. The youth, she said, are helping to keep that genetic history alive, so that it can be passed down to future generations.

Dream of Wild Health was founded in 2000 by Sally Auger. The project took off when a package of seeds arrived from an elderly Potawatomi woman from Wisconsin named Cora Baker. She had become an unofficial "Keeper of the Seeds" entrusted to her by Indians from across the region.

"I had prayed and prayed that someone would take up gardening again," she wrote. "I am very pleased to learn about your project."

In 2003, the nonprofit purchased a 10-acre farm outside the city of Hugo in Washington County. There it began its agricultural and health care experiment. Baker died, but the seeds kept coming. One elderly donor had saved seeds in a sock in her drawer for decades, said Auger. The Lac Courtes Oreilles band in Wisconsin shared some of its oldest seeds. Word spread.

"People at the powwow talk," said Auger. "They'd been holding the seeds so long. They wanted them alive again."

## Plants For Food And Medicine

It was exciting for the new organization, like opening a time capsule. Dream of Wild Health began working with a horticulture professor at the University of Minnesota, the late Albert (Bud) Markhart. In time, Markhart was able to make nine rare varieties of corn viable again.

But Auger and Wilson knew the project was about more than seed saving. Over the years, they launched education and outreach projects for youth.

The groups had a big task before them. It's well-known that Indians were the first to cultivate pumpkins, beans, corn and squash. But it's more than that: They actually used about 1,900 types of plants for foods and 2,900 for medicines, according to food scientist Craig Hassel.

Ten years later, the farm is planted with vegetables, tobacco and medicinal plants that were a part of life for native Minnesotans. That includes a tobacco variety that has been around for 600 years.

The farm also grows organic vegetables, which its teenage Garden Warriors were harvesting last week.

## "I Cooked My First Wild Rice"

Jalen Morrison, 16, of St. Paul, has worked at the farm for four years. His experience shows how the nonprofit tries to groom future health promoters.

Morrison started in a program called Cora's Kids, a one-week farm experience project. Now a Garden Warrior, he's participating in a cooking class in the farm kitchen. He also sometimes staffs the farm's vegetable booth at the Midtown Farmers Market in Minneapolis.

"Before I came here, I didn't know anything about making a garden, about different types of seeds, different plants to eat," Morrison said during a lunch break under a big shade tree.

Breanna Greene and Gene Parker, both 14-year-olds from St. Paul, stood nearby. The two said they liked getting out of the city, working the fields, and "being able to be outside and be safe."

Greene says she has experimented with making salads at home with her family. Parker proudly announced, "A couple of days ago I cooked my first wild rice."

The teens get paid for their summer work. Some eventually return after the summer, to work full-time.

## Planting More Than Just Seeds

The work doesn't stop at the farm, though. To reach parents, Dream of Wild Health offers cooking classes during the school year. It also supports gardens on St. Paul's East Side. And this year, it received funding to buy a van to start a catering business.

But the nonprofit relies heavily on its youth to lead the charge against fast foods and bad food. Maintaining their enthusiasm over the years could be a challenge, its leaders admit.

Dream of Wild Health, said Wilson, is planting seeds both in the ground and in the lives of Indian youth. "We're hoping that when these kids become adults, they will remember these experiences." And if they do, perhaps those memories "will shape their lives, so they can be healthy adults and raise healthy families."
