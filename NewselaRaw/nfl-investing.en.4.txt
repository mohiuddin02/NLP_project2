MIAMI — Miami Dolphins wide receiver Brian Hartline is good at football. He is also good at business.

Hartline studies his passing routes. He also studies reports about how much money companies make. He looks at other information. He is trying to find places to put his money to make more money. These are called investments.

Hartline is a careful investor. He is also growing as a businessman. He and a grade school buddy bought two convenience stores in Ohio, where he is from. Hartline has been known to help out there when football season is over. He waits on customers. He unpacks boxes and puts products on shelves.

## How To Handle Money

Hartline does all that studying and work for a reason.

"I only invest if I really understand," he said.

Many pro athletes make millions of dollars. Many of them also run out of money. The National Football League and teams such as the Dolphins are teaching players about handling money.

In 2009, Sports Illustrated reported that more than three-fourths of NFL players have money troubles within two years after they stop playing. The league got serious about the problem after that report.

Patrick Kerney is a retired player. He works for the NFL. He thinks the Sports Illustrated numbers are too high. Still, he sees the importance of training players to manage their money better.

## Making His Money Last

The NFL is holding classes to teach players about how to handle their money, Kerney said. "Some players run out of money before they expect," he said.

Hartline is not one of them.

The Dolphins receiver says he has kept track of how much he spends for a long time. He also spends less than he makes. Hartline lived that way long before he received his new five-year contract. Now he will make about $6 million a year.

Hartline does admit to one treat. He bought a fancy sports car. "I like my toys," he said. But he's also been learning about where to invest. He wants his money to last for years after he stops playing football.

When he was a child, Hartline's parents gave him a week's worth of lunch money at a time. He learned to make it last. His dad was a businessman. He wanted to be one too.

## "We Did It Ourselves"

Hartline said he makes all of his own business decisions. He also invests in several different things. He does not put all his money in one place.

Hartline hopes to invest in 10 or so convenience stores. So far, he and a friend own two convenience stores in Ohio.

Early on, Hartline said, "we did it ourselves." They waited on customers, stocked the shelves and unloaded trucks. They did not have any workers to pay, he said, which turned out to be a blessing. "I learned the business by experience," he said.

In Florida, Hartline is a hero and role model to Aidan Pratt, 14, for always saving his money. Last football season, Aidan won $1,000 from BankUnited for his essay on the importance of saving. Hartline promotes saving as part of kids' learning about managing money. Aidan got to meet him.

Aidan said he followed his hero's example. "It's the only money I have ever won — and I put it in a savings account," he said.
