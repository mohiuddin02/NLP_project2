Someone falls down and stops breathing. You call 911. Rescue workers are sent to help. Now a smartphone app asks regular people in the area to help too.

The app is called PulsePoint and many people have downloaded it. Lives have been saved because of it.

PulsePoint was made to help people who have suffered cardiac arrest.

Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating. Blood stops flowing to the brain and other organs. If it is not treated right away, people usually die.

Many life-saving apps have been created lately. Some apps let rescue workers know someone is having a health problem. Other apps show rescue workers important information about a patient.

## Fast Way To Get Help

One free app is called 911HelpSMS. It lets you know where you are before you call 911. It also instantly texts your family to let them know where you are.

Another free app is called EMNet finderER. It shows the closest hospital to you.

When someone experiences cardiac arrest, the PulsePoint app reaches out to many people to find a person nearby who knows CPR.

In CPR, you push down on the chest of a person to help their heart start beating again.

Here is how PulsePoint works. First, a 911 call about a cardiac arrest comes in. Then, rescue workers are called. PulsePoint app users learn about the emergency at the same time. The people who are closest are the ones who are alerted.

The app shows people where to find the nearest defibrillator. A defibrillator sends an electric shock to the heart to try to get it pumping again.

The app is free for users, but towns and cities pay to use it.

So far, thousands of people have used PulsePoint to ask for help. Even more people have responded.

## Right Place, Right Time

There are stories of how PulsePoint has helped save lives.

One of these lives was a 56-year-old man from Oregon. Another was a 5-week-old baby in Washington state.

A worker for PulsePoint said that this app is a tool for people to use. The app connects people who know how to help with people who need help. The people who need help are more likely to live because of the PulsePoint app.

More than two years ago a city in South Dakota launched PulsePoint. A rescue worker there said that when the program started, people wanted to know how information would be kept safe. They wanted to know who would be responsible if something went wrong.

These questions did not turn out to be problems. Every state has what are called Good Samaritan laws. People who help other people in an emergency are protected by these laws.

Many people have downloaded the app in the South Dakota city, and like it a lot.

Everyone has a smartphone now. It means that people can help when other people are in trouble. These special apps get them to the right place at the right time.
