KAMPALA, Uganda â€” In 2004, Madinah Nalukenge was facing hard times. She was a single mother in the African country of Uganda.  She had tried selling bed sheets, but that didn't work. She had only $10 left.

Nalukenge began selling mashed vegetables and greasy meats at a bus station, using the last of her money.

Now, Nalukenge runs a catering business that makes her up to $3,000 per month.

Her business is not just a way to make money. It's something she is very proud of.

"There is a lot of money to be made here," she said recently. Her apron was full of cash. "I need to stay focused."

She has a lot of competition. There are 12 other women selling food near her.

## Food And Rent Money

The food sellers in downtown Kampala gave similar reasons for starting their businesses: hungry children, unpaid rent. Most of the women are not married.

Being single is an advantage, these women say. Their past husbands or boyfriends were uncooperative, even violent. For these women, being single means being independent. They are free to run their businesses how they like.

"They don't help and they never want to help," Nalukenge said of her old boyfriends. "Yet even the little you get they want to take away from you. I was alone when I started this business."

Nalukenge and the other food sellers are part of a bigger trend in Africa. More women are starting businesses than ever before.

Many women begin alone, selling things, or providing a service. Some are able to make their businesses larger. Some of these businesses now have many employees.

## Schools, Clothes, Crafts

"Traditionally women would sit at home and wait for the man to return home with a bag of groceries," said Thomas Bwire. He studies the businesses and people of Uganda. Now, women don't need men as much, he said.

In Africa, extreme poverty is still common in many places. But the number of successful female-owned businesses is growing. Some [women business owners](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) have become famous.

Mary Okello started a school inside a three-bedroom house in Kenya. She now owns a respected group of private schools.

Janet Nkubana started a handicrafts company in Rwanda. She nows employs more than 3,000 women.

The Nigerian Adenike Ogunlesi is famous for her "Ruff 'n' Tumble" clothing line for children. She first ran her business out of a car trunk.

## Looking For Loans

Women starting businesses can help poor countries, experts say. But the women face a major obstacle.

It is common to borrow money to start a business, then pay the money back when the business has become successful. But because these women are so poor, no bank will let them borrow money.

According to the World Bank, women business owners could use $300 billion to grow their businesses, but no one will lend it to them.

To address this problem, the World Bank has started a $600 million fund to support female business owners. The fund hopes to let 100,000 women borrow the money to start their businesses.

Back in downtown Kampala, food seller Nalukenge said she has kept her children in school and now owns two small plots of land.

She considered her journey from failed seller of bed sheets to successful caterer.

"We spend a lot of energy here," she said. "There's no resting. But at the end of the day we get our reward."
