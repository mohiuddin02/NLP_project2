BEIJING, China â€” China has promised to stop selling ivory. Ivory comes from elephant tusks.

China's announcement could be a big victory in the battle to stop elephant poaching. Poachers kill elephants to get their ivory tusks. They have killed more than 40,000 African elephants in just the past two years.

Meng Xianlin is a Chinese government official. Meng said his country was still deciding when and how to take action. He pointed out that China is not the only country that needs to make changes. He thinks countries like the United States need to toughen their ivory laws, too.

Selling ivory is against the law in many countries. It is still legal in China. Experts say making ivory illegal will help stop poachers.

## Shoppers Can't Know Ivory's Source

There is no way for customers to know whether elephants were killed to get the ivory they are buying. Poached ivory still winds up in China's legal ivory stores. That means shoppers' money might go to poachers without them knowing it.

China bought most of its ivory in 2008. It sells it to artists who carve it. Last month, it held a large event. The government destroyed nearly 1,500 pounds of poached ivory. The illegal ivory had made it into Chinese stores. Chinese official Zhao Shucong said China will stop selling ivory sometime in the future.

Wildlife experts were surprised by Zhao's announcement. Several wildlife groups thanked China. They say China's decision will make it easier to stop poachers.

Other wildlife groups wondered if China was serious. Some say China will probably just keep selling ivory until it has no more left.

## Chinese Growing More Concerned About Animals

Cristian Samper is president of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. He said Meng's comments should be a warning to poachers all over the world.

Samper says the Chinese government needs to make a plan. It needs to figure out how to stop ivory trading. Samper also says people should stop buying ivory. That way, poachers will not have a reason to kill elephants.

Meng said people in China are becoming more concerned about animals. They do not want to eat shark-fin soup anymore, because it is made from sharks. Nowadays there are fewer sharks. It is an endangered animal. Rhinoceros horn was once a popular Chinese medicine. China made using rhinoceros horn illegal in 1993. Now it is harder to find.

## U.S. Still Allows Illegal Ivory Trade

Meng's speech pointed out that China should not be the only country to take action. Illegal Wildlife products are also sold in the United States.

In 2014, President Obama said the U.S. needed new rules for ivory. New York and New Jersey both passed laws outlawing it. Yet most states have not.

Peter LaFontaine works for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. He says China's announcement "puts the ball back in our court."

LaFontaine says it is up to us to change our laws before it is too late.
