Keiler Roberts sat with her 6-year-old daughter, Xia, last week at a playground in Evanston, outside of Chicago. The two read together. Behind them, kids ran around in a game of hide-and-seek.

On Roberts' lap was a library book, "Thumbelina." On Xia's were two Barbie dolls ready to listen along to the tale. Roberts turned the page to show a glowing picture. Xia's eyes widened, her lips forming an "oh" of surprise.

"Wouldn't that be something?" Roberts said, "If you opened up a flower and a little girl was inside?"

## The Library Is A Bike!

The mother and daughter were among park visitors delighted by Evanston Public Library's new book bike. It's a motorized bicycle with a bright yellow cart attached to it. The cart is filled with about 50 books. Librarian Jill Skwerski rides the bike to parks and community centers. People can come up to the bike to sign up for library cards, check out books and sign up for programs on the spot.

The cart's books include popular writers, as well as books on different subjects. The cart has more fun choices, too: children's fairy tales like the "Animorphs" series.

"I've also got this," Skwerski said, tugging a book out from the cart. "I promised my daughter I'd bring along the One Direction book."

Borrowing a book is fast and simple. It's even easier for families who already have library cards. When 6-year-old Sophie Levy peered into the cart of books, she instantly caught sight of her favorite, "Happy Pig Day!" by Mo Willems.

Sophie's mom, Christine, then pulled out a library card and gave it to Skwerski. The librarian opened her laptop and entered the card number. She had Sophie read aloud the book's call number.

In less than a minute, Sophie was able to return to the playground with her prized book.

## The Book Bike Makes People Curious

The library hopes the book bike will get more community members involved. They're aiming to reach nonusers. Some parts of Evanston have fewer people with library cards, Skwerski said.

"The more people hear about the book bike, the more excitement it can generate," she said.

The bike was given to the library by the Evanston Bicycle Club. The program is still new. During its first few runs, Skwerski realized the bike needs some improvements. She wants to add a ledge or stool for young children to stand on to see into the cart.

Other possible changes include a shelf to show off the books. It would let people recognize the book bike from several feet away, she said. She'd also like to add a docking station to charge phones and electronic devices.

## Take A Book To The Park

Margaret Lo was in the park with her two sons, Onyx, 3, and Alarik, 2. They also checked out Mo Willems books. Lo said the bike is easier for her than a trip to the library.

"They're constantly in demand of new books," she said as her sons climbed onto a tire swing. "I love going to the library, but I'm afraid they'll tear it apart."

The book bike hopes to stop by an outdoor market in the coming weeks. Once the school year starts, Skwerski said she may visit schools in town. But for now, the librarian is enjoying the trips to playgrounds in the warm weather. It gives her the chance to witness children's eager excitement to read.

"What a gift, that this is my job," Skwerski said.
