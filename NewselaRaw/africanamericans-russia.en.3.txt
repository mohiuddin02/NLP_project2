MOSCOW — Growing up in Russia, Emilia Tynes-Mensah did the same things other children did. She read the books of Alexander Pushkin and listened to the music of Peter Tchaikovsky.

In her home, though, there was also American music and Thanksgiving celebrations. There were stories of the struggles facing blacks in the United States. Soul food sometimes replaced Russian beet soup.

That's because her father, George Tynes, was an African-American from Virginia. He had moved to Russia back in 1931.

## Russia Offered Special Treatment

Tynes was among hundreds of African-Americans who traveled to Russia during the 1920s and 1930s.

"My father didn't know anything about this country. He didn't know what to expect," Tynes-Mensah, age 73, said as she sat in her Moscow apartment.

Most of the African-Americans who went to Russia were seeking a better life, said historian Allison Blakely. They were hoping to escape the racism they faced in the United States.

Today, fewer than 50 descendants of these African-Americans still live in Russia.

Once, Russia was eager to attract skilled foreigners, Blakely said. Thousands of Americans went to work in Russia during the 1930s, and among them were several hundred African-Americans.

The African-Americans who went to Russia were highly educated. They included engineers, teachers, entertainers, journalists and lawyers.

Russia gave them special treatment. They received big paychecks, low-cost housing and free vacations.

## Mostly Good Experiences

Tynes-Mensah said that her father felt Russia treated him better than America. "He was happy here."

Tynes was an agricultural expert and had been a football star in college. Nonetheless, back in America he could only find work washing dishes in a restaurant, his daughter recalled. So he jumped at the opportunity to go to Russia.

The experience of African-Americans who traveled to or settled in Russia was overwhelmingly good, descendants said. In turn, they made valuable contributions to Russian society. African-American agricultural experts helped come up with different uses for plants. They also helped develop new plants that were cheaper to grow.

Tynes was sent to various farms to teach people how to raise ducks and other waterfowl. He became an expert in Russia.

## Then Things Turned Bad

There were never many African-Americans in Russia, but they got a lot of attention, Blakely said.

Within years, however, such attention was unwelcome. After the leader Josef Stalin came to power, foreigners were no longer trusted. People who were not citizens were ordered to leave the country.

Things only got worse after 1947. From 1947 to 1991, the United States and Russia were involved in the Cold War. While there was no military fighting, the two countries became enemies and made threats aimed at each other.

African-Americans still living in Russia were not treated well during this period. However, this was not because they were black, it was because they were foreigners.

## Growing Up Differently

Today, Russia has a racism problem, as many people have moved there from Africa.

Tynes-Mensah is half African-American — her mother was Russian-Ukrainian. Growing up in Russia, she was keenly aware that people saw her as different from most Russians.

"I was afraid to go out in public," said Tynes-Mensah, who has light brown skin and a short Afro. "People used to stare — but it was curiosity. They were not angry."

Tynes-Mensah became a chemistry teacher. Today, she runs a group helping mixed-race children in Russia, most of whose fathers came to Russia from Africa. She lives mainly in the United States now, but still spends summers in Russia.
