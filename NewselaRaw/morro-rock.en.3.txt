Morro Rock is a dome-shaped rocky mass that rises 576 feet out of the ocean along California's coast. The mound is almost like an island, attached to the coast by a thin stretch of land. It is a sacred place for two local Native American tribes.

For more than 10 years, the two tribes have been in a dispute over the rights to Morro Rock. They are arguing over whether anyone should be allowed to climb it.

One tribe, the Salinan Indians, says the landmark can only be climbed on special religious days. The other tribe, the Northern Chumash Indians, believes it should never be tread upon. The Chumash think the beauty of Morro Rock should only be looked at from a distance.

This dispute has turned into a legal battle. Last December, the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, a group that represents the tribe, filed a document in court. They argued that the Salinan Tribe should not be allowed to climb the mountain. The Chumash believe the site is sacred and should be off-limits.

## Lisamu And Lesamo

According to Chumash tradition, the rock is called Lisamu.

"Lisamu is alive with life that needs to be protected and honored, not trampled upon," the Northern Chumash Tribal Council has written.

The Salinans see something different in Morro Rock. They call it Lesamo and believe it sits in the place where a Falcon from their ancient legend killed the serpent Teleekatapelta.

On a recent gray morning, Fred Collins stood at the base of the rock and looked toward the sky as a falcon glided over the jagged peaks. Collins is a member of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council.

Collins said that the rock is full of unbelievable birds, like falcons, who stop there as they migrate. He does not believe it should be interfered with.

## "Floating On Air"

Morro Rock has been a state historic landmark and falcon preserve since 1968. The public is not allowed to climb the rock. However, the Salinans have been climbing it since about 2000. An elder from the tribe sought a permit to hold rituals on the peak. The permit was approved and permission was given.

According to Joe Mette, it is normal for the California Department of Parks and Recreation to allow reasonable requests for religious practices to take place on state park property. Mette used to work at the parks department.

The state now allows the Salinan Indians to climb the rock for religious ceremonies twice a year, once in the summer and once in the winter.

Elder John Burch is the member who applied for the Salinans' permit. He has a special religious ritual that he practices when he is on the mountain. It has been passed down for generations. He will sit alone at the top in blackness and starlight, asking for spiritual guidance. He finishes the night of prayer feeling as if he is "floating on air."

The rock's rugged landscape makes for a tough climb. In the past, climbers have had to be rescued after failing to reach the top. Last month, three 15-year-old boys who were trying to climb up needed to be saved. Ten days later, another climber who got stuck part of the way up needed assistance.

## At The Base, Not The Top

The Northern Chumash Tribal Council was not pleased when the Salinans received the special climbing permit. The council says that it was never asked about the deal. They feel they should have been asked because their 35 members were affected by the arrangement.

According to California state law, the parks department must consult with Native American tribes when their sacred sites are affected by projects or policies.

The Chumash don't mind if other tribes gather for ceremonies at the base of the rock, Collins said. It is the climbing they have a problem with.

"Morro Rock has such a great presence along our coast," Collins said. "Fishermen and people of old times always viewed Morro Rock as a landmark in the ocean with special energies. It's a magical place."

If the climbing debate isn't solved by the time the summer climb rolls around, the Chumash tribe may ask a court to stop it.

"We hope we can come to a resolution on this issue in a positive way," Collins said. "But we're willing to stand up and not get kicked around."
