Five babies at a day care center near Chicago have come down with the measles.

Laboratory tests confirmed two of the cases at Kindercare Learning Center in Palatine, Illinois. Health officials are still waiting for final test results on the other three.

All five children are under the age of 1 and are too young to be vaccinated.

## Rare Disease Strikes 2 States

Public health officials are investigating how the babies caught the disease. Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause severe health problems. It is spread through coughing and sneezing and can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. Measles used to be a common childhood disease. Since the measles vaccine was invented in 1963, it has become so rare that most doctors have never even seen a case of it.

The outbreak at the day care center comes about a week after Illinois confirmed its first case of the measles this year. Health officials would only say the person was older than 18 and lives in the Chicago suburbs. They listed three places where other people might have come into contact with the measles patient in mid-January. Two of the places were in Palatine, where the day care center is located.

Health officials say it is not clear if the babies got measles from the adult with measles. They also do not know if the Illinois outbreak is connected to the one at Disneyland. More than 100 people have caught the measles at the California theme park this winter.

## Get Your Shots!

There is a shot that prevents measles. The shot is called a vaccine. Most children get two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. The measles vaccine is highly effective and safe, experts say. Still, some parents choose not to give their children the shot, because of their religion or personal beliefs.

Colleen Moran, the spokeswoman for KinderCare which runs 1,500 learning centers in the United States, said the center is following county health rules. Unvaccinated students and staff must stay home from the day care center until Feb. 24, she said.

"We just want everyone to recover quickly and to stay safe," Moran said.

Officials say that unvaccinated people should call their local health department and doctor if they have measles symptoms. Symptoms include a high fever and rash, and infected people are contagious from four days before the rash starts through four days afterward.

Medical groups say that children should get their first dose of the MMR vaccine at 12 to 15 months old. It is recommended they receive the second shot at 4 to 6 years old, before starting kindergarten.

## "Protected For Life"

Nationally, 92 percent of children receive the MMR vaccine. Despite this, one child in 12 in the United States does not get the first dose of MMR on time. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, this is why so many children are coming down with measles.

Unvaccinated children are among the most likely to get the measles, said Dr. Wendell Wheeler of Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Illinois. Measles is one of the most contagious of all diseases.

If a child gets only the first dose of the measles vaccine, he or she may not be fully protected. About 5 to 10 percent of children are not immune to the measles after just one dose, which is why a second dose is necessary, said Dr. Tina Tan. She is a disease expert at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago.

Children who get both measles vaccines at the right age are "considered protected for life," she said.

## Herd Immunity Is Key

Babies who are too young to get vaccinated are protected by the majority who are vaccinated. This effect is called herd immunity.

However, when the vaccination rate drops below 95 percent, it becomes a serious problem, Tan explained.

The MMR vaccine is required for Illinois students. Statewide, about 98 percent of schoolchildren follow the state rules, according to the Illinois State Board of Education. However, the rules allow parents to opt out of the vaccine for religious or medical reasons. It is not known how many children end up not getting the vaccine.

Heather Robinson took her 15-month-old daughter for the MMR shot last month. The child broke out into a rash that covered every inch of her body â€” "it was even in her ears," said Robinson, who lives south of Chicago. "I was totally freaking out."

Robinson said she thought it was measles.

It turned out to be caused by the shot. Still, Robinson is glad she got her daughter vaccinated.

"I have friends who don't vaccinate," she said. "They admit that they're depending on others to be responsible."
