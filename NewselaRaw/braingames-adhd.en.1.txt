From baby boomers fearing memory loss to college students wanting a mental boost, interest in brain-training products is soaring. Yet leading scientists still doubt brain-training games actually increase mental abilities. Last year 70 cognitive researchers — basically brain doctors — signed a statement speaking out against computer-based games that promise better cognitive performance. They mentioned a lack of scientific evidence to back such claims. 

## Large Studies Planned

Amid this hype and hope, at least two companies have committed to strict testing of their games before selling them to people trying to treat specific health conditions. Boston-based Akili Interactive Labs and Posit Science in San Francisco are preparing to conduct large studies in order to have their games approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a requirement for medical devices that doctors prescribe to patients. The road to FDA approval is long and expensive but promising early studies have encouraged both companies to move forward. The games under development at the two companies emerged from neuroscience and aging research at the University of California, San Francisco (U.C.S.F.).

At a meeting of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Akili Interactive Labs presented data from a small, pilot study of its video game, Project: EVO. It showed some positive results in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Approximately 6.4 million in the United States and one-tenth of children worldwide suffer from the condition. They struggle with paying attention and controlling their impulses.

The company paid scientists at Duke University School of Medicine and Florida Clinical Research Center to run a four-week study. It involved 80 children ages 8 to 12; 40 with ADHD who were not taking medications and 40 neurotypical kids, or those whose brain functions were within a normal range. Participants played the game 30 minutes a day for five days a week.

## Treatment With Tablets

The game has modern graphics and immersive features. Players tilt their tablet devices to steer a raft down a winding icy river and tap their screens to catch aliens and other objects while avoiding distractors. As the players improve, the game gets harder.

The game's developers say players must manage quick decision-making on top of a continuous motor skills task. This helps strengthen brain circuits responsible for key functions, such as attention and working memory, which is the type of memory you use on a daily basis to follow instructions and hold on to information. Typically, these brain functions are a problem in people suffering from ADHD. Eddie Martucci, the co-founder of Akili, says the hope is that "when you engage in the game pretty intensely for long periods of time, it actually reconditions how the brain processes information."

But, the small study was not intended as a final test of the game's effectiveness. "We had to make sure the game is safe and well tolerated—to see that kids wouldn't get bored and throw the iPad against the wall," says psychologist Scott Kollins. He directs Duke's ADHD program and helped run Akili's pilot study.

## Some Improvement Seen

Participants did not get sick of the game. Nor did it make anyone sick — some action games can make players nauseous. Furthermore, certain measures of attention, working memory and impulse control improved in the ADHD group, similar to what might be seen from certain ADHD drugs.

ADHD experts who were not involved in the study warn the improvements observed in these tests might not carry over into improved functioning in daily life. Lawrence Scahill is a pediatrics professor at Emory University who studies children with ADHD. He says that although promising effects were seen in a laboratory, "what that means in the real world is anyone's guess."

Kollins, too, is cautious about Akili's claims. "What we can say conclusively is that the findings warrant further testing in larger, better-controlled studies," he says. "Beyond that, you're starting to get speculative." In the coming months Akili plans to launch a larger ADHD trial, with some kids taking their ADHD medications while playing the game. Another group, called a "control group," would be taking a sugar pill, called a placebo, but would not know it was not their usual medication. Then the two groups would be compared.

## Tests With Alzheimer's, Autism

In addition, the company is testing its video game on people with Alzheimer's disease, autism, depression and traumatic brain injury (TBI) — conditions believed to share a common weakness in the brain system that integrates sensory inputs.

Posit Science has completed a small trial of its computerized training program for ADHD. The study was conducted in India by U.C.S.F. neurobiologist Jyoti Mishra with money from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a U.S. government agency. Based on Mishra's research, Posit's ONTRAC program targets neural circuits responsible for ignoring distraction.

The ONTRAC study enrolled 31 children with ADHD in New Delhi, India's capital. About half were taking commonly prescribed ADHD medications. Twenty-one children were randomly chosen for the ONTRAC group and 10 to a placebo group playing nontherapeutic games. Ultimately, ONTRAC's effects on cognition and behavior, judged by different measures, had the same modest effects as Akili's ADHD group, and lasted when measured six months later.

## Doctors Not Convinced Yet

Mishra has applied for NIH funding for a larger U.S. study of ONTRAC in ADHD. Posit has ongoing trials for FDA consideration of its brain-training programs, which consist of selected cognitive exercises from the company's collection of games.

Posit, for instance, already sells products that claim to improve cognition. But, to make a claim about treating a specific disease, the company needs FDA approval. Doctors who treat ADHD are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Lawrence Diller, a behavioral pediatrician in the San Francisco Bay Area, is a skeptic but commends the companies' attempts to seek FDA approval. "They're going about it in a proper fashion," he says.
