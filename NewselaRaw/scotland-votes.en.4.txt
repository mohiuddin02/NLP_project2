EDINBURGH, Scotland â€” For 307 years Scotland has been in a union with England. Scotland is controlled by the British government. On Thursday, Scottish voters got the chance to decide whether to become independent. They voted to stay part of the United Kingdom.

Scots voted 55 percent against independence. Forty-five percent voted in favor of breaking away from the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is a group of four countries. They are England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The portion of Scottish voters who showed up was greater than ever before. The vote brought relief to leaders in London, the capital of the United Kingdom

## Safer To Stick With The U.K.

The First Minister of Scotland is Alex Salmond. Independence for Scotland has been his goal for a long time. He pushed hard for a new country. However, a larger number of voters felt it was safer to stick with the United Kingdom.

Salmond accepted the results of the vote. "We know it is a majority for the No campaign," he said. He called on his fellow Scots to accept the results of the vote as well.

Even though he lost, he said the vote was a win for democracy.

Salmond had argued that Scotland could be independent because it has a lot of oil and has smart, educated people. He said Scotland would do better without interference from leaders in London.

Nonetheless, Salmond came close to winning independence. His campaign made London politicians so nervous, they promised to give new powers to Scotland.

Some people said voters would decide with their heads or their hearts. Older Scots were cautious. They worried that independence was something Scotland couldn't afford. On the other side were younger Scots. They who loved the idea of building their own country.

## London Feared Losing Scotland Forever

The no vote saves British Prime Minister David Cameron going down in history as a defeated leader.

The prime minister before him was Gordon Brown, a Scot. Brown crisscrossed Scotland in the final days before the vote. Brown told his fellow Scots that independence was not the patriotic choice. He argued that Scots could love Scotland but still proud of their place in the United Kingdom.

Cameron is part of the Conservative Party. The Conservatives are very unpopular in Scotland. The prime minister begged voters not to vote for independence just to bash his party.

The vote against independence keeps the United Kingdom from losing a big part of its territory. It also prevents the U.K. from losing its oil supply. Without Scotland, the U.K. would need to find a new place to store its most powerful weapons. Losing Scotland could have hurt the U.K.'s role within the European Union and the United Nations.

Some had predicted that if Scotland broke away, the U.K. would struggle for a long while.

The U.K. had feared losing Scotland forever. In return for staying in the union, Scots have been promised new powers. It is still a little unclear what those powers will be.
