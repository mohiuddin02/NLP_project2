HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. â€” Some Republican lawmakers are complaining that cities protect immigrants who are living in the United States without permission.

The Republicans are calling them "sanctuary cities." Sanctuary means a place of safety. The Republicans are using the term to get stronger immigration laws. They claim these cities protect  immigrants from immigration officials who want to send them back to their home countries.

It is true that some cities ignore government immigration rules. However, many cities refuse to carry them out. It is not that they care so much about the immigrants. But they do worry about being taken to court.

In July, a woman named Kathryn Steinle was killed in San Francisco. The police said the man who shot her was an immigrant who came to the U.S. without permission. He had been released from jail even though U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) wanted to make him leave the country for the sixth time. Since then, the argument over sanctuary cities has become more serious.

On July 23, Republican lawmakers passed a bill. It would punish cities that refused to share information with the government about immigration. Republicans are opposed to President Barack Obama's Democratic group. They usually vote against Democrats.

## San Francisco Declares It's A Safe Place

San Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city more than 20 years ago. It said it would protect all immigrants regardless of whether they were here legally. In 1989, the city said that officials could not carry out immigration laws or ask immigrants if they are here legally. San Francisco is known as a city that supports the Democrats. However, some of the cities and counties that do not detain immigrants agree with the Republicans. They are not trying to protect immigrants from being sent away.

A federal court in Oregon decided that being in the U.S. illegally was not a good enough reason to keep someone in jail. As a result, the city of Huntington Beach, California, stopped holding immigrants in jail last summer. That city is mainly white and Republican.

Police Chief Robert Handy said his department just follows the law. His officers do not generally ask whether people are in the country legally or illegally. The police department will hold someone in jail if a judge orders it.

About 200 areas will not keep the immigrants in jail just because they are in the U.S. without permission.

## Cities Differ In How They Welcome People

Cities are different on how far they go to welcome immigrants. Some will not help them at all. Places like Cook County, Illinois, and Santa Clara County, California, want immigrants to trust the police. Others, such as San Bernardino and Riverside counties in California, are worried about getting in trouble.

Mark Krikorian is the executive director of the Center for Immigration Cities. It is against illegal immigration. He said what mattered was whether a town followed the rules or not.

"Some may cooperate here but not there. Some may cooperate on certain matters but not other matters," he said. However, he thinks any city that does not cooperate with immigration authorities is a sanctuary city.

## U.S. Officials Ask City Police For Help

Last year, some cities stopped holding immigrants in jail because of the Oregon decision. In response, immigration officials said they would not ask police to keep a person in jail. Instead, they would ask police to let them know when an immigrant will get released. Then the immigration officials could arrest him or her for coming to the U.S. illegally.

In the Orange County jail, officials work closely with federal immigration officials. Immigrants are asked whether they are here legally. Jail officials tell immigration officials when an immigrant is in jail for a crime. They will also tell the officials when that person will be released.

However, the department will not hold people in jail just because they are here illegally. It is worried it might get into trouble with the law, said Steve Kea, an assistant sheriff.

Orange County is not a "sanctuary" area, said Undersheriff John Scott.
