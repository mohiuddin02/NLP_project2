LOS ANGELES — Just outside their practice gym, the Los Angeles Clippers have put four ping-pong balls up where everyone can see them. The black numbers printed on the balls read 5-3-6-10. Those were the numbers that helped the Clippers win the 2009 NBA draft contest.

Winning that contest meant the Clippers got to go first in the NBA draft. New basketball players were finishing college and moving on to the NBA. The Clippers could pick anybody they wanted to join their team. They chose a young star named Blake Griffin. He has made a big difference for the Clippers over the last few years.

College players are graduating and it is time for this year's draft. And the NBA's 14 teams will find out what order they will use to take turns picking new players.

## Finding A Fair Way To Choose

Back in the 1960s, the teams that lost the most games got to pick their new players first. There was just one twist. The worst team from the east and the worst team from the west had a coin toss. The winner got the very first pick in the draft.

Then in 1984, Houston started losing games on purpose. They wanted to finish last so they would get the top overall pick in that year's draft.

The NBA had to make sure the same thing did not happen again. In 1985, they tried something new. Officials put all the names of all the teams in a container. Then they pulled the names out one at a time. The teams picked new players in that order.

Many people were frustrated that the drawing did not give the worst teams very good chances of getting the talented players they needed. Other people said it was too easy for someone to cheat. The drawing system only lasted a few years.

## Ping-Pong Basketball Lottery

Since then, the drawing for the order of the draft has changed a lot. Now the NBA uses ping-pong balls to keep things fair for all 14 teams.

Before the drawing begins, each team gets a list of number sets — sort of like bingo cards. To make things fair, the worst teams get extra number sets. That gives them better chances of winning the first pick.

For example, Minnesota had the NBA's worst record this year, so they will get a list of 250 number sets. This gives them a 1 in 4 chance of winning the number 1 overall pick. New York finished next to last, so they will have 199 number sets. They have a 1 in 5 chance of winning the first pick. The other teams have an even lower chance.

On the night of the drawing, numbered ping-pong balls spin around in a machine for 20 seconds. Then four balls are taken out one at a time. The team with the number set that matches the numbers on the balls wins the top pick.

Then the four balls go back into the machine and the drawing continues to see who will go second and third.

## Keeping The Secret

The ping-pong ball drawing gives losing teams more chances to improve for the next season. It also creates plenty of surprises. The team with the most number sets has only won three times in the past 21 years.

"There is no format that is perfect, but this is as close as you are going to get," Orlando Magic Executive Pat Williams said. "I think the league has found the best system at this point."

The ping-pong ball drawing will take place in a private room more than an hour before the results are announced on television. People who work for all 14 teams will attend the drawing. NBA officials and news reporters will also be there.

Nobody will be allowed to leave the ping-pong ball room until the TV show is over. Everyone has to give up their cellphones, computers and other devices before they go into the drawing. The NBA has to make sure the results stay secret until they are ready to make the big announcement.
