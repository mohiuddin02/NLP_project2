NEW YORK — As the Girl Scouts' membership continues to plummet, its leaders hope technology can reverse the trend. The organization is expanding its "Digital Cookie" program. The upgrade allows Girl Scouts to sell cookies via mobile apps and the girls' personalized websites.

The decision, announced in early December, comes amid persisting challenges for the 103-year-old organization. According to The Associated Press news agency, youth membership for this year was 1.88 million, down 6.2 percent from 2014. Adult membership was 784,120, down 3.1 percent, the news agency said.

The total membership is now 2.66 million — a more than 15 percent drop over three years. Even worse, membership has fallen 30 percent from its peak of more than 3.8 million in 2003.

The Girl Scouts also are struggling in terms of financial support. The latest figures from the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper that covers the nonprofit world, show that the organization received $103.2 million in private donations in 2014, down from $194.6 million in 2006. Back then, the Girl Scouts ranked 83rd among U.S. charities for such donations; the Chronicle now ranks it 257th.

## Trends Linked To Youth Group Declines

Some other major youth groups also face revenue and membership declines. Societal trends are partially thought to be the cause. However, Anna Maria Chavez, CEO of Girl Scouts of the United States of America, argues that her organization is capable of rebuilding its ranks through technological improvements.

For paid staff and volunteers, these include online toolkits. One streamlines the process for joining the Girl Scouts, another empowers volunteer troop leaders to plan a full year of meetings and activities with a single online visit.

"Our volunteers need more tools to serve more girls," Chavez said. "So we're really doubling down on technology."

For the girls themselves, Digital Cookie is the main plan. Chavez said input from some scouts a few years ago inspired the organization's first big step toward becoming tech savvy.

## Scouts See Rise In Cookie Sales

About 160,000 Girl Scouts participated in the program last year, and were credited with selling nearly 2.5 million boxes of cookies beyond those sold through traditional in-person methods. For the coming year, about 90 percent of the GSUSA's 112 regional councils will be engaged in Digital Cookie. Various new features have been added to make it more educational and more fun.

These features include an online game called Cookie Booth Bounce to help girls improve decision-making and budgeting skills, and a "Learning to Run a Business" section of the website. Girls also can post videos explaining who they are and plans for what they would do with the money they earn.

Digital Cookie's fans include Claire Houston, 18, who spent 13 years as a Girl Scout in Dutchess County, New York. A freshman at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, she studies computer science and co-coaches a Girl Scout robotics team.

Digital Cookie "is a great way to connect with how the world is changing right now," she said. "Technology is such a big part of our lives."

## Camping, Other Traditions Championed

Overall, the technological change has not been without problems. A memo from the Girl Scouts' communications office said some councils across the United States experienced membership declines and "disruption in service capabilities" while adjusting to the new systems.

GSUSA had to accept the short-term impact for the "long-term investment in necessary tech improvements," the memo said.

Some complaints about the program changes and the cost of program materials have circulated on a Facebook page called "GSUSA, Are You Listening?" The page serves as a sounding board for Girl Scout volunteers who are uneasy about the organization's direction. Some worry that the GSUSA is going too far in de-emphasizing camping, the earning of badges, and other traditional activities.

The Facebook page recently served as a vehicle for Suellen Nelles, the most outspoken objector among the 112 council CEOs, to distribute a detailed criticism of the national leadership, urging it to work more closely with staff and volunteers at the councils.

## Alaska Scout Group Voices Concern

"The leadership is fine with maintaining all the power and being a top-down organization," said Nelles, who heads the Farthest North Girl Scout Council in Fairbanks, Alaska. "We have forgotten our foundation and that we are only as strong as our all-volunteer membership."

However, Nelles said she has received little support for her views from other council CEOs. For her part, Chavez contends that collaboration between the national office and the councils was more productive now than at any point in her seven years as a Girl Scout executive.

"We know we'll continue to have challenges," Chavez said. "But here's our secret power: We're a family with a clear purpose — creating girls of courage, confidence and character. The girls are going to lead the way for us."
