WASHINGTON â€” As the push intensifies across the country for police to wear body cameras, states and cities have encountered a serious problem to adopting the new technology: the cost.

The price of a single camera ranges from less than $100 to more than $1,000, based on the size of the purchase and whether the deal includes data storage services. Police departments often get discounts for buying more cameras in a single purchase, but there are various additional costs associated with the cameras. Managing and storing the videos can be far more expensive than the cameras themselves. And because the technology is so new, it's likely the devices will have to be replaced fairly quickly, which would require additional expense.

## Expense Is A Big Concern

In a survey of 40 police departments by the Police Executive Research Forum, nearly 40 percent of departments without body cameras said the cost was the primary barrier to using them.

Since President Barack Obama called for $75 million in new federal spending to help pay for 50,000 body cameras for local police departments, states are struggling with how to pay for and use the cameras on a daily basis. There are mixed opinions on when cameras should be worn and whether the video should be public.

"They (cameras) can be a really great tool if implemented correctly," said Lindsay Miller, a researcher who studies issues facing police across the country. "It's not as easy as sticking a camera on an officer and sending them out in the field."

## Exploring Funding Options

In New Jersey, legislation that was passed last fall requires officers or the vehicles typically used in traffic stops to have cameras. The cameras must be either on the officer or on the dashboard of the car.

Giving local governments the option, either body camera or dashboard camera, was a compromise to help pass the bill - a proposed law - and the measure only applies to newly acquired vehicles. Staff members who work in administrative roles or who do not regularly conduct traffic stops do not need to wear a camera.

The program is being funded by a newly passed fine drunken drivers must pay. The legislation adds a $25 fine on convicted drunken drivers that can go toward camera expenses.

In other states, lawmakers have a different approach to funding camera measures. They are calling for state money to help pay for a technology they see as a necessity.

## Now Add In The Cost Of Data Storage

A plan in Texas, for instance, would dedicate $50 million in state money to implement a requirement that officers across the state wear cameras. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has signaled his support for a body camera law.

Some lawmakers in South Carolina want the state to spend as much as $21.5 million for police body cameras. The pressure in the state is particularly high in the wake of the Walter Scott shooting. Scott, an African-American, was shot in the back and killed by a white police officer as he ran away after a traffic stop in North Charleston, South Carolina, in April. The shooting was captured on a cellphone video by a bystander.

The Police Executive Research Forum survey found most agencies spent between $800 and $1,200 per camera to purchase them, a daunting price tag for departments already strapped for cash.

But it is the ongoing costs that are the real challenge. The New Orleans Police Department plans to purchase 350 body cameras, but is budgeting $1.2 million over five years, mostly for the cost of data storage. Other departments across the country expect to spend $2 million for a few years of data storage.

## How To Creatively Cover Costs

Many states are debating the issues that surround police cameras without tackling the funding question. In many instances, lawmakers are focused on how long departments should have to keep video, and if or when recordings should be made public.

Officers could potentially record millions of videos a year. Any number of the clips could be used as part of a criminal proceeding, a public records request or for another official purpose. The cost of downloading, logging, handling and storing all that video can be staggering.

Costs posted serious challenges in Utah this year, where state lawmakers debated camera legislation but ultimately did not pass the bill. Meanwhile, some departments around the state are using the technology and trying to find ways to cover the costs associated with camera programs.

## When Storage Space Runs Low

Clearfield, Utah, a city of about 30,000 located 30 miles north of Salt Lake City, is a prime example. The police department there has been using body cameras since 2010, but recently, data storage problems got so serious that the department had to temporarily use DVDs to store the videos. They had run out of computer server space.

New camera models may pose a solution, as they typically last longer and have greater storage capacity. But now there is another problem: The newer cameras record high-definition video, which means the video files are much larger. That contributes to the data crunch.

"It's just become pretty muddy about what's going to happen in the future," said Mike Stenquist, an assistant police chief in Clearfield. "There's a lot of work to be done."
