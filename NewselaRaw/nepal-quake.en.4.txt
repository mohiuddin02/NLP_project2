A strong earthquake shook Nepal on Saturday. More than 3,000 people were killed. The quake destroyed highways and buildings.

It also set off avalanches on Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain. The avalanches sent snow and ice sliding down Everest.

The earthquake struck just before noon. It was Nepal's most powerful earthquake in 80 years. The earthquake was a magnitude of 7.8. Magnitude shows how strong the earthquake is on a 1 to 10 scale.

The quake's center was 48 miles from Kathmandu. It is Nepal's capital. Kathmandu and Kathmandu Valley were hit hardest by the earthquake. It also shook several cities in northern India. The earthquake was felt as far away as Pakistan, Tibet and Bangladesh, which are also in Asia.

## "This Quake Was So Big"

Officials said the earthquake began only 7 miles below the earth's surface. The closer to the earth's surface, the more powerful an earthquake is. People said the earth shook for several minutes.

A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later. At least 20 other aftershocks followed the huge one. Aftershocks are small earthquakes.

"This quake was so big, "said Prajana W. Pradham. She is with the CARE aid group in Nepal. Pradham said she's been feeling the earth shake for hours. "I just felt another big jolt," she said.

Katmandu's airport was closed. Television and Internet services stopped. Phone and power lines were down.

People said the quake knocked over walls and telephone poles, and broke windows.  Many historic buildings were severely damaged or destroyed. Nepal is filled with temples and an ancient royal palace. The 200-foot-tall Dharahara Tower was built in 1832. It was one of the structures that fell down.

As the quake became worse, residents ran out of homes and buildings. Large cracks opened up on streets and walls.

## Nepal Asks For Help

An Indian plane brought rescue and medical workers to Kathmandu. Three other airplanes were sent from India. One of the planes contained a mini hospital.

Nepal's government has asked for tents and blankets. They also need teams to search for people who survived the earthquake. India offered to send 10 helicopters to help with the rescue effort. The helicopters would also fly injured people to hospitals and give out food.

Nepal has about 30 million people. It is located between India and China.

It will take time before Nepal knows how much damage there is. Nepal is a poor country. Experts think it will have a hard time bouncing back. Nepal depends on tourism for money. Nepal is best known for Mount Everest. Many tourists hike and climb its mountains.

Alex Gavan is a mountaineer who was trying to climb Everest. He posted on Twitter that the quake started an avalanche about 5 miles west of Everest. "Huge disaster," he wrote. Gavan said he helped rescue victims of the avalanche.

In Kathmandu, it was supposed to rain on Sunday. The bad weather could make life even harder for people whose homes were destroyed.
