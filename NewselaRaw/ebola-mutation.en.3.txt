A new study is good news for researchers testing Ebola vaccines.

It shows that the deadly Ebola virus is changing more slowly than scientists thought.

A team of scientists discovered that the virus is not mutating especially quickly. As a virus mutates, its structure changes. Sometimes, this makes viruses become better and quicker killers and makes it harder for people to fight them off. An earlier study suggested the Ebola virus might be changing twice as fast as in previous outbreaks. The new findings published in Science magazine show that the earlier study seems to be wrong.

## The Virus Has Not Changed Much

Understanding the virus's mutation rate is important. Researchers must develop vaccines against Ebola as it is now. If the virus would dramatically change, the vaccines likely would not work.

The Ebola virus has killed more than 10,000 people in the past year in West Africa. For the new study, researchers analyzed DNA from several outbreaks of Ebola. DNA holds the information that tells your body how to grow and function and is passed on from parents to children.

The researchers compared the DNA of Ebola samples collected in Guinea in March 2014 with Ebola samples from Sierra Leone collected in June. They also compared those samples to newer Ebola samples from Mali collected last fall. The researchers were looking to see if there were differences among the samples.

This new snapshot of Ebola showed that there were surprisingly few differences. The changes mostly appeared to be minor. In fact, the researchers calculated that there was little change in the mutation rate between Ebola now and in earlier outbreaks.

## Positive Vaccine Tests On Monkeys

The new study tracked changes in Ebola over a longer period than ever. This gives a fuller picture of the virus and its changes, said Heinz Feldmann, the main author of the study. He is a virus expert at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

The study means that it's "less likely than we thought that vaccines and treatment options will fail," Feldman said. Still, it may not be the final word. More samples of the virus taken in 2015 from other places in West Africa will give scientists a clearer picture, he said.

The results are much-needed good news in the fight against the deadly virus.

Currently, there is no proven vaccine to prevent Ebola. But several possible vaccines are being tested on people.

Recently, a vaccine was successful at preventing the disease in macaque monkeys. The monkeys often stand in for humans as test subjects.

"Findings in nonhuman primates are always significant," says Thomas Geisbert. He studies viruses at the University of Texas. Geisbert said the experts still have to see how the vaccine compares with others being tested in humans.

"The availability of a good and safe vaccine would make an immense difference. We are going to see future outbreaks of Ebola," said Keiji Fukuda. He is with the World Health Organization (WHO). Even if one drug is successful against Ebola, he said, researchers should continue to develop other drugs.

## Stronger Health Systems Are Necessary

Meanwhile, experts are starting to think about how to combat future outbreaks of Ebola.

Victor Dzau is the president of the Institute of Medicine. The organization is bringing together a group of 15 experts. Their mission is to figure out the best way to use international aid money and create strong health systems.

Their conclusions will be especially important. During the current Ebola outbreak, the international community took months to organize the response. It took months to send doctors and set up hospitals, and countries did not send enough money.

## Fewer Sick People

The number of Ebola cases has definitely slowed in West Africa. In total, 79 new cases of Ebola were reported to the WHO for the week of March 22. It was the lowest number of cases for a week in 2015 so far. Health experts are looking toward the day that Ebola will be gone from West Africa. Yet people in Sierra Leone and Guinea are still coming down with the disease.

In Liberia, which came close to being declared Ebola-free, a new case of Ebola was discovered last week.

As Ebola slows, the international health-care community may move on to other problems. Fukuda said he is  terrified that Ebola will disappear from people's memories. He said that would be tragic.
