DETROIT, Mich. — Electric car maker Tesla Motors has been trying to develop a fully self-driving automobile. On Wednesday, it introduced a revolutionary new autopilot system. The system lets cars change lanes by themselves.

The car makers Mercedes, Audi and Volvo already have their own autopilot systems. Tesla's new system does everything those other systems can do. It automatically keeps a car within its lane and maintains a certain distance from the car in front of it. It can find a parking spot and park itself. It also uses cameras and sensors to warn drivers when the car is in danger of being hit from the side.

However, Tesla's new lane-changing feature is a first for the car industry.

Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive officer, said the new system is a first in another way as well. He said it will constantly collect information on driving conditions and driving behavior. Over time, it will use that information to improve itself. For example, the system will note how quickly drivers can safely navigate a particular bend in the road or where stop signs are located.

The new system will change the experience of driving dramatically, Musk said.

## No Hands-Free Driving — Not Yet

Musk added a word of caution: Drivers need to keep their hands on the wheel, and the autopilot system will remind them if they do not.

"We're being especially cautious at this early stage, so we're advising drivers to keep their hands on the wheel just in case," he said. The system is still very new, he added.

Musk said it will be at least three years before fully hands-free driving is possible. He added that it will probably take longer than that for the government to allow it.

## Your Call Is Your Car's Command

The new autopilot feature can be added to around 60,000 vehicles that are already on the road. Owners will be able to install the update themselves. They can update software in their car's computer system over the Internet. Tesla automobiles made before September 2014 cannot be updated because they have older sensors.

Tesla is already working on another update, Musk said. It will allow a car to drive itself in and out of garages when the owner calls it.

## A Catch-Up Game

Automobile industry expert Karl Brauer said Tesla's new system puts it ahead of other car companies. General Motors' new Super Cruise system, for example, does not allow automatic lane-changing.

Brauer said the other companies will now have to try to catch up with Tesla.

"This is the game we're going to be playing, round and round, for the next five to 10 years," Brauer said. "Each time there's a step by someone out there, everyone will have to match it."

With each step forward, the automobile industry will move closer to the goal of a fully self-driving car.

## Autopilot's Risks And Rewards

Brauer said the rapid pace of change could be dangerous. It will mean that drivers may not know what their car is capable of.

If drivers do not fully understand their own cars, it could "introduce many more problems," he said.

Musk remains convinced about the benefits of autopilot, however.

"In the long term, it will be safer than a person driving," he said.
