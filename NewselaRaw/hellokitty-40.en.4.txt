LOS ANGELES — Hello Kitty is celebrating her 40th birthday.

Today, her super adorable cartoon face is on 50,000 products. She has helped sell everything from toasters to diamond necklaces. Stars love her. Lady Gaga wore a dress entirely made out of Hello Kitty dolls.

This week, the first convention celebrating everything Hello Kitty will take place at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. It is called, of course, Hello Kitty Con 2014. Nearby is a museum exhibit. Its name is "Hello! Exploring the Supercute World of Hello Kitty."

However, Hello Kitty is losing the popularity contest. Other cartoon characters are selling more dolls and other products these days.

For years, Hello Kitty was the best-selling character in Japan. Hello Ketty now is in third place. Number 2 is Mickey Mouse. Number 1 is Anpanman. He is a superhero whose head is a jam-filled bun. He sells the most of any character in Japan.

"I don't think this can go on forever," said Tom Looser. He is a professor at New York University. He said Hello Kitty is showing her age a bit.

## Fans Like That She Is Simple

Sanrio is the Japanese company that invented Hello Kitty in 1974. Sanrio sells $8 billion worth of Hello Kitty and other characters each year, said Janet Hsu of Sanrio.

Sanrio, though, does not want to rely on just Hello Kitty to make money.

Sanrio is searching for the next cute craze. Its artists have been busy making new characters. None of them has come close to Hello Kitty's success.

Some people say her simple design is the key to her popularity. Her face has no mouth, expression or personality. Fans can imagine whatever they want about her.

Roland Kelts wrote "Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Invaded the U.S." He said Hello Kitty is whatever people want her to be.

"If you had a lousy day … you come home to Hello Kitty on your sofa" and she will understand how you feel, Kelts said. On the other hand, he says if you had a good day, "Kitty feels good for you."

## Kitty Became A U.S. Favorite

She became popular in the United States about the same time Americans became interested in sushi and anime comics. Some scholars consider her the Number 1 example of kawaii, Japanese for cuteness. Kawaii is big in Japan.

Every so often, Sanrio tries to bring attention to the kitty. It organizes events like the convention and the museum exhibit. The exhibit at the Japanese American National Museum has attracted big crowds.

Like many stars, though, not everyone loves her.

## Kitty Can't Talk

Some say Hello Kitty has no ideas of her own. She can never talk back. After all, she has no mouth. There are blogs in her honor.

Inside the museum exhibit, a DJ wears Hello Kitty headphones. Longtime Hello Kitty fan Gianfranco Ocampo is there. The 23-year-old art student said he collected Hello Kitty dolls as a kid. He also has attended Hello Kitty tea parties.

Davi Marchi, who is with Sanrio, can't exactly explain why people love the kitty.

"If I could explain it," he said, "we would have 30 huge characters."
