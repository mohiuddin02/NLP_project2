The planet has been getting warmer. The heat is causing ice near the North and South Poles to melt. In Greenland, the ice is melting fast. Greenland is a huge island in the north.

A group of scientists wanted to know more about Greenland's ice. They studied at how much ice has melted over the years.

The scientists say that 9,103 gigatons of ice have melted since 1900. A gigaton is a huge weight. It is hard to even imagine how heavy it is. If you stacked 5 million Statues of Liberty on a scale, that would be about 1 gigaton.

## Ice Is Melting Faster

The scientists also found that the melting is speeding up. Ice in Greenland has started to melt more quickly. There was a huge amount of ice loss from 2003 to 2010. That was only eight years. It was twice the amount of ice loss that occurred over 100 years earlier. Those years were from 1900 to 1999.

Scientists believe that the ice is melting faster because the Earth is warmer. Scientists think that it is because of the fuel that people use. People burn these fuels to make energy. Many things from cars to electric lights run on this energy.

Burning the fuels create greenhouse gases. The gases become trapped in the air above. They store heat, making the world hotter. Scientists call this global warming.

## Warmer Temperatures Mean Higher Oceans

As it gets warmer, more ice melts. Melting ice could make the oceans fuller. When ice melts, it adds more water to the oceans. Oceans then rise. Water might start to rise onto the land. It could cause much damage.

The ice that has melted in Greenland has already made the oceans rise. Scientists think that it has added about an inch to the world's oceans.

If the ice keeps melting, the oceans will get higher. The big question is: How warm will the planet get? 

Last month, world leaders met in Paris, France, to talk about global warming. They agreed to try to keep the Earth from getting too hot. 

Hopefully they will do enough to keep Greenland's ice from melting.
