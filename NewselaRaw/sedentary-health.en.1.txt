LOS ANGELES — If you want to stay healthy in old age, spend more time on your feet, according to a new study.

It's not enough for people to get regular exercise as they get older. Researchers say it's also important not to spend too much time sitting down.

In fact, every extra hour of sitting nearly doubles the risk of disability for people over 60. These disabilities include problems getting around the house and feeding themselves, according to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of Physical Activity &amp; Health.

This holds true independent of how much activity a person gets, the researchers concluded. Researchers from Northwestern's Feinberg Medical School, Rush University Medical Center, Harvard School of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention participated in the study.

## Nine Out Of 14 Hours

People who get up and do even 30 minutes of light activity can improve their health, researchers said. Stand-up bingo, anyone?

"A sedentary lifestyle is associated with a variety of poor health outcomes, including increased (cases of) diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mortality," the researchers wrote. But many people may have thought they'd done what they needed to if they met federal recommendations of 150 minutes a week of moderate activity.

Apparently not so.

The question was whether people were sedentary – or not moving around – because they were not doing any exercise, or whether being sedentary was on its own a risk factor for disability.

The researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2003 to 2005. The data include questionnaires and physical exams from 2,286 people 60 and older whose physical activity had been monitored.

The study found that people in that sample spent almost nine of their waking hours a day sitting down, and 3.6 percent of them reported disability in their activities of daily living. This includes having trouble getting in and out of bed, getting dressed, and being able to walk in the house. The average time the people in the sample spent awake was 14 hours.

## "Sitting Is The New Smoking"

About 12 percent of them reported no chronic conditions, while 52 percent reported arthritis, 58 percent reported hypertension and 30 percent reported [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity). People who were sedentary longer tended to be older, male, more educated and less wealthy. They also tended to smoke and have a chronic illness.

Sitting has been getting a lot of attention lately, to the point that there's a new saying: "Sitting is the new smoking." In addition to encouraging everyone to sit less, the study's authors specifically encouraged people to exercise during TV watching and during work hours. Walking to meetings and standing at desks are other ways to be more active and reduce the amount of time sitting still, according to the researchers.

"The real problem is that we are raising sedentary children," said one of the researchers, Pamela Semanik, assistant professor of adult and gerontological nursing at Rush College of Nursing in Chicago. "It's so (common) in our culture."

At her department in Rush, the study has prompted people to change their ways and sit less, said Semanik, who has changed her ways, too. Semanik said she personally has sold her car and reads articles while walking on a treadmill.

The researchers in the current study said as many as 5.3 million annual deaths worldwide are related to not enough activity.

So how much coach potato time is OK?

"That's the $64,000 question," Semanik said. "We don't know how much is OK." She said researchers suspect that one way to lessen the harm caused by sitting is by taking frequent breaks to move around.

## Sedentary Lifestyle's Bad Effects

The study, according to the researchers, appears to be the first to document how sedentary behavior relates to disability in activities of daily living, regardless of how much people exercise. There were limits to research, though. The gadgets used to monitor activity, called accelerometers, don't detect such movements as cycling and were not worn for swimming.

The research supports programs that would get people to spend less time sitting, regardless of what exercises they do. "Among some older adults, reducing sedentary behavior may be a more attainable goal than increasing moderate-vigorous activity," the researchers wrote. This is especially true in people who suffer from illnesses, pain, and those with conditions like heart disease.

The researchers are not suggesting there's no value in moderate exercise, which they said is an inexpensive way to be healthier and reduce health care costs. But the current study is looking "at a very different question," which is how people stay independent, out of nursing homes and able to fend for themselves, Semanik said.

But, they wrote, "Even a large daily dose of moderate-vigorous activity may not be sufficient to offset the (negative) effects of a sedentary lifestyle."
