JERUSALEM â€” Last month, Professor Mohammed Dajani took 30 Palestinian students to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp. He didn't expect his people to support it. But he had no idea how much anger the visit would stir up.

In online posts and comments, Palestinians called the visit betrayal. People told him to be careful. They suggested that he stay away from his university in East Jerusalem and think about going on vacation.

"People said we were giving support to (Israel) as if we were giving up on our rights," said Dajani. He directs he American Studies program at Al Quds University. The university is located in East Jerusalem on the city's Arab side, which is part of Israel in the Middle East. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. He also heads a group called Wasatia that promotes moderation and peace among Palestinians.

The Palestinians are seeking their own state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which border the State of Israel. Israel controls the West Bank, and talks to create a Palestinian state have broken down.

## History Helps Shape An Idea

Dajani said he got the idea of taking students to Auschwitz after he traveled there three years ago. About 1 million Jews were killed at Auschwitz during the Holocaust, the destruction of the European Jewish community by Nazi Germany.

"In my community you see a lot of ignorance of the Holocaust," Dajani said. He added that many Palestinians deny the Holocaust ever happened.

"People don't want to recognize the suffering of the" Jews, Dajani said.

"The conflict with Israel has poisoned the whole attitude toward" the Holocaust, he said.

Israel was created in 1948 after the Holocaust. Many of the Jews who survived the Holocaust found a home there. In the minds of many Palestinians, the Holocaust is linked to the Jewish State.

During Israel's War of Independence, many Palestinians fled or were forced to leave their homes by the Israeli army. Many Palestinians consider the founding of Israel a tragedy, equal to the Holocaust. They remember their suffering in annual commemorations just as Jews have Holocaust Remembrance Day. Holocaust Remembrance Day took place this past Sunday.

"The Holocaust is not taught in Palestinian schools and universities," Dajani said. "It is a history ignored."

## Showing Sympathy To All People

Dajani wants Palestinians to learn about the Holocaust. The trip to Auschwitz was arranged as part of a project sponsored by a Germany university. The program also included a visit by Israeli students to a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank.

In Poland, the Palestinians visited Krakow near Auschwitz. There, they learned about Jewish life before the Holocaust and visited former Jewish neighborhoods and synagogues. In Auschwitz, the group heard from two people who survived the Holocaust. It's believed to be the first trip to a concentration camp by Palestinian students.

"I visited the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem three years ago, but here it was different," said Salim Sweidan. He is a Palestinian student who went on the trip. "When you step on the soil where millions were killed, it leaves a big impression."

Palestinians accused the participants of showing sympathy with Israelis. "But I say no, this was sympathy with the human beings who were killed there," Sweidan added.

## Education Can Change Minds

Nasser al-Qad is a student at Al Quds. He said he joined the trip because it was his duty as a human being, "regardless of our (conflict) with the Israeli side."

He added, "We went there for education, and we believe that there are no restrictions over education." He said Israelis should recognize the Palestinian suffering caused by Israel.

Abdullah Dweikat, a Palestinian columnist, condemned the trip. He said he rejected the killing of any human being because of religion, country or political views. But he also said he could not ignore "wounds and pain of our people."

Sweidan said many people privately expressed support to participants.

Dajani said he used to view Israelis as tyrants. Then his father became sick. Dajani said that the treatment of his father and other Arab patients at an Israeli hospital changed his attitude toward Israelis.

"The conflict with Israel has (affected) the whole attitude toward" the Holocaust, Dajani said.

Why did he take students on the trip? "I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do," he said. "I would do it again."
