MIAMI, Fla. — On Monday, Jeb Bush came to Miami Dade College to announce he is running for president. Neither his father nor his brother was in the audience. Still, Jeb joked about his two famous family members. He said he met his first president the day he was born and the second the day he came home from the hospital.

Bush soon turned serious. The presidency is something to be earned, not inherited, he said.

"Not a one of us deserves the job," the onetime Florida governor said.

"It's nobody's turn," Bush went on. "It's everybody's test, and it's wide open — exactly as a contest for president should be."

## His Family Already Had Two Presidents

Jeb Bush is the son of President George H.W. Bush and the younger brother of President George W. Bush. His family ties may help him win in 2016. They could also make things harder for him. Voters may turn against him if they think he feels he should be president just because he is part of the Bush family.

Bush's announcement drew hours of television coverage and dozens of reporters. The event was carefully designed to send a message: Jeb Bush is a new kind of Republican, even if he is 62 years old.

The Republican Party is more traditional than the country's other main political party, the Democrats. Most Republicans want things to remain much as they always have been, or to go back to what they once were. The average Republican voter is white and older.

Such voters are becoming less common because the United States is becoming more diverse. Many people think that to keep doing well, the Republicans will have to attract new kinds of voters.

Jeb Bush thinks he may be the Republican to do just that. On Monday, Latin music pulsed outside the college gymnasium where his announcement was made. English, Spanish and several other languages mixed together during the event.

## He Lists His Experience As Florida's Governor

Bush ran through his record as governor, pointing to what he said were his many successes. He suggested that his time as governor had prepared him to serve as president. Most of the other people running for president do not have that kind of experience, he said.

Bush promised to help the many Americans who are now out of work. If he becomes president, he will take steps that will lead to about 19 million new jobs, he said.

Bush has been mentioned as a possible president for years. Still, he surprised many in December when he finally said he planned to run.

Perhaps more surprising is the fact that so far he has not been doing that well.

## Republican Primary Has Many Candidates

Many people expected Bush to be the clear front-runner. Instead, he has failed to pull ahead of the many other Republicans who are running. The Republicans must first run against each other in the primaries. The winner of that contest will face a Democrat in the general election. Right now, Hillary Rodham Clinton is the most likely winner of the Democratic primary.

Bush last ran for office more than 12 years ago. As a result, he now sometimes seems out of practice. For example, he did not do too well in answering a question about whether he backed the unpopular war his brother started in Iraq. Bush finally said he would not have supported the war if he knew then what he knows now.

Bush is also out of step with the Republican Party overall. The party has grown much more conservative — more attached to traditional ideas — since he last ran for office. Many Republicans may see him as not conservative enough, and as too much like a Democrat.

On Monday, Bush said he is sure he can win the presidency. He said he will bring the Republican Party to his way of thinking, not the other way around.
