BALTIMORE, Md. â€” Five-year-old Griffin Matuszek was born without part of his hand. He tried using a man-made one called a prosthetic. He thought it was pretty useless and a bit scary.

Now, Griffin has a new hand that he likes a lot more. It was made with a 3-D printer, which melts sheets of plastic into three-dimensional objects. The hand is cheap and easy for him to use.

"He put it on and immediately gave Dr. Chi a high-five," said his mother. Albert Chi is Griffin's doctor. "He was able to pick up a small ball and throw it with his left hand right away."

## Every Child Should Have One

Each year, about 1,500 children are born missing part of a hand, the U.S. government says. Many children also lose hands in accidents.

The need for man-made hands has created a special network of people. It includes inventors, artists, medical workers, parents and fans of 3-D printing. They make 3-D printed hands to replace missing hands. The network wants to give free printed hands to any child who needs them.

"One of the first kids we fitted was a 2-year-old," Chi said. He is a doctor at John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Before the toddler even put it on, "the kid was picking an object up."

Chi made his first 3-D hand with a printer his wife bought him for Father's Day. With free designs he found online, he printed a hand on plastic for about $20. Usually, man-made hands cost up to $40,000.

## It Glows In The Dark!

A group called e-NABLE matches kids with 3-D printers. They have helped more than 400 kids get 3-D printed hands over the past year. The group posts free designs on its website. By using them, families may be printing their own.

The 3-D printed hands are really useful for children. Children grow quickly and soon their artificial hand becomes too small. Replacements are expensive. Their families may not be able to afford to buy a new one every few months or few years.

The 3-D hands can be lighter and easier for kids to use. They also come in their favorite colors.

Griffin asked for a 3-D hand that glows in the dark.

Griffin liked the hand because he could put it on himself and it was easy to use. His old one was tight and covered the lower part of his arm.

Griffin's 3-D printed hand made him happy and more confident. His mother was grateful. She promised to pay for a 3-D printed hand for another child every time Griffin got a new one.

## Working Together To Make Them Better

To make a 3-D printed hand, plastic sheets are fed into the printer and melted. The plastic comes out in layers. They look like Legos. The pieces are fitted together with plastic bolts.

Hand parts take up to 10 hours to print. Putting them together takes another couple of hours. Once they are on, kids can make the hands grasp objects.

Two men created the first 3-D printed hand design over the Internet. In 2011, Richard Van As, a carpenter in South Africa, accidentally lost some fingers. He couldn't afford to buy artificial fingers, so he invented his own. He needed help, though, making them more useful.

He looked online and found a giant puppet that used metal cables. He began working with its maker, Ivan Owen, to make a usable hand. Owen lives in Washington state.

They eventually made better 3-D printed hands they called Robohands. They put the designs on the Internet. Anyone can use them for free.

"It's a powerful experience watching someone use a new hand," Owen said.
