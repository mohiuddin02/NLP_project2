What did President Abraham Lincoln do on your birthday 150 years ago?  A new online project might be able to tell you.

The project is putting historical Lincoln papers on the Internet.

"Millions of people around the world are fascinated by Abraham Lincoln," said Daniel Stowell. He is the director and editor of The Papers of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. It is in Springfield, Illinois.

He and his staff are scanning more than 150,000 papers written by or to our 16th president. So far, they have put about 100,000 documents online. They are also posting as many day-to-day events of Lincoln's life as possible. They have discovered what Lincoln did on more than than 7,100 days. It can be found on the website, thelincolnlog.org.

## World Leaders Liked Lincoln

On March 9, 1844, for instance, Abraham Lincoln paid 25 cents for mittens. On Feb. 9, 1864, several artists painted pictures of him. One of them was the portrait used for the $5 bill.

Stowell thinks that even information about Lincoln's death will help people understand him. Lincoln was killed by a shooter almost 150 years ago.

On April 29, 1965, England's Queen Victoria wrote a letter to Mary Todd Lincoln, his wife. The queen called Lincoln's death "so terrible a calamity." The letter can be found on the citizenlincoln.org website.

People can also read what world leaders say about Lincoln today.

Benjamin Netanyahu is the prime minister of Israel. He leads Israel's government. In October, Netanyahu sent a letter to the museum. He said he got strength from Lincoln. In Israel, there are streets named after Lincoln.

Stowell said he is using the Internet to get young people interested in Lincoln. He also wants to reach museum-goers and Lincoln fans of all ages.

## Lots Of Letters to Read

The Papers of Abraham Lincoln plans to put nearly 200,000 documents about the president online. They will be found on papersofabrahamlincoln.org. Stowell estimates about 50,000 more papers exist.

The papers are old and fragile, he said. The project preserves each one and lets people see them.

Amy Henrikson and Joan Walters work on the project. They are volunteers. They do their best to read the handwritten letters and documents and copy them down.

Poor handwriting and hurried writing make their job challenging. All of it is interesting, Henrikson said, and "much of it is moving."

She remembers seeing a letter written to Lincoln by a Louisiana teacher. The man begged the president for a job up North. He had spoken out against the Southern states separating from the United States. He told Lincoln he feared for his family's safety.

Walters remembers a letter written by Lincoln in February 1861. The letter was to the man renting Lincoln's home. The price was $350 a year.

"His feet were always planted on the ground," Walters said about Lincoln. "He never was too big for any job that needed to be done."

"I think my job is terribly important," Walters said. The goal is to make the papers available to everybody in the world who has a computer.

## Papers Keep Turning Up

Daniel Weinberg owns The Abraham Lincoln Book Shop in Chicago. Recently, he told Stowell about 45 Lincoln papers in the shop. Stowell came to the store to make copies of them.

Are there still important Lincoln papers to be found? Weinberg asked. Every once in a while, he said, something important turns up.

Weinberg called Lincoln a true genius. "Why would we not want people worldwide to be able to learn more from him?" Weinberg said.
