BERKELEY, Calif. â€” Demonstrators around the country are raising their voices against the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police. They are not just chanting slogans like "Hands up! Don't Shoot!" They are singing protest songs to express their anger and pain.

Protest songs have not been heard in the U.S. since the 1960s. Then, singer and activist Pete Seeger helped make "We Shall Overcome" an important song of the 1960s civil rights movement. The civil rights movement fought to give black people full equality in the United States.

Now, old protest songs are being sung by a new generation. New songs are being shared with many people and some of them are even from major artists. Traditional holiday songs are also being rewritten with lyrics about recent events.

"Facts aren't fueling this fire. Feeling is what is fueling this fire," said Daniels Watts. He is a Broadway performer who starred in a protest flash mob in New York City's Times Square. "Until we express those feelings and those feelings are understood, we aren't going to get too far."

## Singing Through Social Media

In the last few weeks, protests broke out across the country after two grand juries decided that two white police officers would not face a trial. The two officers were involved in the deaths of the two black men, Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Garner and Brown were killed in different states over the summer. Both were killed while the officers were trying to arrest them.

One of the tunes popular on the streets and social media was written six weeks ago by Luke Nephew. He is a 32-year-old New York poet who has composed songs for different kinds of protests. His song starts, "I still hear my brother crying, 'I can't breathe.' Now I'm in the struggle singing. I can't leave."

Hundreds of people sang those words last week as they protested the grand jury decision in the Garner case.

Nephew first introduced the song at a meeting of activists preparing for the decision about whether the officer would have to go to trial. The activists shared it with their groups so as many people as possible could sing along. A recording was posted on YouTube with links to it on social media like Facebook and Twitter.

One of the activists, Jose Lopez, said they were told, "Make sure you are taking this back to your organizations. Make sure you are learning this."

## Singing Old Protest Songs

Singer and radio host Darlene McCoy is the founder of a protest group called Mothers of Black Sons. She was watching television when she heard protesters sing the song as police arrested them. She replayed the broadcast to write down the song's words.

McCoy immediately recorded herself singing it and posted it on Instagram. She then challenged other singers to do the same. At least one of the video clips has been viewed nearly 750,000 times.

Some protesters are rediscovering popular music of the past. They are singing "A Change is Gonna Come" by Sam Cooke and Michael Jackson's "They Don't Really Care About Us."

Nephew wonders why music hasn't really been a part of American protest movements since the 1960s. He thinks it's partly because people are no longer used to singing together. Also, younger Americans are turned off by folk and gospel tunes about events that happened in the past.

Questlove is the drummer for the hip-hop band the Roots. Through social media apps such as Instagram and Twitter, he urged fellow musicians last week "to be a voice of the times that we live in." He noted that "protest songs don't have to be boring or non-danceable."

## Professionals, And Amateurs Too

Several professional musicians have already released songs in memory of Brown and Garner. These include Alicia Keys, rapper Crooked I and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morelo.

Amateurs have gotten into the act too. In St. Louis, a group interrupted a symphony performance of Brahms' "Requiem." They sang a song they called "Requiem for Mike Brown" and scattered confetti hearts from the balcony. A requiem is the Catholic religious service for the dead.

Other protests adopt a Christmas theme with what they call "justice carols." These rewrite the words to holiday classics. Instead of "O Little Town of Bethlehem," they sing "O Little Town of Ferguson."

During the Vietnam War protests of the 1960s and early 1970s, songs were an important symbol of the times. Whether any of the current protest songs come to have the same meaning, though, isn't exactly clear.

Ian Peddie is an English professor at Georgia Gwinnett College. He studies popular music and human rights. It often takes time for ideas to trickle through society and for people to write meaningful tunes, he said.
