This week, scientists in Europe made space history. They landed a spacecraft on a comet.

Philae is the name of the spacecraft that landed on a comet called 67P. The spacecraft is a moving laboratory about the size of a washing machine.

Scientists from the European Space Agency (ESA) hope studying a comet up close can unlock mysteries about our solar system. Comets like 67P may contain materials left over from when our solar system first began.

## Rosetta And Comet Finally Meet

This project began in 1993. The ESA started designing and building a spaceship and lander. The spaceship is named Rosetta. Philea is the lander.

Rosetta, with Philae attached, was launched in 2004.

For the last 10 years, the Rosetta orbiter has been chasing comet 67P through space.

Three months ago, Rosetta finally caught up with 67P. It has been flying alongside since then, as the comet heads toward the sun. While near the comet, Rosetta searched for a good place for Philae to land.

The final part of the mission began this week: Philae needed to land on the comet. Early Wednesday morning, the Philae lander left Rosetta.

Philae began its slow, 14-mile fall to the surface of the comet. Comet 67P is about the size of a mountain. It does have gravitational pull, but not nearly as much as Earth. Only 1/60,000, in fact.

## No Worries

Philae fell slowly. ESA scientists thought it would take seven to 10 hours to reach the comet.

Once it hit the surface, Philae sent a message to the Rosetta orbiter to say where it landed. Rosetta sent the message on to Earth. The message took 28 minutes to cross 300 million miles of space.

At the mission command center in Germany, scientists cheered when they got the news.

The ESA had warned that Philea's landing could possibly fail. Philae needed to be upright to work right. Many boulders on the comet made a difficult surface to land on.

Though the landing went smoothly, it was not perfect. Philae was supposed to send out two harpoons — sharp metal spears — to attach itself to the comet. ESA scientists said those harpoons did not fire. Whether to try firing the harpoons again is a "tricky" decision, a lead ESA scientist said. Because the comet has such weak gravity, firing the harpoons could shoot the lander back into space.

## Much A Comet Can Teach Us

The ESA scientists believe they can learn a lot from comet 67P. They want to learn what comets are made of. They want to know if comets might have brought water to a newly formed Earth. They want to investigate the inside of a comet. They are curious why the surface of a comet is dark black.

They also think comets can answer bigger questions about where it all came from. The nuclei, or solid center, of a comet may contain material from the earliest days of the solar system. It is possible that life on Earth was due to comets. These space scientists hope to see the origins our solar system, and ourselves, up close.
