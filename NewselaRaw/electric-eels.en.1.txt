Electric eels can use their zapping power in subtle and surprising ways. A new study finds that when dealing with struggling or hard-to-subdue prey, these eels bend their bodies into a horseshoe-like shape. Doing that more than doubles the voltage they deliver to their almost-meal.

The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, shed new light on the abilities of these remarkable hunters.

"Even an animal that's been studied for centuries may be doing amazing things that we were unaware of (until) we look closely," said study author Kenneth Catania.

## "Remote Control" Helps Find Fish

Catania, a biologist, has studied these eels for a while. Earlier, he discovered that they can "remote control" their prey, by sending out a jolt of electricity that forces hidden fish to twitch and thus reveal their location. Once the eels shock their quarry, they reposition it in the water so they can swallow it head-first. In that brief moment, the fish, if it can withstand the electric attack, has its only chance to swim off and avoid becoming an eel meal.

During his research, Catania started to notice something odd: Many of the eels would curl up their bodies when zapping a meal, bringing their head toward their tail with the fish in between. Then they would release the fish to reposition it before gobbling it down.

Catania observed that younger, juvenile eels — often just 3 to 10 inches long, and with less shocking power — curled up frequently during their electric attacks. More massive, adult eels almost never bothered to do so. The only time they did was when they were trying to subdue particularly difficult prey, such as a large crayfish, which could take extra time to properly reposition.

## Effect Similar To Horseshoe Magnet

The eels' electricity-producing organ has both a positive and a negative end, with the positive end at the head and the negative end in the tail. So it seemed that by curling their bodies, the eels might be bringing the opposing ends of that organ closer together to concentrate the stunning power. Such an effect can be seen with a horseshoe magnet, in which the magnetic field is concentrated by bringing the positive and negative poles together.

To find out if this was indeed what was happening, Catania decided to design an experiment. He took a brain-dead fish equipped with electrodes and put it near an eel as bait, then measured the voltage applied when the eel attacked. Sure enough, the fish received more than double the voltage when the eel curled its body, bringing the opposite ends of its electricity-generating organ together.

## Shocks Cause Temporary Paralysis

The eel then would batter the prey's body with a series of shocks that forced the animal's muscles to contract until they reached exhaustion. In effect the the animal was paralyzed temporarily, making it safe for the eel to release and reposition it.

The findings are part of a growing body of research showing that eels do not use their electric powers as a blunt tool. Rather, they use them in a variety of subtle and sophisticated ways.

Catania still wants to explore a basic and perplexing question: How does the eel avoid shocking itself?

"How they protect their nervous system and their own brain and their own muscles from being activated — as far as I know, it's pretty much an open question," Catania said.
