WICHITA, Kan. â€” Athletes with special needs just scored a big win in Wichita, Kansas. They scored varsity letters.

These colorful cloth patches are letter-shaped awards. They are given to talented high school athletes all over the country. Athletes usually sew the letters onto their jackets so everyone can see them.

The best sports teams in every school are called varsity teams. Students with special needs do not usually play on varsity teams, so they do not have a chance to earn varsity letters. Although sometimes they help the teams in other ways.

Thanks to the Wichita school board, that is about to change. Wichita athletes with special needs will now receive varsity letters when they meet athletic goals of their own.

## Who Is A Varsity Athlete?

The idea of giving varsity letters to athletes with special needs started with Michael Kelley. Michael is a student at Wichita East High School. He has special needs and plays sports in the Tri-County Athletic League.

Michael's mom, Jolinda Kelley, bought him a letter jacket. She says Michael's school would not let him wear his letter jacket because of his disability. The school said that only varsity athletes could wear letter jackets.

Michael's school district says that is not true. Either way, the problem got people all over the country talking about how schools should treat athletes with disabilities.

Now there is a new varsity-letter rule that is part of a plan created by the Tri-County Athletic League. The league runs competitive sports teams for students with special needs. Athletes from 11 different high schools play in the Tri-County league.

Bryan Wilson helps run the Tri-County league. Wilson says the school board's vote means that the every high school in Wichita will start using the league's plan. The plan will help make things fair for athletes with special needs. Some athletes will even earn varsity letters this year.

To earn a letter, athletes with special needs must play a sport for at least two seasons. They cannot miss too many practices and games. An athlete must also have good grades and be a good sport.

## All The Votes Said "Yes" To Letters

At the Wichita school board meeting, Michael Kelley sat in the audience with his family. They wore black T-shirts that said "#GiveThemLetters." Many people had been using that hashtag to talk about the problem on Facebook and Twitter.

Jolinda Kelley said that she appreciated everyone's support, but she does not think "give" is actually the right word to use. She does not want Michael's school to "give" him a letter just because he wants one. She says Michael and other athletes with special needs deserve varsity letters. They earn them by working hard and showing teamwork.

Every single member of the school board agreed with Jolinda Kelley and the Tri-County Athletic League. They all voted to use the league's plan for athletes with special needs. Now Wichita schools will give varsity letters to athletes like Michael.

## The Message Was Heard

After hearing the results of the vote, Jolinda Kelley said that she was thankful that the school board had heard her message. She was also disappointed that one little letter had become such a big deal.

Tonda McGrath agreed. She said that if the school had responded to their concerns quickly and respectfully, there would have been no need for a vote.

Marty Rothwell works for a group that helps people with disabilities. Rothwell was very happy with the school board's decision. Rothwell thanked the school board for supporting the Tri-County league. He says it is important to give students with disabilities a way to play sports, set goals and represent their schools.

Rothwell thanked the school board for giving students with disabilities a "chance to shine."
