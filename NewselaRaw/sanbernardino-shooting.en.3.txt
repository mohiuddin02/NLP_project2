WASHINGTON, D.C. — Attackers stormed a holiday party in San Bernardino, California, this Wednesday. They killed 14 people and wounded 21. 

At first it seemed to be just another mass shooting. Such shootings happen almost routinely in the United States. They have become all too familiar.

President Barack Obama quickly called for tougher gun laws. Around the same time, Donald Trump said guns are not the problem. He thinks the problem is that the shooters are mentally ill. They are just plain crazy, he said.

## Political Parties Disagree When It Comes To Guns

Obama is a Democrat, while Trump is a Republican. These two political parties often do not agree with each other and run against each other in elections. Trump is now running for president.

On Wednesday, both Obama and Trump said exactly what people expect to hear after a mass shooting. What Obama said is the usual thing Democrats say, while what Trump said was usual for a Republican.

Then, the police released new information about Wednesday's attack. They said the attackers might  have been linked to Islamic militants. 

Islamic militants are fighters who are trying to spread their own kind of Islam. Like Christianity, Islam is one of the world's main religions. Its followers are called Muslims. 

There are many different kinds of Islam. Most have nothing to do with fighting, and most Muslims are peaceful.

There are some large groups of Islamic fighters, though. They include ISIS and the Taliban, two groups who are trying to push their own form of Islam on the Middle East. The United States is fighting both groups. 

Some people worry that some U.S. Muslims might be won over by foreign Islamic fighters. They fear they could strike here in this country.

## Presidential Response More Careful

By Thursday, both Obama and Trump were talking differently about Wednesday's attack. Other Democrats and Republicans were speaking differently about it also.

After most mass shootings, Democrats usually call for tighter gun laws. Tougher laws will stops guns from getting into the wrong hands, they say.

Republicans usually say guns are not the problem. They say Americans have the right to own guns. 

Instead of tougher gun laws, the country needs a better way to spot mentally ill people, Republicans say. If mental problems are spotted early enough, mentally ill people will not become violent. Instead, they can get the help they need.

On Thursday, the president chose his words carefully. He asked for patience and told Americans they were safe. He did not call for gun control as strongly as he usually does.

Instead, Obama asked lawmakers to find a way to make it "a little harder" for people to get guns.

## Trump's Response Also Changed

Trump also spoke differently about the attack. On Thursday he said it was linked to "Islamic terrorism," not mental illness. 

Many Republicans say Democrats do not do enough to keep America safe from possible attacks by Islamic fighters. Democrats say that is not true.

On Thursday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters about the president's plans. He said Obama will still try to strengthen gun laws. Earnest said the shooters in San Bernardino could have been stopped if gun laws had been changed.

We have to "keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them," Earnest said. Still, he admitted the attack might have happened even if gun laws had been changed.

## Some Republicans Say Islamic Terror Is On The Rise

Some Republicans still focused on the mental health of shooters.

"That's one thing that really has to get addressed," Republican Paul Ryan said Thursday morning. Ryan was careful not to call the latest shooting an attack by Islamic militants. He said he would wait until all the facts were known.

Some of his fellow Republicans were not so careful.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz said the shooting was a reminder the United States is at war. The latest attack is another example "of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism here at home," Cruz said. Like Trump, Cruz is now running for president.
