DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Inside the gallery, artworks by Syrian artists were drawing auction bids from collectors. Outside on the street, the artists traded the latest gossip from Syria. Periodically, they checked their smartphones for news from that country's civil war.

Such is the divided life of these Syrian artists, who are now based in Dubai. Brought to the Gulf state by their gallery, they are able to continue their work in safety. At the same time, they remain deeply connected to Syria and influenced by the bloodshed they left behind.

The outflow of Syrian refugees — now at 2 million and growing — has fanned out across the region and beyond for more than two years. It ranges from inhabitants of tent camps in Jordan to others trying to rebuild their lives in cities such as Beirut and Istanbul.

But for those fleeing Syria, the Gulf states present a contradiction: On the one hand, the Gulf states are some of the strongest backers of the Syrian rebels. On the other hand, they are denying entry to all but a handful of refugees.

## Saving Syria's Art And Culture

The auction in Dubai's art district this past Monday is part of a small but forward-looking effort. Syria's civil war has already claimed more than 100,000 lives. With no end in sight, the goal is to save part of the country's artistic community.

"It's a tragedy what is happening there now. But it would be an even bigger tragedy if all this art and culture that Syria has so much of would be lost," said gallery owner Hisham Samawi. His Ayyam Gallery moved from Damascus to Dubai in late 2011 as the Arab Spring rebellion widened.

"For us,'" he added, "the artists are part of our family. We had to do it. It was for us and for them."

Step by step for nearly two years, the gallery's operators moved 15 artists and their families to Dubai. To obtain visas for the Syrians, the gallery hired them as employees. Meanwhile, Ayyam crews managed to ship about 3,000 artworks as fighting intensified in the Syrian capital.

Among those under the gallery's wings in Dubai is Tammam Azzam, one of the rising stars in Syria's revolution-inspired art world. A Damascus-born painter, Azzam has shifted to prints and multimedia work. His goal is to draw attention to the horrors of conflict.

## Artistic Voices Of The Civil War

One piece, "Freedom Graffiti," superimposed Gustav Klimt's beautiful painting "The Kiss" over a shattered and bullet-scarred apartment wall. The image became an Internet sensation and established the 33-year-old Azzam as one of the artistic voices of the civil war.

Another piece done since his arrival in Dubai is "Syrian Olympics," a digital print of stick-figure stencils in the shape of Olympic event logos. In it, shooters aim like snipers at runners.

A signed copy sold for $12,000 at Monday's auction, which was attended by more than 300 people. A copy of "Freedom Graffiti" brought in $6,000.

"I have to do something for the people there," said Azzam. "I want to do anything to send any message to people around the world about what happened in my country: People dying every day, every minute, and nobody can stop that."

Azzam struggles with the frustrating feeling that "art doesn't make sense" in the middle of a war.

But conflict has always been an incubator for creativity. Consider, for example, 18th-century political cartoons commenting on the American and French revolutions. Or works inspired by the 1930s Spanish Civil War, such as Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso)'s powerful "Guernica." And now, the Web-driven protest art of Middle East uprisings.

## Protest Art Of The Arab Spring

In Iran, artwork flowed onto the Internet following the disputed 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. During the latest election this June, Iran's art community rallied around the imaginary candidacy of comic book heroine "Zahra."

Since 2011, dozens of high-profile exhibitions have showcased the work of Arab Spring artists. Among those featured was Egyptian Ahmed Basiony. He was killed during anti-government protests in the final days of Hosni Mubarak's rule.

In Turkey this summer, anti-government protesters engaged in a kind of mass performance art. Inspired by choreographer Erdem Gunduz's "Standing Man," they stood motionless during fighting around Istanbul's Taksim Square.

"The artists are paramount, so we had to get them out," said gallery owner Samawi. "There was no question about it. It wasn't like: We'll go find other artists. These are our artists. We believe in them and believe they have a voice."

According to Samawi, there are plans to try to bring other Syrian artists out of the country. But such efforts have become more complicated. Fighting has intensified and the threat of U.S.–led military action has led to an increasing lockdown in Damascus.

"It's a good thing we started when we did," said Samawi. "It becomes more and more difficult as every month passes."

The artist Azzam said friends are watching his abandoned studio in Damascus. "But who knows if it will be there when I return," he said. "And who knows when I can return."
