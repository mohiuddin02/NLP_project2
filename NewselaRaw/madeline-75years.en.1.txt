_In an old house in Paris  
that was covered with vines_

So begins "Madeline," one of the most loved children's books, which turns 75 this year.

Word for word, page by page, the story of little girls who left the house at half past 9, in two straight lines, in rain or shine, has entranced generations of children. Especially loved is the title character herself, Madeline, the smallest and most fearless.

"Madeline" was published 75 years ago by author Ludwig Bemelmans. In October and November, the Chicago Public Library is marking the anniversary with "Madeline" birthday parties at six libraries. Special activities and a costumed "Madeline" character will be at the Bookamania children's book fair on Nov. 22 at the Harold Washington Library.

But some of us have been celebrating "Madeline," and the other special books of our childhoods, all along. We have passed our love of these classics on to our own children.

## A Parent's Voice At Bedtime

Books like "Madeline" pack serious power. You don't just read them. You reread them, again and again, the words drumming into your memory so strongly that after 50 years, they are still there.

Or you are read to, in that delicious cocoon spun by a parent's voice at bedtime. Decades later, the book remains a gateway to the past. All I have to do is read the last page of "Madeline" to hear my mother's voice whisper those last lines:

_And she turned out the light —  
and closed the door —  
and that's all there is —  
there isn't any more._

Childhood books feel utterly real, even if they are populated by talking animals. For years I was sure I had personally witnessed the last scene in Margaret Wise Brown's "Wait Till the Moon Is Full." I thought I had seen the raccoon child playing ball with his raccoon and rabbit friends while their raccoon and rabbit mothers knitted and chatted under the full moon's light.

I wanted my daughters to see it too, so when they were young I started reading that book and my other childhood favorites to them.

## Passing Along Favorite Books

It turned out that I still loved them, and so do other parents passing along their beloved books. A friend of mine recalls watching her husband reading "Little House on the Prairie" to their 7-year-old son. The boy was asleep, but her husband was still reading to him.

Transferring the love of favorite books to children doesn't always work. Mothers of sons sometimes face a challenge getting their boys to like their childhood books about, say, horses.

And some books are simply hard to bring into the modern era. A friend of mine tried three different times to introduce her sons to "Winnie the Pooh," which she adored as a girl but finds slow going today.

"I really sold it," she sighed, "but it didn't take."

My daughters turned out to be an eager audience for my childhood favorites.

"Madeline," "Wait Till the Moon Is Full," "The Story of Babar" — they happily listened to them all, snuggling up to me as I had once snuggled up to my own mother.

## Tattooed On Memory, And On Skin

Then it was on to my favorite chapter books — "Chancy and the Grand Rascal," "Knight's Castle" and, of course, "The Phantom Tollbooth." This last book is by Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer.

Night after night my husband or I read "The Phantom Tollbooth" to the girls. We took them on travels with Milo. In the book, the bored boy receives a mysterious gift of a tollbooth that leads him into adventures rich characters like Tock the watchdog, whose body is a watch face.

The girls loved all of them, these books I knew so well they seemed tattooed into my memory.

So my older daughter had a couple of them tattooed onto her skin.

The little raccoon from "Wait Till the Moon Is Full" is inked on her right foot. The watchdog Tock from "The Phantom Tollbooth" is on her left shoulder.

It is high praise. And others of her generation have given similar pride of place on their bodies to pictures from books dating to their parents' childhoods.

Actress Lena Dunham has tattoos from "The Story of Ferdinand" and "Eloise." A recent BuzzFeed post of tattoos based on children's books included such classics beloved as "The Velveteen Rabbit," "The Little Prince," "Goodnight Moon," "Corduroy," "Winnie the Pooh," "The Phantom Tollbooth" — and "Madeline."

## Magic Happens

New and wondrous children's literature is being produced all the time. Kids don't have to read their parents' childhood books.

But when they do, magic happens. Time comes to a standstill for parents. You are at the same time the parent reading the story and the child listening to your mother reading it to you. Your children are experiencing their childhoods and yours at the same time.

The bond is sweet. You and your children love the same classic children's book.

And maybe one of you can wiggle a tattooed foot to prove it.
