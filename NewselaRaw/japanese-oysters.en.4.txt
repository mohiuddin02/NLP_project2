Hiromitsu Ito is a fisherman. He is from Japan. Today, he is wearing green overalls and taking his boat into Ogatsu Bay.

After five minutes, he slowed the boat down. Two crew members pulled in a net full of sea creatures. The net had been dragging in the water. Ito grabbed a shell bigger than a man's palm, opened it and rinsed it with seawater. "Yume-gaki," he said. "Dream oyster. Try it!"

Oysters, scallops and other seafood all live in Ogatsu Bay. The water is full of underwater life. But there are not many fishermen working in the area.

## Earthquake, Tsunami Hit Ogatsu Hard

In 2011, a big earthquake hit Japan. The town of Ogatsu was hit hard. A huge wave called a tsunami washed over the bay. Entire buildings were destroyed. Many people died.

In Ogatsu, things have not been easy.

Ito, the fisherman, has been trying to help save the town.

"I feel like it's my mission," he said.

So he started a new business. He hopes the business will make a difference.

## Can New Businesses Help Town?

The business is called Kai-you. Kai-you pays fishermen for what they catch in the bay. After cleaning the fish, Kai-you sells the fish to restaurants across Japan.

It hasn't always been easy leading this company. But Ito is still proud.

Last year he opened his own restaurant. His team catches oysters and serves them at the restaurant.

The business and restaurant are doing well now. It will take time to see how they help Ogatsu in the future.
