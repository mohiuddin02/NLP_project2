WASHINGTON — Pianist Jan Lisiecki is about to turn 20. The young star is looking forward to an exciting birthday. He will be flying to Abu Dhabi to play in a concert there for the first time. Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates. It's in the Middle East, and it's hotter than Lisiecki is used to.

"We're going to get some warm weather, which is always nice when you live in Canada," Lisiecki said. He lives in Calgary with his parents. They will be traveling with him to Abu Dhabi.

## Hola, Spain. Hello, Washington

After that, Lisiecki will be going to Spain. He will wrap up his travels with a March 28 concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Lisiecki plays classical music. He will perform pieces by Bach, Mendelssohn and Paderewski at the concert. The Kennedy Center's website says the concert is sold out.

Lisiecki will also be playing all of the pieces in Chopin's "Opus 10." Lisiecki wants to give people a chance to hear all 12 of the Chopin pieces in order. He says it will give them "a special feeling." It will also help them understand how the pieces fit together.

## Hitting Just The Right Notes

It's easy to see that Lisiecki is a very popular pianist. He has a full calendar of live shows and recordings. When he played with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 2014, he performed three times in one week.

Lisiecki's schedule has been very busy since he was 15. That's when he signed a deal with a classical music company called Deutsche Grammophon. He records music for them, and they put out and sell his albums.

Lisiecki has played in big concerts all over the world. He has played with the best orchestras in New York, London and Paris.

Lisiecki says that he simply enjoys being at the piano. He says it is a different world altogether — a colorful world where anything can happen. He thinks his listeners can tell how much he loves to play.
