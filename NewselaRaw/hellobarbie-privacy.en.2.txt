Mattel recently held a demonstration to show off a new toy called Hello Barbie, an Internet-connected version of its most famous doll. The presenter greeted the doll by saying, "Welcome to New York, Barbie."

Thanks to voice-recognition technology, Hello Barbie was able to understand the presenter's remark and then give a response that made sense: "I love New York! Don't you? Tell me, what's your favorite part about the city? The food, fashion or the sights?"

Mattel believes the doll will be a big hit with children because it engages them in a new way. Hello Barbie will also learn about its child users over time.

## Cool Or Creepy?

During the demonstration, the presenter told Hello Barbie that she liked being onstage. Later in the conversation, she asked the doll what she should be when she grows up, and Hello Barbie responded: "Well, you told me you like being onstage. So maybe a dancer?"

Mattel says Hello Barbie is capable of learning about its users' preferences. It can also adjust questions to customize each child's experience. The company hopes the high-tech Barbie will boost their sinking sales when it hits store shelves this fall.

Children might think Hello Barbie is "cool," but many parents say it is "creepy." The doll contains a microphone that records children's speech and sends it over a WiFi connection to cloud-based servers, where that recording is processed. Barbie then gives an appropriate response.

## Dolls Are Money-Makers

Children's rights groups across the nation are calling for Mattel to stop production of Hello Barbie. Some feel that listening in on children this way does not respect their privacy. Others fear that children could be sent hidden advertising messages.

Georgetown University's Angela Campbell is uncomfortable with Mattel's plan. "They're not very clear about what they're really collecting the information for (or) what they might be doing with it," she explained.

Susan Linn, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, shares Campbell's concerns. She says that kids using Hello Barbie are not just talking to a doll. They are talking to a toy company that only cares about making money off of them. Linn says that creates new risks for children and families.

Mattel and ToyTalk, the company that created the technology in the doll, both say that they are committed to privacy and security. They say that Hello Barbie is in line with government standards like the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

## Toy Companies Face Tricky Challenges

ToyTalk's Oren Jacob says they have added safeguards to ensure that stored recordings will only be available to authorized users. He also stressed that the voice recordings will only be used to help ToyTalk make improvements to their technology. Jacob says the recordings will never be used "for anything to do with marketing or publicity or any of that stuff."

ToyTalk has also said that parents will be able to hear all of their children's recordings. Parents can sign up to receive emails containing links to their children's conversations with Hello Barbie.

Linn said she finds that option "troubling" and says it could pose a threat to children's privacy. "When children have conversations with dolls and stuffed animals, they're playing, and they reveal a lot about themselves," she said.

But ToyTalk says that making this information available to parents has to do with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. "We want to make sure parents are in control of their family's data at all times," Jacob said.

Clearly, the Hello Barbie dispute highlights a tricky challenge for the toy industry. In order to make money, established brands are hurrying to keep up with children's interest in technology. In order to please parents, they must ensure that new toys still protect users' privacy and security.
