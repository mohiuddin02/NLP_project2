### PRO: FDA should do its job; 16 million U.S. kids are inhaling dangerous substances

In 2014, the Oxford English Dictionary's (OED) word of the year was "vape." The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should take a hint from the OED and write its own definition of e-cigarettes — a definition that will treat them as a tobacco product.

Congress created the FDA in 1906 amid concern over the quality and purity of America's food and drug supply, which was awash in toxic dyes and preservatives, and shaped by the outrageous claims of the era's "patent medicines."

The agency's creation reflected a belief that consumers could not, on their own, always make determinations about product safety, reliability, and health.

In short, the FDA was made to regulate products just like e-cigarettes.

E-cigarettes have created a market that abounds in unproven health claims; a market in which more than 16 million children can legally buy e-cigs and administer unspecified amounts of nicotine to themselves; a market in which the accidental ingestion of liquid nicotine has caused a huge uptick in the number of cases reported to local poison control centers — including the death of a toddler in upstate New York two months ago.

And it is a market that is booming. Last year, analysts at Wells Fargo estimated the overall value of the e-cigarette market at $2.5 billion and predicted growth to $10 billion annually by 2017.

Market growth can be attributed in part to aggressive marketing, and in part to high adoption rates among high school students attracted to the variety of e-cig flavors, including cotton candy, gummy bear and root beer float.

The FDA is the only agency that can regulate — not ban — this nicotine-fueled juggernaut. The  FDA should prohibit sales and marketing to kids, make sure that health claims made by e-cig companies are true, and require companies to add ingredient lists to e-cig juice.

This "juice" — a misleadingly benign euphemism for a flavored nicotine solution — is heated through a battery-powered cylinder, which can look like a cigarette, a pen or a kazoo.

The devices vaporize a flavored nicotine solution that users then inhale and exhale. Users inhale this flavored vapor and not combusted tobacco, which means e-cigs are safer relative to cigarettes.

But, then again, cigarettes are, in the words of historian Robert Proctor, the deadliest invention in human history, killing 6 million people per year.

And herein lies the potential virtue of the e-cigarette: it could be a powerful tool for saving millions of lives if smokers switched from puffing to vaping to, ideally, nothing. As a cessation tool, e-cigarettes could have the same relationship to cigarettes as methadone does to heroin.

The problem is that the safety and health claims of e-cigarettes have not been proven. Particularly in the online vaping community, anecdotes abound testifying to the e-cig's utility in helping folks kick the habit. But in the words of Mitch Zeller, head of the FDA's Tobacco Products Division, "FDA can't make regulatory policy on the basis of anecdotal evidence."

Preliminary evidence from a major longitudinal cohort study should give regulators pause. Initial findings from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health indicate high levels of "dual use" of tobacco products, meaning that smokers frequently use both e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes.

These findings are consistent with other studies that have found that contrary to being cessation aids, e-cigarettes may actually make it harder for smokers to quit.

Nevertheless, e-cigarettes are frequently advertised as proven tools of public health. Researchers at the University of California-San Francisco found that 95 percent of e-cig websites made "explicit or implicit health-related claims," and 64 percent made claims directly-related to smoking cessation.

This is false advertising. Nicotine is addictive and it is a poison — two facts that the FDA should make explicit by requiring warning labels on e-cigarette devices and vials of e-juices. Dermal contact with even small quantities of liquid nicotine can cause dizziness, vomiting and seizures. Ingestion can be deadly.

A world in which a dangerous product is marketed and sold as a healthy one is exactly what the FDA exists to prevent.

E-cigarettes are not snake oil. But gummy bear, cotton candy and sour apple shouldn't make them go down any easier.

### CON: If bureaucratic buttinskies back off, e-cigs can help smokers quit

On Jan. 11, 1964, the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health released its very first report on tobacco smoking.

Based on scientific evidence consisting of over 7,000 articles relating to smoking and disease, the report cited tobacco smoking as a major cause of lung and laryngeal cancer and chronic bronchitis.

The report launched a "war on smoking" that soon required health warnings on cigarette packages and bans on broadcast cigarette commercials, and by recent years had led to bans on smoking in certain areas, with numerous laws and regulations in between.

Over this half-century of cigarette regulation, two facts have been impressed upon the nation: 1) smoking tobacco kills people; 2) once a person is addicted to smoking cigarettes, or, rather, to the nicotine one ingests by smoking cigarettes, it is very hard for a person to quit.

So when an invention came along — e-cigarettes — that supply nicotine in much the same way as a tobacco cigarette, but without any apparent link to cancer or lung disease, there were many cheers.

Finally there was a product that could help those who were addicted and for whom the available anti-smoking aids had not been of sufficient help.

Lives could be saved. People could replace their tobacco cigarettes with e-cigarettes; switch out smoke and carcinogens with water vapor and the horrible smell with no smell at all — or the light scent of a chosen flavor, such as mint or strawberry.

Lives could be saved.

One would expect the response of the public health community to be a near-universal "hurrah" — and in some quarters, it has been.

But for those who appear to be addicted to regulation, and not to public health, e-cigarettes provide an unwelcome challenge.

How do they go about banning access to a product that saves lives? And what do they say when people, quite reasonably, ask, "Why do you want to?"

For many of these regulators, the answer is as "what if." "What if" vaping — inhaling water vapor through an e-cigarette — turns out to be harmful? "What if" people who vape decide to start smoking, because they first vaped?

It is on the basis of these "what ifs" — however unlikely — that some support bans on the sale of e-cigarettes, or grossly high taxes on e-cigarettes, or outright bans on the use of e-cigarettes in public.

But such policies mean nicotine addicts will be less likely to use e-cigarettes, and relatively more likely to keep smoking tobacco. The obvious and predictable result is relatively more tobacco smoking and thus, more illness and death.

The director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, made the key point clear in an interview with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's New Public Health: "People are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar."

He says e-cigarette regulation should take into account the "continuum of risk: that there are different nicotine-containing and nicotine-delivering products that pose different levels of risk to the individual," and regulate accordingly.

Which means America should not treat e-cigarettes and vaping just like tobacco smoking and smoking, because smoking is far more dangerous than vaping.

In fact, because vaping can cause people to voluntarily stop smoking, a carefully crafted regulatory policy that steers Americans from smoking toward vaping as a replacement provides "an extraordinary public health opportunity."

Zeller makes a lot of sense. By contrast, regulation zealots, such as those in Michigan who in January lobbied against a state-level bill banning the sale of e-cigarettes to minors because it did not treat e-cigarettes the same as the far, far more dangerous tobacco cigarettes, are an enemy of public health.

Smoking kills. Vaping is a safer alternative, and our nation's regulatory policy will save lives if it reflects this fact.
