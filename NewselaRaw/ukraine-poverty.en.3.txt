KIEV, Ukraine — The eastern European country of Ukraine is in a crisis.

Ukraine is a country in Europe right next to Russia. Ukraine has been worried about a Russian invasion. Ukraine used to be a part of Russia until the early 1990s.

Violent protests made Ukraine's pro-Russia leader step down in February. In response, Russian forces moved in to take Crimea, a peninsula in what was the south of Ukraine.

In Ukraine's historic St. Volodymyr's Cathedral, worshipers visit two donation boxes. One is "For the church" and the other is "To support our armed forces." On a recent night, church-goers typically slid folded bills into each.

Boxes to support Ukraine's armed forces can be found seemingly everywhere. They are in shops, along Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, and in thousands of other spots around the country. In the past month, they've gathered about 116 million Ukrainian hryvni. That comes to $10 million.

## Can't Afford Bullets

For a modern military, that amounts to pennies. But Admiral Ihor Kabanenko, a Ukrainian military official, used a news conference this week to express the gratitude of a military that hasn't had enough money for years.

"The money will be used to support our forces, with equipment and ammunition, uniforms," and food, Kabanenko said. "It has been a great help."

It might seem odd that Ukraine's military has to go begging just to afford bullets. But to those who study the military here, there's no surprise.

Ukraine gave a list of needs to NATO in the standoff with Russia. NATO is the military alliance between the United States and Western European states. The list contained basic military items. Ukraine needed helmets, body armor and field radios. It also asked for camouflaged netting, tents, sleeping bags and ground cover tarps.

"The NATO response was 'Are you really so poor as this?'" said Serhiy Zhurets. He runs a research center in Kiev, and is a longtime top adviser to the Ukrainian military. "The answer was yes. It still is yes; the situation isn't getting better."

How bad is it? Only 1 in 10 Ukrainian soldiers staring across the border at Russia have body armor. The country has lost at least three helicopters trying to take a better look at the setup of pro-Russian armed groups. It can't afford to replace a single one. Zhurets said that outside of a U.S. donation of 300,000 ready-to-eat meals (MREs), nobody has offered much help.

## Small Defense Budget

Anton Mikhnenk edits a Ukrainian defense magazine. He said the numbers were easily interpreted. The Ukrainian military has come up with a budget plan in recent years to replace its old weapons and machinery. The plan calls for about 131 billion hryvnia a year, which is about $11.3 billion in U.S. dollars.

Last year, Ukraine's Parliament, similar to our Congress, reasoned that Ukraine faces no dangers from the outside. So it allocated just 15.6 billion hryvnia — $1.3 billion. In previous years, it had been as low as 9 billion hryvnia.

Compare this to other countries. In 2011 the U.S. military spent more than $700 billion. Ukraine's neighbor Poland has recent defense budgets of about $10 billion. Russia's defense budget is about $75 billion.

"We have old weapons and soldiers in need of better training," Mikhnenko said. "It's simple: We need more money. We do today, and we have for years."

Dmytro Tymchuk is a military researcher. He said the state of the Ukrainian military was so bad that it couldn't even afford to take some of the help it needed.

For instance, he said Ukraine would like drones. [Drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) are planes that can fly without human pilots. Recently, Ukraine has lost three helicopters. It even had one pilot and one crew member killed.

## One Drone, No Pilot

"Drones would mean we wouldn't have to put our people at risk," Tymchuk said. "But we don't have anyone with the training to fly the drone. Do we ask the United States to loan us drone pilots, have them be involved if a war with Russia erupts, and thus start World War III? Of course not."

Ukraine does own one drone. But it's never flown, and no one is trained to operate it.

Ukraine decided to "avoid spilling first blood." The country didn't want to "give Russia an excuse for further action" when Russian forces fanned out across Crimea in March. But beyond that the military didn't react. Some experts believe that's because the military couldn't react.

The country's tanks, trucks, jets and ships were in such bad repair that many weren't operational. When the equipment was working, the troops didn't have enough training to operate it. Some couldn't find the necessary fuel to start the engines.

The country also had no line of defense between Crimea and the rest of Ukraine. Crimea is now part of Russia. "If we'd started shooting Russians in Crimea in March, their tanks would be in Kiev today," Kabanenko said.
