Most of us think of the water cycle as something that happens above ground. Water falls from the sky. It evaporates on the ground and goes back into the atmosphere. There it condenses and forms into rain once again.

That actually isn't the full story.

## Hide And Seep

Hidden in the Earth's crust is a huge amount of "groundwater." Once, this water fell from the sky. Then it trickled into the sand, gravel and rocks beneath our feet.  

We cannot see this groundwater, but more than 2 billion people across the globe drink it every day. There is more groundwater than there is water in lakes, rivers or streams. In dry areas it is pumped out of the ground to grow crops. It also helps keep streams and rivers running when there is no rain.

Back in the 1970s a team of scientists estimated how much of the planet's water lies buried beneath the ground. That information has not been updated until now.

In a new study, scientists tried to estimate once again how much water is stored in our planet's crust. This time, they studied a much larger area. They also looked at the age of that water, or how long it had been underground. Knowing that helps scientists understand how quickly it can be replaced as humans keep pumping it out.

## 6,000,000,000,000,000,000 Gallons

"Our maps and estimates show where the groundwater is quickly being renewed and where it is old and stagnant and nonrenewable," said Tom Gleeson. He is a scientist who studies groundwater. He works at the University of Victoria in Canada.

Gleeson says there are 6 quintillion gallons of groundwater in the upper mile or so of the Earth's crust. If you could magically pump it all out of the ground and spread it across the continents, it would form a layer of water 600 feet high. That is twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty.

To come up with that number, the scientists used computers. They plugged in different measurements of how much water can be stored in various types of rocks.

The scientists also wanted to know how old the groundwater was and how it was spread out. They knew that the water could have been there for as little as a day, or as long as one billion years.

## How Old Is The Water?

In particular, they wanted to know how much of the groundwater was "modern," or young. Modern groundwater entered the ground less than 50 years ago. 

Scientists say there are different reasons why it is important to know how much modern groundwater there is. First, it is a more renewable resource than older ground water. In some places, humans are using groundwater faster than it can be replaced. Second, modern groundwater is more likely to be contaminated from factories or farms. This makes it unhealthy to drink. 

To see how much of groundwater is "modern," they looked for a chemical called tritium in the water. About 50 years ago, a large amount of this chemical started showing up in rain water. This was a result of nuclear weapons tests that were going on above ground.  

The scientists looked at many scientific studies. They figured out that tritium was found in groundwater from 55 different countries. 

## Older Than They Thought!

From this information, they made an important discovery. They determined that just a small amount of the world's groundwater is younger than 50 years old. 

Gleeson said he was surprised by this. He said finding out that there is so little modern groundwater was the biggest surprise of the study.  

Ying Fan is a scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey. She wrote about Gleeson's study. She said the findings could mean that scientists will study ancient water to learn about our planet's past.  

Gleeson knows what he wants to do next. He wants his team to find out how much young groundwater is being used. He also wants to find out where it is being used.

"We want to find out how long before we run out of this critical resource," he said.
