NEW YORK — The NBA banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life in response to racist comments the league says he made in a recorded conversation.

Commissioner Adam Silver said he will try to force the controversial owner to sell the team. Sterling has also been fined $2.5 million, and Silver made no effort to hide his outrage over the comments.

He said a league investigation found that Sterling was in fact the person on the audiotapes that were released over the weekend. Sterling has been an NBA team owner longer than anyone else.

"We stand together in condemning Mr. Sterling's views," Silver said. "They simply have no place in the NBA."

Sterling acknowledged he was the man on the tape, Silver said.

## Sterling's Comments Condemned

Sterling is immediately barred from attending any NBA games or practices. He cannot be present at any Clippers office or facility, or participate in any business or player hiring or firing decisions involving the team.

He also cannot participate in any league business.

"This league is far bigger than any one owner, any one coach and any one player," Silver said.

The fine will be donated to organizations dedicated to anti-discrimination and tolerance efforts that will be jointly selected by the NBA and the Players Association, Silver said.

Sterling's comments were released over the weekend by TMZ and Deadspin, and numerous NBA owners and players have condemned them. Even President Barack Obama weighed in on the crisis, the first of Silver's brief time as commissioner.

Before Silver took the podium, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban tweeted out a photo of the NBA Constitution, saying, "It exists for a reason."

The announcement of the penalties came just hours before a game. The Clippers were to play Golden State in Game 5 of a knotted-up Western Conference first-round playoff series.

## Long History Of Controversy

Several sponsors either terminated or suspended their business dealings with the team on Monday. Individual deals that some of those companies have with Clippers stars like Chris Paul and Blake Griffin will continue and were not affected. Still, it was a clear statement that companies, like just about everyone inside the league, were outraged.

The tapes were released just over the weekend. But the issues raised represent just another chapter in Sterling's long history of being at the center of controversy.

In the past, he's faced extensive federal charges of civil rights violations and racial discrimination in his business dealings. Some of his race-related statements would be described as shocking.

He has also been sued in the past for sexual harassment by former employees. Even the woman who goes by the name "V. Stiviano" — who is described as the female voice on the tapes at the center of this scandal — is a critic. She describes Sterling in court documents as a man "with a big toothy grin brandishing his sexual prowess in the faces of the Paparazzi and caring less what anyone else thought, the least of which, his own wife."

Stiviano is being sued by Rochelle Sterling, the owner's estranged wife. She is seeking to get back at least $1.8 million in cash and gifts that her husband allegedly provided the woman.
