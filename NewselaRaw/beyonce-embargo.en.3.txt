WASHINGTON â€” Jay-Z and Beyonce's trip to Cuba four weeks ago got many people talking. Americans are not generally allowed to go to Cuba. So the visit by the stars has perked up interest in traveling to the forbidden island.

More Americans are now seeking "people-to-people" culture tours. Insight Cuba is the first and largest Cuban tour group. It says bookings have jumped since the couple's April tour.

"It's had a huge impact. Everything from our call center to our website to our blog to our Facebook page just lit up," said Tom Popper, president of Insight Cuba. "People were Googling it and curious."

The rapper/singer celebrity couple have made popular a small but growing travel trend. There is a pent-up demand to visit Cuba, an exotic land that's changed little in years. It lies just 93 miles from the Florida coast, but few Americans have ever been there.

## Restrictions On Travel To Cuba

The U.S. and Cuba have been at odds for more than 60 years. The U.S. made a rule that no American can do business with Cuba. Americans are allowed to travel to Cuba. But the rules don't make it easy. Going without the proper permission can run the risk of a huge fine. The rules are less strict for Cuban-Americans.

Jay-Z and Beyonce's high-profile adventure was criticized by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and other Cuban-American leaders. But some in Congress want to make it easier for Americans to visit Cuba.

Roughly 400,000 Cuban-Americans went to Cuba last year. That's because of a 2009 rule change by President Barack Obama. Unlimited visits to family members are now allowed.

Another rule change in 2011 allows groups to lead cultural tours of Cuba. But they must be licensed by the U.S. Government. The idea was to put more Americans in contact with the Cuban people. The hope was that closer relations would lead to more democracy in the island nation.

An estimated 90,000 Americans made these "people-to-people" visits last year. That's up slightly over previous years. Insight Cuba expects its bookings will increase to 5,000 this year from about 3,000 in 2012.

## No Day At The Beach

But the rules are strict for these tours. That includes the three-day one taken by Beyonce and Jay-Z. They arranged their trip through Academic Arrangements Abroad in New York. Rubio and others demanded that such tours have mostly "purposeful" activities. These must include visits to such places as senior centers, schools and artist studios.

It's not supposed to be a day at the beach.

Beyonce and Jay-Z celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary on the trip. They reportedly stuck to the plan of the tour. They visited a school, a children's theater group and a jazz club. Cuban musicians met with the couple as well.

Rubio and other defenders of the ban say these trips give money to the Cuban government. That government is restricting people's freedom. That's why Rubio and others even want to limit family visits to the island.

## Lots Of Paperwork

Under the new rules, applications to obtain or renew "specific" tour licenses are much longer. They went from about six pages to as many as 600. And they can take weeks or months to process. "Every day has to be chock-full of approved activities, pretty much from 9 to 5," Popper said. "It's a rigorous day.

"Not everybody wants to travel that way," he admitted.

But, Popper added, Beyonce and Jay-Z's trip helped in one big way. It is making Americans aware that they can visit Cuba legally. They just have to visit through a culture tour.

Fifty-nine Democrats in the House of Representatives wrote Obama in April. They urged him to let anyone go to Cuba on their own without prior approval by the U.S. government. As Cuban-Americans do now, visitors could book their trip through a special airline. They'd also sign a statement proving they have a good reason to go.

White House officials have not responded. They are waiting until Cuban authorities release Alan Gross, of Maryland. Gross was jailed in December 2009. He allegedly committed "crimes against the state" for bringing satellite-communications equipment to the island.

## "We Need To Try Something New"

But supporters of more travel hope recent reforms in Cuba will lead to further loosening of U.S. travel rules. Such reforms include a new policy this year. It allows Cubans to leave the island without prior approval.

"The Cuban government remains repressive. They have serious human rights issues," said U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, after returning from Havana in April. But she said the ban hasn't improved the situation and that "we need to try something new."
