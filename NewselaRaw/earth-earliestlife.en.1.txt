WASHINGTON, D.C. — Scientists have found fossil-like hints that some kind of life existed on Earth 4.1 billion years ago — when the planet was a mere toddler. The hints would put the start of life on Earth 300 million years earlier than previously thought.

The new evidence changes what scientists believe Earth was like soon after it formed 4.5 billion years ago. It also gives them reason to theorize that life itself is more plentiful throughout the universe because it seemed to start up so quickly.

## The "Gooey" Stuff Left Behind

Researchers examined tiny grains of the mineral zircon from western Australia's Jack Hills. They chemically dated them to when Earth was barely 400 million years old. Inside one of the 160 or so grains they found what is called a "chemo-fossil," or a certain mix of carbon isotopes, according to a study published October 19 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Think of it as "the gooey remains" of life or "anything more complicated," said study co-author Mark Harrison, a UCLA geochemistry professor.

There are different types of carbon with different weights. This carbon residue, or "gooey" leftover bits, had a higher percentage of the lighter type of carbon. Scientists usually find a similar mix of carbon in leftover bits of living things, the same as if your finger decayed, Harrison said. There are rare cases where this particular carbon signature would not be from some type of life, but they are exceedingly unusual and happen only in certain situations.

Harrison has a theory that the carbon is from a colony of tiny organisms of some unknown type. Life existing 300 million years earlier than science had thought is the most logical and simplest explanation, Harrison said. Still, the evidence is not overwhelming, he said.

## Life Grasped Onto Earth Quickly

The common thinking of early volcanic Earth is that it was too molten and there was not enough liquid water for life to take hold so early. Harrison said there is no physical evidence for this theory, however. What the zircon shows is "the Earth by 4.1, 4.2 billion years ago was basically behaving like it is today."

"This is what transformative science is all about," said Stephen Mojzsis, a University of Colorado scientist who was not part of the research. "If life is responsible for these signatures," it came to Earth "fast and early."

S. Blair Hedges of Temple University, who also was not part of the study, said Harrison's findings make sense and the accelerated timeline of life fits with his work that tracks genes.

"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth," Hedges wrote in an email, "then it could be common in the universe."
