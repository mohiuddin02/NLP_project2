FERGUSON, Mo. — A little more than a day after Michael Brown was killed last August, the peacemakers arrived.

They introduced themselves to police and city officials. Late that night, they met with Brown's family, in a police truck down the street from where he was killed. Brown, an unarmed black teen, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson.

The shooting set off nearly nightly protests by members of the local black community. They felt that Brown wouldn't have been killed if he had been white.

The peacemakers worked for a little-known unit of the U.S. Department of Justice called the Community Relations Service. Also called mediators, because they mediate, or help all sides reach an agreement, they were the first U.S. government officials to arrive in Ferguson.

## Playing An Important Role

Since then, they've held dozens of meetings with police, citizens and community leaders. Not much is known about what exactly they are doing. Which is exactly how the mediators want it.

And yet they are playing what may be the most important role in Ferguson. They are persuading worried residents, overwhelmed city officials, angry protesters and frustrated police to sit down and talk.

"God bless them," said Patricia Bynes, a leader in Ferguson.

The Justice Department is investigating the killing. It is also looking into whether the police has used too much force against black people and protesters in Ferguson. They are offering to train the police.

The Community Relations Service has a completely different job. The 50-person, $12 million-a-year unit does not investigate crimes or train police.

## "The Longest-Lasting Solutions"

The goal of the unit, said Director Grande H. Lum, is to give all sides a private place to talk. The hope is that they will solve their own problems.

"Those are the longest-lasting solutions — when the people themselves resolve their own disputes," Lum said. His unit, he said, allows "people to speak."

Lum said mediators are trained to understand what is really causing a problem. They are able to figure out who is involved, and who needs to be included in the meetings.

"We are going to be there," Lum said, "as long as it is needed."

The Community Relations Service calls itself the nation's peacemaker. The unit was created as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The law outlawed unfair treatment based on race, color, sex, religion and where a person was from. Since then, Community Relations mediators have responded to problems between the races in American cities.

In 2013, an officer in Geneva, New York, shot a black man. Protesters gathered in front of the city police department.

Geneva Police Chief Jeffrey E. Trickler said that mediators helped create a community agreement. "Anything we felt we needed, they were a phone call away," Trickler said. "From my eyes, things have improved."

## Secret Key To Success

In St. Louis, the federal mediators have been in and out of the city for years.

Adolphus Pruitt is the president of the St. Louis city branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He said he can't list all the times he has called a police department with a problem. Sometimes the police respond, but more often they don't, he said.

But when the unit's mediators get involved, Pruitt said, everyone is willing to talk.

"They don't like to talk to the press, and don't like to talk about what they do," said Rue Landau, who is with city of Philadelphia. That secrecy, Landau said, is part of the reason why the Community Relations Service is so successful.

## Holding Tense Talks

Two Sundays after Michael Brown's shooting, mediator Rita Valenciano called a morning meeting of nine community leaders, and they talked for three hours. "No breakfast. No orange juice. No nothing. Just us in a room," said Patricia Washington, who works for the county.

The conversation was tense, she said. Ferguson police and city officials were there, and some in the room didn't want to talk with them.

However, before that meeting, "nobody was talking," Washington said.

Moreover, mediators are giving practical help. They have provided training for those who want to protect protesters and want information.

The situation is far from over. Washington said she's been trying for weeks to get the angriest protesters to come to the meetings, without any success.

Still, she said, there's been progress. Now the protesters are calling her and four have promised to come to the next meeting.
