The Chicago police superintendent was fired Tuesday after protests about a fatal police shooting last year.Â 

Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he asked Garry McCarthy, the Chicago police superintendent, for his resignation on Tuesday morning. A week ago, a video of the shooting was released. It showed a white Chicago police officer, Jason Van Dyke, firing bullets at Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old black teen. The officer has been charged with murder.

There has been much criticism over how McCarthy handled the matter. Emanuel said he fired McCarthy to rebuild public trust and confidence in the police force.

McCarthy "has become an issue, rather than dealing with the issue, and a distraction," Emanuel said. The mayor said he had "a lot of confidence in the work" McCarthy has done. Emanuel said he is loyal to McCarthy and praised the police superintendent for his leadership. However, the needs of the city are more important, he said.

## Long Delay Stirs Anger

Emanuel said he began talking to McCarthy on Sunday after days of protests and anger over McDonald's death. Emanuel said he spoke to McCarthy about "the undeniable fact that the public trust in the leadership of the department has been shaken and eroded."

City leaders and protesters have demanded that Emanuel fire McCarthy. They argued that new police leadership is needed to reassure the public. Last week, a dozen African-American members of the city council gathered to call for a new police superintendent.

There has been much public anger over the long delay in releasing the video, which was taken at the time of the shooting in October 2014. In the meantime, Emanuel was elected to a second term as Chicago's mayor.

McCarthy has acknowledged making mistakes, and said that the initial press release about the shooting gave out wrong information. The police statement said that the teenager had continued to walk toward officers although they told him to stop. He also ignored orders to drop a knife.

## Public Given False Information

In addition, false information was released by the spokesman of the police union, which represents the police. The spokesman said that McDonald lunged at police with the knife, although it turned out that the teen did not do so. Last week, the spokesman said he got the information from other people who were there and that he never spoke with Van Dyke.

But McCarthy said he was not in charge of investigating the murder. Government officials and another group looked into what happened.

"The things that I have authority over are training, policy and supervision," he said.

McCarthy also defended how the city has responded to the protests that have broken since the video was released. He said the officers showed "incredible restraint" during the protests and avoided violence.

## Mayor Announces Task Force

However, since the video was made public, many in Chicago have said that McCarthy should leave. On Tuesday, the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper wrote an editorial saying McCarthy "has lost the trust and support of much of Chicago."

In addition to announcing that McCarthy would step down, Emanuel also said he had created a special committee. The committee would focus on making sure that police treat people fairly and holding them responsible if they do not. The committee, called a task force, is also intended to improve the way officials respond when many people complain about a police officer. Right now, the city does not release video footage of police shootings. The task force will also determine if the city should change that policy.

Mayor Emanuel said he and the Chicago City Council will receive the task force recommendations at the end of March.
