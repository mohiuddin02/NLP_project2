RALEIGH, N.C. â€” North Carolina State University's newest library is a little strange: It consists principally of 98,000 tiny glass bottles.

The new library is a huge collection of dyes. Together with the bottles of dye are patches of cloth the dyes were tested on. There are also carefully kept records of how the dyes were made.

Chemistry students have begun the time-consuming work of putting information about all these dyes online. When they're done, crime-scene investigators will have an enormously valuable new tool. All sorts of other researchers will as well.

Visitors to the online library will be able to search thousands of three-dimensional models. These will show the molecules found in particular dyes. A molecule is the smallest part of something that still contains everything that makes that thing what it is.

## The Science Behind The Dyes

Dyes are developed through creating new compounds. Compounds, essentially, are different elements combined to make something new. When a new compound is created, a new kind of molecule is also created. A model of that molecule will make it clear to a scientist how a dye is made.

The new library will also help investigators figure out what a dye is if it's unfamiliar. Its molecules can be checked against online models.

Along with the models, there will be detailed information about the various dyes.

The university has named its collection the Max A. Weaver Dye Library. All materials were donated by the Eastman Chemical Company. Eventually, however, other chemical companies will be asked to provide dyes as well.

## All Sorts Of Research Will Be Done

The library is just part of North Carolina State's bold plans. The university aims to become a national leader in forensic science research. Such work is aimed at finding new and better tools for the fight against crime. Along with the library, the university has created a new Forensic Sciences Institute.

Crime-scene investigators are careful to gather any dyed fibers they find. They know these can provide valuable evidence. Such fibers come from various places: clothing, car seats and rugs, furniture, carpeting. Being able to recognize a particular dye is very useful: It can help investigators figure out where something that left behind fibers came from.

The new library will also be open to other kinds of researchers. It is expected to become an important tool for many different fields. Doctors, engineers and the military will all be searching it for useful new dyes.

For example, special dyes might make military clothing harder to spot at night with night vision goggles. Or new, safer dyes could be found for use with paper products.

## The Work Of A Very Inventive Man

The collection of dyes is housed at the university's College of Textiles.

There are so many dyes, Hinks said, that the university gave up on counting.

The glass bottles are lined up in the drawers of a long wall of filing cabinets. Their range of colors goes well beyond the rainbow. Some are powders, some tiny crystals or nuggets. Most have small, fading labels. On these are hand-drawn pictures of the dye molecules inside.

Students have begun putting information about each dye online. So far, they have only gone through about 1,000 of the dyes. The rest are expected to take a couple of years, even with a small army of students working on the task.

The collection represents the life's work of a scientist named Max Weaver.

Weaver worked for Eastman for 29 years and was the company's busiest inventor. He was known for being unusually careful when it came to keeping records.

Weaver learned how to invent while on the job. Most of the company's other scientists had much more schooling, but he more than kept up with them. By the time he died in 2012, he had more than 260 inventions to his name.

Weaver created the single largest part of the dye library. However, more than a dozen other scientists also contributed.

Now, once it's online, their work will be preserved forever.
