YouTube is a website and app for watching videos and listening to music. Some of its biggest stars are most popular with people younger than 30 years old. Anyone older than that might not have heard of YouTube celebrities like PewDiePie, Lily Singh and the Fine Bros.

They are just some of YouTube's stars. They became famous because of the videos and songs they posted on the site. Some YouTube stars are now more famous than Hollywood actors.

## Viewers Like To Have Choices

YouTube recently started a new service called YouTube Red. For a monthly fee of $9.99, people can watch videos that cannot be seen anywhere else. 

Right now, subscribers get videos and music created by YouTube stars, including PewDiePie. What most subscribers like is that they do not have to watch pop-up advertising. 

YouTube wants its stars to be a big part of what subscribers watch. Yet some experts think Red is not signing up enough subscribers. There are reports that YouTube is already looking to buy videos and movies from other companies.

YouTube is talking with television networks and Hollywood movie studios. YouTube would pay them so it can show their TV shows and movies. YouTube is looking to make its service more popular and add more choices, especially for Red customers.

## Back To The Drawing Board For Red?

Red is one way YouTube is trying to compete with other video services. The three other popular websites for watching movies, TV shows and videos are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. All of them charge customers money to watch their content online. 

Some experts think that YouTube is changing its vision for Red. Originally, all of the videos were to be from YouTube. Now YouTube is looking to buy content from other places. The change could suggest that YouTube is having a hard time getting enough people to sign up for Red. 

One media expert said people might think $9.99 a month is too much to pay for just a showcase of YouTube's own stars. YouTube Red might eventually include hit television shows and movies. Red could be turning into a different product than was first planned.

## YouTube Wants To Be Unique

Robert Kyncl of YouTube said the company did not plan on paying a lot of money for content like football games.

"To us, what is important is we are not doing what everyone else is doing," Kyncl said. He said YouTube does not want to be fighting to show the same TV shows as other services. Kyncl said it wants to use stars and video that already do well on YouTube.

That might be a risky plan for YouTube. Many other successful streaming companies are paying money for content. They are also making their own shows. YouTube competes with Netflix, Amazon and HBO. Shows like "Orange Is the New Black," "House of Cards" and "Game of Thrones" were made by those companies. Then they stream them to TVs, websites and apps. They have been very popular. The shows are designed for older audiences. YouTube's viewers are usually younger.

## Young Viewers Have Different Tastes

One of YouTube's biggest stars is PewDiePie, a Swedish celebrity. He is known for his video-gaming blogs, called vlogs. His vlogs are a big hit with young people. Younger viewers like to watch videos online, mostly on cellphones and tablets. 

Younger audiences watch videos and movies differently than most adults. That is one reason why Red might struggle, one expert said. Younger watchers might need to ask their parents to pay for Red. 

YouTube already has some ideas for original programs. Yet, even those ideas are to be team efforts with hit shows. One idea is to make a show with PewDiePie and the creators of "The Walking Dead." YouTube also plans a show called "Sing It!" with the Fine Bros. It would make fun of TV shows like "American Idol" and "The Voice."
