Ten-year-old Wesley Pope shot down a snow-packed hill on his sled.

"Keep going, son!" his father Russell yelled. "Have fun."

The Popes live in Overland Park, Kansas. After a winter mostly without snow, they finally got a chance to go sledding one afternoon last week.

But a lack of snow is not the only thing keeping many kids off the hills this winter. A growing number of cities have made sledding against the law.

## Limiting Could Work Better Than Banning

Dubuque, Iowa, is the latest city to do that. In January, sledding was banned, or not allowed, in almost all of Dubuque's parks. People who continue to sled anyway will be fined $750.

Other cities have not gone that far. Some are banning sledding only on the most dangerous hills. Others are requiring helmets and outlawing jumping ramps.

Sledding is risky, said Dubuque's city lawyer. "It's not unusual for people to talk about their accidents or near accidents along with the fun times they've had."

Thousands of kids across the country are involved in sledding accidents each year. Between 1997 and 2007, nearly 230,000 of them ended up in emergency rooms.

## Safety Is Important

Some cities have not found it easy to ban sledding, however.

Omaha, Nebraska, banned sledding at a popular hill as a test. After people ignored the ban, the city was forced to allow sledding again. City lawyer Tom Mumgaard said the ban was just not going to work.

Instead, the city posted warning signs. It also placed guards at the hill and put hay bales around trees and pads around posts.

Overland Park has also taken safety measures. At the hill where the Popes were sledding, hay bales were in front of streetlights and a fire hydrant.

Russell Pope said he hopes Overland Park will never ban sledding.

The safety of kids is the most important thing for parents, he said. However, there is always going to be some risk involved in fun things like sledding.

"You can't take all the joy out of being a kid," he said. If kids "don't go sledding in the winter, all you've got is your iPad and SpongeBob. I'd rather they get out there and get some exercise."

## Protesters Of All Ages

Some say the new ban in Dubuque has made sledding more dangerous there. The city has many steep streets and kids may decide to sled down them if they are kept out of parks.

"Parents ought to be getting out there yelling," law professor Craig Lawson said. The city has "made sledding more dangerous" for kids.

Indeed, children who sled on the street are five times more likely to be hurt than children who sled in a park. They are also more likely to be hurt badly.

Dubuque's sledding ban has led to many protests. For example, two adult brothers slid down a hill holding signs. The words, "Don't tread on my sled!" were written on one of the two signs.

Back in Overland Park, 11-year-old Lydia Pope said she agrees with her father. She also hopes sledding will not be banned in her city.

"I wouldn't like it," she said. "Sledding is what you do when there is snow!"
