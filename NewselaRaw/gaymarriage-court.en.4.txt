Gay marriage supporters won big at the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday.  The court said that a nationwide law that ignores legal gay marriages had to go. Several states allow gay people to marry, but they were not getting certain government rights.

The court also made it possible for California to allow gay marriage again.

But gay-marriage supporters did not get everything that they wanted. The court did not decide if the Constitution promises a right to same-sex marriage.

Twelve states allow same-sex marriages. California will start again soon.

President Barack Obama praised the court.

"We are a people who declared that we are all created equal â€“ and the love we commit to one another must be equal as well," he said.

## A Fierce Debate

Gay marriage is a topic that stirs lots of arguments. That is why so many states still oppose it. Even the court was split on the matter.

Both cases were decided by 5-4 votes. But different judges were in the majority in each case.

The Supreme Court got rid of part of a 1996 law. The law let states decide not to allow same-sex marriages. Both Republicans and Democrats voted for it.

Justice Anthony Kennedy said that the law was against the Constitution. There was no acceptable reason for the law. But it hurt everyone in same-sex marriages, he said.

Kennedy said that the decision was limited to marriages in states with same-sex marriage.

## Many People Cheer The Rulings

But Justice Antonin Scalia said that it was not realistic to think the ruling will stop there. He also said that the majority of the court was being unfair to people who opposed gay marriage.

The case was about Edith Windsor. She married Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007. They lived in New York when Spyer died in 2009. New York said that their marriage was legal.

Windsor had to pay a lot of money in taxes after Spyer died. She would not have had to pay the taxes if she was married to a man and not a woman.

Lots of people were outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Many of them cheered when the rulings came.

The court "brings us that much closer to true equality," said David Boies. He is a lawyer for people who sued to get rid of a law that made same-sex marriage illegal in California.

Voters in California had approved the law. A state judge said that it was illegal. California's governor decided not to appeal that decision.

Others tried to defend the law. But the Supreme Court said that they were not legally allowed to do so.

## Speaking Against, And For The Rulings

John Eastman represents a group against gay marriage. He told CNN that the Supreme Court was wrong in both cases.

Changing the meaning of marriage hurts everyone, he said.

Kris Perry cheered the decision from the Supreme Court steps. She and her female partner were two of the people who sued to get rid of the law.

She knew what they will now tell their four sons: "You're just as good as everybody else, no matter who you love, no matter who your parents love."

She and Sandy Stier were married in San Francisco in 2004. But the state Supreme Court quickly said they were not really married.

Stier said the battle is not over.

"It's got to go nationwide, and we can't wait for that day," she said.
