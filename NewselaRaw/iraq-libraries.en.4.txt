BAGHDAD â€” Earlier this month, gunmen entered the Central Library in Mosul, Iraq. They came to seize books they did not like. Their plan was to destroy them. The men were from the Islamic State group.

Islamic State has been fighting Iraq's military. So far, it has taken over one-third of Iraq. It has also seized about one-third of neighboring Syria.

The group wants to make Iraq follow its kind of Islam. It wants to rid Iraq of everything that does not fit with the group's religious ideas. It has destroyed many old things, including ancient buildings. Now, the fighters are going after books.

## Not Many Books Were Left

The Central Library is the largest library in the city of Mosul.

The attackers first smashed the library's locks. Then they carried out about 2,000 books and dumped them into six pickup trucks.

Children's stories and books on sports, health and science were taken away. Only Islamic books were left behind.

An Islamic State leader said the seized books attack God. "So they will be burned," he said. The books were stuffed into empty flour bags and driven off.

No one knows what happened to the Central Library items that were taken. Most people think the old books, newspapers and maps have probably been destroyed.

## Libraries Are Easy Targets

Islamic State members began attacking libraries last month. Another library they looted is the Mosul Museum Library. It contained some works that were believed to be about 7,000 years old.

Then they robbed Mosul's Central Library. Days later, Islamic State struck again.

The new target was the University of Mosul's library. There, they gathered hundreds of books into a huge pile. They burned the books in front of students.

Hakim al-Zamili is an Iraqi lawmaker. He said the Islamic State group is just like the Mongols who raided Baghdad in 1258. Back then, the Mongols dumped books into the Tigris River. It is said that the waters turned black from wet ink.

There is only one difference between the Mongols then and the Islamic State group, al-Zamili said. The Mongols destroyed books by throwing them into the river. Today, the Islamic State group is burning them. The mean way of thinking is just the same, he said.
