WEIFANG, China — Zhang Xiaodong's workshop is covered with all manner of flying contraptions: dragons, eagles, butterflies and mechanical kites, including one that features a frog seeking to devour a praying mantis.

At 65 years old, Zhang is one of China's most revered kite makers, and as he showed off some of his life's work, he ticked off the benefits of lofting wind-blown art into the sky.

"Flying a kite provides good exercise; it uses your neck and shoulder muscles. It enhances friendships among people," he said.

"Flying a kite also elevates your mood," he added. "You can write your worries on the kite, and when it soars high in the air, you can cut the string and your worries will fly away."

## Passion From The Very First Kite

Chinese kite makers have much to worry about these days. As China modernizes, a new generation is playing video games instead of attaching painted silk to bamboo frames. The kite makers that remain are rapidly aging, and nearly all of them are men.

While China takes great pride in its kites — an invention that led to the science of aerodynamics — the future of this traditional craft is far from certain. That is true even in Weifang, a city southeast of Beijing that proclaims itself China's kite capital.

Han Fuling has been making traditional kites in Weifang for nearly all of his 82 years. He can recall the special feeling when, at age 7, he built his first kite and saw it waft into the air.

Yet these days, Han is doubtful that any of his four children will carry on his handiwork.

"Not only does my son not make kites, he gives me a hard time for continuing to make them. He says I am old and I should rest now," Han said. "But kites are my passion. How can I not make kites?"

## Preserving Cultural Heritage

The slow downfall of kite making is part of a larger cultural saga in China: historic architecture, crafts and music are being overwhelmed by China's growth and its inability to effectively preserve traditions of the past.

Since 2006, China's Culture Ministry has devoted $3.5 billion yuan, about $574 million, to programs seeking to preserve the nation's "intangible cultural heritage." But late last month, the ministry announced it was disqualifying 300 of those programs, either because they were ineffective or could not account for expended funds, according to a story in the China Daily newspaper.

China's kite masters have weathered hard times before. During a time called the Cultural Revolution, China's Communist leader Mao Zedong was trying to use strict rules to show his authority over the country. During this time, traditional kites were labeled one of the "four olds," and artists were threatened with internment at re-education camps if they did not change with the times.

Han Fuling is one who obeyed Chairman Mao's strict rules, making kites that pictured workers instead of ancient mythic figures. Even so, he has bitter memories of what he calls "the 10 years of upheaval."

"Some students destroyed some of my kites during that time. My wife was very upset," he recalled. "I told her, 'It is OK. As long as I have my hands I can make more.'"

## A Rescued Book Long Forgotten

In Beijing during that time, a kite artist named Fei Baoling went through similar trials. Now 86, Fei recalls stripping the painted silk off his kites so that "all that was left was the bones." But at the end of the Cultural Revolution, traditional folk art came back into favor, and Fei worked to ensure that kites were included in the Second National Arts and Crafts Exhibition, held in Beijing in 1972.

China is home to many schools of kite making, with concentrations of artists in Weifang, Tianjin, Nantong and other cities. In Beijing kite circles, Fei is widely known as the elder statesman, a expert at intricately painted swallow kites, inspired by an 18th-century novelist and kite master, Cao Xueqin.

In 1981, Fei became so absorbed in kites that he quit his banking job to devote himself to the craft. A friend had given him a tattered and incomplete kite book penned by Cao Xueqin that had nearly disappeared from circulation after the Cultural Revolution and with his friend's help, Fei threw himself into reconstructing the book. Its publication enhanced his reputation among serious kite makers and collectors, both in China and overseas.

## A Plastic Triangle Is Not The Same

For the last several years, Fei's eyesight has been failing, but that has not stopped him from taking on new apprentices. One of them is Sun He, a 36-year-old auto mechanic, who began studying with Fei in 2003 with a goal, he said, of producing swallow kites with the same precision and designs as his master.

Sun's living room has the faint scent of bamboo and paint, while its walls are filled with symbols of old China: kites, photographs, paintings and huzi — twisted gourds that have deep symbolism in Chinese mythology. Sun said his fascination with the past started with his grandfather, who taught him the old accents and ways of Beijing, including Beijing opera.

When Sun encounters a young person interested in Chinese culture, he "seizes on those moments," he said, but they do not occur often.

"That is the problem we face. People don't have the sentimental attachment to traditional kites," he said. "They rarely fly them. They buy the triangles (plastic commercial kites) and fly them at the bridges."

## Few Devotees Left

In 2006, a Chinese-language student named Peter Boekelheide traveled around China, conducting a survey of kite making for the Drachen Foundation, a Seattle-based group of kite devotees. He came to the conclusion, like Sun He, that traditional kite makers in China are dwindling.

"Kite making is turning into something that people do as a hobby, if they do it at all," Boekelheide said in a telephone interview from Portland, Oregon, where he works as a software developer. "I don't think I talked to a single artisan who was optimistic about the future."
