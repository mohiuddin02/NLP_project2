LOS ANGELES — Myths die hard — especially origin myths. Messing with long-held beliefs about a painting that helped kick off a revered American art movement isn't something to be undertaken lightly. That movement is Abstract Expressionism and the painting central to its birth was Jackson Pollock's mammoth 1943 "Mural."

"Mural" was something entirely new for American art. Nearly 8 feet high and 20 feet wide, it was covered edge-to-edge with rhythmic lines and bold shapes which didn't represent anything specific, though the artist likened them to a frenzied stampede of mustang horses. The painting contributed much to the beginning of Abstract Expressionism, also known as the New York School, after World War II.

Abstract Expressionism was the first American art style to have a major international influence. For a time, it put New York at the center of the art world, instead of Paris. Primarily a painting style, it avoided representing people, landscapes or objects, and instead tried to express emotion and energy through strong and active brushwork. It also emphasized spontaneous creation — creating in the moment, without planning — and the process of painting itself.

Pollock's pivotal painting went on public view at the J. Paul Getty Museum on Tuesday — minus a chunk of its myth. That myth has been undone by science.

## "I Had A Vision"

One key element in the New York School creation myth is now officially dead. Despite claims made and repeated for decades, Pollock did not paint the giant canvas in one great, glorious burst of nonstop creativity.

Instead, the painting, which was considered a turning point for the artist and the history of modern American art, evolved over many days and perhaps even several weeks.

The usual story is that Pollock fretted over the huge blank canvas for months, unsure of what to do. It sat untouched in his studio, almost as a daily taunt. Then, in a sudden and dramatic binge of brilliant, all-night action, the masterpiece issued forth.

Except, apparently that's not what really happened.

Collector and art dealer Peggy Guggenheim commissioned the work in the summer of 1943 for the entry hall of her Manhattan townhouse. She was planning a November Pollock show for her gallery, and the painting would be a statement of her faith in a barely known talent.

The canvas is four times bigger than any Pollock had previously attempted. Notoriously insecure, he no doubt struggled with the immensity of the task.

Just after nightfall on the day before the work was due, Pollock is said to have begun to paint. By 9 a.m. the next morning, 15 tumultuous hours later, "Mural" was done.

"I had a vision," he later explained.

## Myth Undone By Science

"As soon as the paint was dry to the touch, Jackson broke down the stretcher, rolled the canvas, and transported both to Peggy's apartment building," Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith wrote in "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga," their Pulitzer Prize–winning 1990 biography. It was a version of a story widely reported by Guggenheim, Pollock's girlfriend Lee Krasner, critic Clement Greenberg and others.

But now, thanks to the Getty Museum's careful analysis of the layers of paint, we know for certain that the story isn't quite right.

Pollock did lay out an initial overall composition, painting wet-on-wet in diluted, high-quality oils of teal, lemon yellow, red and umber. Perhaps that was done in a single lengthy session.

However, much of the paint was applied later. Separate layers each required drying time, some for many days.

More than 25 paints have been identified. That includes white patches of ordinary house paint — a surprise discovery.

Now that the heroic myth of the fearless, exhausting, one-shot painting binge has been undone, it's worth asking: What purpose did that unlikely myth serve in the first place?

Building an image of manly vigor surely had something to do with it. Consider that the tale's primary source was Krasner, Pollock's girlfriend.

In 1943 Pollock, then 31 years old, was an artist living in Greenwich Village in the midst of World War II, when most young American men were off fighting or at least wearing a uniform. That made him seem cowardly to some. What's more, Krasner knew of widespread rumors that Pollock was a homosexual. The heroic myth of one brilliant, all-night painting campaign propped up an image of forceful masculinity and helped fight off the doubts and rumors.

## An Actual Artist

And Greenberg, the ambitious young art critic, had his own agenda too: He was looking for a painter who could be the torch-bearer for a distinctly American form of modern art. He needed a native art as profound as that produced in Europe, but one stylistically free of influences from the art of a continent going up in smoke.

Think, if you will, of Pollock as the blustering Gen. Patton or MacArthur of America's painting troops, leading the unstoppable charge to victory. "I took one look at ('Mural')," Greenberg later claimed, "and I knew Jackson was the greatest painter this country had produced." He would be the heroic standard-bearer for American art's Greatest Generation.

Which begs a question: Does the destruction of a central element of the New York School's creation myth lessen "Mural's" artistic importance — or Pollock's?

Just the opposite is true.

The rigorously constructed painting shows an artist who knew exactly what he was aiming for. Over days (or weeks), he honed his own steadily maturing vision. And he was on an exploratory track that, a few years hence, would produce the magnificent drip-paintings on which his enduring reputation rests.

As a bonus, the myth-busting smashes today's popular fantasy of the artist as volcanic genius, with masterpieces flowing like lava out of gushing fingertips. Pollock was, instead, an actual artist. He labored on "Mural," and he labored hard.
