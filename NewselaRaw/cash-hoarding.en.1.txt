NEW YORK — Five years into the global financial crisis, families around the world remain too spooked to take any chances with their money.

Although they speak different languages, live in wealthy countries and poor ones, face good job markets and bad, when it comes to money they are acting as one. Families are holding tight to their cash, driven more by a fear of losing what they have than a desire to increase it.

An Associated Press study of households in the 10 biggest economies shows that families continue to spend cautiously. They have pulled hundreds of billions of dollars out of the stock market and cut their borrowing for the first time in decades. They are putting their money into savings and investments that offer low interest payments, often too small to keep up with the cost of living increase each year.

"It doesn't take very much to destroy confidence, but it takes an awful lot to build it back," says Ian Bright, a senior economist at ING, a global bank based in Amsterdam. "The attitude toward risk is permanently reset."

## "It's Safety, Safety, Safety"

Such caution on such a global scale has not occurred since the end of World War II in 1945.

The implications are huge: Avoiding debt and spending less can be good for one family's finances, but when hundreds of millions are too careful with their money, it can starve the global economy.

Weak economic growth means that salaries in the United States, already not keeping up with the cost of living, will continue to rise slowly. Unemployment in parts of Europe is at a record high. In several countries, more than 35 percent of young people are out of work.

Some of the slump isn't surprising: High unemployment in many countries means fewer people with paychecks to spend. Some people, who lost jobs, now have new ones that pay less or are part time. But even people with stable jobs are careful.

Five years ago, Lehman Brothers, one of the largest banks in the world, declared bankruptcy, triggering the global crisis. Now, said Arne Holzhausen, a senior economist at Allianz, based in Munich. "It's safety, safety, safety."

The AP analyzed data showing what people did with their money five years before the Great Recession, as the crisis is called, began in December 2007 and five years afterward. The AP focused on the world's 10 biggest economies — the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Russia, Italy and India.

## Retreat, Avoid, Hoard

Some key findings include:

— RETREAT FROM STOCKS: A desire for safety drove people to sell stocks even as prices rocketed up, and put their money into bonds. A bond, generally considered a safe investment, is a small loan that helps a government or company pay for a long-term project.

— AVOIDING DEBT: Household debt, including home mortgages and money owed for credit card purchases, rose at an enormous rate in the five years before the financial crisis.  In the U.S., the U.K. and France, it soared more than 50 percent per adult, according to Credit Suisse. When the financial crisis hit, people slammed the brakes on borrowing, although lenders cut interest rates to record lows.

"Given what they've lived through, households are (reluctant) to borrow again," says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank in Chicago. "They're not going to stretch. They want a cushion."

— HOARDING CASH: Looking for safety for their money, households in the six biggest developed economies kept a lot more of their money in cash. In the five years after the crisis, they added $3.3 trillion, or 15 percent, to the amount money they kept in cash.

The growth of cash is remarkable since millions more people were unemployed, wages grew slowly and people diverted billions of dollars to pay off their debts. They also poured money into bank accounts, although they would earn little interest on their deposits.

— SPENDING SLUMP: Cutting debt and saving more may be good in the long term, but to do that, people have had to control their spending. Adjusting for inflation, they spent just 1.6 percent more a year during the five years after the crisis, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting and consulting firm. That was about half the growth rate before the crisis.

— DEVELOPING WORLD NOT HELPING ENOUGH: When the financial crisis hit, the major developed countries looked to the developing world to take over in powering global growth. The four big developing countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — recovered quickly from the crisis. But that didn't last, and this year, their economies are stumbling.

## Severely "Scarred" By The Crisis

Consumers around the world will eventually begin spending their money, but few economists expect them to snap back to their old ways.

One reason is that the way people spent in the years before the financial crisis was abnormal. The boom years, experts now understand, were caused by families going into debt to buy what they wanted.

More importantly, economists say that people are psychologically "scarred" by the crisis. Scarring is the fear of losing money, during a period of loss of jobs, incomes and wealth.

The desire for safety remains even after the economy improves. Americans, who suffered through the Great Depression in the 1930s, remained careful about money for decades even as the U.S. economy boomed after World War II.

Some economists think the psychological blow of the most recent financial crisis was so severe that normal spending levels won't come back for at least another five years.
