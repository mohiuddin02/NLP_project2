MEXICO CITY â€” Look at the magazines featuring Mexico's rich people and there is one thing you will rarely find: dark-skinned Mexicans.

No matter that most Mexicans consider themselves moreno. That is the Spanish word for dark.

Mexico has strong laws against discrimination, or treating somebody unfairly based on skin color or national background. Some businesses don't follow them. Some publicity firms that make commercials and advertisements for companies are an example. So are some media companies like television stations and magazines.

The problem came up this month. Mexico's largest airline was looking for people to cast in a commercial. The ad asked that "no one dark" show up. Many people were outraged.

## Clear Case Of Discrimination

Tamara de Anda is a magazine editor. She says she's never seen anything so clear. The words were in capital letters: "NO ONE DARK."

She wrote on the Internet about the incident. Aeromexico Airlines and the Catatonia publicity firm apologized in response. Catatonia blamed a modeling agency for publishing the ad.

De Anda wrote about her feelings on her popular blog. She said the incident was part of a bigger problem. A large part of the population is being pushed aside. "I've been swallowing Mexican advertising for 30 years of my life, 11,000 days," she wrote. It's as if "dark-skinned people don't exist."

It might seem like a severe judgment. After all, Mexican tourism campaigns promote the nation's multicultural history. They highlight the history of the Aztec and Mayan empires. Mexico's population is 118 million. That includes nearly 16 million who trace their roots to Mexico's original people. Also, an estimated 450,000 Afro-Mexicans live mostly along the coasts.

## Discrimination Barred By Law...

Lawmakers changed Mexico's constitution in 2001. It now bars all forms of discrimination. Twenty-two of Mexico's 32 states now have anti-discrimination laws. The nation has signed more than two dozen international treaties banning unfair treatment.

Laws are not always followed, says Mario Arriagada Cuadriello. He studies politics at the London School of Economics. He also edits a leading cultural and political magazine called Nexos.

Arriagada published an article this month about widespread discrimination in Mexico. He received a flurry of responses.

"People wrote to say that if you are light-skinned, you get better treatment in restaurants," he said. One person told him about wealthy residents in the capital area. They ask their dark-skinned servants not to walk in the common gardens "because it makes the areas ugly."

## ...But Continues In Practice

Jose Vasconcelos was one of Mexico's great thinkers in the early 20th century. He  held up the mestizo as a superior race because of their spirituality. Mestizo is a person of mixed Indian and European blood.

The Mexican Revolution began in 1910. At that time, the government viewed the mestizo as an ideal. Images of dark-skinned Mexicans appeared on lottery tickets and other items. But that changed by the 1950s. The Institutional Revolutionary Party was in power. It adopted images of light-skinned Mexicans wearing Indian clothing. Some say this was done to please the upper class. Yet people of all color filled the Congress, and still do.

At the end of the century, Mexico condemned discrimination along with the rest of the world. Still, society magazines that pack newsstands celebrate in their pages the light-skinned wealthy classes.

Mexicans of Indian heritage rarely appear on television or magazines. They are treated as a separate group in many places.

## Dark Used As An Insult

De Anda believes the Indian is only accepted if he is wearing his traditional costume. If he wears jeans and a jacket, she says, people think he will rob them. Calling someone dark is a common playground insult.

The government conducted a survey on discrimination in 2010. Few Mexicans considered themselves light-skinned or blonde. More than half said they were "dark." The rest described themselves as "cinnamon," "chocolate," "brown," "yellow," "a little tanned" or "black."

Arriagada flipped through Clase Magazine. Its pages were filled with photos of wealthy families celebrating social events. He compared it with magazines ones might find in a northern European country with lots of fair-skinned, blond-haired people.

"Look," he said of the people in the magazine, "it's like Norway."
