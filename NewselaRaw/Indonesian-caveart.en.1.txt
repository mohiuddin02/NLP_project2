Archaeologists working in Indonesia say prehistoric paintings of hands and animals were created nearly 40,000 years ago.

These images, discovered in limestone caves on the island of Sulawesi just east of Borneo, were painted at about the time as the earliest known art found in the caves of northern Spain and southern France. The age of the Indonesian paintings suggests that Europe can no longer claim to be the sole birthplace of art.

The findings were published this week in the journal Science.

"We now have 40,000-year-old rock art in Spain and Sulawesi," said Adam Brumm. He is a research fellow at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, and one of the lead authors of the study. "We anticipate future rock art dating will join these two widely separated dots with similarly aged, if not earlier art."

## Finally Getting A Date

The ancient Indonesian art was first reported by Dutch archaeologists in the 1950s, but had never been dated until now. For decades researchers thought that the cave art was made during the pre-Neolithic period, about 10,000 years ago.

"I can say that it was a great — and very nice — surprise to read their findings," said Wil Roebroeks, an archaeologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study. "'Wow!' was my initial reaction to the paper."

The researchers said they had no preconceived ideas of how old the rock art was when they started on this project about three years ago. They just wanted to know the date for sure.

To do that, the team relied on a relatively new technique called U-series dating. The technique was also used to establish the minimum dates of rock art in Western Europe.

## Finding Cave Popcorn

First they scoured the caves for images that had small, white, cauliflower-like growths covering them. Eventually, they found 14 suitable works, including 12 outlines of hands and two figure drawings.

The white growths they were looking for are known as cave popcorn. They are made of minerals that are deposited by thin streams of calcium-carbonate-saturated water that run down the walls of a cave. These deposits have small traces of the radioactive element uranium in them, which decays over time to produce another radioactive element called thorium.

"The ratio between the two elements acts as a kind of geological clock to date the formation of the calcium carbonate deposits," explained Maxime Aubert. An expert on dating cave paintings, he is with the University of Wollongong in Australia's New South Wales state.

Using a rotary tool with a diamond blade, Aubert cut into the cave popcorn and extracted small samples that included some of the color from the cave art. The sample's layer would be at least as old as the first layer of mineral deposit that grew on top.

Using this method, the researchers determined that one of the hand outlines they sampled was made at least 39,900 years ago. A painting of an animal known as a pig deer was at least 35,400 years old.

## Art In Very Early Human Culture

In Europe, the oldest known cave painting was of a red disk found in a cave in El Castillo, Spain, which is at least 40,800 years old. The earliest figurative painting, a rhinoceros, was found in the Chauvet Cave in France and dates back 38,827 years.

The age of the Indonesian paintings suggests two potential explanations for how humans came to be making art at roughly the same time in different parts of the world.

It is possible that the urge to make art arose simultaneously but independently among the people in the two different regions. Perhaps more intriguing, however, is the possibility that art was already part of an even earlier human culture, which these two groups brought with them as they migrated to new lands.

Wednesday's study clearly disproves one theory: that tens of thousands of years ago prehistoric humans were making art in Europe and nowhere else.

"The old 'Europe, the birthplace of art' story was a naive one, anyway," Roebroeks said. "We have seen a lot of surprises in paleoanthropology over the last 10 years, but this one is among my favorites."
