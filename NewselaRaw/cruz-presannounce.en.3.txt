LYNCHBURG, Va. â€” Senator Ted Cruz announced his plans to run for president on Monday. The senator made his announcement at Liberty University, an evangelical Christian school. Cruz is a Republican from Texas.

"Today, I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States," Cruz said in a speech to students.

"Ted! Ted!" students yelled.

"It is the time for truth. It is the time for liberty," Cruz said in his speech.

## College Announcement Aimed At Young People

The candidate talked about his parents and their humble backgrounds. His wife's parents were missionaries, who went to other countries to spread Christianity. His father was from Cuba. He pointed out that he had to borrow $100,000 to attend college and that he only paid it off a few years ago.

The speech spoke to many different groups within the Republican Party: Christians with traditional values, military supporters and members of the tea party, who want a smaller government. By making his announcement at a college, Cruz showed that he hopes to get young people involved in his campaign.

One of Cruz's advisers said he wants to unite conservatives behind his campaign. At the same time he will continue to show he is willing to stand up to political parties and will not budge in his beliefs. Cruz has pushed to end the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care law. He has also called for the Common Core education standards to be thrown out. Cruz has been doubtful about climate change, or global warming.

## "We Will Get Back To The Principles"

Cruz had already announced his candidacy with a tweet sent Monday morning. Then he made the other announcement at Liberty. Cruz aimed to make it clear that he wants young people and evangelical Christians to vote for him.

"I'm running for president, and I hope to earn your support!" he wrote early Monday. His tweet made him the first major candidate to formally declare himself running in 2016. Many other Republicans want to be seen as the strongest candidate. However, none of them have officially announced.

Later Monday, Cruz said it again, in person, at Liberty University.

"We stand together for liberty!" Cruz said. "This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington ... (It will come) when the American people stand together, and say, 'We will get back to the principles that made this country great.'"

The student audience screamed like a concert crowd. Cruz got loud applause when he mentioned Patrick Henry, an American Revolution patriot from Virginia. They went wild when he talked about his own student loans. They cheered at the idea of shutting down the Internal Revenue Service, the government agency that collects taxes.

They booed loudly when Cruz mentioned President Barack Obama's health care law.

## Competition Is Yet To Come

Cruz moved around the stage, urging students to imagine scenarios in which conservative ideals won on a variety of political issues. Imagine no "Obamacare." Imagine no Common Core. "Imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law-abiding Americans."

Cruz's announcement will likely put the 2016 presidential race into high gear. By announcing early, Cruz can grab the spotlight from his rivals. Other Republicans with whom he will likely compete to be the Republican candidate are Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and surgeon Ben Carson. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania may also run. Both are popular among evangelical Christians.

Cruz, who is 44 years old, is a lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Princeton. He is best known for trying to block Obama's health care law from going into effect in 2013. His efforts included a 21-hour-long speech on the Senate floor. Such a speech is called a filibuster.

## Lots Of Money To Raise

Cruz's campaign is looking to raise $40 million to $50 million for the primary race. In the primary he will face off against other Republicans. The winner of the primary race will be in the national election. That candidate will then face candidates from other political parties, like the Democrats. The Cruz campaign is also buying online advertising early. It hopes to get more people familiar with Cruz's name in time for the primary election.

Cruz has talked about raising money from average people. He will also seek donations from rich people who supported him in Congress.

Cruz lives in Houston with his wife and two young daughters. His wife, Heidi, works for a large bank. She will take time off so she can campaign with her husband.
