A singer posted a meme about the Powerball lottery on Facebook. A meme is a picture that spreads through the Internet. His meme claimed to solve the problem of poverty in America. The meme was created when the lottery jackpot was $1.3 billion on Monday.

On Wednesday, the winning numbers were picked for Powerball, which had risen to $1.6 billion.

## "Poverty Solved!" Oops, Check Your Math

"Powerball 1.3 billion ÷ U.S. pop 300 million," the meme reads. "Everyone receives 4.33 mil. Poverty solved!!"

Unfortunately, the meme is incorrect. As people have pointed out across the Internet, the answer is wrong. $1.3 billion divided by 300 million is just $4.33\. It is not enough to get anyone out of poverty.

So, why have 1.3 million people reshared the meme on Facebook. Why have hundreds of thousands liked it? 

## "Enough Money To Feed The People"

The person who originally made up the meme is Philipe Andolini. The singer Livesosa re-posted it, which helped the meme get popular. His "math was incorrect but I get it," Livesosa wrote . "There's enough money to feed the people."

In other words, the meme is not really about the Powerball jackpot. How is it that one person can suddenly win $1.3 billion when other people have next to nothing? Is there a way to share the Powerball money more fairly?

There is some good news though. Powerball does sort of give money back to people in America. It does not, however, send out checks to everyone in America. It also does not split the money fairly. For example, poor people are the biggest players of the lottery. Many policy experts argue that the lottery is basically a tax on the poor.

## How Lottery Funds Are Split Up

Powerball is run by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). It is in charge of several huge lottery games in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Powerball tickets cost $2\. So, when you buy a ticket, about $1 goes to prize money. Less than a dime pays to run the lottery. About 12 or 14 cents goes to the store that sold the ticket.

What happens to the rest? The money goes straight back to the state where you bought your ticket. Your state government decides what to do with it. Different states spend the money in very different ways.

In Arizona, about $625 million has gone to local transportation since 1982\. Indiana spent $637 million helping teachers who retire. In Washington state, the lottery has helped build CenturyLink Field. The Seattle Mariners baseball team play there.

## Could States Spend The Funds Better?

Andolini's meme seems to make a point. It says that more Powerball money should go to programs that help the poor. Kentucky, for instance, has spent $30 million on reading programs. In Pennsylvania, nearly $25 billion has been spent on programs for old people.

Andolini says Powerball money should help people. His math was clearly wrong, Yet, changing how the states spend the money make lots of sense.

His point does not sound as catchy as a Facebook meme.
