<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131024_Roma.jpg" /> BERLIN — Earlier this month, a 15-year-old girl on a school field trip was grabbed by French police. Her crime? The French government had just turned down her family's asylum request and claimed it couldn't wait until the end of the school day to get her out of the country.

Police escorted her off a bus filled with her classmates and whisked her away. Along with her family, she was quickly expelled to Kosovo, a country where she had never lived.

Many believe the quick deportation was really a reaction to the girl's ethnicity, Romani, or in the more common and derogatory word, Gypsy. Experts say that harsh treatment is all too common for members of one of the last ethnic groups in Europe for whom racist insults and abuse remain widely acceptable. The Roma are thought to have originated in northern India, but have lived in Europe since the 1300s.

A report by the charity group Oxfam recently described the Roma "as the most vulnerable and deprived ethnic group within Europe." It went on to say Romani are "disproportionately affected by poverty and discriminated against in employment, education, health care, administrative and other services." They face, it said, "considerable obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms."

## A Turning Point Lost

The story of Leonarda Dibrani's expulsion from France took a surprising turn when hundreds of French supporters, including many students, flooded the streets of Paris to demand that she be allowed to return. Many thought the incident might mark a turning point and that the deeply negative views Europeans hold of their centuries-old neighbors might at last begin to change.

But such hope disappeared within days when reporters said that a Greek Roma family might have abducted a blond girl who police found when they searched a Roma settlement north of Athens.

A Greek official added to the uproar when he noted: "This case has reinforced our suspicions of Roma involvement in child trafficking. … Blond, blue-eyed children are clearly being targeted."

The belief that Gypsies kidnap children stretches back centuries and is reflected in folklore and literature. This ancient prejudice has stubbornly survived.

"The Italians gorged themselves on this story of a little blond girl who they believe was snatched by evil Gypsies," said Rome-based human rights attorney Claudia Tavani. "This is despite the fact that, to this day, it has never once been proven that the Roma have had anything to do with kidnapping."

Tavani said the recent European economic crisis has increased discrimination, especially in struggling nations such as Greece and Italy. When times are tough, people want someone to blame, and the Roma are an easy target.

In Italy, the Roma are trotted out every time a government or a politician is in trouble, Tavani said. "Politicians see easy votes in vowing to rid Italy of these thieves, robbers and kidnappers," she said.

## Widespread Hatred Of Roma

The demonization of the Roma is hardly limited to Italy — indeed, it can be found all over Europe.

In Slovakia, city governments build walls around Gypsy camps and in the Czech Republic, neo-Nazis lead protests against their presence.

In Romania, a right-wing political party recently offered cash to any Roma woman who would get sterilized. In France, Gilles Bourdouleix, a 53-year-old member of Parliament, this summer said of the Roma: "Maybe Hitler didn't kill enough of them."

Hitler's Germany killed between 250,000 and 500,000 Roma (and Sinti, another branch of the people known as Gypsies). The Holocaust hardly ended hatred toward the population in Germany.

Standing next to the year-old memorial to those killed by the Nazis, Romani Rose, chairman of the Central Council of Sinti and Roma in Germany, said the hatred remains widespread.

"Even after the Holocaust, our minority still encounters racism and discrimination," he said, noting that they are Europe's last hired, first fired. He said poor villagers come to Berlin and find only overcrowded apartments where crooked landlords overcharge them for a mattress on the floor. "Such overpopulation leads to conflicts with the neighbors, and old prejudices come up again," he said.

## But "They Are Just People"

Cordula Simon, the commissioner for Europe and International Affairs in the Berlin district of Neukoelln, is consumed with helping Roma immigrants.

Europeans, she said, view the Roma people either as "happy dancers and fiddlers or as dangerous criminals. The reality is that they are just people, and in dealing with Roma immigrants there are many positive stories to tell. Too few are willing to listen, however."

Among the most positive aspects of recent Roma immigration, she said, is education. Young Roma children, coming from desperately poor rural areas of Romania and Bulgaria, arrive in Berlin schools woefully behind, many having never been to school before.

"But their energy level, their hunger to learn, is enormous," she said. It's moving to see to what extent Roma parents will sacrifice to give their children a better life, she added.

Mitek is a 37-year-old Roma immigrant from Bulgaria. He lost a job and found no prospects at home, so he left his wife and children behind and came to Berlin hoping for a better life. What he has found to this point isn't much.

When Mitek isn't sweeping clean the patch of abandoned factory in central Berlin that he's called home for six months, he's either out scavenging plastic bottles for refunds or sitting and thinking about the good life to come. And he still believes, even though his "home" is a scrap-wood hut inside an abandoned factory.

"My hope is still to find a job, and to bring my wife and children to live with me," he said while seated outside his hut. "It hasn't happened yet. But I have hope. My life will be better soon."
