SAN JOSE, Calif. — The ocean off the California coast has been warmer than usual this year. The warmer water has brought strange fish and sea animals to the area.

For example, Hawaiian ono fish are swimming off the California coast. And a green sea turtle was floating near San Francisco. It is usually at home off the Galapagos Islands.

Scientists think changes in the wind are the cause. The wind has been different this fall. Because of that, the Pacific Ocean off the West Coast has warmed. It has drawn in warm-water fish and sea animals.

Temperatures off the California coast are 5 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual for fall. It is the warmest fall in 30 years.

## Not As Windy This Year

"It's not bathtub temperature," said Nate Mantua, a scientist, "but it is swimmable on a sunny day."

In mid-October it was 69 degrees near Santa Barbara. Usually, the water temperature there would be in the high 50s or low 60s.

The last time the ocean off California was this warm was in 1983 and 1997. They were strong El Niño years. In an El Niño, ocean water at the equator near South America warms up much more than usual. It can bring big changes in the weather for North and South America.

But El Niño isn't driving this year's warm water, experts say.

It comes down to the wind. Normally, certain winds blow from the north to the south. The winds keep warm water close by the equator. Since this summer, the wind has been blowing less. It has allowed warm water in the south to move north.

## "No Cooling Of The Water"

In most years, the winds also help push around the ocean's water. This churns up cold water below the surface. It isn't happening as much this year.

"If the wind doesn't blow, there's no cooling of the water," Mantua said. "It's like the refrigerator fails."

Scientists don't know why the winds dropped off. They also don't know when they will start up again.

"It's a mystery," Mantua said.

For ocean scientists, this fall has been a wonder.

Scientists have spotted more than 100 dolphins off the Farallon Islands in the past two months. They are normally hundreds of miles away, off Southern California. They also saw a Guadalupe fur seal, which is normally found in Mexico.

## Tripletail And Sunfish

In September, a fisherman off San Francisco caught an endangered green sea turtle. It usually lives off Mexico and the Galapagos Islands. The fisherman returned it safely to the sea.

In addition, fishermen found tripletail, a type of fish commonly found between Costa Rica and Peru. There were even giant sunfish off Alaska.

"They are following the water temperature," said H.J. Walker, a scientist. The warm-water fish normally turn around when they hit cold water, he said. This year, they are swimming farther north because the water is still warm.

When waters cool down, scientists expect the types of fish they usually see to come back. This is what happened after the 1983 and 1997 El Niños.

"It is an oddball year. But I'm not surprised," said Joe Welsh, who works for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. "These things come and go. There's a lot to learn out there."
