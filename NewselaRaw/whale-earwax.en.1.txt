A giant plug of earwax pulled from a dead blue whale is providing scientists with a detailed biography of the wild animal's life, from birth to death, in 6-month chapters.

The scientists' new technique is described in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. It arms researchers with a tool to understand a whale's hormonal and chemical biography — and a window into how pollutants, some long discontinued, still remain in the environment today.

Whales are often called marine sentinels because they can reveal a lot about the waters they swim through, said Sascha Usenko. He is an analytic environmental chemist at Baylor University.

"These types of marine mammals that are long-lived have a great ability to accumulate contaminants, and so they're often perceived as being sentinels of their ecosystem," said Usenko, who helped write the study.

## Reading, Not Just Counting, Wax Layers

Researchers often study tissue and even the stuff that whales exhale through their blowholes for chemical clues. But for the most part, blubber, or fat tissue, reveals just the whales' total accumulation, said Gina Ylitalo, a Seattle-based research chemist who was not involved in the study. It doesn't really give scientists a play-by-play account of the animal's chemical exposure or hormonal production over time.

But Usenko realized that earwax is rich in lipids, just as fat is. So the same lipid-loving hormones and chemicals found in a whale's insulating blubber would also end up in its ear canal.

Wax is deposited in the ear over time. So it forms a plug whose layers can be counted like tree rings to determine its age.

But Usenko wondered if scientists could do more than just count the waxy layers. What if they could read each one, too?

"If I could section out each one of those layers and perform an analysis of each, then I could understand not only what they were exposed to today, but go back in time," said Usenko. He had studied ice and sediment core layers to understand an area's environment over time.

## Theory Put To A Smelly Test

To test this theory, the team took a very fine-toothed band saw to a 10-inch earplug pulled out of a nearly 70-foot-long male blue whale. The animal died after a 2007 collision with a ship off the Santa Barbara coast.

"It's naturally pretty heavy and strong and resilient," Usenko said of the wax. The earwax is mostly made up of keratin (the stuff in hair and nails) and lipids. "It doesn't necessarily smell great. When we were pulling it out, some of the crew actually just left."

The plug's 24 layers are laid down in light and dark stripes, Usenko said. The lighter bands are more rich in lipids and thought to result from periods of abundant food. The darker parts may be a sign of leaner times.

They found that the whale's testosterone levels spiked 400-fold when it was around 10 years old. Researchers used the information to refine estimates of when a male reaches sexual maturity.

Levels of the stress hormone cortisol spiked 800 percent shortly after the whale's testosterone shot up. The stress hormone's rise could be due to competition for mates.

The average concentrations of cortisol also doubled over the animal's lifetime, which could be due many factors. Food availability, changes in social status, contaminant exposure or environmental noise could change the stress level, the authors wrote.

## A Track Record Of Pollutants In Ocean

Meanwhile, the chemical contaminants found — from flame retardants, pesticides and other pollutants — also opened a window onto humans' long-term effects on the ocean.

The researchers found several persistent organic pollutants in the whales' bodies, particularly DDT, the insecticide largely banned in the U.S. in 1972 in part for its suspected cancer-causing properties. But this whale had been born after the chemical's use was discontinued.

In fact, almost all of the organic pollutants in its wax came from four old pesticides and a PCB, a type of chemical used in coolants and insulating fluids.

Many of the pollutants in the whale's ear plug, particularly the discontinued chemicals, were probably passed through its mother's milk, Usenko said. Persistent pollutants spiked in the baby whale's first 6 months. Twenty percent of the total persistent pollutants in the whale's 12-year lifespan where accumulated during that period.

The researchers saw peaks in mercury too. One occurred when the whale was about 5 to 6 years of age and another happened when it was about 10 years old. Because the whale seemed to travel up and down the California coast, perhaps it was swimming through regions with increased mercury contamination, the authors wrote.

## "Asking Questions And Getting Answers"

"I thought it was a novel idea, to be looking at contaminants at those different time points," Ylitalo said. "It's a neat little way to get that information."

One of the great challenges of studying large whales is collecting samples from them in the field, said Randall Davis of Texas A&amp;M University. This new method would allow scientists to pull a lot of information from earwax samples that are already sitting in museum collections.

Usenko said he planned to study more blue whales' earwax, and perhaps examine the earwax of other species of whales, too.

"It gives us a lot more opportunities and a new way of asking questions and getting answers," Usenko said. "That's really exciting."
