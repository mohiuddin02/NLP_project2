Mondelez International just introduced its latest twist on the Oreo, the best-selling cookie in the world. Oreo Thins are slightly wider and just a little over half as thick as the original wafers. The sleek new cookies are also 7 calories lighter, though they are not meant to be a diet version of the classic.

Instead, Oreo Thins are described as a more "sophisticated" cookie. They are designed to be eaten straight from the package as a sandwich rather than twisted apart as the original ones often are.

These slimmed-down Oreos are faced with a pretty hefty challenge: extending the unmatched rise of what is, without question, the most widely eaten cookie in history.

## The Cookie Stratosphere

Oreos' unrivaled success puts them in their own cookie stratosphere. In fact, nearly $1 out of every $5 spent on cookies in the United States is spent on an Oreo. The creme-filled wafers' nearest competitor is the Keebler brand, which is clearly in a distant second place. Last year, Americans spent about twice as much on Oreos as they did on Keebler's 11 varieties added together, including Chips Deluxe and Fudge Shoppe.

The best-selling cookie's runaway lead is only growing. Since 2005, Oreo sales have increased more than 60 percent, which is easily the largest jump for any of the top cookie brands sold in the United States. To put that in perspective, consider that cookie sales overall rose just 10 percent during that time period. More than 70 percent of that growth was due to increased demand for Oreos.

Of course, Americans are not the only ones who love Oreos. The twistable, dunkable sandwich cookies dominate the global cookie market, too. Oreos account for roughly 5 percent of worldwide cookie sales. That might not sound like much, but Oreo's slice of the pie is more than three times the size of any other cookie brand's global sales.

## Sort Of Their Own Food Group

There are many reasons Oreos have become such a powerful product. Perhaps most importantly, people really like them. The cookies are a crowd favorite on their own, but they are also used to take other foods to new levels. Oreos that do not get gobbled up on their own or dipped into milk might be deep-fried in dough, mixed with ice cream, blended into milkshakes, pounded into pie crust or crumbled up and used as a topping.

Oreos are also thought of as reliable. After so many years of exposure to both the brand, which was introduced by Nabisco in 1912, and the cookie's unique design, people are drawn to Oreos because of the familiarity they offer. In 1986, The New York Times marked the cookie's 75th birthday with an article that said that "(Oreo) cookies are designed as consciously as buildings, and sometimes better."

## Don't Mess With Tradition

But Oreos have managed to grow by breaking with tradition, too. Over the years, the brand has sparked consumers' interest by introducing new variations on the original formula. Some of them, like Golden Oreos, which are made with vanilla wafers, have become quite popular and remain available long term. Wild flavors like Watermelon Oreos are more likely to be sold on a seasonal basis. Even when experimental versions do not sell very well, they can still boost the brand by reminding Oreo lovers that it has been too long since the last time they bought a pack of the originals.

Oreo Thins, the newest addition to the lineup, are launching in the United States after a successful run in China, where they were introduced last year. Mondelez International plans to eventually roll them out worldwide.
