TAIYUAN, China â€” Air China Flight 1236 was supposed to take off at 8:10 p.m. for Beijing from Xian, hometown of China's famous terra cotta warriors.

It felt like the warriors could have marched faster. What was supposed to be a 100-minute flight last month ended up delayed, diverted and finally canceled. In the end, it took passengers 18 hours to get to Beijing.

China's skies are in a state of almost permanent gridlock. During the month of July, only 17.8 percent of flights departing from Beijing's airport were on time. In August, on-time departures improved, but only to 28.8 percent. Out of the 35 top international airports, Beijing is ranked the worst for punctuality, with Shanghai close behind.

The maddening delays have become a drag on the economy and the trigger for near-riots. In a nation that prides itself on social order, state media reported 26 brawls at Chinese airports between May and August. One Hong Kong airline has started teaching its flight attendants kung fu.

## Congestion In The Air

Flights here are delayed for pretty much the same reason highways are backed up: Explosive economic growth has produced traffic faster than the infrastructure has improved to handle it.

Since 2003, the number of airline passengers in China has nearly quadrupled, to 319 million last year.

Meanwhile, airspace is limited by the People's Liberation Army, which controls 80 percent of the skies above China. In the U.S., roughly 17 percent is federally controlled.

Air traffic controllers in China also err on the side of caution, the result of strict regulations imposed after a spate of accidents in the early 1990s. Flights are spaced about 7 to 10 miles apart, which means 20 to 40 planes can land on a runway every hour. In the U.S., by contrast, 60 per hour routinely land.

In preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics, China spent more than $3.5 billion building its showcase Terminal 3 at Beijing Capital International Airport. The glass-atrium vanity project, the world's second-largest airport terminal, made Beijing look rich. But it did nothing to lessen the congestion in the air.

"It is like building a bigger parking lot. It didn't expand the airspace, so things only got worse," said Xu Hongjun, a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China.

## Irate Passengers Storm A Runway

Xu said it would require a decision at the highest level of the Chinese Communist Party to prioritize civil aviation over military use. Probably only President Xi Jinping, who is also head of the military, could bring about such a change.

"Airspace is a sensitive topic. You have to figure out how to divide the airspace and balance national security with economic growth, and that has to be done at the highest level of government," Xu said.

With its vast distances, mountains and gorges, China is better suited for travel by air than rail. Under a five-year plan released in 2011, China said it would invest $230 billion to construct 55 airports. A new airport, expected to be the world's largest, is planned for Beijing's Daxing neighborhood.

For the time being, more passengers has meant more delays and frustration. A new genre of cellphone video on YouTube shows airport brawls in which stools are thrown and irate passengers smash telephones and computers.

One stormy night in July, there were three separate incidents at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Passengers beat up airport staff members, some of whom suffered injuries that required hospitalization. The following weekend, 30 passengers stormed a runway in Nanchang, in Jiangxi province, after a seven-hour delay.

"The airlines are always coming up with different excuses. You never find the right person to ask, and the passengers just get angrier," said Tao Yuanyong, a Beijing travel agent.

## A Nightmare Of A Flight

The stock answer when passengers ask why a flight is delayed is "air traffic control." This vague and evasive phrase implies there's no clearance for an airplane to take off or land.

The crisis hit a breaking point this summer, the worst time of year for delays because of the rainy season. Stung by a flurry of bad publicity, civil aviation authorities on July 18 enacted a policy known as "unlimited takeoff." This lets planes from the busiest airports take off regardless of whether a landing strip is available. Aviation authorities have also threatened airlines with penalties and loss of routes if they experience excessive delays.

The result is that airlines tend to hustle passengers into planes that then pull away from the gate, making it look like the flight is on time. The passengers end up strapped in their seats on the tarmac, waiting for a runway. Or, even worse, they end up in flight, circling an airport. In addition to fraying nerves, this wastes fuel and pollutes the environment.

The Air China flight from Xian last month, already delayed nearly two hours in boarding and taxiing on the tarmac, landed in Taiyuan rather than Beijing. A thunderstorm was the cause, passengers were told.

After an hour on the runway in the coal-mining capital, the flight to Beijing was canceled. Passengers were put up for the night in shared rooms in a guest house run by the local water authority.

Many, no longer trusting Air China, took a train for the remaining 300-mile journey and arrived in Beijing at 3 p.m. Those who gambled, waiting for a plane, did only slightly better: They made it to Beijing at 1:30 p.m., roughly 18 hours after checking in for what was supposed to be a flight of less than two hours.
