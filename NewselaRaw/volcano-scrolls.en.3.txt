Mount Vesuvius is a volcano in southern Italy. It erupted in A.D. 79, with terrible results. Lava and gas poured out for two days, wiping out nearby Roman cities and towns.

But not every building and object was completely destroyed.

One of the most important things that still exists does not look like much. It is a collection of hundreds of charred, rolled-up bundles.

The bundles are scrolls – that is, long sheets of papyrus paper. Scrolls were the books of the Romans' time.

## Mysterious Words All Rolled Up

The scrolls were very badly burned by the blast of the volcano. They were turned almost black and now crumble very easily. In fact, it is nearly impossible to unroll them without destroying them. For that reason, many have never been unrolled, and what is written inside them remains a mystery.

All that may change thanks to a new discovery.

For the first time, scientists were able to read words inside the scrolls, without unrolling them. They used a special kind of X-ray to see inside the charred papers.

The handwritten scrolls come from a small library in the town of Herculaneum. It was one of the towns destroyed by the volcano.

## Unrolling The Ancient Past

Scholars have made various attempts to unroll the scrolls in the past. Some of them turned out very badly.

For example, in the 1980s two of the scrolls were opened. However, the scrolls first had to be broken into tiny pieces. Too many ended up being destroyed.

Scientists also tried to X-ray the scrolls before. They thought that X-rays might allow them to read the scrolls without unrolling them. However, regular X-rays did not work.

The problem was that the volcano blast had carbonized the papyrus — that is, it had turned it into carbon, a black, charcoal-like material. The black ink the ancient writers used was made from carbon. Therefore, both papyrus and ink appeared to be the same when X-rayed. It was practically impossible to tell them apart.

A team led by scientist Vito Mocella made the new discovery. Mocella and the others realized they could use a different approach to solve the carbon problem.

## Special X-rays Needed

Instead of ordinary X-rays, they used something called X-ray phase-contrast tomography. It allowed them to see changes in the X-ray light that happens when the light passes through different materials. It makes a 3-D image, which allows the scientists to see the bumps of ink made by the letters. The letters were raised just enough to make out.

Mocella and the others were able to read a few words and letters from two scrolls. One of the scrolls was still rolled up when they X-rayed it.

Reading the words inside the scrolls was still very difficult, however. The papyrus was very damaged by the blast of volcanic heat, making some of the letters nearly impossible to read.

## Handwriting On The Scroll

Still, the scientists were able to learn a lot from what they could make out. They were able to connect one of the scrolls to a scroll that had been opened earlier.

The handwriting in one of the newly examined scrolls is very unusual. It looks the same as what was found in a scroll of the writings by the poet Philodemus. Mocella and the others believe both scrolls were written in 75 to 50 B.C.

The newly examined scroll was probably written by the same person who wrote the other one, the scientists say. It most likely contains another work by Philodemus.

X-ray phase-contrast tomography should prove to be very useful, the scientists say. It will help scholars study unopened scrolls without risk of destroying them.
