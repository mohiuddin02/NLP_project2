ORLANDO, Fla. — Visitors entering a Disney theme park feel a special sense of magic. One reason that the Walt Disney Company has been able to keep this up for so long is because of the secrecy surrounding the characters.

Employees who dress as characters in the theme parks are forbidden from revealing publicly which princesses or animated characters they play. The company wants to keep that information secret.

Now that rule is being challenged by a group representing Walt Disney World performers.

## What Happens In Character, Stays In Character

The group is called Teamsters and it is a labor union. Unions are organizations that fight for the rights of employees at some companies. Donna-Lynne Dalton, a member of the Teamsters, said the company has rules in writing about what performers can and cannot say about their work characters. They cannot mention online or in any kind of media — including social media like Facebook, newspapers, magazines or TV — what characters they play.

Disney says it owns that information. Over the past few weeks, she said, workers have had to acknowledge online that they understand the rules.

The Teamsters believe these rules are not reasonable. The union says that the company is making an unfair request in requiring employees to keep quiet. Dalton says the rules interfere in the lives of performers.

"They don't work for the CIA," she said, suggesting that working as a Disney character is not a top-secret spy job.

The union is beginning to take legal action. Dalton said the group filed an official complaint with Disney last week. On Friday, she said, the union will file an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), a government agency. The NLRB will then review the problem.

## Sticking With The Character Fantasy

There are more than 1,200 workers at Disney who dress as characters. The performers greet guests throughout the park. There are "fur characters" such as Winnie the Pooh, in outfits that cover the person completely, and "face characters," such as Snow White or Cinderella.

The characters have different roles in the parks. They can do anything from appearing in meet-and-greets to being in parades. Disney wants to make sure that it looks like the characters stepped right out of the movies. They want guests to feel that the characters are real. Staff performers must follow rules about what to wear, how to act and how to dress. They must take great care in getting dressed, too. Workers are forbidden from allowing guests to see them wearing only half of a costume, for example. The characters also cannot tell children at the park that they are really actors.

"From Disney's point of view, fantasy's real," said Lee Cockerell, who once helped run Disney World. "You don't want to start disappointing kids and having this out there."

Not revealing identities is "kind of one of these professional things that people do," said Cockerell, who retired in 2006. "I really don't know if it was in writing or not, or just talked about by your trainer."

## Online Postings Could Pose Problems

Dalton said workers know they need to preserve the Disney magic. However, she feels the current rules take things too far. She does not think it is reasonable to forbid employees from posting anything online about their identities at work.

"Clearly, it is saying they cannot do something on their off time," she said. The rules can be fuzzy around what is work time and personal time and what Disney can control.

There is also a question about what family members post online. Dalton said it was unclear if workers could be punished if their family members post pictures or information about the characters.

She also questioned whether Disney entertainers would get in trouble if they used the information on their resumes to get other entertaining jobs.
