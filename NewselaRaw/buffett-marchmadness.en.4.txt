One of the world's richest men created a new contest. Its prize is $1 billion.

It sounds crazy, but Warren Buffett knows his money is safe. The winner must pick all the winning teams in the NCAA March Madness men's basketball tournament. Sixty-eight college basketball teams from across the country will come together. They will play 63 games. The chances of knowing who will win each game is 1 in 9 quintillion. It's just about impossible.

In January, Tim Chartier heard about the contest. Chartier is a mathematician. He knew the contest would keep him busy.

He was right. Chartier has become a math rock star. Now he is on TV and in newspapers telling people how to win.

## Almost Impossible

Five years ago, Chartier came up with a way to pick winners. It is based on middle school math. March Madness began Thursday. It ends with the Final Four games in early April.

Chartier's own son, Noah, has become interested in the Buffett contest. Noah is 11 years old. He wants his dad to help with his own picks.

"Daddy, it's a billion dollars," Noah said. They decided Noah can choose the teams. If they win, Noah will get $25 million of the prize money every year.

Noah decided he could live with that.

But Noah will have to become a millionaire another way. The chance of of choosing all the winning team is one in 9 quintillion. That's a nine followed by 18 zeroes. It's almost impossible.

"It would be like you and I sitting at a table," said Jeffrey Bergen. He was the first mathematician to figure the chances a person will pick all the winning teams. He has become a math rock star like Chartier. He's going to flip a coin, he said. And you are going to correctly guess "the coin flip 63 times in a row." How easy is that?

## Not Even Close

John Diver is in charge of ESPN's Tournament Challenge. The Tournament Challenge is the sports station's March Madness contest.

More people have entered ESPN's contest than any other. No one has ever picked all the winners of all the games, Divers said. Not even close.

"I don't want to say it's impossible," Divers said. "But it's impossible."

The ESPN Tournament Challenge offers a $10,000 gift card to its winner. But Diver wants to give a bigger prize. He knows no one will win.

"Let's offer a $1 trillion prize," he said. "Let's one up Buffett."
