OAKLAND, Calif. â€” The huge robot looks scary. It has a missile launcher for one arm and a cannon for the other. It is not as tough as it looks. It is just showing off. The robot moves very slowly. That is because it runs on a small lawnmower engine.

The robot's builders want to turn robot fights into shows. They have signed it up to fight a robot from Japan. First, they have to get it ready.

Gui Cavalcanti and Matt Oehrlein built the robot, called Mk II. They have a company called MegaBots. They challenged the builders of a Japanese robot to a fight and it was accepted. Both sides have to pick a time and place.

Some gamers have been waiting for this their whole lives, Cavalcanti said. People like battles and people like technology. "This is a perfect blend," he said.

## My Robot Can Crush Your Robot

The Japanese robot is named Kuratas. It is faster and stronger than Mk II. Kuratas has a machine gun, and Mk II only fires paintballs. Mk II needs a driver to keep it moving. Right now it has more in common with a truck than a robot.

Kuratas can fight with its hands. Mk II is built to shoot its weapons from a distance. "It can't really take a punch or swing a punch," Oehrlein said.

The inventors posted a video online, looking for money. They asked for help to make their robot better. They raised half of the money they needed in only two days.

The inventors worked on Mk II for almost four months. Now it has armor so it can take a punch. It also moves better. Mk II will need more power to run some of its new features.

## Bring On The Robot Battles

MegaBots started in Boston. The company moved to San Francisco to have a better place to build robots. It was hard to build big robots in Boston, Oehrlein said. There were not enough spaces to build properly. San Francisco has more buildings with room to do that, he said.

The robot builders have big dreams for a new battle sport. It would be a kind of robot Olympics. There will be special arenas. Each country will battle with its own robot army.

There is no reason to worry, Oehrlein and Cavalcanti say. It will always be just sport.

The robot is big and slow and it can easily fall over, Cavalcanti says. It is not useful for a real army. A robot fight, though, is different. Look out, Kuratas.
