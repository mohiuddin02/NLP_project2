Vietnam is a country of 90 million. And yet, there is not one single McDonald's there.

Young people in Vietnam are impatient for the Golden Arches to come to the communist country. They wonder why there is not one there already. After all, the Vietnam War ended almost 40 years ago.

Their wait is almost over. The country's first McDonald's will open next year in Ho Chi Minh City.

McDonald's partner in Vietnam has a uniquely American experience. Henry Nguyen is an investor who studied medicine and business at Northwestern University. He worked at the Golden Arches as a teenager.

Nguyen was born in Vietnam and left with his family as a toddler in the final days of the war, which ended in 1975. He returned to the country more than 12 years ago. He is a well-known businessman. His father-in-law is the country's prime minister.
## "Vietnam's Golden Generation"

Nguyen recalls the french fries and hot fudge sundae he enjoyed on his first trip to McDonald's as a 4-year-old. He was making fries and working the front counter 10 years later. "It's a love affair with the brand that started as a young boy," Nguyen said.

Vietnam will be the 119th country for McDonald's. People in the country have been making more money as the economy grows. There are also a lot of young people who live in cities. Nguyen, 39, and McDonald's think those two trends mean they can be successful.

"This current young generation is Vietnam's golden generation," Nguyen said. "They will be the ones leading the market and economic development." They will also change what people eat and buy, he said.

McDonald's has had problems bringing its food to other parts of Asia, Nguyen said. In some places, like Japan, people are not used to touching their food. But Vietnam was once a French colony. People there are used to bread and using their hands to eat.

People also know about McDonald's, even if there isn't one in the country. "More than two-thirds of the people here in Vietnam have heard of McDonald's brand, and the vast majority think of it in very positive light," he said.
## From China To Vietnam

Nguyen's bet is a sign of a big change underway in Vietnam. The country has made it easier for big companies to come into Vietnam since 2007.

"It's a market we've wanted to get into, and one of the things was finding the right partner," said Mike Flores. He is a McDonald's executive who develops restaurants around the world.

Flores said McDonald's has watched Vietnam's highly educated young population. Money to set up factories is flowing into the country from China. McDonald's has already done well in the Chinese market.

"As China has been building its middle class, manufacturing is moving more into Southeast Asia, and Vietnam is picking up the overflow," he said.

Starbucks opened its first location in Ho Chi Minh City this year. The city was called Saigon when it was the capital of South Vietnam, which fell to North Vietnam in 1975.

"I've had so many friends, colleagues and others ask, 'Why isn't there a McDonald's here?' " Nguyen said. "'Do they think there's something wrong with Vietnam?' "
## 20th-Largest Food Market

Elizabeth Friend studies the food business for a company called Euromonitor. She said the Vietnamese spend $33 billion a year on restaurant food. It is the 20th-largest market in the world.

But big restaurant companies are a small part of that market. Those companies are called chains. Although Pizza Hut, KFC and Subway also have locations in Vietnam, chain restaurants only got a $216 million slice of the $33 billion pie last year.

"Maybe people haven't caught on to chains," she said. "But you can also see there is a huge untapped potential to move in and claim that market share."

Nguyen [started a company](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) called Good Day Hospitality. It will run his McDonald's restaurant in Vietnam. The businessman has taken on an even more public life since marrying the prime minister's daughter.

He said he was surprised by news reports that seemed to link his McDonald's deal to his family. He had been talking with McDonald's about coming to Vietnam for more than 10 years. He was selected through a tough search process. The burger giant interviewed more than 50 people or companies to run the first restaurant, Nguyen said.

Aside from the Big Mac, Nguyen will also be bringing the first drive-thru to Vietnam. He said he knows he will face challenges. Those include questions about whether the food is healthy. Other challenges include keeping the food safe, finding the right places to put restaurants, and hiring the right people to work in them.

"I think about all of these challenges, and to me, it's exciting," he said.
