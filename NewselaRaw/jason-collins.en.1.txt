Jason Collins, a professional basketball player, came out as a gay man this week in an essay he wrote for Sports Illustrated.

News spread quickly as the magnitude of the announcement set in: Collins will forever be known as the first active player in one of the four major U.S. professional sports to come out of the closet. Every news station in the country picked up the story, quoting his magazine essay, which began, "I'm a 34-year-old NBA center. I'm black. And I'm gay. I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation."

Collins has played for six different NBA teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Atlanta Hawks.

In the nearly 3,000-word essay, Collins explained that he first knew he was gay when he was just 12 years old and his twin brother was developing an interest in the opposite sex.

"I couldn't identify with his attraction to girls," he wrote. He also explained that he never felt as whole as a person as when he came out to his aunt, a judge in San Francisco. Her reaction was warm and loving and from then on, he knew he would always have support.

## Bombings Triggered Decision

The tragic bombings during the Boston Marathon on April 15 partially inspired Collins to make his announcement. The incident "reinforced the notion that I shouldn't wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect. Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?" Collins wrote.

The recent Supreme Court fight for gay rights also weighed heavily on Collins' mind. The strain of hiding his sexuality was almost too much for him to bear in March when the high court heard arguments on rights for homosexual individuals.

Collins decided to come out because of a noticeable shift in public opinion. More and more, Americans seem to be increasingly tolerant of gay rights, he said in his essay. Rhode Island became the 10th U.S. state to legalize gay marriage on Thursday. Now all six New England states allow same-sex couples to wed. Delaware became the 11th state to do so on Tuesday.

"We still have so much farther to go," he wrote. "Everyone is terrified of the unknown, but most of us don't want to return to a time when minorities were openly discriminated against."

## Positive Public Reaction

Since the release of his Sports Illustrated essay, Collins has received an outpouring of positive support. Just hours after the story broke, he received a call from President Barack Obama commending him on his courage.

"He seems like a terrific young man, and I told him I couldn't be prouder," the President told CNN. "One of the extraordinary measures of progress that we've seen in this country has been the recognition that the LGBT community deserves full equality – not just partial equality, not just tolerance, but a recognition that they're fully a part of the American family."

Collins wrote that he wasn't sure what the reaction of his fellow basket players would be. But if the news this week has been any indication, he has nothing to worry about. NBA stars Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash of the Los Angeles Lakers went to Twitter to show their support.

Bryant tweeted, "Proud of @jasoncollins34. Don't suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others." Nash wrote: "The time has come. Maximum respect."

## Breaking stereotypes

Collins has proved to be an aggressive and physical player on the court over his 12 seasons as a professional basketball player. In the 2004-2005 season alone, he led the NBA with 322 fouls. As he explains in his essay, this aggressive behavior goes against stereotypes of gay men.

"I'm not afraid to take on any opponent. I go against the gay stereotype, which is why I think a lot of players will be shocked: *That* guy is gay? But I've always been an aggressive player, even in high school," he writes.

## First, But Not The Last

Among editorials following Collins' declaration, one penned by Michael Rosenberg of Sports Illustrated stands out. He writes that while Collins may be the first professional athlete to come out, he will not be the last.

"Heck, someday we may even argue about whether he was first," wrote Rosenberg. "Jason Collins is a trailblazer. But in the next few years, that trail will get awfully crowded."

He shares Collins' view that most Americans are coming around to the idea of gay rights and that widespread tolerance is just around the corner.

Rosenberg also addresses some critics on behalf of Collins, including an NFL player who tweeted a negative remark following Collins' announcement. Rosenberg noted that not only did the tweeting football player receive a mountain of angry backlash, but also that he deleted his tweet and publicly apologize for his comments.

"He [Collins] didn't have to respond … people responded for him," Rosenberg said.

## Achieving Happiness

On Tuesday morning, Collins sat down with George Stephanopoulos of Good Morning America to discuss the announcement. Smiling, he told Stephanopoulos, "I think, I know, in my personal life, I'm ready, and I think the country is ready for supporting an openly gay basketball player."

He added, "I know that I, right now, am the happiest that I've ever been in my life."
