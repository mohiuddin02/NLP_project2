WASHINGTON — On Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced what many people had been waiting for: her second campaign to become the president of the United States. "Everyday Americans need a champion. I want to be that champion," she said.

Clinton made her announcement in a video. She said she now plans to head to the states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In those states, she will be looking to connect with voters directly at coffee shops, day care centers and people's homes.

"So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote. Because it's your time. And I hope you'll join me on this journey," Clinton said at the end of the video, which features a series of men, women and children describing their hopes and dreams.

Her approach was chosen for a reason. Its goal is to show that Clinton is not just assuming she will be the Democratic pick for the 2016 elections. Only after about a month of touring will Clinton give a speech detailing her reasons for running.

Clinton is a former secretary of state, senator and first lady. She enters the race in a strong position to succeed her rival from the 2008 campaign, President Barack Obama.

## "When Families Are Strong, America Is Strong"

Her message will focus on helping the middle class and working families. The campaign is portraying her as a determined fighter who can get results and work with Congress, and business and world leaders.

Finding good jobs that pay well has been hard, but Americans have fought back against tough economic times, she said.

However, she said "the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top."

Clinton said it doesn't have to be that way: "So you can do more than just get by. You can get ahead and stay ahead. Because when families are strong, America is strong."

Clinton's approach is similar to Obama's during the 2012 elections. He framed his re-election as a choice between Democrats trying to help the middle class and Republicans who sought to protect the wealthy.

Clinton will likely face pressure from some Democrats. They fear that despite her promise to help the middle class, Clinton is too close to wealthy people on Wall Street who donate money to politicians. These Democrats have urged her to push for tax increases on the wealthy and tougher rules for Wall Street and big banks.

Clinton should be "firmly on the side of average working people who are working harder than ever and still not getting ahead," said economist Robert Reich.

## Republicans Quick To The Attack

Republicans did not wait for Clinton's announcement to begin their campaign against her. The party's chairman, Reince Priebus, laid out some of the ways Republicans will attempt to defeat Clinton. They will criticize her record as secretary of state, and will try to link her closely with Obama, who is very unpopular with Republicans. Clinton's election, Priebus said, would be like giving Obama a "third term."

Republicans have jumped on Clinton's use of a personal email account while she was secretary of state, saying it allowed her to hide some of her mistakes. They have also heavily criticized her response to the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed a U.S. ambassador.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, in his own online video, said Sunday that the "Obama-Clinton foreign policy" has "emboldened our enemies."

Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, also pointed to the Clinton family's foundation. The foundation — which raises money to for good causes — has drawn criticism from Republicans for taking money from foreign governments.

Paul said it was wrong for the foundation to accept money from Saudi Arabia. The kingdom restricts women's movements, and bans them from driving. Clinton has long pushed for women's rights around the world.

Clinton claims to be a strong supporter of women's rights, so she should have turned down Saudi money, Paul said. "Instead, she's accepting tens of millions of dollars."

## Challenges: Money And Other Democrats

Clinton is the first Democrat to get into the race. However, there are some less-known Democrats considering challenging her. They include former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee.

Whoever wins the Democratic nomination will have to overcome history to win against a Republican in the general election. Only once in the last half-century has the same party held the White House for three terms in a row: during the administrations of Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

The 2016 campaign is likely to be the most expensive in history. Total spending on both sides is expected to well exceed the $1 billion spent four years ago. This weekend, Clinton campaign fundraisers stepped up their outreach to Democratic donors, who are mostly behind her bid for president. In a flurry of phone calls they urged supporters to donate as soon as possible.
