ZENGCHONG, China â€” In the Chinese village of Zengchong, there is a large tower with a giant drum. The drum tower was built more than 300 years ago. The drum is used to call villagers together or to warn them if an enemy is coming.

The tower was built without nails. It is 82 feet tall and has 11 six-sided levels that are stacked like the layers of a wedding cake. It is decorated with painted roosters, chickens, peacocks and ducks. They are painted in bright blues, greens and yellows. There are also trees and bamboo. A smaller two-story tower with eight sides sits on top of the building.

## Simple Life In The Village

The tower was built in 1672. Life in Zengchong seems to have changed very little since then.

There are no fast-food restaurants, no mini-marts or traffic lights. Men still drive donkey carts through streets paved with big stones. Women carry bundles of firewood on their backs.

Old women sell handmade brooms as pigs oink nearby. Roosters roam around and cluck.

The tower is the center of life in the village. It stands strong and straight. People come to the tower to celebrate or to settle arguments.

The center of the tower's floor has a large fire pit.

## Villagers Keep The Fire Going

Shi Qinghui is 53 years old. He sat next to the fire pit on a recent morning. Shi carefully shaved a piece of bamboo into long green pieces. He planned to weave them into a trap to catch river shrimp.

A few other men were nearby. One got up every so often to throw another 5-foot log onto the flames.

The fire is lit each morning, except when the weather is very hot. It is kept burning until 10 or 11 each night, Shi said. There are 300 families in the village. Each is responsible for keeping the fire going at least one day a year.

Like almost everyone in Zengchong, Shi has lived his entire life here. He is a member of a group of people called the Dong. He was a child when he learned what the tower's drumbeats meant. Three beats meant it was time to gather and sing. Six meant an enemy was coming, he said.

## Protecting The Drum

One time the tower was in danger. From 1966 to 1976, China went through what was called the Cultural Revolution. Its leaders tried to get rid of old ideas and customs.

They tried to get the villagers to burn the drum, Shi said. The villagers did not listen.

The tower has lasted 343 years. It is China's oldest drum tower. Now China's leaders want to use the tower to get tourists to visit the village.

A construction crew is working to connect the village to the main road. The main road links it to a town 29 miles away. A new brown sign along the roadway spells out "Zengchong" in English letters. The English letters will help guide foreigners to the village.

## Slow And Steady Progress

There are already signs that Zenchong is becoming more modern. Some huts have satellite dishes on their roofs. Children drive battery-powered toy cars through the narrow streets.

But there is not much tourist business. There are no souvenir shops in Zengchong, and no people selling postcards or T-shirts. At least not yet.
