Voters in two states will decide if people will get to learn what is deep inside their food.

On Nov. 4, citizens in Oregon and Colorado will vote on whether companies must tell buyers, on the package, when food has been genetically changed in any way. The proposed laws call for labeling those foods.

GMO stands for genetically modified organism. A GMO is any plant or animal whose genes have been changed in a lab. Genes are the building blocks of all living things. In a person, a gene will decide many things, like hair color or height. In an animal, genes will determine things like how much meat it has. In corn, genes will determine sweetness or how well it deals with drought.

Companies genetically modify crops or food livestock with genes from other species to give them certain qualities. It may help them to grow better. It also protects against disease, insects or drought. A bacteria gene added to corn, for example, shields it against some bugs.

People who oppose GMOs say they are not safe.

## Lots Of Worry Over GMOs

Oregon and Colorado could become the first to pass a referendum calling for GMO labeling. In a referendum, ordinary citizens vote on a proposed law, not lawmakers. Referendums in Washington and California rejected similar GMO laws in 2013 and 2012. Lawmakers in Vermont approved GMO labeling, but a court fight against the law is ongoing.

So far, food companies in favor of GMOs have been successful in fighting label laws. Monsanto, a genetically modified seed producer, and food companies Kraft Foods and Coca-Cola are some of the largest in the fight. Large grocery chains and some farmers have joined them. They worry that people will not buy GMOs, because they will think GMOs are unnatural or unsafe. They also say labeling will make products more expensive.

Supporters of GMO food labels argue that people have a right to know what's in their food. They say the information will help people decide what to buy.

Scientists largely say the fear that GMOs are dangerous is not true. A 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences found no health problems from GMOs.

## No Nutrition Information?

Most processed foods in the United States, like canned soup, soda and frozen meals, contain some GMOs. Foods such as peanut butter, wheat bread, milk, cheese, fruits and vegetables generally do not.

Larry Cooper helps run Right to Know Colorado, which is for labeling GMOs.

He said that in Colorado, groups against labeling have raised raised $12 million. Pro-labeling groups raised just $700,000.

"It's definitely a David-versus-Goliath thing," he said.

Groups against labeling say the laws could hurt the people they are designed to help.

Thomas M. Helscher is the spokesman for Monsanto. He said the food company opposes state labeling laws. "They don't provide any safety or nutrition information," he said.

Helscher added that they "will hurt, not help" people and businesses. He said the government in Washington, D.C., should decide whether GMOs should be labeled or not.

## Ice Cream Gets Into The Act

In Oregon, the referendum vote has become the most expensive in the state's history.

So far, the two sides have raised $16.7 million. Monsanto alone gave more than $4 million to defeat the proposed law.

On the other side, the Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps company has given $1.15 million to support labeling in Oregon. It has supported labeling in other states.

Ice cream maker Ben &amp; Jerry's is on Dr. Bronner's side. It recently renamed a popular flavor. Chocolate Fudge Brownie is now called Food Fight Fudge Brownie. The name change is to get the word out to people about the vote.
