NEW YORK — On his recent visit to the United States, Russian conductor Valery Gergiev was met by protesters almost every step of the way.

In New York, Ukrainian protesters stood in freezing weather outside the Metropolitan Opera, where he was conducting the orchestra. They held signs with phrases like "GERGIEV supports WAR in UKRAINE" and "DON'T PLAY PUTIN'S TUNE" on them.

Gergiev may be the most famous and respected Russian artist alive today. But he is also controversial, because of his strong support of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

## A Long Friendship With Putin

Russia, Ukraine and other countries used to be one country. It was called the Soviet Union. Russia and Ukraine had been separate before. Many Ukrainians did not like being under the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union broke up more than 20 years ago.

Now Ukraine is afraid of being under Russian rule again. Putin allegedly sent Russian soldiers to eastern Ukraine last year. Pro-Russia groups in eastern Ukraine have been fighting Ukrainian troops. Putin has supported the rebels. Because of that, Russia's president has become less and less popular in Europe and the United States.

Gergiev and Putin have a long friendship. Because of that, some artists have refused to perform with Gergiev. He was banned from a festival in Germany. Still, Gergiev insists he's a busy man with no time for politics.

He conducts orchestras all over the world. In Russia, he leads the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg — home of renowned ballet, opera and orchestra performances.

Gergiev is finishing his time as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra. He will move to the Munich Philharmonic in Germany next. Classic musical festivals will take him all over the world — to Finland, Sweden, Holland, Israel and China. He often serves as a guest-conductor for other orchestras.

## "People Come To Hear Music"

Gergiev recently finished a month in the United States. He visited New York, Florida and Michigan with the Mariinsky group. They performed opera, ballet and classical music. He also guest-conducted at the famous Metropolitan Opera in New York.

During the trip, protesters met him wherever he went. At the Metropolitan Opera, one protester holding a banner got onto the stage as Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko was taking her final bow. Netrebko has also been a public supporter of Putin.

Gergiev says he is fine with protesters expressing their opinions outside, but he insists that it's not appropriate inside the theater.

"People come to hear music," he says, "not to hear shouting. And to go on stage and scare Netrebko, how can the Met let this happen?"

In 1990, Valery Gergiev had just turned 37. He was an unknown assistant conductor. Still, he had a grand vision.

The Soviet Union had just fallen. There was new freedom in Russia that had not been there before for artists.

## Ambassador For Russian Culture

Gergiev wanted to take a fresh look at Russian culture. Russia needed to know itself so it could rebuild as a new nation, he said.

He began to revisit operas that had been forgotten during the Soviet years. He focused on Russian composers: Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky.

Gergiev was very successful. He highlighted Russian culture and much more. He built a concert hall for the Mariinsky Orchestra and a second opera house. He became an international ambassador for Russian culture. He had help — money from the Russian government.

In St. Petersburg, he found a friend in city government — an assistant mayor who supported culture: future President Putin.

As president, Putin is not shy about supporting Russian fine arts like ballet and opera. When other world leaders visit, he often takes them to see ballet or classical music performances.

## Performing Charity Concerts

Gergiev doesn't just promote Russian culture. He also has become a fighter for the environment. In the early 1990s, he started a small music festival in Mikkeli, Finland. In the Finnish forests he discovered lakes where the water is clean enough to drink.

Gergiev also has appeared in many troubled places around the world to perform charity concerts.

Still, more and more people have been upset with Gergiev. Many were angered when Gergiev supported the Russian takeover of Crimea a year ago. Crimea had been part of Ukraine.

"It's a long story," he says. He explained that people outside of the region have trouble understanding how deep-rooted the issues are. For this, Gergiev says you have to go back to the history of Ukraine and its relationship to Russian culture.

"The Crimea issue is not something from five years ago or three years ago. You have to go back 200 years, 100 years," he says.
