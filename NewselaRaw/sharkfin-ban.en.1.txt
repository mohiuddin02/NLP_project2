LOS ANGELES — An ancient Asian dining tradition came to an end in California on Monday. Grocer Emily Gian was not happy about it.

Gian slashed prices on shark fins, the expensive ingredient of a soup eaten on special occasions. Her hope was that she would sell out before California's ban on the sale or possession of the delicacy takes effect.

"The law is unfair," said Gian, whose store in Los Angeles' Chinatown sells shark fins for $599 a pound. "Why single out Chinese people in California when shark fins are legal in many other states?"

Across town, retired science teacher Judy Ki offered an answer.

Ki grew up in a wealthy Hong Kong family that served steaming bowls of shark fin soup to honor guests at birthdays, banquets and weddings. These days Ki, a spokeswoman for the Asian Pacific American Ocean Harmony Alliance, sees the delicacy in historical context.

## Reserved For Emperors

Shark fin soup dates to the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Then, it was reserved for emperors as a symbol of their importance and power. "Back then it was quite a physical feat for a fisherman to land a shark. It was the ultimate symbol of yang, or male energy," said Ki.

It wasn't prized for its flavor. It hardly has any. Its chief merit is a delicate, jellylike texture, achieved through careful drying, precise trimming and a complex preparation method that takes several days. For flavor, cooks often add chicken or ham.

As China's middle class grew in recent decades, the number of people who could afford the delicacy rose sharply. To meet growing demand, the fishing industry found what some call a cruel way to harvest several million fins each year. Fishermen slice the fins off live sharks and throw the crippled animals back into the sea to drown.

An estimated 73 million sharks are killed each year for their fins, which can sell for more than $2,000 a pound in California. The populations of some shark species, such as hammerheads, have been reduced by as much as 90 percent in recent years.

Ki calls that morally wrong. "It is not right to slaughter massive numbers of sharks for a bowl of soup that lasts five minutes," she said. "Culture evolves. [Extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) lasts forever."

## Other States Following Suit

But Gian and others said it's not fair to ban shark fins in California while chefs and grocers in other states can continue to sell them.

The state, and supporters of the ban, said they hope that will change.

"This is an important milestone in the global campaign to end shark finning," said Aimee David, who is director of conservation policy at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. "California's example has inspired several states to act." Hopefully, she added, many others will follow their lead.

So far, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Maryland and Delaware have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale of shark fins. So have the Pacific territories of Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. New York is currently pursuing similar legislation.

Korean Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways have stopped carrying shark fins as cargo. And the Chinese government has announced that it will phase out fins from official events within three years.

Despite protests from some Chinese American leaders, California Gov. Jerry Brown outlawed the possession, sale and distribution of shark fins 18 months ago. Stores were allowed to sell their current stocks until Monday. Violators could face penalties of up to six months in prison and fines up to $1,000, authorities said.

## Court Ruled In Favor Of Ban

San Francisco merchants who claimed that the ban was unconstitutional and discriminatory toward Chinese culture mounted a legal challenge in federal court. In January, the case was resolved in favor of the ban. The court found that California had the right to outlaw the sale of shark fins. Its decision was based on research showing that the decline of sharks is a threat to the marine ecosystem.

Across the street from Gian's shop, Wing Hop Fung Ginseng &amp; China Products was down to its last three bins of dried shark fins. One was marked: "Father's Day Special! 20 percent off. $999 a pound."

At the nearby Ocean Seafood, shark fin soup now costs $42 a bowl. Manager Dennis Fong said the restaurant was changing its menus this week to remove the item.

Some Chinese restaurants were trying to come up with a tasty imitation shark fin soup. In place of shark fin, they used non-endangered seafood.

As for Gian, she still had a lot of fins to sell.

"Maybe we'll reduce the prices even more, or eat them ourselves, or maybe move them to a state where they are still legal," she said.
