Ceres is a mysterious rocky object in outer space. Scientists know very little about it. Yet soon it will be explored up close for the first time.

A spacecraft called Dawn is heading toward Ceres right now. By March 6, it will be close to Ceres. Then it will begin to carefully map Ceres' surface.

Ceres is located between Mars and Jupiter. It is round and roughly the size of Texas.

## A Dwarf Planet

Ceres is too small to be considered a regular planet. Instead, it is what scientists call a dwarf planet.

Scientists did already have some pictures of Ceres. They were taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2004. Hubble's pictures are very blurry, though.

The Hubble pictures do show something interesting, however: a few bright spots on the surface of Ceres. Scientists are very curious to figure out what these are.

Dawn is already taking its own pictures of Ceres from far away. The latest pictures were taken from a distance of 28,000 miles.

## Clearer Pictures

The new pictures are much clearer than anything Hubble took. Scientists can now see the bright spots more clearly.

The bright spots are actually quite dark. They are called bright spots for one simple reason: they are far brighter than the rest of Ceres. Most of the dwarf planet is blacker than coal.

No one knows for sure what the bright spots are. One idea is that they are water ice that came out of ice volcanoes.

## Underground Water?

If Ceres has ice volcanoes, then it must have a lot of water beneath its surface. Scientists would find that very interesting. A planet with large amounts of water is more likely to have life on it.

Ceres is in an area between Mars and Jupiter called the asteroid belt. Asteroids are rocky objects too small to be planets. But Ceres is not "a dead potato" like an asteroid, says scientist Mark Sykes. "There is a lot happening."

Dawn will not actually land on the surface of Ceres. It will remain around 250 miles above the dwarf planet.

## Any Dead Bugs In There?

Dawn will circle all of Ceres repeatedly. Scientists will be able to put together detailed maps from the pictures it takes.

Scientists may want to take an even closer look at Ceres.

Scientists could send another spacecraft in the near future, Sykes says. It could "go down to one of these spots." There it could "scoop up soil, take a look and ask whether there are any dead bugs in there."

But, Sykes says, "It's too early to say whether this stuff is there." Still, he is feeling very excited. After all, life may soon be found on the tiny dwarf planet Ceres.
