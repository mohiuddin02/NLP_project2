WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter made a historic announcement Thursday. Women now can serve in any job in the military.

Carter ordered the military to open all combat jobs to women. The Marine Corps had wanted to keep women out of certain front-line fighting jobs. Carter rejected that.

At one time, women were not allowed to be soldiers or sailors. Now, women serve their country in all branches of the military, the Marines, Air Force, Navy and Army. Yet, until Thursday, 1 of out of 10 jobs were still closed to them.

## Changes Will Begin April 1

Carter is in charge of the U.S. Department of Defense. He said that moving women into combat jobs will not always be easy. However, the military can no longer afford to shut out half of the population, he said. Carter said that any man or woman who meets the standards should be able to serve. He gave the armed forces 30 days to come up with plans to make the historic change. A top military leader said the plans will be put in place by April 1.

Carter's announcement means that women now can serve in the military's most difficult and dangerous jobs. Special operations forces, such as the Army Delta units and Navy SEALs, had been closed to them. These elite units perform special missions. They often go behind enemy lines.

General Joseph Dunford was once head of the Marines. Now, he is the chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff. That means he is the highest-ranking military officer in the U.S. Armed Forces. Dunford had argued that the Marines should be allowed to keep women out of certain combat jobs. Only the Marine Corps felt this way. The Army, Navy and Air Force have all moved steadily toward allowing women to serve in all posts. Dunford said studies show that units with both men and women do not work as well together as all-male units.

Carter said he came to a different conclusion.

## Ability, Not Gender, Takes Priority

Carter noted that on average, men and women have different physical abilities. Men are often bigger and stronger. However, he said men and women must be given tasks and jobs based on ability, not because they are men or women. There may be fewer women in some jobs, he said, but they should have a chance to try for those jobs. The military's main goal is still being the best fighting force it can be.

Carter's decision comes after several years of study. All the military services will follow his decision.

Carter has hinted at this for months. In October, he spoke to U.S. troops in Italy. He told them that only choosing men for top military jobs would be "crazy."

In Italy, a Marine asked Carter a question. Carter answered that the country's soldiers must come from the entire American population. "Half the American population is female. So I'd be crazy not to" consider women for military jobs, he said.

For that reason, as many jobs should be open to women as possible, Carter said.
