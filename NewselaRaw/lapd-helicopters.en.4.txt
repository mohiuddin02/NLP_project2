LOS ANGELES â€” Police often use helicopters to fight crime.

In Los Angeles, helicopters are being used to stop crime before it starts.

A few years ago, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) began looking into ways to prevent crime. It tried a new method, sending police to areas where crimes were more likely to happen. Crime went down.

Now the police department is flying helicopters to crime "hot spots." Police think that people will not break the law while a helicopter hovers overhead.

The way of fighting crime is extremely new, says Captain Gary Walters, who heads the police air support unit. "It's different. It's nothing that we've ever done before."

Los Angeles has 17 police helicopters. It is the largest police helicopter fleet in the country. Most police departments use helicopters to search for criminals. Crime experts say that using the helicopters to prevent crime is really unusual. They say it sounds like a good idea.

## More Choppers Above, Less Crime Below

So far, police officials say, the helicopters are working. The more helicopter flights, the more serious crimes went down.

During a week in June 2013, helicopters flew 36 times over an area in South Los Angeles. During that week, 125 crimes were reported. A month later, helicopters made 91 flights in the same area. The number of crimes dropped to 86.

The biggest difference came last September. Police helicopters flew over the area 65 times in a single week. During that time, police recorded 90 crimes. A week later, the number of flights dropped to 40. Meanwhile, the number of crimes skyrocketed to 136. Almost all types of crime went up during that time, including burglary, car theft and thefts from vehicles.

Craig Uchida looks at data for the police. He offers advice on preventing crime. He says it is too early to prove that helicopters stop crime. So far, though, the results are good, he says.

##Beware Boomerang Bad Guys

Geoffrey Alpert is a professor with the University of South Carolina. He studies the use of police helicopters. He says helicopters can work for a while. However, criminals will likely return after the helicopters leave.

Helicopters may scare off criminals, but not permanently, he said. "Those criminals could strike in a different time and place."

Some see helicopters as a new tool for reducing crime. For other people, they can be loud and scary.

Andrew Guthrie Ferguson teaches law at the University of the District of Columbia in Washington. He points out that helicopters are really noisy. A helicopter overhead can make people feel unsafe or threatened.

Police departments say they want to have a better relationship with the community. A hovering helicopter can get in the way of that, Ferguson says.

## "To Do Something Different"

Some people were unhappy when the police received two drones from Seattle police last year. The Los Angeles police are not using the unmanned aircraft, which carry cameras. They remain locked away for the time being. Yet, some people think that the police department might use them to prevent crime, like the helicopters. They worry the drones will spy on people.

Commander Sean Malinowski sees it in a different way. Malinowski helped figure out how to stop crime before it happens. He says using the helicopters shows how creative and exciting police work has become.

"That gets people pumped up to do something different," Malinowski says.
