Most of us have experienced what is called writer's block. We sit down to write, paint or make music. Then we find that we just can't. Most frustrating of all is the more thought we put into it, the harder it is. Now scientists might have found a reason why it is so hard to force creativity.

Scientists at Stanford University set out to explore creativity in the brain. What they found was surprising. A study suggests that the cerebellum does more than scientists once thought. The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls how muscles move. The new study says it is also involved in creativity. If so, the discovery could change our understanding of the way our brain works.

## Quick! Draw Some Action Words

The cerebral cortex is on the outside of the brain. It helps people to think, remember things and learn languages. There are two parts of the cortex. Each side controls different parts of thinking. It is thought that these two parts affect how we think. People who think creatively are thought of as being "right-brained." People who think logically are often called "left-brained."

Three years ago, Grace Hawthorne wanted to do an experiment. She is a professor of design at Stanford University Institute of Design. She got help from Allan Reiss, a behavioral scientist at Stanford's School of Medicine. Hawthorne wanted to find out if her design class made students more creative. So Reiss developed an experiment. He was inspired by the word game Pictionary.

People in the study were placed into a scanner type of machine. It can see activity inside the brain, kind of like a digital X-ray. While they were in the machine, they were asked to draw pictures based on action words like vote and salute. They had 30 seconds for each word. They also drew a zigzag, or crooked, line to see how the brain looks when people draw. The participants later said which word pictures were harder or easier to draw. They ranked how hard they were to do. Then professors scored the pictures for how creative they were. Scientists at Stanford looked at the pictures of the brain to find patterns in the brain activity.

## Brain Parts Work Together

Scientists were surprised. The less the people thought about what they were drawing, the more creative the pictures were. The more they thought about them, the more they messed up.

The cerebellum may help in creativity. This could change our understanding of how the brain works. The different parts of the brain may work together more than we thought.

It may also prove that "practice makes perfect." We know that the brain's motor cortex is busy when we are learning new movements. Then the cerebellum coordinates the movement. This frees up the brain's motor cortex to learn more. Activity in the cerebellum slowed when participants faced a difficult job. It increased when the job did not take much thought. This supports the idea that the cerebellum helps thinking in much the same way it works in motor control.

## Study To Be Continued...

Yet the study was not perfect. First, scientists do not agree on what creativity means. To measure it they still need to come up with a meaning for it. Second, the cerebellum controls muscles. So the creativity of the drawings could have been based on the movements needed to draw them.

Also, when the participants drew the zigzag, it was to compare against the words. It is known as a "control." The zigzag was probably easier to draw than the words. Future experiments should try to match the drawings more closely with the control.

Finally, the study measured only visual creativity. It should measure other types of creativity like music.

Many hope the Stanford experiment can be improved and repeated. Then we will understand more about creativity in our brains.
