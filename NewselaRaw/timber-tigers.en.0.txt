U.S. consumers who purchase hardwood floors and furniture made with illegally cut Russian timber unwittingly may be putting [endangered tigers](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) at risk, according to a report by the World Wildlife Fund.

The study reveals how loggers in eastern Russia are misusing permits for thinning out diseased trees or just flat-out breaking the law by logging on protected lands.

The loggers are taking down old-growth Mongolian oak trees and other species key to the survival of the Amur tiger, the report said. Environmental groups estimate that there are about 450 Amur tigers left in the wild.

The eastern Russian provinces of Khabarovsky and Primorsky border China. Chinese flooring and furniture manufacturers, who compete with U.S. companies, use the illegal wood in products exported to the United States and Europe, the WWF said.

The practice threatens the last remaining habitat of the Amur tiger, sometimes called the Siberian tiger. The oak trees, many of them centuries old, play a particularly important role in the food chain on which the tiger depends.

The Mongolian oak drops acorns that are eaten by deer and wild boar, which are in turn prey for the Amur tiger. With the trees rapidly disappearing, so is the tiger's food source. New roads being built by loggers are also leading to poaching of both the rare tiger and its prey.

## Which Tree is Which?

"U.S. consumers can unwittingly be contributing to this," said Linda Walker of the WWF. Other trees illegally logged and sent to China include Manchurian ash and Manchurian linden. All are similar to wood grown in the United States. They are sent to China for use in finished products that are then exported to the United States.

"There is no expert in the world who can tell from the appearance of the wood that this is a different species," said Nikolay Shmatkov, who works for the WWF on forest policy projects in Russia.

Companies engaged in the illegal trade have threatened WWF officials monitoring logging in Russia's far-eastern provinces, he said.

The WWF and other environmental groups are angry. Export data from Russia show that from 2004 to 2011, oak timber exports from Russia to China were two to four times the legally allowed levels. Shmatkov estimated that from 2007 to 2008, Russian loggers exceeded legal limits in the tiger's habitat by 52.9 million cubic feet of wood.

## A Trade Problem

The issue could lead to a trade conflict with Russia. The practice appears to violate amendments made to the Lacey Act in 2008. The Lacey Act was a sweeping nature protection legislation first enacted in 1900. The 2008 amendments require that American companies or individual importers of forest products ensure that the wood was obtained legally in the country of origin.

The changes mean that it is the responsibility of U.S. companies to make sure they are following the laws in the exporting countries. It also means they are liable for wrongdoing by suppliers or middlemen. It is not enough to know that the product is coming from China. Importers must now know where the Chinese companies with which they do business are getting their wood products.

The Lacey Act was the subject of headlines last year when well-known guitar maker Gibson was charged with violations for imported wood. The act briefly became a rallying cry for tea party politicians, who pointed to it as an example of government meddling. Gibson settled with the federal government in August, with the company paying a $350,000 fine and pledging to improve its oversight of its wood imports.

"Fully enforcing this U.S. law by investigating highly risky Russian hardwood imports and prosecuting proven violations will send a clear message that the largest consumer of wood products is closing its doors to illegal wood and all its devastating consequences," said Sascha von Bismarck, head of the Environmental Investigation Agency. Von Bismarck's environmental group uncovered many of the problems with Gibson's use of rare hardwoods.

The State Department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture both have extensive outreach programs abroad designed to draw attention to the amended Lacey Act and to encourage companies to follow it. Shmatkov was on Capitol Hill on Monday to raise awareness about the problem with Russian logging.

To avoid contributing to the problem, the WWF's Walker said consumers should try to do business with companies that sell products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Few Russian companies have such certification.

"Consumers can purchase FSC-certified flooring or furniture. That is the easiest way to ensure that purchases are not contributing to the degradation of the Russian Far East's last tiger habitat," the WWF report said.
