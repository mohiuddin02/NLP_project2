SPOKANE VALLEY, Wash. — Once a month, collectors come to Spokane Valley Sportscards for their version of a poker night, breaking open factory-sealed boxes of cards, looking for what they call a hit. They may have different teams they favor, but they're all after big-name players, the ones whose cards could command hundreds of dollars.

Among the regulars, Joseph Branda is known for taking the biggest risks.

He's the one who once bought a $600 box of basketball cards, the kind that comes in an intricate wooden chest. He's the one with the collection that's potentially worth as much as a decent car. On this Saturday, as the others hold back their spending, he's the one who just asked for another box of football cards, wagering $140 on coming away with a prized addition to his collection.

Leaning over a counter, Branda, 22, quickly sorts through the box. He rips open six packs, each holding six cards, and flips through a lineup of professional football players.

## "Whoa!"

He tosses aside most of them. Then Branda's eyes widen. His tilts his head back and breaks into a stunned smile.

"RG III!" he calls out.

It's a hit. He's scored Robert Griffin III, a Heisman Trophy winner and the starting quarterback for the Washington football team. The limited-run card is autographed and it also has a swatch of his jersey attached to it.

All conversation in the room stops, and several of the others huddle around him to gawk at the card.

"Whoa!"

"Oh, that's awesome!"

The shop's owner, Alan Bisson, looks up the value: $150.

Bisson takes the card held in Branda's trembling hand and slips it into a plastic cover to protect it.

"That's what I'm looking for!" Branda says. "Every hit from here on out is profit."

## The Thrill Of The Hit

The third Saturday of each month is trading night, when baby boomers gather alongside college students and kids too young to have seen Michael Jordan play basketball.

The regulars who come to Bisson's shop — a group of no more than a dozen — are not very interested, however, in making trades.

They've been lured here by the thrill of the hit. They come month after month, hoping they will turn up one of the cards conceived as collectibles, with limited quantities inserted into random packs.

"It's like pulling the handle on a slot machine," says Bisson, 60, who admits that he's one of his own best customers. "It's the chance of pulling the big one."

His passion (or vice, depending on how you look at it) is what drew him into this business. Twenty years ago, he got into the business with a salesman at a shop where Bisson once bought his cards.

Bisson's the only one still left. He runs the store — which focuses on sports memorabilia but also carries political collectibles — from an old ranch-style house in this Spokane, Wash., suburb.

In what was once a cozy living room, racks of card boxes block the windows, and the fireplace is hidden behind shelves of merchandise. In the den, a worn, sea-green sofa faces a wall overtaken by Bisson's version of a library card catalog, where the cards of almost any athlete a collector might be looking for are organized in alphabetical order: Troy Aikman. Kobe Bryant. Jay Cutler.

## Keeping His Business Afloat

On good days, maybe a dozen people walk in, but there are many days, though, when it's just Bisson.

A number of those who show up are looking to sell rather than buy. Their collections usually date to the early 1990s, when sports cards were a fad. Now they've got boxes of overproduced memorabilia that is as good as garbage, as Bisson tells one man who lugged in his collection one afternoon.

Most of the card business, Bisson says, has moved online. The sense of community is gone.

He could have walked away, like his former partners and the owners of other shops in the area. At the moment, trading night keeps the shop afloat.

Zach, 9, may be the youngest participant in trading night, but he's just one of the guys.

Zach has been coming since December, driven by a passion for sports that he picked up from his father.

"Instead of watching cartoons in the morning," Zach says, "I get up and watch 'Sports Center.'"

At some point, many kids outgrow the hobby. Branda has inherited many of his friends' collections. He has about 400,000 cards of football, basketball and baseball players, organized in plastic bins that stack to the ceiling of his bedroom.

## A Hobby With Profit Potential

The regulars say their family, their friends — wives and girlfriends, especially — don't get it: Why would they spend so much money on cards?

"It's a better hobby than doing drugs and being in a gang," says Scott Brewster, a 20-year-old junior at Washington State University. "So they approve of that."

Their expensive hobby also has the potential for profit. Branda has sold a card featuring the autographs of eight Yankees who played in the 1996 World Series — the second of two made — for $750. Brewster made $300 in profit on a card with the autographs of the NBA's San Antonio Spurs Tim Duncan and David Robinson he bought for $25 at a yard sale.

As trading night winds down, Bisson writes their charges on slips of paper and adds up the tab. One of his better customers racks up a tab so big — $643.50 — that he doesn't want the amount printed with his name for fear of his wife's wrath.

For Branda, it's $260. For Brewster, $140. He pays some of it with his debit card, a little more in cash. He will take care of the rest when he's back next month, flush with more money and ready to try his luck again.
