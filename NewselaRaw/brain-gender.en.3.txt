Men and women have brains that are built differently. Scientists discovered that by looking at results from over 100 studies. They found differences in parts of the brain that control language, memory, feelings and behavior. However, scientists did not find any difference in the way that men and women think. Scientists concluded that human brains are not just male or just female. 

Scientists published these results in a magazine. They wrote that male brains are built differently than female brains. One thing that scientists found was a small difference in size. A man's brain is a little bit bigger than a woman's. 

## Does How A Brain Is Built Change How It Thinks?

Scientists then wanted to find out if the physical differences in the brain meant that male and female brains think differently. 

Daphna Joel is a scientist at a college in Israel. Israel is a country in Asia. She and a team of scientists looked at pictures of more than 1,400 men's and women's brains. They could not find any patterns that make men and women think differently. The team looked at different tests, different parts of the brain and different groups of people.

Joel's team found that men and women's brains are built differently. She says that does not mean that they can be sorted that way. 

Joel and her team wrote in another magazine for scientists recently. In it they said that each brain has things that make it different. They wrote that some of those things "may be more common in females compared with males. Others may be more common in males compared with females." Joel also said that they found some of the same things in both male and female brains.

## Male, Female Or Both?

The team wanted to figure out more. They looked at parts of the brain. They looked for clusters that were only male or only female.  

Joel and her team then used a new test group. There were 281 men and women in the group. They were all between 18 and 79 years old. 

The scientists looked closely at photos of their brains. They looked closer at parts in the brain that showed the biggest difference between male and females. They divided the results into three groups, male, female, and both. The brains that were both had female parts of the brain and male parts as well.

Very few showed up as just male or female. Four out of every 10 showed up as both.

Joel and her team then repeated the study. They got the same results. More brains showed up as both rather than just male or female.

## Teens And College Students

The scientists then looked at two large studies of American teens done by universities. The studies interviewed youths about their family, friends, neighborhood, schools and lives. The goal was to see how their social life led to their choices. Then the scientists wanted to see how these teens behaved led to their health and accomplishments as young adults. 

First, they looked at a study of 570 boys and girls. They found that only about 10 of the teenagers scored as just male or just female. A little more than half scored as both.  

The difference was even bigger with the second study. Among 4,860 teenagers, very few scored just male or female, but 7 out of 10 scored as both.

Finally, Joel and her team looked at older students. They asked 263 college kids about things that they liked to do such as watching talk shows on television and playing video games. They also asked about other activities that are usually thought of as more for men or more for women.

With their answers, the scientists found that very few of the students could be grouped as just male or female. More than half answered as both.

Joel and her team say the results ruin any attempt to say that male brains are all one way and female brains are all another.
