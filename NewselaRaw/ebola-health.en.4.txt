ATLANTA â€” Ebola is a deadly disease. It kills six to nine of every 10 people who catch it. Right now, there is a big Ebola outbreak in Africa.

World health officials warned about Ebola on Friday. They said the disease was moving faster than they could control it. Meanwhile, U.S. doctors got ready for the arrival of two Americans infected with Ebola.

The two Americans were being moved from Liberia to Atlanta, said Samaritan's Purse, a Christian aid group. The moves started this weekend.

The patients are Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, a missionary, the group said.

Brantly arrived first in Atlanta on Saturday. He was taken to Emory University Hospital's special infectious disease unit. The unit was built in cooperation with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC's job is to protect the nation's health.

There are only four units in the country like the one at Emory. It separates infected patients from other areas of the hospital.

## No Cure For The Deadly Disease

Meanwhile, Dr. Margaret Chan, head of the World Health Organization, spoke about fighting the disease in Africa. She said the international group planned to release $100 million to fight Ebola. More than 1,300 people have been infected with the virus. At least 729 have died.

There is no vaccine or treatment just for Ebola. It is spread through contact with the organs, blood or other fluids of infected people.

People who are infected with the virus get a sudden fever. They get very weak, have bad muscle pain and headaches. They also throw up and have diarrhea. The disease can also cause kidney and liver failure. People with Ebola can bleed inside their bodies.

## Lots Of Worries

Some people are scared that two people with Ebola were coming to the United States for medical care. They worry that the disease could begin to spread here. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci insisted that this was highly unlikely. He is a top doctor working for the government.

Dr. Fauci talked about the strength of the U.S. health care system. He said that doctors here could keep infected patients away from other people.

Still, some people near Emory University Hospital said they were worried. They did not like the idea of Ebola patients being treated in their hometown.

"What? No, that worries me," Lisa Jackson said. "Why are they bringing them here? They shouldn't even let them across the border," she said, shaking her head.

Greg Hammock disagreed. Still, he admitted that he worried about the virus spreading. "All I know is Emory better be on top of their game," he said. "If this is the only place they can get help, then sure they should bring them here."

## Controlling The Spread Of Ebola

On Thursday, the CDC said not to travel to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. All three countries are in West Africa.

"We do not have effective treatment or vaccine for Ebola," said Dr. Tom Frieden. He runs the CDC. "There is no proven treatment. There is no proven vaccine. There is not likely to be one for at least a year."

He said health officials would control the disease using ways that have worked before. That includes identifying people who are infected. They would keep them away from others. Health officials would also find people who have been close to people who are infected. Communication among health workers is also important, he said.

Writebol is said to have received an "experimental" drug. There was only enough of the drug for one person. Brantly reportedly received a "unit of blood" from a 14-year-old boy who survived the disease. The boy's family wanted to thank the doctor for saving his life.
