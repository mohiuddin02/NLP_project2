BERLIN â€” A German newspaper columnist asked a question this week about the reaction to what was going on in Washington. The columnist wanted to know why people in Germany were shocked by the political fight that led to the recent government shutdown.

After all, they'd seen it before. The Republicans insisted on scaling back the Affordable Care Act, which led to the shutdown. It wasn't so different from German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisting that Greece cut back on spending and the Greek crisis that followed.

While it was only one column in one newspaper, it did nicely sum up how much of the world seemed to be seeing the United States during the budget fight:  both broken, like Greece, and bossy, like Germany.

## Shutdown Ripples Around The World

No one was amused, however. The United States, after all, is not a bit player on the international stage like Greece. It is the unquestioned global leader. And sure, Europeans may express anger at the United States because of a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But many were shocked to see how hostile Americans seem to be to one another. They also didn't understand how disinterested Americans seemed in how their internal fight might affect the rest of the world.

Xenia Dormandy is an expert on the United States and its place in the world at a group in London called Chatham House. She said the politicians involved in the shutdown are only thinking about how it matters in American politics. "Nobody cares about any of the international implications," she said.

Some predict the fighting will have long-term consequences.

## Losing Ground To Other Nations

Willem Post is an expert on U.S. politics at The Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands. He warned about the standoff in the United States and divisions within Europe over what to do about its own economy. These issues mean the two continents are not doing what they need to to remain the most important forces in the world. At the same time, there is talk of China rising and power shifting to the Pacific.

The United States is still the world's largest economy and will long remain the world's most powerful nation, he noted. And Europe, troubled as it may be, remains a major economic force.

"This is a window of opportunity now, for two continents with shared goals, to make a partnership under which they will not diminish," he said. "Of course, they cannot wait 20 years to make this happen. This is a moment, and it must be seized. Instead, we have dysfunctional governments on both sides of the Atlantic."

And there will be consequences, he said.

"For us, failure to make progress now is an issue, but only one of many," he said. "For our children and grandchildren, it is a looming disaster."

## No Compromise

The American role in it makes it harder for Europeans to understand. To people in Europe, their own conflicts make more sense. The European Union is made up of 28 nations with competing interests.

But the United States is a single nation.

"Europeans really don't understand," he said. "The United States is the model democracy; it should be leading by example. Instead, there is no talking, there is no compromise. The lesson to the rest of the world is that the United States these days can't be relied upon."

The official Chinese news agency Xinhua had its own opinion about the U.S. government shutdown. One of its writers suggested that it might be time to think of  "building a de-Americanized world."

## End Of The American Century?

The Xinhua piece proposed that the time has come for the world to give up the U.S. dollar as the currency of world trade. Doing that would be a disaster for American shoppers used to low prices on imports.

The article goes on in even stronger language to criticize the United States for its international policies. The United States is not using its power to end violence and conflicts, it is instead introducing more trouble into the world, the writer said.

The language of the article is harsh, but the thoughts are hardly fresh. They also won't go away simply because the United States, once again, drove up to the edge of the cliff and dangled the world economy for a while before deciding not to actually drop it.

Earlier this year, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius gave a speech in Indonesia about recent global history and the end of "The American Century."

The world had two powers with the United States and the USSR, Fabius explained. Then, for a short time, there was one big power, the United States, because the USSR collapsed and broke apart into Russia and other republics. In the future, there will be several big powers, Fabius said. For the moment, there is no power in control, he said.

As such, the global cost of this government shutdown shouldn't be measured in dollars as much as in prestige, some analysts say. And in those terms, the U.S. lost a lot.

Joerg Wolf, editor in chief and a foreign policy expert at the Atlantic Community, a Berlin-based group, noted that "it is mind-boggling that politicians are so slow to see the costs of their actions."

Wolf wonders if politicians really need to experience the consequences to appreciate them.

"The U.S. is playing with fire," he said. There will be blowback."
