KATHMANDU, Nepal — Binod Tiwari leaped out of an SUV and stopped in front of a foot-wide crack in the pavement.

As trucks and motorcycles whizzed by, Tiwari raised his camera to snap photographs of the crack. Tiwari then checked some nearby homes that tipped dangerously forward.

Tiwari is an engineer at California State University, Fullerton. He came to Nepal to help lead a team that measures the damage after big earthquakes such as the magnitude 7.8 one that hit Nepal in April.

Magnitude is a measure of how strong an earthquake is on a 1 to 10 scale.

The team is with the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance, which is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation. The engineers wanted to find out what happened to the rock and soil during the quake. They examined which buildings, bridges and roads made it through the quake — and which ones didn't.

## Chasing A Disaster

The best way to learn to build safer structures, Tiwari said, is to head to the disaster zones where they have failed.

"Natural disasters come without telling us," he said. "Science has to chase that disaster."

Tiwari studies soil liquefaction, a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during earthquakes. It causes the soil to move like a liquid, tipping over buildings as if pulling a rug out from under them.

Tiwari was born in Nepal in the kind of mud-mortar house that collapsed during the quake. When he was a teen, his family moved to Kathmandu, the capital, where he would look through his window at the Himalayas.

"All around you see snowcapped mountains," he said. "If you feel a little sad, you just look into the mountains."

Across Nepal, the team saw children and elderly Nepalese huddled under tents near flattened and crumbling houses.

It's "devastating," Tiwari said. "You want to cry."

Tiwari's ability to connect with Nepalese people was essential to the team's mission. Earlier in the day, he chatted in Nepali with a high government official and as he checked the damage in people's homes, Tiwari asked residents for details on what happened during the quake.

## Studying Soil's Role In Survival

The scientists needed to work fast before the evidence was erased by the summer monsoon rains.

They examined every bit of infrastructure they came across — bridges, roads, houses and power projects.

Yet they also looked at how different types of soil reacted to the earthquake. In part, they hoped to identify slopes in this mountainous country that have a high risk of landslide. Finding those weaknesses quickly would allow them to better predict which slopes are most likely to give way when the monsoon rains come.

Soil plays a role in whether a building survives an earthquake. Tiwari and his team looked at what the soil is made of, its grain size, how densely packed it is and how much water it holds.

Later in the day, Tiwari climbed under a metal gate to examine a three-story school that had sunk into the ground.

School officials had built it to withstand a magnitude 8.0 earthquake, stronger than the magnitude 7.8 quake that hit in April. Yet the builders never checked the soil underneath it to see if it could hold a foundation, Tiwari said, shaking his head.

## Checking Out The Aftershock Damage

Tiwari and his team were on the road May 12 when a magnitude 7.3 aftershock hit. The aftershock caused their car to sway as if rocked by high waves.

It was like "some big elephant coming to your car and shaking the car," Tiwari said

There was no question of turning back, because the aftershock gave them an important scientific opportunity to see the damage just hours after a major earthquake hit.

The damage was extensive near the center of the aftershock. Homes made with mud and bricks had fallen apart, and several buildings were flattened.

Before returning to California, Tiwari spent the last few days of his trip giving talks to engineering groups located in Nepal. The country's building guidelines will need to be rewritten as well, because they don't take the ground beneath into account.

Scientists also will have to study the soil in different regions around Nepal. They need to fully understand which areas are safe to build in, he added.

## Reassuring His Mother And Her Neighbors

Years ago, right after graduating from a Nepali university, Tiwari built his own house. He designed it so well that it survived the quake.

His mother still lives there, but she and terrified neighbors had refused to return to their homes. They lived together in a long tent for weeks as aftershocks continued.

Tiwari knew he could not leave them until he had examined the buildings himself.

Tiwari checked everyone's house and told them, "Don't worry, go back to your house and sleep well there," Tiwari said.  "And they did, they did."
