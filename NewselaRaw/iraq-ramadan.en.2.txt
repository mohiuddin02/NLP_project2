The refugees live in a camp for people forced from their homes by the nation's growing conflict. Their push for food ended their first daylong fast of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.

Shouting men scrambled Sunday to reach pots of rice, meat and chicken stew in this dusty, hot refugee camp some 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the northern city of Irbil. The city is the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region. People are fleeing to the Kurdish region, which has some freedom from Iraq's government and whose people have mostly kept out of the conflict.

The chaotic scene at the camp highlights the fears of Iraqis as they begin Ramadan. The nation is gripped by unrest and edging toward civil war. People are bitterly divided by religious beliefs. Sunnis and Shiites, who worship two different branches of Islam, are frequently at odds. The majority of Iraqis are Shiites and they control the government. Under Saddam Hussein's government, the Sunni minority once ran the country. Sunni rebel groups are fighting to change the balance of power.

## For Some, A Bitter Ramadan

For Bashir Khalil, a 39-year-old Shiite, and his wife Nidal, a Sunni, Ramadan has been robbed of its rhythm of community and togetherness.

The couple fled Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul after it was captured by Sunni extremists earlier this month. They have always been poor. But in their impoverished quarter of the city, neighbors shared their food. Here, when the food ended, there would be no more until another charity came by.

"When this food finishes, there'll be nothing else," 34-year-old Nidal Khalil sadly said.

She and her husband fled after Sunni militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) forcefully questioned them. ISIS was once part of the al-Qaida terrorist group, but later broke off. In the last two weeks, ISIS has seized large parts of northern and western Iraq, including Mosul. It wants to establish an Islamic country in Iraq and neighboring Syria, following its views of Sunni law.

ISIS considers Shiites to not be true Muslims. Bashir was under suspicion because he is a Shiite, and Nidal was questioned because she worked as a cleaner in a Shiite charity.

They returned days later after receiving assurances from local gunmen that they wouldn't be harmed. Yet, they came back to find their home had been damaged in clashes.

"We don't want this one or that one," Nidal Khalil said, referring to the Shiite-led government and the Sunni insurgents. "Neither of them cares about us poor people."

Her mother-in-law, Shamsa, sat nearby, smoking a cigarette. Fasting Muslims are not supposed to smoke, eat or drink during daylight hours. But the 70-year-old woman shrugged and said she couldn't fast in the heat.

Bashir Khalil did not manage to get any of the food donated by a local television station. However, his 10-year-old daughter, Sara, managed to grab a bag filled with containers of soup, rice and meat.

## For Others, "God Has Blessed Us!"

At the camp's edge, it was quiet in tent D42. There, another refugee named Umm Mishal watched the sun sink over the horizon alongside her youngest daughter Amal, who wore a torn red dress.

"Ramadan is a generous, blessed month. We will not go hungry," the 49-year-old woman said. At the same time, she complained that other families had taken more than their fair share of the donated food, chaotically distributed off the back of trucks.

"They have grape juice," she said, pointing at another family.

Then, on a plastic sheet bearing the United Nations' logo, she set out three tubs of soup, three plates of rice, a loaf of bread, a small roasted chicken and sliced watermelon.

The evening's meal was taken care of. Suddenly giddy, she exclaimed, "God has blessed us!"

She said with a giggle, "Eat some chicken!"
