A new study came out from a children's hospital in Ohio. It said more and more American children are getting hurt by their toys.

The study shows that between 1990 and 2011 the number of kids who got hurt by a toy went up. The scientists studied kids who were sent to the hospital. They looked at 100 hospitals with 24-hour emergency rooms. The age kids were most likely to be hurt while playing with toys was age 2. More than half of the kids who got hurt were under 5 years old.

Most of the time kids play safely and don't get hurt.

Not always, though.

## Be Careful On That Scooter

Many kids get hurt when they play with scooters. Toy-makers call the scooter a "ride-on" toy. Wagons and tricycles are also ride-on toys. Kids push scooters with their feet to move them. Then they climb on top and ride it. The number of accidents from playing with ride-on toys went up by three-quarters between 1990 to 2011.

Scooters can be dangerous. They helped to make falls and crashes the most common accidents with toys. The study found that six out of every 10 falls came from ride-on toys.

The study also found that kids who play with scooters or wagons get more badly hurt. They fracture or break their bones. Kids who used scooters were three times more likely to break a bone than kids who used other kinds of toys.

Kids who got hurt riding scooters were also sent to the hospital more often.

## Toy Accidents At Home

The scientists found other interesting facts. The facts had to do with all toys.

For example:

Four out of five accidents with toys took place at home.

Almost two-thirds of the accidents happen to boys.

Accidents from toys were higher in the spring and summer. They were lower during the fall and winter.

Nearly all of the kids sent to the emergency room were treated quickly and sent home. They did not have to stay in the hospital.

The scientists said that there would be fewer accidents if toys were made safer.
