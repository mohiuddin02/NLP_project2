Chris Christie is governor of New Jersey. In February, he appeared on a late-night comedy show. He bit into a jelly doughnut. He made fun of his own weight. Ten days later, he had a secret weight-loss operation.

And then it was back to work. He appeared as if nothing had happened. He made no mention of the operation at any of the meetings he held that week.

"If I had the choice, I wouldn't have ever talked about it," Christie said on Tuesday. He said that a news report about his surgery was indeed true. Christie has joked about his weight throughout his career. However, the governor said it was his plan all along never to admit publicly that he had the surgery.

"It's nobody else's business," Christie said. He added that it became public only because a reporter asked him a direct question about the operation. "I would never have lied about it."

It is, Christie said, a deeply private matter. Christie has struggled for decades with his weight. And he said it has absolutely nothing to do with politics. Christie's term in office is nearly over. He plans to run for re-election. Political watchers say he has a chance to be the Republican candidate in the 2016 race for president.

## Family Matters

Christie told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday that he decided to have the surgery for his family. He has a wife and four children. He turned 50 in September.

"My long-term goal is to get myself into a position where I'm healthier and I can live a longer life and be an active parent and hopefully someday grandparent," Christie said. His youngest two children are in elementary school.

"I want to try to put myself, as I get older, in the best position I can be to spend as much time with them as I possibly can," he said.

Christie declined to say how much weight he has lost. Nor would he say how much he weighs now or how much he plans to lose. He said such questions are nobody's business. He called the media attention "ridiculous" and "silly."

Christie discussed the operation with no one outside his family, except for his chief of staff and chief counsel. New York Jets coach Rex Ryan had the same surgery. He shared his experiences with the governor in a phone call. But Christie said he never told the coach that he was thinking about doing it himself.

## No Role Model

Christie said he has no plans to become an example for weight loss.

"I do not see myself nor do I care to be a role model in this regard for anyone," he said. "This is an intensely personal issue for me."

Less than two weeks before his surgery, Christie appeared on "The Late Show." Comedian David Letterman asked Christie if his jokes about the governor's weight bothered him. The governor then pulled the donut out of his pocket. He took a bite. He licked his fingers. The audience laughed. Christie said his size was "fair game." He added, "I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life."

The next day, former White House doctor Connie Mariano told CNN that she worries about his "dying in office." Her comment angered the governor. Christie said his children heard it. He called Mariano a "hack who wants five minutes on TV."

The governor has been open about his struggle with his weight. During a news conference after the Letterman show, he said "there's always a plan" to shed pounds. He said he's been working with a personal trainer four days a week since running for office. His workouts include weight lifting.

## Do Voters Weigh Candidates?

Former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine ran against Christie in 2009. Corzine tried to make Christie's weight an issue. Christie said, "I don't know what that has to do with being governor." Christie beat Corzine.

Christie denied that politics was the reason for the operation. He also said that he doesn't think his weight should matter if he decides to run for a higher position.
