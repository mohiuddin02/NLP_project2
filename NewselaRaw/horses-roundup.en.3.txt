The U.S. government and animal supporters are still fighting over plans to remove some wild horses from lands in the West.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said last week that it would remove 1,300 mustangs in the coming months. Many of the horses might otherwise die from lack of food and water, the government said. The bureau announced the plan even though it has run out of room to house the horses. It only has space for 50,000.

Animal supporters say 1,300 horses are still too many. They question the BLM's reasons for taking the horses from the land.

The agency has said before that there are too many horses for the land to keep alive. Supporters of wild horses say this is not true. They argue that the agency is really helping ranchers whose cattle and sheep graze on the land. The BLM is responsible for 264 million acres across the United States. That is almost as much land as all of Texas and Montana put together.

## Summer Roundups Of Horses

Nine of the BLM's 16 summer roundups will be conducted in Nevada.

On Tuesday, the agency said it would move 50 wild horses threatened by drought from an area two hours north of Las Vegas. Bureau officials said some animals that are suffering might have to be killed.

The BLM has been closely watching the drought. Since early July, it has been filling tubs and troughs with water. It has also been providing hay to the horses.

But the animals are very nervous. They will not drink from the man-made containers.

"Horses will die," BLM spokesman Tom Gorey said. "It's not going to be pretty."

The bureau has been criticized for how it has managed wild horses. The animals have been blamed for damaging the land. But there are far more cattle grazing on the land than there are horses.

Scientists reviewed the agency's horse roundups. They recommended that the government spend money to cut down on the number of mustangs being born. It should also let nature thin the herds, not spend millions to house horses in crowded holding pens, the study said.

## "BLM Is Galloping Ahead"

In June, 30 members of the House of Representatives urged new U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to improve the government's wild horse management program. The lawmakers also asked her to get tighter control of the increasing amount of money it is spending on program. A big part of the spending goes to the high cost of removing the animals from the range.

For the 12 months that end in September, the BLM plans to remove 4,800 mustangs from the range. That is down from 8,255 in the last year, Gorey said.

The American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign group criticized the bureau's plans.

"The BLM is galloping ahead with rounding up more wild horses," said spokeswoman Suzanne Roy. The government is doing this even though it costs taxpayers a lot of money and the scientists said the BLM should stop, she said.

Six of the Nevada roundups will use helicopters to herd the animals to pens. The rest will use bait and water to trap them in corrals.

## Working In Secret?

Sally Summers is the founder of the Reno-based group Horse Power. The group wants to stop the capturing of horses and burros. She said the BLM's plans to put water traps in a particular area would make it hard for people to watch what the bureau is doing.

"Do they make sure there is enough water in those traps? Do they check them enough times a day to collect horses out in the middle of the heat? We won't know," she said.

She added: "The BLM is tired of people picking it apart. They want to do what they do in secrecy."

Gorey lashed back at critics.

"On one hand, they imply that if Mother Nature kills off the horses from thirst or starvation, that's OK," he said. "But if we intervene to save these horses, that's unacceptable."

"Where is the reasoning in that argument? I don't see it," he said.
