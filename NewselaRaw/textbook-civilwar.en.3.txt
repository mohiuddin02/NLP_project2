Texas students will begin using new schoolbooks this fall.

The books leave out a lot of history. The books do not say much about the unfair treatment of blacks in the South. They also do not say that the Civil War between the Northern and Southern states 150 years ago was caused mainly by slavery.

Slavery was a "side issue to the Civil War," said Pat Hardy. He was on the state education board when it passed the education standards in 2010. The standards say how teachers should teach history in school.

"There would be those who would say the reason for the Civil War was over slavery," Hardy said. "No. It was over states' rights."

Last month, nine black people were killed in a South Carolina church. The man charged in the attack was seen in a photo holding a Confederate flag. It is a symbol of the Southern states during the war. To some, the flag is a symbol of Southern history. For others, it is a sign of slavery and racism. After the shootings, people began discussing whether the flag should be taken down from buildings.

## People Worry About What Kids Are Learning

Now, people are also questioning how the Civil War is taught to children in school.

"It's the obvious question, it seems to me," said Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network. The group opposes how the Civil War is taught in Texas.

He wondered: What are kids learning?

Rod Paige, who was in charge of the U.S. Department of Education, was among those who criticized the Texas board.

The history of slavery and civil rights are important parts of American history, Paige said. They have made America what it is today. "We may not like our history, but it's history," Paige said.

Historians agree that states' rights played a part in the Civil War. However, states' rights and slavery were basically the same thing, they say. The right that states in the South were seeking to protect, after all, was the right to buy and sell people.

## Texas, South Carolina Books Are Different

Southern states made that clear when they declared their independence from the rest of America, said James Grossman, the head of the American Historical Association.

The Civil War happened only because 11 Southern states were determined to defend the right to own other human beings, Grossman said. "The Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery."

Historians agree on that, Grossman said.

Historian Jeremy A. Stern gave the Texas standards a grade of D.

Yet Stern said that South Carolina deserves an A. He said that the state honestly deals with slavery's part in the war while also speaking about states' rights as an important issue at the time. South Carolina is where the Civil War began and where the churchgoers were killed in June.

## How Important Was Slavery?

Nearly half of Americans believe that states' rights were the main cause of the war. In comparison, fewer people said the main cause was slavery, according to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey.

Raul Cevallos started a group in Texas to educate students. He found that many young people are ignorant about history.

In a video his group made, some students did not know who won the Civil War. Yet, he said, they were able to name the wife of movie star Brad Pitt as Angelina Jolie.

People who do not know about the Civil War and slavery will not understand why America is the way it is, Cevallos said.

Stephen Wright is an eighth-grade teacher in Nacogdoches, a small Texas town. He said some Texas students leave class not knowing that slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. His students know the truth, he said.

The leaders of the Southern states wrote that slavery was the reason they separated from the U.S. He has his students read their writings.

"Man, it's all about slavery," he said. "The students know that."
