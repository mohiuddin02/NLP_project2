"Ga-ga, ga-ga," rings out across the playground at Madison Elementary school. Kids at the Wheaton, Illinois, school gather around the "gaga pit," cheering on the players. It is recess, and they are not-so-patiently waiting for their chance to play the game.

Gaga is not a new game, but recently, it has become much more popular. Some call it a kinder and gentler form of dodgeball, played with just one soft foam ball. The game does not require strong athletic ability, and almost anybody can play. "Everybody's even in gaga ball," says Madison physical education teacher Joe Cortesi.

For some, the name "gaga" may conjure images of a certain female pop singer, but she has nothing to do with this game. Gaga ball has been played for many years and is believed to have originated in Israel. Gaga means "touch, touch" in Hebrew. It was being played in the United States by the 1970s.

## Being Last Is A Good Thing

A gaga pit is any large, flat surface surrounded by a short wall. The shape of the pit can be either hexagonal or octagonal.

The number of players varies, but everybody starts with one hand touching a wall. The ball is then dropped in the center, and players slap the ball underhand and try to hit the other players below the knee to get them out. The last player left in the pit wins.

The rules are a bit more complicated. Players cannot hold or throw the ball, and if someone hits the ball out of the pit without it touching another player, they are out. If someone who is already out catches that ball, he or she is back in.

"It's kinda like dodgeball. I like gaga ball a lot better," student Rian Klabunde says. "I just feel like it's not that competitive, and it's really just a fun way to hang out. Dodgeball is a little bit more competitive, and I don't really like that."

The rules, soft ball and walled-in space help to keep the sport safe and easy to play.

## Gaga Ball Starts Soaring

In 2010, an Illinois man named Cliff Silverman played gaga at a father-daughter camp. He saw how it appealed to both the girls and the dads, so he began designing gaga gear. Now he has a business selling the gear to summer camps and on his website.

Silverman says that when he first started selling his gaga ball gear to summer camps, only about 1 in 10 people had heard about the game. "I had to get people in the pit and teach them," he says. Now, when he talks about the game, most people already know about it.

Cortesi, the PE teacher at Madison Elementary, saw how popular the game was at a neighboring school. He asked the school to give him money to build a pit. Then, parents and students helped him build the school's first pit from wood, using Silverman's hardware.

It was such a hit that the school decided to build another one. "It's pretty cool when you see middle schoolers and high schoolers coming over to play together after school," Cortesi says.

Parents might find that their child comes home with scrapes, but few complain.

"We've watched our kids play a lot of organized sports," Illinois father Dan Israelite says. "It's not always the best sportsmanship being shown. But this is just fun. There is very little screaming and yelling that's not positive," Israelite says.
