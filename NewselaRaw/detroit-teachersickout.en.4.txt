Most of the schools in Detroit were closed Wednesday. Detroit is a city in the state of Michigan. Teachers shut the schools down. They held a sickout.

A sickout is a kind of protest. It happens when many workers take the day off at the same time. 

Teachers are allowed to take a day off when they get sick. On Wednesday most of Detroit's teachers called in sick. Most were not actually sick though.

Teachers are angry about Detroit's schools. They say school buildings are falling down. Classrooms are too crowded. 

Teachers say schools are unhealthy for them and their students. There are many rats and cockroaches. There are holes in the ceilings. The rooms can be very cold. Teachers do not even have the books they need to teach. 

## "Enough Is Enough," Teacher Says

"We felt it was time to take a stand. No more. Enough is enough," said teacher Marietta Elliott. 

School buildings need to be safe, Elliott said. Teachers need books to teach. Teachers should get more money for doing their job too, she added.

They say Detroit classrooms are too crowded. Some teachers have 45 students at one time. It is hard for one teacher to teach that many students.

Teacher Vanessa Dawson said the sickout was a big step to take. Students missed a day of school. Still, things have gotten so bad something had to be done. 

"Someone had to hear what we were saying," she said.

## Leaders Begin To Take Action

Some leaders have heard the teachers. 

Mike Duggan is mayor of Detroit. He is the city's top leader. 

Duggan said the city will look at every school building. He said people should report unsafe and unhealthy schools. The city has set up a way for them to do that.

Rick Snyder is the state's governor. He is Michigan's top leader. 

Snyder said lawmakers should try to fix Detroit's schools. He said they must do something soon.

"Too many schools are failing," Snyder said.
