SAN DIEGO â€” On Wednesday, brush fires broke out in more than half a dozen spots in northern San Diego County. Throughout the day, they spread at a dangerous pace. Their progress was spurred on by hot, dry winds and record-high temperatures.

Crews also battled flames in other parts of Southern California.

The San Diego fires forced many evacuations. People fled schools, businesses, homes, a mobile-home park and California State University, San Marcos.

The most destructive of the blazes was the Poinsettia fire in Carlsbad. It burned several hundred acres and caused a lot of property damage.

By mid-afternoon, three Carlsbad homes had been destroyed. Later in the day, officials said that eight homes, an eight-unit apartment building and two commercial buildings were destroyed or damaged.

## "There Was Just No Time"

Firefighters have "days of work to be done," Carlsbad Fire Chief Michael Davis said. The fire broke into different sections and raced up canyons, as red-hot embers were launched by high winds into new areas.

By day's end, the fire was no longer spreading. However, officials said, it was still not contained and hot spots remained troublesome.

Homeowners had only minutes to gather treasured belongings and pets and flee.

"There was just no time," said Greg Staska, 63, whose home was destroyed. "But it's OK, I'm alive."

Meanwhile, the Tomahawk fire, in the northeastern section of the Camp Pendleton military base, burned more than 6,000 acres. It forced evacuations of two housing areas and two schools.

A blaze dubbed the Twin Oaks fire prompted the evacuation of California State University, San Marcos, and nearby homes. A fixed-wing aircraft dropped water on the fast-moving fire.

## One Fled Two Fires

Erik Bye, 28, a programmer at 24 Hour Fitness, experienced two fires. At work in Carlsbad, he saw smoke from the Poinsettia fire approaching. "The smoke just kept growing, growing, growing," he said. "It wouldn't stop. We weren't sure what to do."

He raced home to San Marcos where he felt it would be safe. Instead, a fire erupted there and covered his neighborhood with smoke. Without waiting for an evacuation order, Bye left.

"It's been a bad day," he said. That comment was heard frequently from others in northern San Diego County.

Various evacuation centers were set up for those fleeing Wednesday's fires. Among them were schools, a shopping center, a senior center and a golf course. Several people with large trailers volunteered to move neighbors' horses to the Del Mar Fairgrounds.

And in the canyons next to Rancho Santa Fe and Fairbanks Ranch, firefighters continued to battle the Bernardo fire. This erupted on Tuesday and had burned 1,500 acres by early Wednesday. Fortunately, no structures were damaged. By late Wednesday, the fire was described as 50 percent contained.

"It's like a scene from Armageddon," one homeowner said as thick, black smoke blotted out the sun.

## Hundreds Evacuated

Hundreds of homes and businesses were evacuated as the blaze raged out of control. Several elementary schools and libraries were emptied out as well.

Legoland in Carlsbad was closed, leaving disappointed vacationers.

Heath and Gina Seifert of Glendale were en route to the theme park with their two daughters. Suddenly, the traffic on Interstate 5 locked up and news of the fire began to spread.

"They were like, 'Where's Legoland from here,' and we were like, 'It might be on fire,'" Heath said of his daughters.

Legoland did not burn, but the rides were shut down and the people at the park were forced to leave.

Firefighters throughout the county seemingly raced from fire to fire. Their efforts were hampered by record-breaking temperatures, high winds and tinder-dry vegetation.

As bad as Wednesday's fires were, for many who remembered raging fires in 2003 and 2007, they were a familiar threat. People in San Diego County, state official Dave Jones said, "are all too familiar with the destructive force of wildfires."
