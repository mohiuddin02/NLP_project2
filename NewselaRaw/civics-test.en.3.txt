PHOENIX â€” To graduate, high school students in Arizona now have to pass the U.S. citizenship test. Arizona is the first state to pass such a law.

Normally, immigrants have to pass this test to become U.S. citizens. The test asks questions about the Founding Fathers, the Bill of Rights and U.S. presidents.

Other states may pass similar laws this year. But some educators warn it's not the answer to the nation's poor knowledge of civics. Civics is the study of how the government works.

## Skimming The Surface?

Fewer than 12 states make students take any test about American government to finish high school. In some states, students don't even need to pass.

"This has been building for a long time," said Ted McConnell. He works with former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to increase learning about government in schools. McConnell said he and others are worried that lawmakers are only skimming the surface of what students need to know.

Some education leaders are worried about the state of teaching civics.

In 2010, a national test looked at educational progress. Only 1 out of every 7 high school seniors got a passing score in American history. If people don't understand the importance of being a citizen they don't vote. The number of people who voted in the last elections for Congress was the lowest in years.

## Is A Test The Right Answer?

The Joe Foss Institute is a group that wants to change that. It wants all 50 states to use the U.S. citizenship test for high school students by 2017. The institute says lawmakers in 15 states are expected to consider it this year.

The Arizona law requires high school students to correctly answer 60 questions on the test to pass. There are 100 questions in total. Passing the test is required to earn a high school or GED diploma. The law goes into effect for the 2016-17 school year.

McConnell said people pushing for the citizenship test have the "right problem, wrong solution."

Some experts say this exam does not capture what they want students to learn.

## Would More Classes Be Better?

Some states have their own civics exams. Those test knowledge that the U.S. citizenship exam does not. They ask questions about equality before the law, the purpose of democratic government, and being a good citizen.

The citizenship exam is actually too simple, some experts say. They prefer more civics classes.

The new rule also comes as part of a larger argument over testing. There are worries the No Child Left Behind act and other laws prevent the understanding of civics.

People fear too much testing means there is less time for teaching topics like civics. One study found this to be true. More than a quarter of the school districts said they spent less time on social studies.
