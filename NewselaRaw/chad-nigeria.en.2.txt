WASHINGTON â€” The United States has sent 80 troops to help search for kidnapped [Nigerian schoolgirls](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian+schoolgirls), according to the White House.

President Barack Obama informed Congress of the deployment on Wednesday and said the soldiers will remain until their help is no longer needed. The soldiers will provide support for information-gathering aircraft flying over northern Nigeria and surrounding areas.

The decision marks a big increase in the U.S. involvement in the search. The girls were kidnapped from their school April 14 by Nigeria's most feared and powerful extremist group, Boko Haram. More than 270 of them are still missing.

Two weeks ago, the U.S. sent about two dozen experts to help look for the girls, including intelligence and law enforcement officers. Of those, fewer than 10 were from the military.

Under federal law, the president must tell Congress when U.S. soldiers are sent to a foreign country.

## Believed Hidden In Deep Forests

Separately, U.S. Department of Defense officials said the extra troops will operate and maintain an unarmed Predator [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), and provide security. The drone is equipped with a camera. It has been searching for the girls from the air.

U.S. officials believe Boko Haram divided the girls into smaller groups and have hidden them in the deep forests of northeastern Nigeria. The area is about the size of West Virginia. Defense Department spokesman Navy Rear Admiral John Kirby compared the hunt for the girls to searching for "a needle in the jungle." So far, the search hasn't turned up much information.

"We've not seen anything that indicates their location at this point," Kirby said. The U.S. is sharing any information it gets with the Nigerian government. But so far, it's not seen much.

For the last five years, Boko Haram has increased its grip on Nigeria. The terror group has been particularly active in the north where kidnappings and attacks have become common. On Wednesday, Boko Haram members attacked three villages with car bombs. At least 40 people were killed near the site where the girls were taken. A day earlier, Boko Haram supporters killed at least 118 people during a double bombing in the central city of Jos.

The U.S. officials have been put in a difficult position dealing with Nigeria's military. U.S. law prevents the government from giving help to anyone who has committed human rights violations. The African country's army has been accused of human rights violations. Also, some members of Boko Haram belong to the Nigerian army.

Alice Friend is in charge of African affairs at the Defense Department. She has said the U.S. is being "very, very careful" to give information only to Nigerians who won't use it to violate human rights.

## Hashtag #bringbackourgirls

Since 2010, Boko Haram is believed to have killed at least 300 students. Boko Haram can be translated as "Western education is forbidden." It has said it kidnapped the girls because they should be married rather than go to school.

The girls' kidnapping sparked international outrage and a Twitter hashtag campaign, #bringbackourgirls. Among those participating in the campaign was first lady Michelle Obama. But in the last week, the campaign has lost some of its popularity.

The troops will be stationed in the neighboring country of Chad. They will not be in Nigeria. But their presence is still likely to cause some anger in Nigeria. Some Nigerians question why the U.S. military is getting involved in Africa.

U.S. officials have said the Nigerians must be the ones to carry out the rescue if U.S. technology spots the girls.

"We're not talking about U.S. military operations in Nigeria to go find these girls," Kirby said. "That's not the focus here."

The last time the United States sent troops to Africa was in 2011. The Obama administration deployed a small group of soldiers to central Africa to help hunt down Joseph Kony. He is the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, which used to terrorize Uganda.

The U.S. troops are still hunting for Kony. He remains on the run.
