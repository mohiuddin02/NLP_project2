SEATTLE, Wash. — For many years the great Seattle Gum Wall was covered with millions of pieces of chewed gum. People came from everywhere to see it. They took pictures. 

Then, in early November, workers started cleaning the Gum Wall. 

One worker sprayed hot water onto the old brick wall. It made the gum soft. Then the other worker scraped it off. Gobs of gum fell. The air smelled like old minty gum. 

## A Final Visit Before Gum Is Gone

People wanted to visit before the Gum Wall before it came down. Kymberly Dempsey lives nearby. She let her four children skip school so they could see it. The colorful wall is yucky, she said. It is also kind of beautiful, she thinks. 

The Gum Wall started 20 years ago. It is near a theater. People were waiting in long lines outside. They wanted to get into the theater to see a show. They were bored. People stuck their used gum to the wall outside the theater.

For years, the wads only covered a small part of one wall. Then people took pictures in front of the wall. They posted them to Instagram and Facebook. More people came. The gum wall grew.

## A City That Believes In Bubble Gum

Allison Hazen and Philip Prahst visited the Gum Wall on their wedding day. They wanted to celebrate by sticking gum on the wall.

It was perfect. Only they forgot to bring gum.

People saw Allison's white wedding dress. They clapped. One lady even filled Allison's hands with white gum.

It took workers 130 hours to clean the Gum Wall. Right after they finished, people started adding more gum to the wall. Soon the Gum Wall could be back.
