LOS ANGELES —In the 1960s, '70s and '80s, many young people learned to play the accordion. Salesmen sold accordions door-to-door. Dozens of schools taught the instrument.

Back then, accordion students from all over the country came to LA for a yearly contest.

One boy's life was changed when a salesman knocked on his door almost 50 years ago.

Alfred Matthew Yankovic was only 7 years old when his parents bought him an accordion and lessons.

Later, "Weird Al" Yankovic used an accordion to record his first song. It was the beginning of a successful career that has lasted more than 30 years. It even earned him three Grammy Awards.

Still, Yankovic knew his instrument was not "cool."

## From Unhip To Cool

"The accordion got a reputation of being kind of unhip," Yankovic said with a laugh.

But now things are changing. The accordion has a new reputation: it's becoming cool.

People noticed when popular bands such as Mumford &amp; Sons and Gogol Bordello started using accordions.

The 2001 French film "Amelie" also helped bring the accordion back. The movie's soundtrack features the instrument.

It also helps that young people nowadays are looking for "weird" things to make cool again.

Yankovic said he noticed the accordion getting more popular about 10 years ago. He joked that he probably had something to do with it.

But for some people, the accordion was always cool.

Latino musicians like Faco Jimenez and Ramon Ayala are masters of the button accordion. In this world, the accordion was never a joke. It has always been respected as a serious instrument.

## "A Very Simple Music"

Button accordionist Otoño Luján never thought of the instrument as weird or embarrassing.

In Latino culture, it does not have the same reputation of being nerdy, said Luján, who teaches accordion.

"It's a very simple music," he said. "But it's got a soul to it that really pulled me in."

Although he's trained on the button style, Luján loves all accordions. "There's all these different flavors," he said.

On a street in Los Angeles, a small red and white neon sign reads: "DAVE'S ACCORDION SCHOOL."

Inside, black and tan cases cover the floor.  Two shelves hold accordions and other instruments for sale.

Pictures of Weird Al Yankovic and Irish band the Pogues hang on the wall.

Owner Dave Caballero, 68, sat on a piano bench examining the inside of a brown accordion.

Down the hall, his wife, Veronika, was finishing a lesson with 92-year-old Emily Gaughenbaugh.

## Playing A French Song

Gaughenbaugh said she took up the instrument a couple of months ago, partly because it's better than doing crossword puzzles.

She waited for her 66-year-old daughter to finish her guitar lesson in another room. She listened as  a man with gray hair played a French song on an accordion.

Soon a young women with a short haircut and a young Russian boy showed up for their lessons.

"Accordion is coming back," Gaughenbaugh said, smiling. "For a while it was kind of a joke."

Caballero opened his shop in 1971. He always thought of the accordion as cool. Many of his students say they were inspired by their favorite musicians or by the movie "Amelie".

Some students like the accordion because it is easy to carry around. Others are fascinated by it, but they aren't sure why.

"I think it's just the general curiosity," he said. "People just love the tone of the accordion."

Even with three helpers, it is difficult for Dave to repair all the accordions people send him. Some come from as far away as Tahiti and Hawaii.

"We can never catch up," Caballero said. His shop is full of accordions all the time.
