## Surprise Win In Second Round

## "A Lot Of Respect" For Star's Record

"I have a lot of respect for Ronda," Holm said. "This wouldn't have meant as much if it hadn't been for what she has done."

In her first two UFC fights, Holm was careful. A judge decided that she won. She did not score any knockouts.

UFC President Dana White said he will set up a rematch.

White first wanted to have Miesha Tate fight Rousey.

## Skills Made An Interesting Match

Then they decided to go with Holm. Rousey had already beaten Tate twice. Also, Holm was a boxer so it made for an interesting fight.

"I made this fight. This is the fight I went after," White said. "Obviously, I thought Ronda would have more answers."

Before the fight, Rousey was acting strangely. At weigh-in a day earlier, she charged at Holm and called her a phony.

Rousey is also making a movie.

She could have a rematch if she wants. White does not expect her to be back any time soon, though.
