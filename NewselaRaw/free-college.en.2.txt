Imagine a city where one out of every three children is poor. One out of every 10 adults cannot find a job. Imagine a place where only six of 10 students finish high school. What do you think happens to the four who do not finish high school? Their future is not very bright.

That was New Haven, Connecticut, just a few years ago. Many of New Haven's youths had no way out of their life of poverty. They looked ahead to their future and saw no opportunities. They knew they could not afford to go to college. This was especially hard to accept because Yale University is right in the middle of New Haven. Yale is one of the best colleges in the world. Yale graduates go on to become U.S. presidents and senators.

## A Radical Plan

A few years ago, things began to change. New Haven's mayor and other leaders decided to do something about the problem. They copied a program that was started in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It was working in other cities, so why not New Haven? The program, New Haven Promise, would pay for college for high school graduates who qualify. Now, three years later, seven out of 10 high school students will get their high school diplomas.

Even the poorest New Haven students now have a chance to go to college. They have to meet certain requirements. New Haven Promise will pay full tuition to Connecticut public universities and part of the tuition for private universities in Connecticut. Yale University provides money for the program.

## A City In Search Of A Makeover

New Haven Promise is part of a bigger plan to improve the city's economy. Like so many cities in the Northeast and Midwest, New Haven has serious economic problems. The city had factories that employed low-skilled workers, but the factories are long gone. In their place are new companies that need skilled workers.

New Haven residents want those high-skilled jobs, but they haven not been able to go to college or get specialized training. City leaders realize that turning around New Haven's economy will take more than just new companies moving to town. New Haven needs to invest in educating its youth so they will be qualified to do those high-skilled jobs.

## A Two-Way Promise

New Haven Promise is no one-way street. The students have to sign a pledge to "do their best" in certain key areas of achievement. They have to live in New Haven and attend New Haven public schools. They must have a B average, 90 percent attendance, and a good behavior record. They also have to give 40 hours of service to a community organization.

During the few years the Promise programs have been in place, it has become clear that just providing free tuition is not enough. Family support is key to help students stick with college. Many students do not have enough of that support at home. There may be no one setting a good example of success or encouraging them to work hard.

## Teaching Success

So New Haven started another program called College Summit. The goal is to create a "culture of success" from kindergarten all the way through 12th grade.  Students, teachers and parents must all be on the same page. They must all expect that every student can and will attend college. The high schools now have college readiness courses for their students. Promise is offering workshops for parents on how to apply to college.

## Not Just Getting In, But Staying In

The Promise program will only be successful if students do well enough to stay in college.  They need to finish with a 2-year or 4-year degree. But educators are finding that many Promise scholarship students are not able to finish the first year. Some students do not sign up for a second year. Others are not able to get good enough grades to keep the scholarship.

There are many reasons for this. Some students cannot afford to stay in school and have to get jobs. In Kalamazoo, middle-income students were found to be twice as successful as poor students.

The city is now finding ways to give students help and guidance all the way through college. It is still early, but the hope is that the program will give all New Haven students a chance at a bright future.
