TOKYO, Japan â€” Thousands of people are trying to enter Europe. They are escaping war in the Middle East. Many of them are from Syria. They are called refugees.

Shinzo Abe is the head of Japan's government. He promised $200 million to help them. Japan has not offered to let Syrian refugees live in the country, though.

Some Japanese wonder if Japan should do more.

Mainichi Shimbun is a Japanese paper. On Tuesday, it wrote that Japan could do more for countries that are helping refugees. It could also let some of the people live in Japan. The problem is not only for Europe to solve, it said. Japan is in Asia, but it can help too.

Yasunori Kawakami is a Japanese reporter. He said that the world is ignoring the refugees. Is it OK for Japan to ignore them also? he asked.

## Japan Donates A Lot Of Money

Amnesty International is a human rights group. It said other rich countries also do not take in refugees. Russia, Singapore and South Korea are on the list.

Japan is proud of being a good world citizen. Last year Japan gave $181.6 million to help refugees. Only the United States gave more money.

Last year, the government said Japan accepted 11 refugees out of 5,000.

Shogo Watanabe is a lawyer who helps refugees. He said Japan should be ashamed of itself.

Japan has a population problem. There are fewer and fewer Japanese each year. Japan's citizens are growing older. There are not enough babies being born. Refugees could help increase Japan's population.

## Country Has Space For More People

There are now 127 million Japanese. Japan's government thinks that the population will shrink to 95 million by 2050. Then, almost half of the Japanese will be over 65. Who will take care of them?

Japan has enough space. The country has about 8 million empty houses.

Many in Japan think it is not their problem.

Nobuo Ikeda is a teacher at Aoyama Gakuin University. He is against accepting migrants.

Some say it would cost too much.

Tomoaki Ueda is a Japanese Twitter-user. He said the refugees would need too much help. He thinks the government would spend too much money on them.
