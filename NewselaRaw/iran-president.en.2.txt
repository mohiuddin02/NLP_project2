WASHINGTON — When Iran's president speaks at the annual gathering of the United Nations on Tuesday, Western diplomats might do something they have not done in six years – stick around and listen. Some may even applaud.

Former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was known for his angry speeches. He denied the Holocaust happened. Hassan Rouhani was elected in June to replace him. He is more soft-spoken and is likely to give a conciliatory address to world leaders this week. It will be closely watched for signs that he is willing to thaw relations with the West.

Western diplomats predict that Rouhani's speech at the U.N. General Assembly will include an important gesture. He might even acknowledge that the Holocaust happened. U.S. officials would like to see him go further during his five-day visit. Maybe he could agree to direct talks with Washington. The leaders of the two countries have not spoken formally since Iraq's 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The White House says it has not scheduled a meeting between President Barack Obama and the 64-year-old Rouhani. But U.S. officials have hinted that Obama and other top officials are ready to chat with Rouhani or his U.S.-educated foreign minister. Such chats could open the way for bargaining on [Iran's](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) disputed nuclear program.

## Campaign Pledge To Ease Iran's Isolation

There are signs that Rouhani "is somebody who is looking to open dialogue with the West and with the United States in a way that we haven't seen in the past," Obama said in an interview on Telemundo. "So we should test it."

Obama has repeatedly signaled he is willing to talk with Rouhani. He even said so in an exchange of letters with Rouhani. The Iranian president was elected in June after a campaign that included pledges to ease his country's isolation and improve relations with the West.

The president is not the most powerful person in Iran. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is and he has long resisted compromise on the nuclear program. But punishments against Iran over the program have increasingly squeezed the economy. So he has signaled top-level support for the Rouhani mission.

Rouhani urged world leaders on Friday make the most of the opportunity "and to respond genuinely to my government's efforts to engage in constructive dialogue." His comments appeared in an article in the Washington Post.

Ahmadinejad was often viewed as a carnival sideshow in his annual trips to New York. But VIPs and journalists are scrambling to get a close look at Rouhani. He has almost nonstop meetings planned during his trip.

## Is Rouhani Open To Compromise?

A Jewish Iranian legislator will join him on the trip. Rouhani used his Twitter account this month to send best wishes to Jews celebrating the Rosh Hashana holiday. It's unimaginable that Ahmadinejad would have done the same.

"After eight years of an erratic, unpredictable president who would say outlandish things, you have a normal person as the president of Iran," said Haleh Esfandiari, a former political prisoner under Ahmadinejad. Esfrandiari now is a Middle East scholar in Washington. "He is centrist, he is a moderate, he tries to compromise."

Rouhani's appeal is apparent in the huge demand for tickets to a dinner he will have with several hundred Iranian-Americans in New York. It is even being called "Rouhanimania."

Two years ago, the Iranian mission to the U.N. canceled a similar dinner with Ahmadinejad when too few people wanted to come.

The question remains: Is Rouhani simply presenting a more moderate face to the world? Or is he open to compromise to end the nuclear dispute?

Even his detractors predict he will be charming and avoid picking fights. Although he is a true believer in the Islamic Revolution and a pillar of the Iranian national security apparatus, he is also realistic and intelligent. He speaks English well, having lived in Scotland in the 1990s as a Ph.D. candidate.

## Rouhani: "Turn Threats Into Opportunities"

It was Rouhani who arranged the Iranian government's sympathetic reaction after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He also helped Washington reach out to opposition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which border Iran, after the U.S.-led invasions.

Rouhani has tried to appeal to the West without upsetting hard-liners at home.

He has proclaimed the "age of blood feuds" over, and said the United States and Iran can "turn threats into opportunities." But he also has condemned U.S. "military interference" and insisted that Iran's nuclear program is a natural right that it will not surrender.

Analysts say Obama must be careful not to look too eager to make a deal. That would undermine his negotiating leverage and make influential members of Congress upset. It also would not sit well with the Israelis, who are counting on the United States to prevent Tehran from ever getting a nuclear bomb.

Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Friday that U.S. officials weren't falling for pretty promises from the new Iranian leadership. "Their words have to be followed by action," he said.

Although the Iranians aren't expected to begin serious negotiations right away, media reports in Iran suggest they may have an immediate negotiating goal in mind. They apparently want punishments eased enough so that they could reconnect to the global clearinghouse for international financial payments called SWIFT. The connection would let Iran send money around the world for business.
