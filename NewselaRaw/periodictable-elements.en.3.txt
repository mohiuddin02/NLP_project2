The periodic table of elements is getting a little bit larger. Scientists just discovered four new elements. 

Elements make up all matter. They cannot be separated into smaller materials. Atoms are the building blocks that make up elements. At the center of each atom is a nucleus. Inside of it are small particles or pieces called protons and neutrons. 

The periodic table lists all the elements. The table hangs in classrooms around the world.

Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118 are the ones just discovered. They were confirmed recently by a group of science experts. 

The new elements are known as super-heavy elements because the nuclei of their atoms are so enormous. Nuclei is the plural of nucleus. Element 118 is the heaviest element ever found. It has 118 protons and 176 neutrons.

## Super-Heavy Elements Are Not Natural

Most elements are found in nature. Super-heavy elements are not usually found in nature. It can take years to make them in special laboratories.

"Probably the only other place where they might exist in a short period of time could be a supernova," said scientist Dawn Shaughnessy. In a supernova, a star explodes. A supernova has "so much energy and so many particles" in one place, said Shaughnessy. She is the top scientist for the Heavy Element Group at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The group took part in three of the discoveries.

Super-heavy elements are also very unstable. They are only around for a split second. Then they begin to break down.

Scientists cannot see unstable elements. Scientists know about the elements because they can measure what remains after the elements break down.

## A Mashing Game Of Chance

The heaviest known elements are made by smashing two particles together and hoping they will stick. It is a game of chance.

Scientists first make a target out of a carefully chosen atom with a particular number of protons and neutrons. Then they blast it with another specialized atom. They use an atom that they think has the best chance of recombining with the target.

"It's really hard to smash two things together and get them to stick," Shaughnessy said. The atoms do not want to stick together. "They want to repel each other."

It takes several months to try this smashing experiment a huge number of times. If the experiment works one time out of many, it is considered a success. "And we're not always successful," Shaughnessy said. 

There are only a few laboratories around the world equipped to do this work. The experiments create a large amount of information. Supercomputers have to search through it all and find signs the experiment worked.

## Americans, Russians, Japanese Credited

Elements 115, 117 and 118 were created by scientists in Russia. Scientists from Lawrence Livermore worked on all three discoveries. Scientists from Tennessee and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, also helped create element 117.

Element 113 was discovered by a Japanese group. They are the first Asian scientists to find a new element.

Until now, these elements have been known by general Latin names. Now they can get their real names. Traditionally, that honor goes to the scientists who first found them.
