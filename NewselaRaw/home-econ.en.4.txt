Rudo Boothe's daughter is just 19 months old. But that's not too early to teach her about shapes and numbers, he says.

"My attempt is to make numbers very important," said Boothe. Greatness is his goal. Boothe and his daughter count down with the microwave timer at home. They add up tomato sauce cans in the grocery store.

Boothe lives in Florida and works in technology. He says success comes from learning to read and do math at age 4.

Boothe may seem like a super competitive parent. Instead, he is setting the stage for his child to earn more money later.

## Reading Plus Math Equals Big Paychecks

Scottish researchers say that better reading and math skills at age 7 mean bigger paychecks later in life. These are more important than intelligence, education and wealth. American educators agree that early education is important for success. But they say we shouldn't ignore other factors.

Timothy Bates says good things happen to children who read better at age 7. Bates teaches at the University of Edinburgh. By the time they are adults, they earn much more.

How much more? Bates studied 17,000 people in Britain during 40 years. Youngsters who were better at reading and math had higher incomes, nicer homes and better jobs as adults. They did better even than people who were smarter or had richer parents, but weren't as good at reading or math. A 7-year-old who read even a level higher earned $8,000 more at age 45.

Bates said that would even be more true in the United States. Here, rewards are based more on how well we do in school and at work.

This means important educational skills will matter through a person's life. It doesn't matter how smart you are, Bates said. Also, this still holds true even if you stay in school longer or you come from a richer family.

## Money A Greater Factor, Some Say

Hold it right there, say a bunch of American educators. They agree that early learning is important for job success. It creates kindergarten-ready kids. These kids become adults who are ready for jobs. But family wealth also matters.

For starters, only about half of American children attend good pre-kindergarten programs, said Libby Doggett. She works for the U.S. Department of Education.

In preschool, kids learn tools for reading and math. But they also learn other skills important for success. These include self-control and problem-solving. They also learn to make good decisions.

"It's not about ability," Doggett said. "We create ability. And we create it early on."

The kids most likely to miss good pre-K programs are poor children, says Greg J. Duncan. He teaches at the University of California. There is a big difference in educational skills between the nation's richest and the poorest kindergarteners. Richer children are much more likely to afford good pre-K programs.

## Getting An Early Start At Home

Even worse, American schools do not close this skills gap, Duncan said. Students in poorer areas are more likely to act out in class, he said. Their families tend to move around more too.

Duncan says the gap comes from the home. It also comes from different parenting styles.

Parents can make reading and math exciting, said Silvia P. Tarafa. She is the principal of the Key Biscayne K-8 Center in Florida. She gave some suggestions.

Parents should read nonfiction books on subjects their children like, she said. When they bake, they can use measuring cups to teach fractions. At the store, show that four quarters make a dollar. When children paint, frame the picture. That requires measuring the length and width.

These activities will help a child later in school, Tarafa said.
