LOS ANGELES — Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo crashed during testing Friday and broke into several pieces. One test pilot was killed and another was injured.

SpaceShipTwo was part of an ambitious space business started by British billionaire Richard Branson, who owns Virgin Mobile, Virgin America Airlines and Virgin Atlantic Airlines.

"Space is hard and today was a tough day," said George Whitesides, the CEO of Virgin Galactic.

Two pilots were aboard SpaceShipTwo. A California Highway Patrol spokesman said two people were found near the crash site in the desert north of California City and east of Mojave. One of the pilots had parachuted out of the aircraft, and another was located near the scene, according to the California Highway Patrol.

## Crash Spread Over 2- To 3-Mile Area

The WhiteKnightTwo aircraft, which carries the SpaceShipTwo, landed safely. National Transportation Safety Board investigators were on their way to the site, which the Kern County sheriff's office said was spread over a 2- to 3-mile area.

Virgin Galactic has engaged in a nearly decade-long goal to produce the world's first commercial space liner. The idea was to make several trips a day carrying paying customers into space for a brief journey.

Friday's test was the company's first rocket-powered test flight in nine months. A company called Scaled Composites was managing the test flight in partnership with Virgin Galactic, and its CEO said the flight was using a new fuel type that had been tested on the ground. In January, SpaceShipTwo reached 71,000 feet — its highest altitude so far. Virgin Galactic has done its testing for the spacecraft in the Mojave Desert at Mojave Air and Space Port, about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles.

The crash was the second disaster in the commercial space industry in a week. On Tuesday night, an unmanned rocket carrying supplies to the space station exploded just seconds after liftoff from a Virginia launch pad. No one was injured in that explosion.

Virgin Galactic's plans have been repeatedly delayed. Branson said earlier this month at a celebration in Mojave that it was "on the verge" of going to space, but he did not give a time frame.

## "When I Wasn't Hearing Anything"

Stuart Witt, CEO and general manager of Mojave Space and Air Port, where Virgin conducted its testing, said he did not see an explosion.

"From my eyes and ears, I detected nothing that appeared abnormal," he said. "If there was a huge explosion, I didn't hear it." He said a 90-second pause led him to think something had gone wrong.

"It's when I wasn't hearing anything that I became concerned," he said.

Virgin Galactic's reusable SpaceShipTwo rocket plane was designed to fly with the WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft to 50,000 feet. There the spaceship separates and blasts off. Virgin Galactic has said that when the rocket motor engages, it will power the spaceship to nearly 2,500 miles per hour (mph) and take the pilot — and up to six passengers — to the edge of space, or more than 60 miles above the Earth's surface.

Passengers would experience weightlessness at that altitude and see the curvature of the Earth before the spaceship re-enters the atmosphere and glides back to a runway. The company planned to charge $250,000 for the experience.

## Paying Customers Reserve Rides

Virgin Galactic said it has accepted more than $80 million in deposits for about 700 reservations made by people who are interested in the ride, including stars like Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Leonardo DiCaprio. Ticket holders also include Jim Clash, a writer and resident of New York City. He reserved his ticket four years ago with a 10 percent deposit and says he won't be swayed.

"It's rocket science. It's dangerous, it's risky, it's complicated. Most of us who bought tickets know that," he said. "I expected there to be accidents … I'm very sad and shocked that it was in such a spectacular fashion today, but it's not going to change my view."

Marco Caceres is senior analyst and director of space studies at the Teal Group, a company that studies aerospace and defense businesses. He said that having twin crashes in a week "could have a very serious impact" on attracting investors to the industry.

Any time a person dies, it sends the message of how dangerous these ventures are, Caceres said, adding that Virgin will now have a harder time attracting customers. Virgin's space plane had looked safer than a rocket to the public, he said.

"People will now realize this is space travel," Caceres said, "and you're getting into a rocket."

## The Risks Of Rocketry

Michael Blades, an analyst at Frost &amp; Sullivan, said the crash will indefinitely delay Virgin's goal of sending tourists into space.

"The passenger thing probably won't happen this decade," he said.

Friday's accident was not the first for the program. In 2007, during a test of the spaceship's propulsion system, an explosion at the Mojave Desert airport killed three workers and injured three others.

The blast reminded the public of the risks of rocketry, which had long been operated by powerful governments rather than businesses.

Branson has since built a 68,000-square-foot facility at the space port for a business called Spaceship Co. to mass-produce its rocket ship and carrier aircraft. It was one of the first aircraft assembly plants to be built in the region in decades.
