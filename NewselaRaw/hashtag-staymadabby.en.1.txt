Last week, the Supreme Court of the United States heard a controversial case called Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. As Americans across the country await the court's ruling, one group of observers have taken to the Internet to express their feelings about it. Their message? Abigail Fisher should "stay mad."

In 2008, a white high school student named Abigail Fisher applied to the University of Texas (UT) at Austin. After her application was denied, she filed a lawsuit against the school, claiming that she was the victim of discrimination. The school considers race in a portion of its applicant decisions. Fisher thought she was rejected because she was white.

## Universities Sometimes Consider Race In Admissions

Like many American universities, UT Austin sometimes considers the race of applicants to boost the attendance of minority groups who have, historically, been discriminated against. The practice is called affirmative action. Some argue that affirmative action helps make sure that college classes include students of all races and helps break the cycle of racism that continues to hold back people of color. Others say that it is a form of racial discrimination.

The Supreme Court heard Fisher's case last Wednesday, provoking many reactions online. On Twitter and Instagram, two social media sites, a popular hashtag emerged: "#StayMadAbby." A hashtag is a label that links together comments on social media sites. 

## Many Critics Unite Via Hashtag

Using the "#StayMadAbby" hashtag, African-American students and graduates have been mocking Fisher for suggesting she deserved to go to UT Austin more than some of the school's African-American students. 

One post included a photo of a group of women in graduation caps and gowns with a caption that read, "Simply amazing, beautiful, intelligent BLACK WOMEN. '#StayMadAbby.'"

Several posts rejected the idea that African-Americans only get into college because of affirmative action. One Twitter user pointed out that his success in college earned him a place in graduate school.

## During Session, Court Appeared To Be Divided

Other comments online cast doubt on Fisher's claim that she was denied admission because of affirmative action. According to a document submitted to the court, of the 47 admitted applicants with grades and test scores lower than Fisher's that year, 42 were white. What's more, 168 African-American and Hispanic applicants with grades and test scores either equal to or better than Fisher's were denied admission.

African-Americans make up 4 percent of UT Austin's freshman class.

Edward Blum is a UT graduate whose nonprofit organization is funding Fisher's lawsuit. He acknowledged that some white students with lower grades than Fisher's were admitted to UT Austin the year she applied. However, he said this did not disprove her claim that she was the victim of discrimination. 

The Supreme Court appeared to be divided last Wednesday as the justices heard arguments from both sides of the case. It was the first time the court revisited affirmative action since 2003. That year, it ruled the University of Michigan's Law School affirmative action policy was legal. 

## Justice Scalia Adds To The Controversy

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia added to the case's controversy on Wednesday when he suggested African-American students who benefit from affirmative action should instead opt for "slower-track" schools. Some thought he was implying that African-American students belong at worse schools.

How the court rules this time will likely not be known for months. If UT Austin's policy is not upheld, the decision has the potential to end affirmative action at colleges and universities across the country.
