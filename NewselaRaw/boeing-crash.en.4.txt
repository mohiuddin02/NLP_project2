LOS ANGELES â€” An airplane crashed at San Francisco International Airport Saturday. The plane was a Boeing 777. Pilots and aircraft experts say it is one of the safest types of planes.

The plane was built by Boeing, a company based in Washington. It rolled out its first 777 to a huge crowd at its factory in 1994. Since then, more than 1,100 have been built. Only one had ever been in a major accident.

Saturday's crash involved an Asiana Airlines flight from South Korea. The accident happened just as the plane touched down on the runway. Two passengers were killed and dozens were injured.

Asiana Airlines is South Korea's second-largest airline. It is ranked as one of the top airlines in the world. The airline has a good reputation for both for service and safety.

## A Small Start

The airline started in 1988 with a single plane flying short hops within South Korea. It now flies 12 Boeing 777-200ER aircraft.

Asiana Airlines' pilots have a reputation for being "cowboys," says one airline expert. Many of the pilots trained in the South Korean military.

Boeing made a statement Saturday after the crash. It expressed its concern about the safety of everyone on board the plane.

"Boeing is preparing to provide technical assistance to the National Transportation Safety Board as it investigates the accident," the statement said. The NTSB investigates all U.S. plane crashes.

The last time passengers were killed on a major U.S. airline was in 2001. An American Airlines flight crashed after taking off from New York in 2001.

Smaller airlines have had crashes since then. The last deadly U.S. crash was a plane flown by Colgan Air . The plane crashed into a house near Buffalo, N.Y., on Feb. 12, 2009, according to the AP. All 49 people on board and one man in the house were killed.

## 777s Fly Long Routes

The Boeing 777 has been seen as one of the safest aircraft in the skies today.

Nearly all of the world's large airlines fly 777s for long routes. It has been a major workhorse for carriers flying from the U.S. to Europe and Asia. More than 1,1000 are in service.

Richard Aboulafia studies flying for the Teal Group Corp. He said the 777 is very reliable.  "With its track record, it's as good as it gets when it comes to aircraft design."

But the 777 does not have a perfect record. In 2008, a British Airways 777 crash-landed in London with 152 on board. Investigators found the plane had lost power. Ice had built up during the flight. The ice stopped fuel from flowing into the engines.

## "Landed Short Of The Runway"

Robert Herbst is a retired American Airlines 767 pilot. He looked at the pictures from Saturday's wreck. The images make him think the Asiana Airlines plane may have had the same engine problem.

"This is very obvious what happened," Herbst said. "They landed short of the runway. They were too low for the flight path and the tail of the aircraft hit the sea wall."

When approaching the runway, Herbst said, "the nose is pretty high up in the air just before touchdown. They weren't high enough and the tail hit the sea wall."

Jet fuel in the wings of the 777 then likely caught fire, said Herbst. He flew commercial airliners for 41 years.

## Plane Had Flown Since 2006

Last May, Boeing told all the airlines with 777s about a problem. A faulty part was causing an automatic shutdown in the 777's engines. General Electric Co. made the engines. In a span of about four months, engines shut down in midflight two separate times.

There were 26 airplanes flying with the GE engines. It was not immediately clear whether Asiana Airlines was one of the affected airlines.

Boeing makes six versions of the twin-engine aircraft. The 777 that crashed in San Francisco was a 777-200ER. It costs around $260 million and made its first passenger flight in 2006.

"It could very easily have the safest record for that size of aircraft," Herbst said.
