### PRO: U.S. should send more troops to fight Islamic State

President Barack Obama has no choice. He will have to become a real war leader. It is the only way to defeat the Islamic State group. He may not like it, but putting troops on the ground is the only way to win this war.

Islamic State's attacks on Paris were horrific. It killed 130 people. Yet the attacks did not change the game. The game changed in 2014 when Islamic State broke out from Syria and defeated the Iraqi army. Now it has declared a country ruled by Islamic law. And it is just starting in those two countries. It plans to take over others.

The group, also known as ISIS, is dangerous. It threatens the United States and its friends.

## Act Before It Gets Worse

ISIS wants its own country in the heart of the Middle East. This will cause war. ISIS is made up of Sunni Muslims. Sunnis take a different view on Islam than Shiites, the other major Muslim group. Most people in Iraq and Iran are Shiites. Therefore, a group like ISIS would cause a conflict in the whole Middle East. Then problems will spill over to Europe. Already refugees are flooding Europe to escape the fighting. At the same time, Russia is dropping bombs on several groups fighting in Syria. The future could be even worse.

The second threat is a worldwide one. Islamic State already has a global reach. It has tens of thousands of foreign fighters. It is skilled at using the Internet and social networking. On top of that, it conquered Iraqi land rich in oil. Now it is the wealthiest extremist group in history.

Since then, the Islamic State has shown it can change. It is combining the terror practices developed by extremist groups over the last 30 years. Nonetheless, what really makes the Islamic State scary is its goals.

To keep up its story as a true Islamic nation, the Islamic State must live up to its image. It must make people think it is a powerful and growing force. The way ISIS is doing that is to take the battle to its enemies. Using terror attacks across national borders shows that it is on the move.

Obama cannot say these dangers are under control. They are happening across Europe now. America is just watching it happen.

Our plan for dealing with the Islamic State group has not been enough. Islamic State has been tough. It has survived months of our weak attempts at bombing.

## Break ISIS Control In Iraq

Russia has now entered the war. It is trying to prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad. It has also created more conflict. Still, it has not driven the Islamic State from Syria. It is true that ISIS has suffered defeats. The ethnic Kurds were able to take back the city of Sinjar. Yet ISIS bounces back every time.

At this point, the United States should not try to solve Syria. As long as Russia and Iran help Assad, he will stick around. Then the war will continue. Groups like ISIS and others will keep fighting him. Moreover, the U.S. just cannot lead in the fight to get the Islamic State everywhere.

But where the United States could lead is in breaking the Islamic State's control of part of Iraq. That is worth doing. Commanding a state is what makes the group a global threat.

Without U.S. participation, the prospects for winning a typical war against ISIS are slim. In a normal war, two military groups fight against each other on a battlefield.

Arab countries cannot fight a typical war against ISIS. They lack the troops, equipment and ability to beat ISIS. The Kurds can win back territory. Beating ISIS is beyond them, though. The Iraqi military is far from ready. Neither Sunnis nor Shiites are ready to risk an all-out war with ISIS. European countries do not have the ability to fight on the ground in the Middle East on their own. They still need the United States standing by their side.

Even if the military defeats ISIS, they will have to keep them from coming back. Iraq is not stable enough right now. Its military cannot fight off future attacks.

This is bad news for President Obama. He boasted of ending the war in Iraq and withdrawing U.S. troops. But the lack of U.S. boots on the ground changed the facts on the ground as well. The Islamic State quickly took advantage of Obama's decision. They moved in when we pulled out troops.

Adding force bit by bit will not work. We've sent in 50 troops here, and done a few airstrikes there. Waiting to send in troops is risky. It could let the Islamic State spread even farther.

### CON: A wider war only repeats past mistakes

The response to the Paris terror attacks should not be more war.

Wanting revenge is understandable. French President Francois Hollande speaks of a war against the Islamic State group. It is just like when U.S. President George W. Bush spoke of a war against al-Qaida right after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States.

A day or two after the Paris attacks, an Islamic State member threatened to do something similar in Washington, D.C. The threat only makes people more concerned. It makes it seem like we must do something immediately to destroy Islamic State, which is also called ISIS.

The problem is that a military effort to destroy the Islamic State is not likely to work. President Barack Obama knows that he cannot promise to destroy the Islamic State quickly. He would fail. Then he would have to eat his words.

## Creating More Enemies

Our wars have gotten us into this fix. Our response to the attacks we suffered on Sept. 11 was military. Our aim in invading Afghanistan in 2001 was to stop terrorism. Unfortunately, we seem only to have created more. We did limit al-Qaida's ability to operate in Afghanistan, but they moved elsewhere. The anger we generated with our war in Afghanistan may have brought even more down on us.

Our invasion of Iraq in 2003 removed the Sunni-led government of Saddam Hussein. We replaced it with a government led by the Shiite majority. The Shiites then carried out revenge attacks against the minority Sunni population of Iraq. The Shiites had suffered under Hussein.

While occupying Iraq, we pushed anyone who had supported Saddam Hussein's government out of their jobs. That left the Sunnis thinking they had no place in the new Iraq. Excluding the Sunnis just led to Sunni groups forming, like the Islamic State.

Rabbi Michael Lerner is an expert on the Middle East. After the Paris attacks, he wrote that the West must not act "only out of self-interest" but also out of an awareness that we are all connected as people. 

He said: "Until the powerful countries of the world are seen as mainly driven by a desire to care for the well-being of everyone else on the planet and the well-being of the planet itself ... what we saw in Paris this past week is destined to be an increasing reality in the coming decades."

## Undercutting Hatred Of The West

The response to the Paris attacks should be to set the West on a path to dealing with the Middle East. We must do so in a way that undermines the anti-Western feelings that lead to the violence we saw on the streets of Paris.

The Paris attacks provide a new reason for the West to take action to undercut the hatred of the West.

One way we can do this is to help solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The lack of a solution for that conflict directly relates to the massacre in Paris.

The support of the Western powers, and particularly the United States, for Israel was a battle cry for Osama bin Laden. He used it to gain followers when he first organized al-Qaida in the 1990s.

The Arab countries were unable to deal with Israel to secure a country for the Palestinians. Bin Laden attracted the youth of the Middle East. He told them that violence was the only way to fight the West and to force Israel to give the Palestinians a country.

Bin Laden successfully played on the view that the United States has been bought off by Israel. Many in the Middle East think the United States let Israel take over Palestinian land. For years, Israel has built settlements of homes on Palestinian land. All the while, the United States has continued to support Israel.

President Obama wisely is not buying into President Hollande's thinking.

Rabbi Lerner's approach shows a greater chance of achieving long-term peace. By changing how we act in the Middle East, we can change the views that have generated terror attacks.
