Holding a bright purple stuffed animal, Emily Whitehead walked the hallways of the U.S. Capitol, urging lawmakers to support the research that saved her life. Her parents, Tom and Kari, of Philipsburg, Pa., were by her side.

The Whiteheads traveled to Washington, D.C. as part of Family Advocacy Day. The once-a-year event was sponsored by the National Association of Children's Hospitals.

Many hospitals from around the country brought patients and their families to the event. Peter Grollman works at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). He explained that it is a day meant to "connect the work we're doing in the hospitals and the funding (or money) the government gives."

One government Institute that Grollman would like legislators to pay attention to is the National Institute of Health. It gives more money for medical research than any other institution in the world. The Institute's mission is to make important discoveries that improve health and save lives.

But earlier this year, legislators forced cuts in spending on government programs called sequestration. That means that the NIH is in trouble because the Institute will not be able to spend as much on research.

## Experimental Treatment Saved Emily

Emily's treatment at CHOP is a prime example of the good that NIH money can do.

In the spring of 2012, [Emily was close to death](http://www.newsela.com/articles/virus-cure/levels/960). She was suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, the most common form of pediatric cancer.

Desperate to save their only child, Kari and Tom decided to enroll Emily in an experimental treatment at CHOP. The treatment involved collecting and removing millions of Emily's T-cells -- a type of white blood cell that is vital to the immune system.

Those T-cells were then genetically engineered by researchers at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania to recognize and attack the cancer cells in her body. Emily's T-cells were infected with a disabled form of the virus that causes AIDS. The virus is called HIV.

"The virus has been engineered so it can't cause disease anymore," Dr. Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania said in the short film _Fire With Fire_. "But it still retains the ability to reprogram the immune system so that it will now attack cancer cells."

Emily became the first child to undergo the treatment. She recently celebrated one year of being cancer-free.

"If those opportunities don't exist to find therapies that save lives, we really find ourselves at a disadvantage," Grollman said.

## Asking For More Funding

The Whitehead family traveled to Washington to push for the government to restore NIH funding. They met with members of Congress from their home state like Representatives Glenn Thompson and Joe Pitts as well as Senators Pat Toomey and Bob Casey.

Forty-five percent of pediatricians and half of pediatric specialists train at children's hospitals, the National Association of Children's Hospitals reports.

Less funding from the NIH and other government organization means less support for these doctors, specialists and researchers. And according to Grollman, there is a shortage of specialists in children's hospitals across the country.

The budget that President Barack Obama proposed this year offers only a third of the past funding. The government cutbacks will require the Institute to cut 5 percent or $1.5 billion of its 2013 budget, the NIH said.

"The bottom line is that when you cut two-thirds of that funding, you're essentially gutting the program," Grollman said.

Casey and Pitts are co-sponsoring the Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2013. The Act, according to Grollman, aims to restore program funding.

The decision is up to the Senate's appropriations committee, a group of Senators that decides how government money should be spent.

## "Children's Champions" Cards

Restoring NIH funding is "very high" on Thompson's list of priorities. He says there are two sides to the issue: the new discoveries developed through medical research and a qualified workforce.

"The big crisis in health care really is having available and qualified trained health care professionals out there," Thompson said.

Thompson said he received two autographed "children's champions" cards from Emily. The cards included her picture and information about her treatment and personality.

One is on his desk. He took the other to the House floor to share with Rep. Jack Kingston, the chairman of a subcommittee which oversees health funding.

Tom Whitehead said that all the lawmakers were supportive of what the family had to say. He added that many of them have been following Emily's progress and were impressed.

Senator Casey shared his own experiences about transplants his father received.

"We had a good day," Tom Whitehead said. His family offered to return to Washington if the congressmen needed an example of the importance of NIH funding.
