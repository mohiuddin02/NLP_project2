NEW YORK, N.Y. — Fewer girls want to be Girl Scouts. Girl Scout leaders want to change that. They hope technology can help. Last year they started a new program. It is called Digital Cookie. Girl Scouts can sell cookies with cellphone apps and online. 

Now the Girl Scouts made the program even better.

It is called Digital Cookie 2.0. It came at a good time. The Girl Scouts is 103 years old. It is called Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA).

## Technology Brought Changes

The Girl Scouts is also having money troubles. Companies and people are giving less money. The Girl Scouts is a charity. It depends on people giving it money. 

Anna Maria Chavez is the head of Girl Scouts. Technology will make the group strong again, she says.

Technology has already changed things. Now girls can join online. Troop leaders can plan meetings and activities online, too.

Girls Scouts walk around to sell cookies. They knock on doors. They sell cookies near stores. Now they can sell cookies online, too. 

## Online Games Teach Skills

The new Digital Cookie helps them. It is educational.

An online game called Cookie Booth Bounce is fun, too. It helps girls make good choices. They learn how to save money. Girls can post videos. They can share ideas.

Claire Houston likes Digital Cookie. She is 18. She was a Girl Scout for 13 years. Now Claire goes to college. She runs a Girl Scout robotics team, too.

Technology is a big part of our lives, Claire says. It is important for the Girl Scouts to keep up.
