Lawmakers and clothing chains are taking a long, hard look at the human cost of cheap clothes after a deadly building collapse in Bangladesh.

The eight-story Rana Plaza factory complex crumbled on April 24 with nearly 3,000 workers trapped inside. More than 1,100 were killed. It is the garment industry's worst-ever accident and reports from the disaster area have been dramatic.

A baby boy was born under the rubble shortly after the collapse. The baby's 26-year-old mother survived the falling concrete, mortar and bricks. Rescuers found the newborn with his umbilical cord still attached.

Another worker, Sonia Akthar, was sewing a shirt when the ceiling collapsed on her, Al-Jazeera reported. Her leg became trapped under heavy concrete, and rescuers were forced to take off her leg to save her. Other workers were luckier, and acted heroically to save others. When a doctor was too scared to go into the wrecked building, 30-year-old worker Didar Hossein went in on his own. Using the doctor's tools, he amputated limbs to save workers who were pinned under rubble. Nineteen-year-old Reshma Begum survived 17 days in the rubble with nothing but four packets of cookies and a little water.

The building owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was arrested trying to flee the country. He is a local politician, but was also well known as a neighborhood gangster. Police, engineers and workers themselves warned him that the building's pillars were near breaking. Rana reportedly ordered workers back inside the factory. The building crumbled the next day.

On Tuesday, survivors of the collapse protested near the factory site. They blocked traffic demanding wages and benefits. The government has agreed to improve factory conditions and its building inspections. But labor experts say the government is part of the problem. Factory owners have been able to pay Bangladeshi officials to look the other way and ignore safety hazards.

## Living On Less Than $1 A Day

Bangladesh could not survive without garment factories. It is the world's second-largest clothing producer, after China. Roughly 80 percent of the goods Bangladesh sells to the world are clothes. Almost half the population of 150 million lives on less than $1 a day. The factory industry has provided many much-needed jobs, especially for women. But about half of the nation's factories are unsafe, said Kalpona Akter, a workers' rights activist. Akter started working in garment factories at age 12.

Workers at the factory were sewing clothes destined for Canadian and European stores when it collapsed. Western companies choose Bangladesh for its low wages and fast production. But the cheap cost and quick delivery comes at a human cost: factories often use child workers, and forced pregnant women to work until just before their due dates.

The European Union is one of Bangladesh's biggest customers. The EU said it was considering taking action against local producers. It wants to force them to obey building safety codes. Target, Gap and J.C. Penney met with workers rights groups last week to discuss safety conditions. Adidas said it set up a hotline for workers. They can send a text message to report abuse. But some do not believe that Western brands will help, since they are the ones demanding quick, cheap production from the factories.

"How can a garment businessman keep up with this ever-increasing demand?" said Shahidullah Azim, a representative for Bangladeshi garment factories. "By using every opportunity to minimize production costs -- paying workers less and not caring about workplace safety." He suggests that it is the big clothing chains that should agree to pay higher prices to cover the cost of the safety improvements at the factories.

## "Deafening Silence" From Brands

One Canadian retailer took the opportunity to blast his competitors. "I am troubled by the deafening silence from other apparel retailers on this issue," said Galen Weston, the chairman of Loblaw, a Canadian company that used the Rana Plaza factory to make its clothes. Loblaw promised to donate money to the victims.

The government has so far detained nine more people for questioning. On May 1, workers rallied in the capital city, Dhaka. They called for Mohammad Sohel Rana to be put to death. There are rumors the construction workers built the factory with shoddy materials and cut safety corners because they knew Rana would not pay for them. Rana's case may show other factory owners that they are responsible for what happens in their buildings.

Consumer boycotts could also help. Customers shopping for budget fashions may not be able to forget the image of the crushed workers when they see a "Made in Bangladesh" label.  However, with hundreds of bodies still being pulled from the rubble, the Bangladeshi workers themselves may demand change. One woman who came to lay flowers on the unmarked graves told Al-Jazeera that "garment factories are prisons, they are like hell. I will never work in one again."
