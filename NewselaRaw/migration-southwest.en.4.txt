The U.S. Census Bureau is a government group. Every 10 years, it counts the number of people who live in this country. This year in 2016, the Census Bureau is giving an estimate halfway through the 2010-2020 decade. The bureau says that between 2014 and 2015, more than 1 million people moved to the South. This part of the country is also called the Sun Belt because the weather is often sunny. It includes 16 states and the District of Columbia. 

During this time,13 states in the western part of the country also grew quickly. The states added just under 1 million people. 

People moved to the South for many years before the Great Recession. This was a period between 2007 and 2009 when the U.S. economy was weak. Many people could not find jobs and had less money. Now the economy is better. People are moving south and west again.

## More Residents Leaving Snow Belt

There are fewer people moving to the Northeast and the Midwest. This part of the country includes the Snow Belt, an area that gets plenty of snow. The number of people who live there did not grow much after the recession.   

Americans are more willing to move now than they were during the recession. At that time, the Census Bureau said many people were unwilling to move. It said only 1 in 5 people who wanted to move somewhere else did so. 

## Looking For Jobs, Cheaper Homes 

Two out of three of the people who made long-distance moves between 2014 and 2015 were looking for jobs. They were also looking for housing they could afford. One-fourth of the people moved for family reasons. 

From 2014 to 2015, more people moved to Texas than any other state. Georgia, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon and Utah also did well. Some of these states are in the Sun Belt while others are in the western part of the country.

In West Virginia, thousands of people moved away. Many did not have work. They wanted to find jobs in other states. People also moved away from Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico and Vermont.

## A Change In Representatives

The number of people in a state is important for government. The number affects how many lawmakers a state has in Congress. Each state sends a certain number of representatives to work in Washington, D.C. The representatives work on issues important for the people in their states.

Texas could gain three new lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives. Florida could gain two, while Oregon could gain one. Some states like West Virginia will lose a representative in Congress.

## Heading North To Oregon

In Oregon, many young people are moving to Portland. The city has many jobs in technology. Josh Lehner does research for Oregon. He says there is not enough housing for all of the people who want to live here. 

Many of the people moving to Oregon are from California. They leave because housing in California is expensive. 

John Malson studies people and where they live for the state of California. He says some people do not want to move to California because housing is so expensive.  

California has many jobs in technology so it attracts many people. "But it's very expensive to live in California," Malson said.
