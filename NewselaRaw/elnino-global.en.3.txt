A fog of thick smoke covers the Indonesian countryside, making hundreds of thousands of people sick. The air is not safe to breathe. The fog has become a health emergency. 

In Peru, officials say they cannot have the Dakar Rally. People from all over the world come to this cross-country car race. Now they cannot have the race because of the coming heavy rains and floods.

In Ethiopia, crops die for lack of rain. United Nations officials warn that soon there will be a dangerous lack of food. 

These problems and more can be traced to a weather event known as El Nino. 

## Californians Eager For El Nino

People in California look forward to an El Nino this winter. They want the rains to end their long drought, or dry spell. Yet most of the world fears this climate event. 

El Nino was named by some fishermen in South America. Before people knew that El Nino was a worldwide event, fishermen in Peru and Ecuador noticed the warm currents that sometimes arrived around Christmas. The warm water seemed to drive fish away. The fishermen called this event El Nino, Spanish for "the child." They were thinking of the birth of Christ.

Periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean has happened for thousands of years. Scientists only recently discovered how it affects the world, though.

Normally, the hottest ocean surface temperatures in the world are in the western Pacific, near Indonesia. That changes during an El Nino. The warm waters slide east. Warm waters produce rain and storms. The storms get energy from the hot water. Conditions are now right for large storms to happen.

## Altering Wind And Rain Patterns

When these waters move east, it changes the path of strong jet streams. Jet streams are fast winds high above the Earth. Changes in the currents make seasonal weather patterns change.  

Seasonal rains might not come as expected to parts of India, Africa and Southeast Asia. Crops die and wildfires begin. In parts of North and South America, pounding storms roll over the land.

In Southern California, El Nino is known for heavy rain and overflowing rivers. Yet El Nino may also move rain away from dry farm fields that need water. 

Farms failed because of the dry weather in India and China in the late 1800s. There was very little food and people starved. 

## U.N. Says We Are Better Prepared Than Ever

Today, U.N. officials say the world is better prepared than ever to deal with the effects of El Nino. They still warn that 11 million children are at risk from hunger, disease and lack of water in eastern and southern Africa alone.

Drought causes other dangers. In Indonesia, companies sometimes cut down plants and light fires to clear farm land. Because of the dry, hot weather from El Nino, the fires can quickly spread. These huge fires, which have happened during every El Nino since 1982, have made hundreds of thousands of people sick.

## Effects Spread, Cause Health Concerns

Drought and flooding caused by El Nino can have other health effects. Diseases like cholera and typhoid spread where floodwaters pick up dirt and garbage.

Warming Pacific waters can also cause an increase in hurricanes. Scientists think El Nino was one reason that Hurricane Patricia happened. It was one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded.

Scientists also believe that El Ninos can hurt coral reefs around the world. Coral reefs are ridges in the ocean made of the hard bodies of living and dead coral sea creatures. Coral is important to the balance of life in the ocean. Temperature changes can cause coral reefs to release their coating of algae. Algae are plants that grow mostly in water. Corals get their food from algae. Without algae, the coral reefs turn white and can die.
