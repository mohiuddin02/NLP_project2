High school senior Jake Olson is completely blind. Amazingly, he is also an excellent long snapper. In football, a long snapper is responsible for passing the ball backward to a player behind him at the start of a play. Behind him, another player kicks the ball toward the goal post, trying to score an extra point or a field goal.

Olson was recently accepted to the University of Southern California (USC). Sometime in the next four years he may trot onto the field during a USC Trojans football game. He will then be guided by a USC teammate to the ball as the teams get ready for a new play.

## Taking It To The Next Level

The holder will line up Olson's hips, then turn and kneel seven yards behind him. He will yell a cue, and Olson will hike the ball back in a tight spiral.

The play must be perfect, but if all goes well, it will end in a field goal.

If that scenario seems unlikely, well, you don't know Jake Olson.

## Losing His Sight ...

Olson lost his left eye to cancer at 10 months. He was 12 when doctors decided his right eye also would need to be removed.

By then, Olson had become a devoted football fan and a big supporter of the USC Trojans. He decided he wanted to spend as much time as possible watching the Trojans play before he lost his sight. The Trojan's head coach heard about Olson and invited him to come visit the team.

Olson caught several games and spent his last day with sight at a Trojans practice. His courage and positive attitude greatly inspired many of the USC players.

During his first two years as Orange Lutheran High School, Olson sat in the stands during football games. The whole time, he longed to play the sport he loved.

## ... But Finding A Way

Olson began thinking that there might be a way he could play football. He could become a long snapper, the only position that does not require a player to see the ball or the other players.

Olson's mother was not happy about the idea, as she feared he might be turned down — or injured.

Nonetheless, near the end of 2012 Olson sought out Orange Lutheran Coach Chuck Petersen and asked if he could join the team. Petersen told him to return after the team finished out that season.

"I didn't want to kill the kid's spirit, so I just said 'Oh, OK'… and thought I'll probably never hear about this again,'" Petersen said.

Olson showed up in the spring and again asked for a chance to play.

## "We Saw Him As A Football Player"

"I told Jake, 'You of all people don't want this to be a charity case — you're going to have to earn your spot,'" Petersen said.

Progress was slow at first, particularly because Olson could not be shown how to throw the ball. However, Olson practiced relentlessly and over time his snaps improved enormously. He eventually became the team's first-choice long snapper and won the starting position.

Teammates would guide Olson onto the field and help him line up with the ball, but he otherwise performed as any other player.

"We didn't see him as a blind person — we saw him as a football player," kicker Jerry Fitschen said.

## "This Is Pretty Cool"

Olson experienced an unforgettable moment last season against Servite High in Anaheim. Orange Lutheran were way behind but fought back to within three points, bringing the score to 25–22.

With a few minutes left, Olson came on for the snap for a field-goal attempt. He lined up and experienced something for the first time: In a stadium filled with the noise of a spirited crowd, "everything kind of got quieter," he said. He recalled thinking, "Well this is pretty cool."

The snap, hold and kick were perfect, and Orange Lutheran tied the score.

## His Dream Team: The USC Trojans

Olson is very much looking forward to attending USC, home of his football favorites. He has not been picked to be a team member, but he may join the program as a walk-on.

Steve Sarkisian, USC's football coach, said he would not be surprised if a movie were made about Olson's journey.

Contributing to an extra point or field goal for the Trojans could be part of the story.

"Someday, he's going to snap in a game for us," Sarkisian said. "When? I don't know — but it will happen."

He added, "When that day comes, it will be awesome."

Olson is not expecting special treatment.

All he wants, he said, is "the opportunity to prove myself like anyone else."
