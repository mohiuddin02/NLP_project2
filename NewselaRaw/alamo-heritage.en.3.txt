BONN, Germany â€” The United Nations has honored "The Alamo." This week, it announced that the famous building is now a world heritage site. The word "site" means place. Heritage is something important enough to be remembered and passed down.

The United Nations (U.N.) is a government group that has many member countries. The U.N. said recently that The Alamo is important to world history. The Alamo is now officially a place worth preserving and protecting for all time.

The Alamo is one of a group of five Spanish Roman Catholic churches located in Texas. Together they are known as the San Antonio Missions. All five missions were selected by the United Nations. All are now world heritage sites.

## Missions Shaped Texas History

The Missions were built in the 1700s. They are located in what is now the city of San Antonio.

Each Mission was made up of a church and a few other buildings around it. They were built to introduce Native Americans to Christianity. Native American, Spanish and Mexican ways of living all shaped the Missions.

The Alamo is the best known of the Missions. A famous battle took place there in 1836. A small band of Texas settlers were attacked by Mexican soldiers. The settlers were greatly outnumbered but fought bravely. In the end, they fell to General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and his Mexican forces. The settlers' courage has been honored ever since by the words, "Remember the Alamo!"

## Japan's Industrial Sites Make The List

It's not only the United States that has new heritage sites this year. Japan does as well.

The U.N. selected a group of Japanese sites. Together, they help show what happened in the country during the 1800s. During that period Japan quickly modernized. It built new machines and ships that made it as strong as Europe and the United States.

A disagreement had to be settled before the new Japanese sites could be announced. The disagreement was between South Korea and Japan. South Korea said their citizens were forced to work at the Japanese sites. The Koreans were taken prisoner in the 1940s during World War II. They were made to work long hours under terrible conditions.

South Korea said Japan should admit what happened at the sites. The world should know the truth. Only then would South Korea support the sites' being named world heritage sites.

Japan finally admitted that the forced work did happen. The Korean workers' suffering will now be part of the story.

## Other World Sites Also Chosen

The United Nations also picked other new world heritage sites. One is Mongolia's Great Burkhan Khaldun Mountain. Many believe the mountain is the place where Genghis Khan was born and buried. Genghis Khan was a fierce Mongolian warrior. During the 1200s he conquered many countries.

Jamaica's Blue and John Crow Mountains were also selected. They are the country's first world heritage site.

Jamaica was once controlled by the British. Before 1834 there were many African slaves on the island. Slaves who escaped from their owners often hid in the mountains. Up there they were able to live freely. Many Indians too found a home in the mountains. Today, many rare plants and animals can still be found up there.
