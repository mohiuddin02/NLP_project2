Ann Neagle was shopping at the only real grocery store within 30 miles of her home. She paused before a bag of Red Delicious apples, which cost $7 per dozen.  But the apples were discounted. The Navajo Nation, which governs the Navajo Indian tribe, had lifted the 5 percent sales tax on fresh fruits and vegetables.

It's part of the tribe's attempt to encourage people to eat healthier food. Too many Navajo are overweight, and diabetes and heart disease are big problems. The tribe is also planning to put a 2 percent tax on junk food. Leaders hope the tax will encourage healthier eating. They plan to use money raised from the tax to fund things like vegetable gardens and exercise equipment.

## Healthy Food Is Expensive

That tax, the first of its kind nationwide, will hit one of the poorest areas of the country, where more than 40 percent of people are unemployed. Neagle is worried.

"Less money for fruits is nice, but it doesn't even out," she said. "For people on a fixed income, we can't afford things to get more expensive."

Neagle is not alone. About 42 percent of the Navajo Nation live in poverty. The U.S. government has declared parts of the vast reservation a "food desert," which means it's difficult to find affordable or good quality fresh food.  For many in the tribe, limited income and few stores to choose from mean gas stations and convenience stores are their primary grocers.

For the $7 she could spend on a dozen apples, Neagle, 54, could stretch her money further by purchasing prepared and processed foods. Seven dollars would buy more than 30 boxes of ramen noodles or seven frozen dinners.  But those meals wouldn't be very healthy.

## Is Soda Junk Food?

Like Neagle, many people across the country face similar problems. But a health crisis among the Navajo reservation's 175,000 residents moved lawmakers here to give the junk food tax a try.

The tribe hasn't set a date for the tax to go into effect. A tribal tax commission still has to give its final approval, but no one expects that to be a problem.

It has not been easy to decide what food should be taxed as junk food. Tribal council members said the soft drink industry urged them to keep soda and sports drinks out of the legislation.

They resisted, and now those drinks are known as "minimal-to-no nutritional value food." Other items on the list include frozen desserts, fried food, potato chips and candy.

## "I'll Still Buy Chips"

"It's not going to do anything except make it more expensive," said Preston Yazzie, 20. "I'll still buy chips or whatever. But maybe it'll help some people."

One mile from where Navajo government leaders work, Bashas' Grocery sits on tribal land. Most of the items in the front of the store, and the items that are advertised in a weekly newspaper, would be subject to the new tax.

Racks of canned Vienna sausage and corned beef hash greeted shoppers. Behind them was a huge selection of sodas, such as Coke and Pepsi, and discount brands like Fiesta, which would all be taxed. The rest of the store was similar to a typical grocery layout, though processed items such as chicken nuggets appeared in the meat aisle.

Shoppers "go crazy for those hot Cheetos," a grocery clerk said.

## The Power Of Healthy Eating

Still, many local residents do seem to understand what's going on. A Navajo Nation survey found 74 percent of people on the reservation think health problems are caused by a lack of healthy food.

Legislator Jonathan Nez knows firsthand about the power of healthy eating.  Four years ago, he weighed 300 pounds and ate a junk-filled diet.

He started eating healthy and lost weight.  He also rides his bike and runs, two activities almost unimaginable to him in 2010.

"If they put this tax in front of me then, I probably would have opposed it," Nez said with a laugh. "I know I would have."

## "We'll Get There"

"It's a long haul," he said.  "But we'll get there."

To understand how the Navajo Nation found itself in a health crisis, it's important to understand its relationship with food.

Navajo society used to depend on farming, a fact reflected in the story of the tribe's beginning. The legend goes: Starving people from another world were met by a turkey, who shook out four corn kernels from beneath its wings. The kernels saved the people from hunger.

Navajo society relied on sheep and cattle, as well as corn. Then, in the 1920s and '30s, the U.S. government began setting limits on livestock, explained at the time as a way to preserve eroding and overgrazed soil.

## Funding For Vegetable Gardens?

On the reservation, just 7 percent of residents graduated college, making it significantly harder for them to get a job.

Supporters of the junk food tax hope it will mark a turning point for the country's largest tribe. Money will go into a community health fund to pay for physical improvements on the reservation and educational programming.

The money might also be spent on farmers markets and vegetable gardens. Or it could be used to buy exercise equipment, community food groups and health and sports clubs for kids.
