Scientists are coming up with ways to use DNA to help protect people from diseases in food. They are also aiming to make sure the food we buy is what it is supposed to be.

Foodborne illnesses sicken 48 million Americans every year. About 128,000 people end up in the hospital and 3,000 die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Food fraud is also increasing. In 2014, Oceana, an international conservation group, published a study that found that one-third of the fish it sampled was not labeled properly.

That could soon change.

## Where Did It Come From?

Scientists worldwide are working to create databases of tiny living things found in food. They are also trying to map, or sequence, the most common bacteria or other tiny disease-causers called pathogens. Scientists have been coming up with ways to use DNA to tag food so it can be traced back to the source. The new methods promise to speed investigations and reduce foodborne illnesses and deaths. They could also spot fake food.

Genome Trakr is one project. It is a collaboration of the University of California, Davis; the company Agilent Technologies, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The program promises to sequence the genetic material of 100,000 types of pathogens spread through food.

The technology maps the DNA sequence. It allows scientists to distinguish one type of microbe, or tiny living thing, from another. This can allow earlier elimination of outbreaks around the world. The database will be available online and for free to researchers and public health officials. The program will make it possible to pick out different strains of a microbe that cannot be told apart any other way. This will let scientists trace back a small outbreak before it spreads all over.

## Food Detectives

Right now that kind of trace-back is difficult without detailed information about people becoming sick. A recent study from Cornell University suggests the new technology will be faster and more effective. Using whole genome sequencing, researchers were able to find double the number of cases in a 2010 outbreak of salmonella at a medical center in New York City.

Whole genome sequencing has already helped stop serious food outbreaks. In 2012, researchers picked out salmonella in tuna sushi that made 258 people sick. The salmonella was tracked to a processing plant in India. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigated the plant and found 10 cleanliness problems.

The gigantic Genome Trakr database should speed up this kind of detective work. It would provide an enormous volume of information that has already been analyzed. "We've just extended the project to China, and they will map another 10,000 genomes and deposit them," the project's director, Bart Weimer, said. The group also has other global partnerships in the works.

## The Bar Code Of Life

Sequencing a whole genome is only one of the new approaches to food safety. Food fraud prevention is also benefiting from a large project called the International Barcode of Life (iBOL). The project is building a genetic library of all life on Earth. It offers a global online database of DNA labels. The labels are sort of like the bar codes on food packaging.

The project has already created more than 2.6 million bar-code records. Those cover almost 200,000 species of plants and animals. The project hopes to reach 500,000 by the end of 2015. The iBOL can already tell the difference between wild salmon and salmon raised on farms because they are two different species.

A 2015 report from the CDC used bar coding to identify imported poisonous puffer fish. The fish were being sold in the United States as nonpoisonous varieties.

## An App For That

Finally, inspired by the bar-coding idea, one new company, DNATrek, is creating bar codes for food items. It uses DNA from plants to make an odorless, colorless and tasteless material that can be mixed with waxes and oils already used on foods like oranges or apples. It is sprayed on food. The DNA sequences are like invisible bar codes and can be applied at different points where food is moved: the farm, the distributor, the packer and even the seller.

"When an outbreak occurs," company founder Anthony Zografos said, the tags can be read in about 20 minutes. The food can then be traced back to where it came from immediately, not in weeks or months like before, he said.

Zografos believes that cellphones may one day have apps that can actually spot bacteria or viruses. Then we can hold our phones over our food to make sure we know exactly what we are eating.
