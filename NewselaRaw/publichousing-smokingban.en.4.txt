NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” The government is taking a stand on smoking. They want to ban smoking in all public housing in the United States.

Some people like the idea. Others do not want the government telling them what they can do inside their homes.

Public housing buildings are owned by the federal government. Families that do not earn much money can live there. They pay only part of the rent. The government pays the rest. Smoking is already not allowed in some of these buildings. Now the ban may come to all of the buildings in the country.

"I would not like that. And other residents wouldn't like that, either," said Dana Jones. She is a smoker in Atlanta. Jones did say it would probably help her break the habit.

## Making Buildings Safer

A government agency manages the buildings. It is the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The policy would protect more than 760,000 children, HUD said. It would save about $153 million a year. That is the cost of health care, repairs and fires from smoking.

The rule covers cigarettes, cigars and pipes. There would be no smoking in homes. Indoor common areas and offices are also off limits. No smoking within 25 feet of the building, either.

HUD thinks the rule could have a big impact. It could make buildings safer for everyone.

Luis Torres does not support the idea. He is 64 years old. Torres has lived in New York public housing for 44 years. He does not want to be told what to do inside his own home.

"That's private. You can do everything you want in your apartment," Torres said.

Philip Morris USA is a cigarette company. It talked about people who own their own homes. They should be able to make the rules about smoking in the house, the company said.
