NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” Workers for restaurants like McDonald's and Taco Bell spoke up on Tuesday. They protested in front of restaurants all over the country. Protestors held signs and gave speeches.

The workers came to demand a raise. Restaurant owners should pay them at least $15 an hour, they said.

Tuesday's protests were not just about restaurants, though. They were part of a larger fight called the "Fight for $15."

Supporters want many kinds of workers to be paid more. They want the national minimum wage raised to $15 an hour.

## Protesters Have Message For Politicians

A minimum wage is the least amount of money an hour a boss can pay workers. Anything less is against the law.

Right now, the national minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.

The raise restaurant workers hope to get would not be only for them. Anyone making less than $15 an hour would get a raise too.

Tuesday's protests were not just aimed at bosses. Protestors also had a message for the people who are running for president. Support our cause or we will not vote for you, they said.

## Presidential Candidates React To News

Voters will pick the next president in November of 2016. They will choose between a Democrat and a Republican. Democrats and Republicans are this country's two main political groups. Each group is known as a party.

Right now, many Democrats and Republicans are running. In the end, one person from each party will be picked.

On Tuesday two candidates said they do support the "Fight for $15." The two are Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Both are Democrats. Sanders also showed up at a protest in Washington.

The protests Tuesday took place in more than 270 cities.

## "Fight For 15"Or Else, Worker Says

Dominique McCrae joined a protest outside a McDonald's in Durham, North Carolina. McCrae is 23. She serves fried chicken and biscuits at a Bojangles' restaurant. She is paid $7.55 an hour.

McCrae said she dropped out of school to care for her grandfather. She began working at Bojangles two months ago. Her pay is not enough to take care of her child and pay her rent, she said.

"We just want to be able to support our families," said McCrae.

Adriana Alvarez works for McDonald's. She will vote for the first time next year. However, she will only vote for a candidate who will "Fight for 15," she said.

## Experts Disagree About Minimum Wage

Alvarez is 23 and lives in Chicago. She makes $10.50 an hour. Higher pay would help her move out of the moldy basement apartment she shares with her young son, she said.

"I can find a better place," she said.

Most restaurant workers earn about $11.51 an hour. Fast-food restaurants often pay far less.

Some experts say raising the minimum wage is not a good idea. They think a big raise would hurt workers. Bosses would not be able to afford to give everyone more pay, they say. They would have to get rid of some workers.

## Workers Need Pay For Families, Some Say

Other experts do not agree. They say raising the minimum would help workers and their families a lot.

In New York on Tuesday, a few hundred people gathered outside a restaurant. The protestors cheered and clapped.

Some protesters were not restaurant workers. Liz Henry works at a hospital. She said she makes more than $15 an hour. However, she supports the fight for other workers.

"Even what I'm making right now is not even enough," she says. "How do they really get by? It's hard."
