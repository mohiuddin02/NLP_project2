LONDON, England â€” Britain now has a baking champion, and her name is Nadiya Hussain. This week, Hussain won the "The Great British Bake Off," a baking contest on television. For her fans, Hussain is not only a great baker. She is also helping to bring people of different backgrounds together.

Hussain is not originally from Britain. She was born in Bangladesh, a small country next to India. In this way, she is like many British people. Over the last few years, hundreds of thousands of people have moved to the country from all over the world. People like Hussain who move to other countries are called immigrants. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Britain_Baking_Sensat_Edit.jpg" />

Hussain lives in a city in northern England called Leeds. She is a 30-year-old student and is the mother of three children.

## One Of The Best Moments Of Her Life

On Wednesday, Hussain beat two other bakers to become this year's "Bake Off" winner. Afterward, she said that winning the show was one of the best moments of her life.

During her time on the show, Hussain gained many fans. Millions of viewers watched her bake each week. Her final show was watched by 13.4 million people. Her victory was celebrated across Britain.

For many, Hussain is not just a television baker. She also represents immigrants in Britain. Immigrants have changed Britain. Now, neighbors in Britain are more likely to come from different backgrounds. Many come from different parts of the world. At the same time, many immigrants in Britain see themselves as British. They become part of the country, even if they are not from there originally.

## An Example Of Being Different But Also The Same

Many people in Britain see Hussain as a great example of how immigrants in Britain are both different and the same as everyone else. She is originally from Bangladesh and is a proud Muslim woman. She is famous, though, for baking traditional British treats. Her winning cake was draped in the colors of the British flag.

One fan of "Bake Off" is David Cameron, the leader of the British government. He is the prime minister. In a speech on Wednesday, he predicted that Hussain would win. He also said that Britain was proud to have people of so many different backgrounds.

Not everyone in Britain is happy about immigrants, however. For example, an anti-immigrant government group called the U.K. Independence Party has become popular. The group's popularity shows that many people in England think too many immigrants are coming to Britain. This week, a government leader named Theresa May said that more immigrants would make Britain less unified.

Hussain, though, has been bringing people in Britain together.

## Show's Popularity A Little Surprising

It is somewhat surprising that "Bake Off" has become so popular. It is different than most shows on television. It is simple and old-fashioned. It was not popular from the start, but it has become very popular. In the first season, about 3 million viewers tuned in. It just completed its fifth season. It now draws an average of 10 million viewers.

After the show each week, people write about "Bake Off" on Facebook and Twitter. The show has even made baking more popular. Sales of baking books and cake pans have soared.

Josh Abrams is a professor. Food is one of the things he studies. He thinks that part of why "Bake Off" is so popular is that it is old-fashioned. He said that it reminds viewers of simpler times in the past.

For many viewers, meanwhile, Hussain is an example of Britain's present and its future.
