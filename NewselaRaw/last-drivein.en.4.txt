POWELL, Wyo. —  Pokey Heny is the owner of Wyoming's last drive-in theater. As cars arrive there, she is ready for another night of entertainment in this small town.

Heny, 52, collects $15 from each vehicle. She greets people by their first name. She tells a 4-year-old girl she likes her stuffed hippo. A mother and daughter roll up in an old truck. Heny lets them in for 10 bucks.

Then she looks out toward the big screen. She sees families on top of cars, in lawn chairs and the backs of trucks. And she smiles. She knows she's helping to save something important in this town. Powell is a town of ranchers and has just 6,000 people.

Heny's business opened as Wyoming's first drive-in theater in 1949. But, the future of the theater is in the dark. Hollywood movie studios want to make much more money. And this year, they are switching to digital movies. Old movies had film on rolls that were put onto projectors. Film movies are being replaced by digital at drive-ins across the country. Heny had to buy a digital projector or close down.

## Last Screen Standing In State

So, she bought a digital projector for $80,000. That same amount is what she paid for the whole theater in 2004.

But Heny sticks by her bet. She's putting money into the town's future, she says. "So many businesses have closed, the bowling alley and video store. If I let this one go, it wasn't ever coming back."

Drive-ins have been failing for years. They were popular in the 1950s. Since then, nine-tenths have closed. There were once 4,063 in the U.S. Now, there are just 350, says Kipp Sherer, who tracks the drive-in business for the website Drive-ins.com. Today, Alaska, Delaware and Louisiana have no drive-ins. Maryland, Rhode Island and Mississippi each have one. Wyoming once had 30. Now just Heny's is left.

Sherer says that for small towns it's one of the last places "where families can watch a movie and be themselves." It's a cheap evening out "that doesn't break the bank."

## Tonight's Feature Flick

Heny wants to keep it that way. Though she switched to digital, she tries to keep everything else as it was when she was a child. She plays only family movies. She won't show horror flicks because she doesn't want people driving past to be scared.

At the start of the movie "Monsters University," a crowd waits outside the snack bar. Candy and pickles on a stick are for sale. There's bug spray to scare off mosquitoes.

Suddenly, sound comes out of old speakers that stand next to parking spaces. Next, two girls tell customers to turn on a radio station for sound. Some nights, groups of 6-year-olds hang outside the projector shack. They make shadow puppets with their hands in the light from the projector. "Just kids being kids," Heny says.

The nation's first outdoor movie theater opened in New Jersey. In 1933, a man put a projector on top of his car. The screen was nailed to two trees. A radio played the sound.

## Last One To Leave

Years later, the theater in Wyoming opened. It was first called Paul's Drive-in, because a man named Paul started it. Besides movies, it offered pony rides in an old hay field and boat rides in a small pond. The theater charged 50 cents for grownups and 9 cents for children during the 1950s.

In the 1970s, its name changed to the Vali Drive-in. The theater was the center of Powell's social life for teens. "The girls came here because this is where the boys were," said Diana, Heny's sister. Diana worked the snack bar as a teen. She now helps Heny run the business. "I met guys — that's why I worked here."

Then Heny took it over. In 2004, she changed the name to the American Dream Drive-in. "It really is the American dream to be your own boss," she said. "And there aren't that many female small-business owners in Wyoming." Most weekends she earns $3,000 which includes money made at the snack bar.

Like most nights, she's the last to leave, switching off the marquee out by the mural of the American flag. For a moment, she stands there, watching the lights dim on Wyoming's last drive-in theater.
