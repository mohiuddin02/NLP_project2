CHICAGO, Ill. — Cancer is a terrible disease. It kills many people every year. Cancer cells can spread through a person's body without stopping.

Cells are so small they cannot be seen, but there are trillions inside each person's body. Everything in the body is made up of cells.

Cancer starts when cells are hurt. The damaged cells start to grow like crazy. The cells then form into lumps. They are called tumors.

When there are too many tumors inside the body, people can die.

## Bigger Animals, But Smaller Cancer Rates

Big animals have more cells than small animals do. It might seem like they would get cancer more often than smaller animals. Surprisingly, that is not true.

Elephants have many more cells in their giant bodies than humans do. Still, they get cancer much less often than people.

One out of every 4 people dies of cancer. Only about 1 in 20 elephants dies of the disease. No one has ever been sure why this is so.

Now scientists think they have found the reason. It has to do with a gene called p53. Genes are inside cells. They control the way cells act.

## One Cancer-Fighting Gene Per Cell For Humans — 20 For Elephants

There are many different kinds of genes. Scientists believe the one called p53 helps the body fight cancer.

People have one p53 gene in each cell. Scientists have just discovered that elephants have many more than that. They believe the extra genes help protect elephants from cancer.

The new discovery was made by two teams of scientists.

Doctor Joshua Schiffman led one of the two teams. He and his team took a bit of blood from eight elephants, without hurting them. The elephants belong to a circus and a zoo.

Each bit of blood was full of living cells. By using special machines the scientists were able to see inside the cells.

Schiffman's team found that elephant cells have 20 copies of the p53 gene. Human cells have only one.

## Damaged Elephant Cells Behave Differently

Schiffman also looked at how elephant cells behave when they are damaged. He and his team used radiation to hurt the cells. Radiation is very strong energy we cannot see. The damage it causes can lead to cancer.

The body has two ways of protecting itself against cancer. Damaged cells can repair themselves. They can also destroy themselves. If neither thing happens, the cells start to grow uncontrollably. The cancer can then spread through the body.

Schiffman and his team studied both elephant cells and human cells. Both were zapped with radiation. They wanted to see if there were differences in how the two kinds of cells behaved.

The elephant and human cells behaved very differently. The damaged elephant cells destroyed themselves twice as often as the human cells. By killing themselves, the elephant cells stopped cancer from spreading.

## Scientists Hope To Develop New Medicines For Humans

The second group of scientists looked at more than 60 other animals besides elephants. They found that only elephants have extra copies of p53. The rest have only one copy in each cell, just like people.

The second team also put elephants' p53 genes into mouse cells. They found that those cells then behaved just like elephant cells. They destroyed themselves when they were damaged.

Schiffman's team hopes to use its discovery to come up with new medicines for people. The idea is to find a medicine that will make human cells behave more like elephant cells. If they succeed, maybe then doctors will be able to beat cancer.
