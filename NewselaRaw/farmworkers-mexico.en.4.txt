SAN QUINTIN, Mexico â€” Veronica Zaragoza grew up picking berries and tomatoes in Mexico. Farming there has changed a lot. However, she has been getting paid the same amount of money for years.

Technology increased the amount of fruits and vegetables that farmworkers, like Zaragoza, could harvest. New greenhouses have been built to grow vegetables indoors. The fields are now watered by irrigation lines. They move water across the fields.

Still, Zaragoza earns only 110 Mexican pesos a day. That comes to about $8, just a little more than when she started picking as a 13-year-old. Now she is 26 years old, and a mother of three kids.

Last week, Zaragoza joined thousands of pickers to protest low pay. Pickers stopped working and left the fields. It was a strike. It was the first strike by farmworkers here in years.

## Harvest Almost Stopped

The strike began Tuesday and has shut down schools and stores. The protesters blocked the main highway, stopping traffic for hours. They almost stopped the harvest.

Hundreds of police and army soldiers used force to clear away the crowds. More than 200 people were arrested.

Zaragoza was held by police in a field with other protesters. She was released after 17 hours. By Thursday morning, she was back protesting.

"We haven't done anything wrong," she said. "We just want better lives."

The land around San Quintin grows much of the fruits and vegetables that Mexico sells to other countries. Thousands of people pick fruit there.

Much of the fruits and vegetables are shipped to the United States. One of the main farming companies in Mexico is BerryMex. It grows strawberries and raspberries that are sold in the U.S. The name Driscoll is on the box in U.S. supermarkets.

## Same Wage For Years

Farmworkers want better pay and health care. They also want extra pay when they work extra hours. Farmworker leaders met with government officials and leaders from the farm companies on Thursday.

Some people have defended the farm companies. They say the growers pay pickers more than in other places in Mexico.

BerryMex said it supports "fairness, honesty and respect" for all of its workers.

Bernardo Velasco, age 47, is a farmworker. He said his home has no running water. Every week, he buys five jugs of water so his family can drink and bathe. Velasco makes $50 per week. He said it isn't enough to feed and house his family.

"We've been here for years working and working for the same wage. We've had enough," Velasco said.

## Protests Turn Angry

The protests started peacefully but turned angry.

Zaragoza said she saw protesters thrown to the ground and hit by police.

She said police were arresting everyone on the streets. Even peaceful protesters, like Zaragoza, were being arrested. On Thursday, people were waiting for news of their arrested family members. They also wanted to know how the talks were going.

Alberto Munoz is a lawyer for the farm owners. He said it would be hard to pay workers more.

In Mexico, many farmworkers are part of large unions. A union is a group of workers who join together to have more power to ask companies for better pay. The unions have already made agreements with the growers. These deals cannot be easily changed.

Some of the farmworkers want to go around the unions. They want to deal with the farm owners themselves.
