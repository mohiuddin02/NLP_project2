There were incredible runs, catches, and one very memorable interception. For a few men outside a fruit-processing plant on the outskirts of Medellín, however, the most important moment came during a commercial break. Days after the game, they were still still analyzing the one-minute advertisement promoting Mexican avocados.

The men were interested in the ad, produced by Avocados from Mexico, because they are hoping to break into the American avocado market themselves. U.S. consumer demand for the green, buttery vegetable is spiking. Colombia, which has a free-trade agreement with the United States, is hoping to be the next big player in America's guacamole bowl.

## Winning The Avocado Lottery

They have a long way to go. To sell avocados in the United States, Colombian growers need to be able to show that they satisfy requirements for clean and safe agriculture. They will also have to get permission from regulators, the government agents that make sure agricultural sales are carried out legally. Even with these challenges, most people think Colombia will start exporting avocados to the United States within the next 24 months or so.

According to Colombian Minister of Agriculture Aurelio Iragorri, his country already exports 80 different agricultural products to the United States. "If product number 81 is avocados, we will have won the lottery because the United States is one of the major consumers of avocados," he told reporters.

With his eye on future avocado sales, Iragorri understands that the Super Bowl is a both a major sporting event and a major business event. "It's the day that they consume the most avocados because Americans eat a lot of chips and they like to put guacamole on them," he said.

## The Avocado Export Bowl

U.S. demand for avocados has soared 174 percent in the past 14 years. In other words, it has nearly doubled. With the increase in demand, there has also been more competition among avocado sellers. According to trade journals, Avocados from Mexico may have spent as much as $9 million for its ad to run during the Super Bowl.

Mexico supplied 1.3 billion pounds of avocados to the United States in 2014, followed by California with 282 million pounds. Peru and Chile came next, with 144 million pounds and 89 million pounds each, respectively.

Some Colombians think they can compete, especially with Peru and Chile. Colombia is geographically closer to the United States than Peru and Chile, so it may be able to sell avocados there more easily.

Andrés Eduardo Mejía is the executive director of CORPOHASS, the association of Colombia's avocado producers and exporters. He believes that Colombia can take advantage of a major business opportunity by exporting avocados to the United States. "The U.S. is seeing per-capita consumption expand and promotional efforts are exploding."

## Colombian Companies Are Ready

The U.S. government has indicated that it welcomes Colombian avocado sales, but the process to set up the new industry is slow. The government has tried to speed things up by providing training and expertise to help Colombian companies.

"I think there is a lot of potential and the ambassador's visit here is to show that we're partners with Colombia," the embassy's agricultural counselor, Michael Conlon, said.

Colombian companies have already begun expanding while they wait for permission to sell avocados in the United States. Colombian land dedicated to avocado production more than doubled from 2008 to 2014, and the country is on track to produce 42,500 tons this year.

"But 42,000 tons isn't enough," Iragorri said, looking forward to a U.S. opening. "Avocados have a great future."

## Florida's Harvest

While Colombia tries to enter an already crowded market, there is one avocado-growing region that does not have to worry about competition. Florida is the second-largest avocado-producing state behind California and is expected to harvest somewhere between 1 million and 1.2 million bushels this year, or about 66 million pounds, according to the state's Avocado Committee.

Unlike California and Colombia, however, Florida specializes in green avocados that are larger and have a lighter flavor than the dark-skinned Haas avocados that dominate the U.S. market.

Brooks Tropicals is South Florida's largest grower of avocados. It has started calling Florida's green avocados "SlimCados" to highlight the fact that they have less fat than Haas avocados.

Mary Ostlund, director of marketing at Brooks Tropicals, points out that consumers may enjoy having more than one kind of avocado to choose from. "People are realizing they like to eat more than one kind of avocado," she said, adding that most grocery stores stock both varieties.

She sees the green avocado market and the Haas avocado market as separate. As far as green avocados are concerned, Florida has little competition. "I guess we have staked out our own little corner," Ostlund said.
