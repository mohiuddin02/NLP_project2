NEW YORK — They speak different languages. They live in rich countries and poor ones, with good job markets and bad. But when it comes to money, they all are acting the same. Families are keeping a tight grip on their cash, driven more by a fear of losing what they have than a desire to get more.

It has been more than five years since the global economic crisis hit. Families around the world still are too nervous to take any chances with their money.

An Associated Press study shows that families in the 10 richest countries are spending carefully. They have pulled hundreds of billions of dollars out of the stock market. They are putting their money into savings, for instance, that are low risk, but won't make them very much money.

"It doesn't take very much to destroy confidence, but it takes an awful lot to build it back," says Ian Bright. He is an economist at ING, a global bank based in Amsterdam. The attitude toward taking chances with money has permanently changed, he said.

## Global Economy Suffering

The effects are huge: Avoiding debt and spending less can be good for a family's budget. But when hundreds of millions are too careful with their money, the global economy suffers. Spending creates a demand for goods, which leads to more jobs and helps the economy. An economy is the total wealth and production of goods in a country.

Slow economic growth means salaries in the United States will rise slowly. Right now, unemployment in parts of Europe is at a record high. In several countries, more than 35 percent of young people are out of work.

High unemployment in many countries means fewer people have extra money to spend. But even people with stable jobs are being careful.

Five years ago, Lehman Brothers, one of the largest banks in the world, failed. This caused the global crisis that began in December 2007. Now, said Arne Holzhausen, an economist based in Munich, "It's safety, safety, safety."

The Associated Press analyzed information about what people did with their money five years before the crisis began and five years after. They focused on the world's 10 richest countries. They are: the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Brazil, Russia, Italy and India.

## Safety First For Families

Some important findings:

— RETREAT FROM STOCKS: A desire for safety drove people to sell stocks and put their money into bonds. A stock is a very small ownership interest in a company that can be bought. A bond is a loan that helps a government or company pay for a long-term project. A bond is generally considered the safer investment.

— AVOIDING DEBT: The amount of money people owed on home loans and credit card purchases increased enormously in the five years before the crisis. When the crisis hit, people stopped borrowing so freely.

Given their experience, people are slow to begin borrowing again, says Jack Ablin. He is an officer with BMO Private Bank in Chicago.

— SAVING UP CASH: In the five years after the crisis, households in the six richest countries began keeping much more of their money in cash. People also put money into bank accounts, although they earned little interest.

— SPENDING SLUMP: Cutting debt and saving more may be good in the long term. But to save more and spend less, people have to control their spending. After the crisis, their rate of spending slowed to a crawl.

— DEVELOPING WORLD NOT HELPING ENOUGH: When the financial crisis hit, the major developed countries looked to countries with growing economies to help global growth. The four big developing countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — recovered quickly from the crisis. But this year, their economies are stumbling.

## Scared Of Losing Money Again

People will begin spending money again. But few economists expect them to snap back and spend as freely as before.

The spending behavior before the crisis was not normal either. Experts now understand that families bought what they wanted not because they earned more, but because they borrowed too much money.

More importantly, economists say people are psychologically "scarred" by the crisis. Scarring is the fear of losing money during an economic downturn. This affects their spending behavior and doesn't go away so quickly after the economy recovers.

Americans who suffered through the Great Depression in the 1930s remained careful even after the U.S. economy grew strong again after World War II.

Some economists predict that it will take at least another five years for people to spend normally.
