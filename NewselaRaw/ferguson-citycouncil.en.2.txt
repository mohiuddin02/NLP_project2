FERGUSON, Mo. — For the first time in Ferguson's 120-year history, the city's six-member City Council will have three black members. Before this Tuesday's elections, Dwayne James was the council's only black member. Now he will be joined by two other African-Americans: Wesley Bell and Ella Jones.

Ferguson has seen massive unrest since last summer's police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Many here feel that police and the court system are heavily biased against minorities.

Ferguson is 67 percent black, but has had only a handful of black elected officials. One way to bring about reform, many say, is to elect more African-Americans to political office.

Tuesday's election is an important step in that direction. Even so, it was less than a clear victory for those hoping to bring about real change in Ferguson, some said.

## Jones Wins Four-Way Contest

Voters chose three new council members, each of whom represents a different area of the city. Of those, only one was the candidate favored by protesters. Two candidates supported by protesters — Bob Hudgins and Lee Smith — lost to candidates who were seen as being part of the current government and the way it has run the city.

Hudgins was defeated by Brian Fletcher, the white former mayor of Ferguson.

"I guess the signal was sent tonight that this old dog has a few tricks," Fletcher said. "Experience isn't a bad thing. It can be a good thing."

Smith lost to Wesley Bell. While Bell is African-American, he is a judge and is thus associated with a court system that many see as extremely unfair.

Jones was the candidate favored by protesters in her race. She won nearly 50 percent of the vote in a four-way contest.

Jones is chair of the city's Human Rights commission. She started sending out letters to raise support for her campaign long before Michael Brown was killed by Officer Darren Wilson. She said she ran partly because of the way she witnessed young black men being treated by police.

## 30 Percent Cast Ballots

Overall, turnout was much higher than is typical for City Council elections here in Ferguson. Thirty percent of the city's 12,738 voters cast ballots.

In most years, turnout typically hovers around 12 percent and it is not uncommon for City Council candidates to run uncontested. The Brown shooting and the numerous protests and investigations which followed changed all that. This year's election featured eight candidates competing for three council seats.

On Tuesday, just as the first wave of voters headed toward the polls, a thunderstorm rolled across the region. The bad weather raised fears that turnout would be low, although in the end those fears proved unwarranted.

At Koch Elementary School, only about 10 people had voted by 9 a.m., said those outside the polling location. The polling site is less than a half-mile from the Canfield Green apartment building where Brown was killed.

"I'm worried that this is going to look bad for Ferguson because I know the world is watching, and the world is anticipating a large turnout," said LaRhonda Wilson.

The stormy weather did not stop Sharon Bell-Price, who said she never misses a chance to vote. "As for this election, it's extremely important," she said.

Brown's shooting, questionable practices in courts and racial profiling are all issues that influenced her voting decision, Bell-Price said. "I'm hopeful we'll get the change we're looking for," she added.

## Reaching Out To Voters

Even though there is much anger at the court system in Ferguson, the fact that Bell is a judge did not seem to hurt him.

Dan Peterson, Bell's campaign manager, said the key to victory was voter outreach.

"It was knocking on doors talking to people in person," Peterson said. "We talked about why Wesley was the best candidate."

A half-hour before the polls closed at 7 p.m., Bell and Smith were at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church, trying to sway last-minute voters.

The newly elected council members will see significant turnover in city government. Both City Manager John Shaw and Police Chief Thomas Jackson need to be replaced. The two men resigned following U.S. government investigations that were highly critical of Ferguson's policing and court practices.

Whoever interviews for the police chief's job "better be doing his homework," Bell said.
