FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — If you have bought Cheddar Goldfish snacks in the past four years, one fed-up Florida mom wants to help you get your money back.

And her effort has put South Florida in the forefront of a national debate over genetically modified foods.

Disgusted by what her complaint calls false advertising, Palm Beach County elementary schoolteacher Lisa Leo has taken Pepperidge Farm to court. She has accused the huge food manufacturer of mislabeling its popular fish-shaped crackers as "natural."  She says they contain genetically modified soybeans.

Her lawsuit was filed June 11 in federal court. She wants new labels placed on the product. She also seeks at least $5 million in damages for Floridians who purchased the snack since June 2009.
## GMO Food Fight

"Consumers have a right to know what they're putting in their bodies," said Joshua Eggnatz, Leo's attorney. "You may not think GMOs are bad for you, but others may, and the consumer has a right to know and to choose."

Genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, are plant or animal products that have been re-engineered in a lab. Scientists use the DNA of bacteria, viruses or other plants and animals. The purpose is to make seeds yield more crops or make the crops heartier, more tolerant of herbicides, and resistant to insects, drought and other environmental factors.

It is estimated that about 90 percent of the corn, cotton, soybeans and sugar beets grown in the United States are genetically altered. They are most often used in highly processed foods like crackers and cereals.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not defined what "natural" means in terms of food labels. But its website says the agency "has not objected to the use of the term" when the food does not have added color, artificial flavor or man-made substances.

Eggnatz said Leo did not want to comment for this story. The lawyer offered few details about why Leo sued. According to the complaint, Leo purchased the snacks monthly from three stores. She paid a higher price for the crackers. And she believed that the "natural" label meant they contained no GMO ingredients.
## Worries Widen Over Health Effects

Leo would have chosen cheaper, non-GMO snacks for her family had she known about the Goldfish's modified soybeans, according to the complaint. Eggnatz says she is a middle-aged mother of two and grandmother of one. The suit does not say that anyone in Leo's family was sickened by the product.

Pepperidge Farm officials did not return calls for a comment.

The complaint targets one product. However, it shows a growing concern over the long-term health consequences of America's changing food supply.

Recent studies have suggested that re-engineered foods can create new unintended poisons and increase the risk of allergies. But the evidence is limited.

Still, more than 60 countries — including Japan, Australia and the European Union — ban or restrict the sale and production of the ingredients. And the companies that make them have come under fire in recent years.

One of the most visible protests erupted in May. More than 2 million people around the globe rallied against Monsanto. The company, based in St. Louis, is the world's largest manufacturer of genetically modified seeds.
## Ultimately About Consumer Choice

Amid the uproar is a national outcry for forced food labeling in the United States. Congress is considering a bill. It would direct the FDA to "clearly label" genetically modified foods. Florida and 14 other states want to require the labels at the state level.

The food manufacturing lobby has been successful in fighting labeling laws. It argues that consumers will assume that because a product contains GMOs, it is inferior or not as safe.

"It's a hugely controversial topic, and when you look at both sides, they seem to make a lot of sense," said Lillian Craggs-Dino, a dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic in Weston. "There are no easy answers in this one."

Part of the concern over GMOs, Craggs-Dino said, is that many are modified with DNA from other species. Genes from an animal or shellfish, for example, can be added to a seed. That creates a problem for allergy sufferers. People following a vegan or Kosher diet would also be affected.

"I think, ultimately, this is about education, consumer choice," she said. "People want to be educated by what they see on a food label and make an educated decision on whether to buy the product or not."
## "Goldfish Highly Processed"

Public pressure for labels has persuaded Whole Foods to require suppliers to add GMO labels to their products. It's the first major supermarket chain to do so. The company is setting 2018 as its deadline.

Florida-based Publix, meanwhile, is following the lead of the Food Marketing Institute, a large industry association. It is "calling for education, labeling and standards for genetically modified foods," Publix spokeswoman Kimberly Reynolds said.

While the debate rages on, consumers can take some steps to avoid GMOs without having to rely on labels, accurate or otherwise, Craggs-Dino said: They can buy products certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as "organic."

And then there's another method, endorsed by Carol Sherman, a registered dietitian in Boca Raton. "Just use your common sense," she said. "In reality, if you think Pepperidge Farms Goldfish are natural, you have to be kidding yourself. Goldfish are a highly processed food," the most likely candidate to have genetically altered ingredients.
