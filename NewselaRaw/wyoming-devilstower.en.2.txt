But the vertical lines along the sides of the almost 390-meter-tall (nearly 1,300 feet) rock formation in Wyoming are not claw marks. They are actually the edges of columns of igneous — volcanic — rock. The column formed as the molten rock cooled and contracted, cracking apart.

## Czech Scientists Check It Out

But how did the columns of Devils Tower form — below the ground or as part of a violent volcanic eruption?

Scientists have suggested many theories over the years. The most popular today hold that Devils Tower was born 49 million years ago as a rising half dome of magma, molten rock. The magma was squeezed to the surface either between underground layers of rock or deep inside a volcano.

Prokop Závada, a geologist at The Czech Academy of Sciences, and three other researchers became interested in the mystery of Devils Tower. They found a clue in another butte in the Czech Republic, called Boren. A butte is an isolated hill with steep sides and a flat top. Boren is similar to Devils Tower, although it is more rounded and covered with trees.

## Maar-Diatreme? It's A Blast!

The researchers concluded that Boren was created by a sudden type of volcano called a maar-diatreme. This kind of volcano blasts a crater on the Earth's surface when molten rock underground meets groundwater. After the blast, the researchers think, a flat dome of lava filled the crater, acting like a plug. Wind and rain eroded away at the edges of that dome until only the innermost portion remained. We call that isolated core Devils Tower. Because Devils Tower is so similar to Boren, the Czech team decided to see it was formed in the same way.

The researchers looked at two main characteristics of Devils Tower. They studied the shape of its distinctive columns and the position of magnetic minerals within them.

The National Park Service let the researchers collect one new rock sample from Devils Tower in order to analyze its magnetic properties. The researchers discovered that near the base of Devils Tower, tiny needle-shaped minerals within the rock are oriented close to vertical. That is the direction the lava flowed before it hardened. Closer to the top, the minerals turn horizontal.

## Plaster And Computer Models

Based on that information, the researchers made digital and physical models. For the physical model, they mixed some magnetic particles in with soft plaster. They squeezed the material upward through an upside-down cone full of earth and rock until it formed a mound on the surface. This resembled the eruption of lava following a maar-diatreme volcano.

They measured which way the magnetic particles pointed just as they had done at Devils Tower. They also made a computer simulation of cooling volcanic rock. The simulation let the researchers compare columns created as Devils Tower cooled under different conditions.

The columns of Devils Tower matched the expected pattern exactly. In the plaster models, the direction of the magnetic particles also matched the direction of the minerals from Devils Tower. They were closer to vertical around the base and horizontal near the top. In a paper, Závada and his team concluded that Devils Tower was caused by an underground volcano like Boren in the Czech Republic.

## This Bears Further Study

Western Washington University's Bernard Housen was not involved in the study. He said the work was "interesting and certainly very plausible" or believable. However, he was not convinced it ruled out other possible explanations. The problem is that there isn't much data from Devils Tower itself, since the government has allowed so few samples to be taken. "So, it is likely that the origin of Devils Tower will remain uncertain," he said. This is in part because the government wants to make sure that the butte is preserved, Housen said.

It might be possible to study the similar, if less spectacular, buttes near Devils Tower, however. They were likely formed in the same way — with or without the help of giant bears.
