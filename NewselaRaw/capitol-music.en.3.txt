LOS ANGELES â€” The historic record label, Capitol Records, hired a new boss in 2012. When he arrived, the award-winning records hanging on the wall were taken down. A cardboard cutout of the Beatles was hauled away.

The items were symbols of Steve Barnett's difficult job ahead. His mission was to take the old record company and make it modern again.

Capitol Records was so stuck in the past that it could not look ahead to the future, Barnett said. Capitol Records was founded in 1942 in Los Angeles. It has recorded albums for music stars including the Beatles, Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra.

## Picking The Stars

Before he became chairman of Capitol Records Group, Barnett was president of Columbia Records. Columbia was the biggest record label in the United States and Capitol was the fifth-largest. Capitol moved up to second place in just over two years since Barnett became chairman in 2012.

A big part of Capitol's improvement has been Barnett's ability to choose the artists and anticipate which ones could become big stars. In 2014, Capitol hired two of the biggest new artists of the year: singer Sam Smith and the boy band 5 Seconds of Summer.

The 2015 Grammy Awards nominations were a sign of Capitol's comeback. Capitol artists got 46 nominations. Smith got six nominations for his first album, including the rare accomplishment of a new artist being nominated in the top four awards: best record, album, song and new artist.

## Albums To CDs To Streams

Capitol had been hurt by changes in the music business in the last decade. Fans went from buying CDs to downloading songs and albums, then to streaming music online. Capitol was managed badly, said experts. It did not spend money on finding new artists.

Capitol was bought by Universal Music Group a little over two years ago. The new owners wanted to invest money to fix it, said Lucian Grainge, chairman of Universal Music.

The first step was to hire the right leader, said Grainge. Barnett had been a manager for rock group AC/DC, Cyndi Lauper and other musicians. When he was running Columbia Records, he worked with artists like the British soul singer Adele, the boy band One Direction and the indie-rock group Foster the People.

Just like Grainge, Barnett has been a fan of the artists on Capitol's labels for a long time. As a kid growing up in England, Barnett liked some of Capitol's most famous acts. He liked the Beatles and Beach Boys.

Barnett moved Capitol from New York back to its home in Los Angeles. Thirty employees and their families had to move 3,000 miles across the country. Barnett also decided to restore the Capitol Tower, a historic building in Los Angeles where the label got started. He offered empty offices to other Universal Music labels including Motown, another famous record company.

## "We're In The Game"

Barnett said Capitol's job is to develop artists. He said he felt safe betting that Sam Smith would be a star. His hunch paid off. Smith's "In the Lonely Hour" was the third-biggest album of 2014. Only Taylor Swift's "1989" and the "Frozen" soundtrack sold more copies. Katy Perry's "Prism" album also did very well for Capitol.

Smith said he signed with Capitol because he liked the company's bosses. He said they showed respect for him and his music. Smith said it was a done deal when he met with Steve Barnett.

Richard Griffiths, manager of One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer, says Barnett was the reason both groups signed with his record companies. One Direction signed with Columbia Records when Barnett was in charge. 5 Seconds signed with Capitol after Barnett joined.

Grainge and Barnett would not say how much the new owners have spent on Capitol. But Barnett said a walk through Capitol's offices could help figure it out. Offices have been renovated and repainted, and there is new equipment in Capitol's three recording studios.

Grainge said the changes are not trying to change Capitol into something new. The owners only tried to help the employees, who already had the skills, talent and dedication, he said. Universal Music wanted to nurture Capitol back to success by helping its people. Two years later, Capitol is on a new path.

"I think we're in the game," Barnett said.
