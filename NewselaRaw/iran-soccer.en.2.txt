LOS ANGELES — Soccer player Steven Beitashour wants to make a couple of things clear right away.

First of all, his decision to play for [Iran's](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) national team in this summer's World Cup had nothing to do with politics.

"I just thought about soccer," Beitashour says. "It's a great opportunity, especially to play on the international stage."

And secondly, he does not want to be compared to a soldier who would go fight for any country willing to pay him. If U.S. Soccer had wanted him as much as Iran's national team, he would have been just as happy to stay home. But he was never asked to make that choice.

For Beitashour, who was born in San Jose, Calif., to Iranian parents, the decision to play for Iran has been solely about soccer. But for many others, his choice seems to be tinged with politics. After all, the U.S. and Iran have had a very strained relationship for more than 30 years.

## "The Biggest Stage"

"When we hear of an Iranian-American going back and contributing somehow to where our parents grew up, it's an awesome feeling," says Borhan Oskoorouchi of San Jose, who runs a weekly Farsi/Persian-language radio program.

Meanwhile, Beitashour just wants to play in a World Cup. For the 27-year-old, this summer's tournament in [Brazil](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Brazil) could be his last chance. The World Cup happens once every four years.

"It's the biggest stage and the best players (are) playing there," says Beitashour, a former Major League Soccer (MLS) all-star who plays right back for the Vancouver Whitecaps. "Having an opportunity to potentially be there, it's just great."

He's not there yet. Beitashour first played for Iran in an Asian Cup qualifier last October. The team still has three friendly matches left before its final World Cup roster is due next month showing who will play. Beitashour is hardly guaranteed a spot.

But his U.S. background and his experience on a professional soccer team might help. Iran's Portuguese manager, Carlos Queiroz, conducts his practices in English and has an MLS background.

Queiroz was also responsible for bringing Beitashour into the Iranian program. After he took over the national team three years ago, he put together a list of several players with Iranian backgrounds who were playing all over the world.

## Of Two Cultures

"At the beginning there was a little bit of resistance," says former assistant coach Omid Namazi. "But once that ice broke and players came in and showed what they could bring to the national team, I think it was a sense of welcome."

It certainly was for Beitashour.

"Within five, 10 minutes I felt like they were my brothers," he says of his Iranian teammates.

Beitashour still struggles with the language, Farsi. Before getting an invitation to join the team, he hadn't visited the country since he was 5. But while he was growing up in California's Silicon Valley, his parents observed many Iranian traditions.

"The culture is still part of you," he says. "I definitely feel like I've got strong ties."

Still, his upbringing was also as American as apple pie and weekend visits to the mall.

Beitashour went on to the play at San Diego State, then spent four years with the San Jose Earthquakes of MLS before being sold to Vancouver in January.

## The Next Hurdle

So even though Iranian coaches first contacted him three years ago and asked him to begin the lengthy process of preparing the paperwork necessary to visit the country, playing for them wasn't part of the plan. He had been called into the U.S. national team camp in the summer of 2012 and again the following January.

But Beitashour didn't get into a game either time, and officials with U.S. Soccer said it was unlikely he'd ever play for the team.

So when Iran called back, he jumped at the chance to play in a World Cup. U.S. Coach Juergen Klinsmann blessed the decision.

"In our ranking in the right back position, he was five, six, seven. So it was not realistic," says Klinsmann, who played in three World Cups for Germany. "I don't want them to miss out on anything. If this is what they badly want, then absolutely fine."

The next hurdle for Beitashour is being chosen to join the team.

"It's going to go down to the wire," says Namazi, the former assistant coach. "But I have a good feeling that he´ll be on the squad come the World Cup."
