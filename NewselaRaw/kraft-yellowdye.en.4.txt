Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese will soon get rid of yellow food coloring. Kraft makes the Mac &amp; Cheese that comes in the blue box. It's the favorite of many kids. Kraft announced that it will remove all unnatural food coloring by 2016. Instead, the pasta will get its bright yellow color by using natural colorings. These natural colors will come from spices like turmeric and paprika.

Today more customers want natural foods. This is why Kraft says it is getting rid of the unnatural food colorings. But some people think that the food coloring may lead to a health problem for children. It is called attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. People with ADHD may be hyperactive. They may have trouble paying attention or they may act without thinking.

## Unnatural Food Colorings

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is part of the U.S. government. Its job is to make sure food and medicines in America are safe. It says unnatural food colorings are safe. However, some studies have found that the colorings, or dyes, can cause children to be hyperactive. The two dyes that scientists worry about most are Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6.

In Europe, foods have a warning on them if they have one of these dyes in it. However, the FDA has decided that this labeling is not needed in the United States. The FDA says there is not enough proof that these dyes are harmful.

Joel Nigg is a professor at a university in Oregon. He disagrees with the FDA. He worked on a study that looked at the dyes. It found that the dyes have an effect on hyperactivity in children.

He says the problem needs to be studied more. Many studies have looked at only small numbers of people.

## More Studies Are Needed

Companies add coloring to make their food look tasty. The colors Yellow Nos. 5 and 6 have been used since the early 1900s. They are 2 of the 9 colors that food companies must list on foods they make. A study in April 2015 found that one serving of Kraft had less than what the FDA says is an unsafe amount. This is one of the reasons why they are allowed.

Bernard Weiss has studied this problem for many years. He is a professor at a university of medicine in New York. He is frustrated that the FDA has not done anything about it. He thinks that food companies should prove that dyes are safe. Like most other scientists, he thinks more studies are needed.

Nigg says the FDA should make food companies put a warning on foods. The warning should explain that these dyes could make some children more hyper. He says the studies show that the unnatural colors have an effect on a small number of children. He worries about this group of children. He thinks the best way to protect them is to protect everyone. He says we can protect everyone by putting warnings on food.
