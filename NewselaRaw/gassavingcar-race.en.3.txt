PHILADELPHIA — Its top speed is 35 miles per hour. It has less power than a lawn mower.

Nevertheless, the bright-red vehicle in a Swarthmore College basement is very much a race car. Only thing is, the race it will enter won't be won by the fastest car. The goal, instead, is to use as little energy — gasoline or electricity — as possible.

Cars that get a lot of miles out of not much gas or electricity are called energy efficient. They are cheaper to run and are better for the environment than regular cars.

The narrow, three-wheeled vehicle is headed to Houston this week. It will be facing off against 125 other cars in the Shell Eco-marathon Americas.

It turns out that the Toyota Prius, the Nissan Leaf and other hybrid cars are not so special after all. Some of the cars entered in the race can achieve thousands — yes, thousands — of miles per gallon of gasoline. A Toyota Prius usually gets 40 to 55 miles per gallon. In the 2013 contest, Laval University in Quebec took top honors with 3,587 miles per gallon.

Swarthmore's machine doesn't quite reach that level: It gets what translates into a little less than 1,300 miles per gallon. Comparing it with cars with gasoline engines is tricky, though: The car is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell.

## It's "Totally Unrealistic"

And don't get the idea that these curiosities will be showing up on an expressway near you. The Swarthmore car weighs just 137 pounds and is only 8 1/2 feet long.

"It's a demonstration," said engineering professor Nelson Macken, who has been guiding the project. It is "totally unrealistic."

The Eco-marathon cars are divided into two main types. "Urban concept" vehicles are required to look like modern passenger cars. In other words, they have to have four wheels and a roof over the driver's head. Experimental vehicles, such as Swarthmore's, can look like pretty much anything.

Entrants must complete 10 laps of a 0.6-mile course laid out on the streets of Houston, for a total of six miles. Shell first held the "Americas" race in 2007; a sister event in Europe dates back to 1985.

Swarthmore graduate Eric Verhasselt started building the school's car in 2012. He welded its aluminum frame in the summer before his senior year.

The most expensive part of the car is the $10,000 fuel cell. Fortunately, the college already had one.

Verhasselt took the car to Houston last year for its first Shell race. He placed third among six hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Junior Neil Macfarland is continuing the effort this year. He helped Verhasselt with the design, and now is tweaking and testing the car to get the most out of it. As it turns out, it runs best at just 15 miles per hour.

Also helping are junior Andrew Grasberger and freshman Persis Ratouis, among others.

## Trouble With Gremlins

Don't forget the secret weapon: Winnie Ngo, a junior from Oakland, Calif., who will be behind the wheel.

The computer science student weighs just 95 pounds and stands 4 feet, 10 1/2 inches. Her tiny size allows her to fit into the small car with room to spare.

It's much better than having the 6-foot-1 Macfarland drive. Since his long limbs do not fit inside the car, he had to remove the car's sides to take it for a short spin.

"People were turning and staring," Ngo said.

The hydrogen for Swarthmore's car is stored in a tank behind the driver's seat. It generates electricity in the fuel cell, a black box mounted nearby.

Inside the fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen are combined. The result is water and electricity.

Fuel cell cars are non-polluting: They don't give off any smoke or gasses.

One day last week, though, the car had problems: I wouldn't start. Macfarland was worried.

"Right now, we're chasing electric gremlins around the car," Macfarland joked. Gremlins are little mythical creatures. Legend has it that they are fond of damaging machinery.

The problem turned out to be an emergency shut-off switch that had jammed. Macfarland had it working again in short order.

The three-day race opened on Friday.

Start your engines! Or fuel cells.
