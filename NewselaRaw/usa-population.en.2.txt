The numbers were part of an annual estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The complete census happens every 10 years, when the federal government takes a count of the population. But every year the Census Bureau does an estimate. It tries to figure out where populations are changing. It includes how many people have died and been born. It also includes how many people have come into the country, or into the states. And, it looks at how many have left.

The states that had the most growth were Texas, California and Florida. This helped push Southern and Western states past the Northeast and Midwest in population growth.

It's significant, because population numbers play an important role in determining states' political power.

## Southern States Show Strong Growth

Population estimates are watched by state officials. They determine how much money the states get from the federal government and the number of seats each state receives in one part of Congress. That part is called the House of Representatives. The number of seats gets changed every 10 years, when there's a big census.

If states continue to grow at the same pace until the next census, Texas could gain three more congressional seats in 2020. Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado would stand to gain one seat each. Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, West Virginia and Rhode Island would lose a seat each.

The new numbers show Southern states were growing faster than the Northeast and Midwest. That's been happening for some time. Texas lagged behind only North Dakota and the District of Columbia in the rate of population growth since the 2010 census. It gained four seats the last time that seats in Congress were divided up.

California has 38,332,521 residents, and Texas has 26,448,193. They are still the states with the highest populations.

New York only just barely kept its third-place spot. It has 19,651,127 residents, compared with Florida's 19,552,860. But the Sunshine State will soon overtake New York. Its population is growing about three times faster, according to census estimates.

As a percent of population, California's growth again was higher than the national average over the last year. It rose 0.9 percent, or added 332,643 new residents, compared with 0.7 percent nationwide. But in raw numbers, Texas added the most residents, 387,397.

More and better-paying Californian jobs in the second half of 2013 might mean faster growth in California. But Texas still has an advantage because of its energy-based economy and a population that is getting younger.

## North Dakota The Fastest-Growing State

Texas is going to keep an advantage in gaining seats in Congress, "until the oil economy turns (down) again," said Dowell Myers. He is a population expert at the University of Southern California.

"But California's adding jobs more rapidly now than Texas," he said. "So probably next year I would bet that California's share of the growth is up a little bit more."

North Dakota is the nation's fastest-growing state, driven by a thriving oil and gas industry. North Dakota's population stood at 723,393 on July 1, according to numbers from the census. That's a 3.1 percent increase from 2012. Since the 2010 census, North Dakota's population has grown 7.6 percent. This is much faster than the national rate of 2.4 percent.

Kevin Iverson is the manager of the North Dakota Census Office. He says the biggest population growth has been among 19- to 34-year-olds, primarily through people moving there for work.

"The economic winds have clearly favored North Dakota," Iverson said. He credited it mainly to the energy boom, but also growth in manufacturing and agriculture. "The real question begins to become, to what extent can you continue to grow?"

Population in the District of Columbia also grew briskly, rising 2.1 percent from 2012 to 2013 to 646,449. Utah grew the next fastest, at a rate of 1.6 percent. It was followed by Colorado and Texas at 1.5 percent and Nevada at 1.3 percent.

West Virginia and Maine saw slight population declines in the last year. Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Vermont and Illinois had the slowest population growth, all at or near a tenth of 1 percentage point.

The national population stood at 316,128,839 on July 1, an increase of 2.3 million. But the yearly growth rate nationally is still lower than where it was in the mid-2000s. Population grew faster then. It was before the economy went down and U.S. companies began to cut jobs.
