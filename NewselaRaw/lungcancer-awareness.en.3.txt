CHICAGO — November was Lung Cancer Awareness Month, but you'd never know it. In October, NFL players or coaches wore pink for breast cancer. Some people say the color blue should be worn to support the cause to stop lung cancer. No one in the NFL wore blue in November.

"It just doesn't seem fair," said Meghan O'Brien, 31, a nonsmoker diagnosed with the worst level of the disease last year.

The lack of attention is especially strange because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It claims more lives than breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers combined. Only about one out of every six people who get it live more than five years.

## People Blame Patients

But people think lung cancer is caused only by smoking.  So, people blame the patients for getting the disease.

Roughly 228,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year. But as many as one out of every six of them were never smokers, says the LUNGevity Foundation. LUNGevity is a group that gives money to find a cure for lung cancer.

Because lung cancer is thought of badly, it affects everything. There's less emotional support for people who have the disease. Even in death announcements, family members sometimes say that the dead person was a nonsmoker. They don't want the person who passed away to be thought of in a bad way.

It's very hard to find money to pay for research to find a cure for lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute says that the government spends $17,835 on research for breast cancer for each person who dies of the disease. But only $1,378 is spent on research for each person who dies of lung cancer.

## Hard To Make People Aware

Those numbers are surprising since almost 23,000 nonsmokers die of lung cancer each year.

But it's not easy to build awareness. There isn't even a ribbon for lung cancer. People aren't even sure what the right color is, says Andrea Ferris, president of the LUNGevity Foundation. She says it's blue. Others say it's clear or pearl.

"In every other disease, the first question people ask is, 'How can I help?' But with lung cancer, there's no empathy. It's always, 'Did you smoke?' After a while, it's just easier not to say anything," Ferris said.

In O'Brien's case, doctors found a problem with her genes, called a mutation. Genes determine what we look like or if we get diseases. The mutation O'Brien has happens when two normal genes join together to form a new one. This mutation causes cancer.

O'Brien started taking a drug designed to help block the mutation. It worked for a while. But now the disease has come roaring back, invading her lungs and brain.

## Asked If She Smoked

She has started a blog to describe her lung cancer journey.

"I try not to get too mad when people ask if I smoked," she said. "Instead, I try to turn it into an opportunity to talk about it … to educate. I guess that's the teacher in me."

Even so, O'Brien immediately listed her good health habits: Physical education teacher. Regular tennis player. She hasn't eaten fast food since age 13. No cigarettes, ever.

Two weeks after starting a new job, she was told that she had lung cancer. And it was attacking her other organs.

## Missing Out On Having A Family

O'Brien spent most of the next four months in the hospital. She needed to have tumors removed from her spinal cord and doctors took out several of the vertebrae in her back. They replaced them with metal rods and screws.

After she was sent home, O'Brien couldn't keep her new teaching job.

O'Brien's eyes tear up as she thinks of her unfulfilled dreams. These are things like having a good job, getting married, having kids, and buying a home.

Dating isn't really something she thinks about now. Treatment caused her to lose her hair, while steroids added 50 pounds. Even with the side effects, she tries to find ways to stay attractive, such as having her makeup professionally done.

The worst insult, she said, "is when people ask, 'Are you sure you never smoked?' As if I forgot."
