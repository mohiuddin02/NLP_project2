UNITED NATIONS  — Two years. Two hundred and five countries and territories. Twelve actors. Shakespeare's "Hamlet" is going global.

Actors based at Shakespeare's Globe, a theater in London, are taking "Hamlet" on the road. They hope to perform in every country and territory in the world.

This week the production landed at the United Nations in New York. The tale of the conflicted Danish prince received a rowdy standing ovation from top diplomats. This "Hamlet," with simple sets and few actors, played for about 500 guests here, as real-world crises played out in Ukraine and Gaza.

"It's an absolute delight to be here. It's extraordinary. It feels very, very odd. But very pleasurably odd," said Dominic Dromgoole, artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe. "We like bold ideas. We like bold, simple — some would say stupid — ideas."

## Enthusiastic And Energetic

The tour hopes to visit 205 nations and territories on all seven continents. The number is not exact, as countries and territories can change.

So far, the tour has already visited 28 countries and traveled 19,295 miles (31,053 kilometers). It began this spring at its London home, a reconstructed 16th-century theater on the River Thames.

With so much ground to cover, the production must travel light. The scenery is just a few steamer trunks, cloth sheets, wood beams and rope. The actors play multiple roles. They also play instruments such as drums, violins and mandolins.

Despite these limitations, an enthusiastic and energetic cast brings the play to life.

The U.N. is not the first unusual place these actors have performed. They have put on the play in opera halls, market places and beaches. The troupe hopes to visit all the world's countries, including Iraq, North Korea and Syria. They also hope to perform in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank.

"Inclusivity is a much better policy than exclusivity," said Dromgoole. "If you do start excluding anyone, you do have to ask the question 'Where do you start and where do you stop?'"

## On To Central America, Caribbean

The show has already played in some conflict zones. During the continuing dispute between Russia and Ukraine, the show was performed in both Moscow and Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. At the Kiev performance, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko was in the audience.

The production next moves on to Central America and the Caribbean, stopping in the Bahamas on Wednesday and on to Mexico, Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica. Later this summer it will head to Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

The tour features a portable set and a 12-person multicultural cast that includes Hong Kong-born actress Jennifer Leong and Maori actor Rawiri Paratene.

Two actors share the title role, Prince Hamlet — London actor Naeem Hayat, and Nigeria-born Ladi Emeruwa.

Hayat played Hamlet confidently at the U.N., portraying the young prince's crushing indecision and apparent madness.

## Playing To Different Audiences

An international audience such as U.N. diplomats may have different reactions to the play, Emeruwa said.

"I think it'll mean different things to different people depending on what sort of situation they're in or what sort of situation their country is in as well," he said.

The show's journey began in London on April 23 — Shakespeare's 450th birthday. It has already made stops from Amsterdam to Prague, Cyprus to Ukraine. The tour concludes at its home theater on April 23, 2016 — the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death.

Paratene, who plays Polonius and other parts, recognized that art has limited power to change international events.

"It would be foolish of us to go in thinking that we could get the diplomats to operate better," he said. "All we can do is tell the story." Paratene says that if they gather from that "something that makes the Israeli representative go to the other side of the room and sit next to the Palestinian representative and maybe kiss each other on the cheek and talk and listen, that would be very nice. But that's not what we're here to do. We're here to tell a story."
