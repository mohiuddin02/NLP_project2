AKRON, Ohio â€” A new basketball program is helping sixth-graders in Akron, Ohio. It teaches them to behave and to believe in themselves.

The boys love basketball. The program uses this love to help them grow into respected and respectful men.

Silas Hardiman is one of the players. Last month, a classmate made fun of how he looked. Silas did not hit him. Instead, the 11-year-old thought about what would happen.

"If I would have hit him," Silas said, "I would have been kicked off the team or benched."

Silas is among 76 students at seven elementary schools who are in the program. Basketball and other sports normally are not available until seventh grade.

## A Perfect Mix

Administrators think focusing more on middle school is a good idea. It is a time when more boys get into trouble as their bodies and feelings change.

The basketball program costs less than $10,000 to run. A company called DC Heating & Cooling Inc. gave $1,540 to help. The program already is paying off, said school official Dan Rambler.

Officials agreed with combining mentoring and athletics to make things better at the schools, he said. It was a perfect mix of what they wanted to do for students, he said.

Students in the program gather once a week after school. They normally spend 15 minutes on the basketball court. Another 105 minutes is spent in a classroom. They help each other catch up on homework while listening to mentors, or adults who can give advice. These mentors focus on helping black youth. Each Saturday, the seven teams play.

The weekly practices began in October. The final match is set for March 5.

The students do not get to play if they get into trouble or fail to meet weekly school goals. Teachers set the school goals. The boys are behaving better. They are also doing better in reading and math, school administrators said.

## Learning Responsibility

Kyle Earley decides who can play. He checks weekly progress reports. Earley makes the kids run tough drills for bad behavior.

Earley works with young people at a local church. He graduated from an Akron high school in 1998. Then he coached middle school basketball. Earley saw students skipping school last year. There were other behavioral problems too. 

He suggested the idea of creating a sixth-grade basketball league to Angela Harper. She is the principal at Crouse school. She passed the idea along to Rambler and others in charge of student behavior, programs and athletics.

Earley brought in his sister, Ciara Dennis. She is a psychologist. She works with people on how they think and feel.

Dennis came up with a plan. It helps the mentors teach the boys to be responsible for their actions. The boys learn to show anger in other ways, to understand and respect others and to be proud of who they are. Doing these things frees them from the situations that keep many poor young people from achieving their dreams.

The health agency provides training and support to children and adults. It works in churches, schools and homes in the community.

The basketball program is part of a larger effort. The idea is to get mentors, especially black men, to help these students at a very important age.
