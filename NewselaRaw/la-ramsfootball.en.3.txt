HOUSTON, Texas — Los Angeles, California, has not had a football team for 21 years. During that time many have tried to bring football back again. One plan after another has failed. 

On Tuesday, team owners gathered to give it another try. Each owner owns a team in the National Football League (NFL). 

Now, Los Angeles' wait for its own football team is finally over. 

The owners voted to allow the St. Louis Rams to move from Missouri to Los Angeles. The team will start playing later this year.

The Rams' new home will be in Inglewood, a city in the greater Los Angeles area. Their new stadium will be built on the old Hollywood Park racetrack. It will be the league's biggest sports site. It will probably open in 2019.

## A Shared Stadium

The NFL owners also voted to allow a second football team to share the stadium with the Rams. Most likely, that team will be the San Diego Chargers.

The NFL owners had to decide between two plans. Both involved moving two teams to cities in Los Angeles County. 

One plan was to move the Chargers and the Oakland Raiders to Carson. The other plan was to move the Rams and a second team to Inglewood. The second team was to be decided on later.

In the end, the Inglewood plan won out. The vote was 30-2. 

The Chargers were given the right to share the new stadium with the Rams. The team has not yet said that it will come to Los Angeles, but it probably will.

One problem had to be solved before the deal could be reached. Owners Stan Kroenke and Dean Spanos had to agree to work together. Kroenke owns the Rams and Spanos owns the Chargers.

## Chargers' Owner First Supported Other Plan

Before now, Spanos has supported the Carson plan. For almost a year, the two men did not want to work together.

Now both men will probably have teams in L.A.

The new stadium will have 70,240 seats. It will be 175 feet tall. 

There will be a roof over the playing field to keep out rain. The roof will be made out of a see-through material. The stadium will be open on the sides, to let in air.

The Rams will play at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum until the new stadium is finished. 

If the Chargers also come to Los Angeles, they will need a temporary stadium too. The NFL says Angel Stadium, Dodger Stadium and the Rose Bowl are all possible places.

When the Inglewood stadium is finished, two teams will share it equally.

## After Many Failed Plans, Success At Last

Right now, there is only one shared stadium in the NFL. It is located in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The stadium is shared by the New York Giants and Jets football teams.

Over the years there have been many plans to bring football back to Los Angeles. Many different teams and places were considered. 

Four mayors tried to bring football back, all with no luck. There were plans from rich businessmen. Even stars like Garth Brooks, Tom Cruise and Magic Johnson tried to help out. Before Tuesday, every plan fizzled out.

Things finally changed in January 2014. Kroenke bought 60 acres of land next to 238 acres of Hollywood Park. Hollywood Park is owned by Stockbridge Capital. 

Later in 2014, Kroenke and Stockbridge Capital agreed to work together. They plan to build more than just the stadium on the land they own. They will also put up a music hall, housing and places to shop.

Builders expect to start working on the new stadium very soon.
