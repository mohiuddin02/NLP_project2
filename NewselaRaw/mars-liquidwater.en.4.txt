Planet Mars might have liquid water on it. It is a new discovery that has many people excited. The U.S. space agency NASA announced the discovery this week. Perhaps one day, people will be able drink the liquid water.

A lot of research was done to find the liquid water. Lujendra Ojha was in charge of the research. He is a student at Georgia Tech university. Mars is the only planet besides Earth to show that there might be water on the surface. Other planets have water under the surface. They also have water that exists as a gas. Now Mars has evidence that water can exist as a liquid.

## Lines In The Sand

Last year, other scientists learned about the water from the Mars rover. A rover is a robotic machine that can explore a planet. Scientists found that water on Mars turned to gas very quickly. The study also found a type of salt on Mars. The salt keeps the water from turning to gas so quickly.

This water may be forming lines on the planet. The lines look like wet sand. The science name for the lines is recurring slope lineae, or RSL.

Oiha and his team studied the lines on Mars. They found high amounts of the salts. It seems like the salts have been getting water, too. The water may help to form the RSL.

The scientists studied where they thought they were seeing water. They also found the salts there, Oiha said. The salts seem to disappear in areas where the lines are not forming.

## We Need A Closer Look

Oiha's work shows that the liquid saltwater may help form the RSL. It shows that Mars has liquid flowing today.

However, there is more work to do. The scientists hope that a rover can take a closer look at the RSL.

If humans ever go to Mars, they could probably use the salts, Oiha said. "We wouldn't have to bring tons of water."
