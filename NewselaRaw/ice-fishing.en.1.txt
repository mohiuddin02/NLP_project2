Ice fishing has come a long way. Once, the typical ice fisherman was a huddled figure sitting hunched over on a windswept frozen lake, watching as his hand-drilled hole froze shut.

Now that fisherman, or angler, is apt to be sitting in his or her shirtsleeves in an insulated fishing shelter. He'll likely have a glow-in-the-dark fishing line, with a propane heater glowing in one corner and a flasher depth-finder purring next to a power-drilled hole. A string of LED lights might brighten the shelter, and the angler is apt to be texting a friend while watching the flasher indicate an incoming fish.

Is it any wonder that ice fishing is becoming more popular?

"It's because it got nice," said Russ Francisco of Marine General Supply in Duluth, Minn. "We have nice equipment now. Tents became warmer. Rods and reels are high-quality. It's fun to go now."

## Shelter From The Cold

An activity that once was an exercise in suffering and endurance has become downright civilized. Ice fishing's rise in popularity has paralleled the increase in new types of ice-fishing gear, retailers say.

Lots of ice-fishing shelters are now made with sled bases built into them. The top folds into the sled, along with bait buckets, rods, tackle and heaters. The power drill, fueled by gas or propane or battery power, rides in the truck or on the snow machine.

Other shelters snap open easily and pack down small. Heaters are simpler and safer; electronics keep improving; and rods and reels are getting more sophisticated.

And even with the significant investment needed to get started in ice fishing, the sport is a relative bargain, retailers say. "It's way cheaper than summer fishing," said Mike Reedy of Northwest Outlet in Superior, Wis. "You don't have to get a boat."

And, said Ron Murphy, who is bringing Duluth its first ice fishing show, "You can do it as a family." He owns Shamrock Productions of Burnsville, Minn.

Ice fishing retailers say the winter fishing season now rivals the summer season, which is saying something in a fish-crazy state like Minnesota. "It is equal to the summer fishing in dollars and cents," Francisco said. "Every time I say that on the radio or somewhere, people question me, but it's true. There's a lot of people who just ice fish."

Scott VanValkenburg of Fisherman's Corner in Pike Lake, Minn., sees the same trend. "December and January are every bit as busy as June and July," he said.

## Bridge Over Summer And Spring

Terry Olson, manager at a Gander Mountain hunting and fishing store in Hermantown, Minn., estimated that ice fishing sales represent 25 to 33 percent of total fishing sales. "The good thing for us is that it bridges the end of the (summer) fishing season and the spring opener," he said. "Otherwise you'd have that long time with nothing in the fishing industry."

As ice now forms on the lakes around Duluth, winter anglers are making plans to get out. One grandfather was talking to Marine General's Francisco the other day about taking his 4-year-old grandson out.

According to Francisco, taking kids out on the ice is more practical than taking them out in a boat in the summer. "They can run on the ice," he said. "Part of fishing is running around with other kids. If someone else catches a fish, they can all run over to see it."

And there's always a warm shelter waiting for them if they get cold.

The other reason that ice fishing is popular in the area is that the fishing is good for lots of species. "We're lucky here," VanValkenburg said. "We've got wonderful bluegill fishing, crappie fishing and, of course, walleye fishing."

Anglers have a good shot at catching trophy walleyes in the local harbor, where the fish run up to 30 inches or longer. As soon as the ice forms there, anglers will be pulling their shelters out to fish for those walleyes.

"When the harbor freezes, to us, that's just like summer, like the opener," Francisco said. "Big walleyes is what they're looking for."

## The Ice Is Right

Beyond that, when the ice is right along the shore, anglers catch Kamloops rainbow trout and coho salmon in two rivers. If the ice gets really good offshore, anglers can catch big lake trout in Lake Superior.

"People come from all over just to say they've stood on Lake Superior and fished," Francisco said. "They come from Iowa, Indiana, the Dakotas and mostly from the Twin Cities."

Farther north in Minnesota, many inland lakes are stocked with brook trout, rainbows and splake. Native lake trout are found in other inland lakes.

At Lake of the Woods, resorts cater to ice anglers fishing for trophy walleyes from heated shacks far out on the lake. It's located partly in Minnesota, and partly in Canada.

"If you have any question about (the growth of ice fishing), look at the amount of money those resorts are investing in Lake of the Woods," Francisco said. "It's as important as summer fishing."

In fact, the amount of time spent winter fishing now far exceeds summer fishing on the Minnesota side of the lake, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
