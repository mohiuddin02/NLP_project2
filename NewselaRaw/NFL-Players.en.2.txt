A onetime point of pride for the New England Patriots has suddenly turned against the NFL team.

The team has been known for getting the most out of some talented players with character flaws. Think of receiver Randy Moss and running back Corey Dillon who had legal troubles during their careers. But it has had to defend its hiring decisions after Aaron Hernandez was arrested on murder charges.

Some teams thought the former Patriots tight end was too risky to draft when he came out of college.

New England took a chance, however, selecting the troubled University of Florida standout in the fourth round of the 2010 draft. That seemed like a bargain for a player many thought was as talented as those picked in the first round. For three seasons, the move paid off. Hernandez reached the Pro Bowl in 2011 and received a five-year contract extension worth as much as $40 million.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd and is being held without bail in a Massachusetts jail. The Patriots cut Hernandez from the team less than two hours after he was arrested on June 26. The team also let fans exchange their used Hernandez jerseys for those of any other Patriot.

## Arrest Sparks Debate In NFL

The high-profile arrest of Hernandez and the flood of information about his troubled past has sparked a debate within the NFL: When is a risky pick too risky?

"The owners are talking to their general managers as soon as this happened, saying, 'Let's make sure this doesn't happen to us,'" said former NFL coach Jimmy Johnson. He won two Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys with some troubled players on his teams. But he thinks some players who can straighten up will not get the chance to now. "... people are going to be afraid of getting into a situation like this."

Not everyone agrees. Tony Dungy won a Super Bowl as coach of the Indianapolis Colts. He believes that clubs will continue to roll the dice on players with character flaws if the price is right.

"You're going to get enough people to overlook it," Dungy said. "People will say, 'I may not want to risk drafting this guy in the first round and paying him so much that if it goes haywire I've lost out. But at some point, it's worth the risk.' That's the way it is."

He added, "Talent is the overriding factor in the NFL. Has been for a long time."

## College Players Evaluated

There were warning signs with Hernandez. He failed drug tests and had run-ins with the law in college. A scouting service said that he enjoyed "living on the edge of acceptable behavior," according to a document obtained by the Wall Street Journal.

The evaluation was prepared by Human Resource Tactics in North Carolina. It said Hernandez scored a lowest possible 1 out of 10 in "social maturity." He scored a perfect 10 in "focus" and nines in other areas. The test found that Hernandez "may be prone to partying too much and doing questionable things that could be seen as a problem for him and his team."

That evaluation was similar to one the company prepared on Maurice Clarett. The trouble-prone running back from Ohio State was chosen by Denver in the third round of the 2005 draft. He never played in the NFL and was let go from the team in training camp a month after signing a four-year contract.

"He scored high in everything but a two in social maturity," former Broncos general manager Ted Sundquist recalled. "That was his downfall in Denver, the ability to interact."

Clarett has changed for the better after spending 3-1/2 years in prison on robbery and gun charges, Sundquist said. He was assigned to monitor Clarett by former coach Mike Shanahan.

"I was the one who was counseling him all through training camp," Sundquist said. "It's like (Clarett) was upset with us for drafting him."

## More Background Checks Needed

Sundquist, the team's general manager from 2002 to 2008, said people wrongly think that the NFL provides teams with thorough background checks on prospects. At least that wasn't the case when he was in the league.

"You can contact the league for some things," he said. "But for the most part they're not going to give you what people are wanting, which is a top-to-bottom full report on a guy's character, his police blotter, all that kind of stuff."

He said typically clubs do not hire private investigators but instead rely on their area scouts to obtain background information on prospects. Some of those scouts are young and inexperienced. Often, that information comes from the player's college, which might not tell you everything.

"Some of the schools will tell you what you need," Sundquist said, "but you have to have a relationship in place to get that information. Otherwise, if it's a young scout that goes in there, they're going to protect their reputation and their head coach, and the fact that they recruited a knucklehead."
