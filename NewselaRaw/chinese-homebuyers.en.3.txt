LOS ANGELES — Real estate agent Alisha Chen began selling homes 10 years ago. Back then, she did not expect to be working with buyers from overseas.

Then U.S. housing prices dropped and Chinese money began to flood into the country. Today, Chen has a new specialty. She helps rich overseas Chinese buy homes in Southern California.

Chen's job requires some unusual skills. She has to know the different likes and dislikes of buyers from Hong Kong, mainland China, and Taiwan. She has to be able to explain the differences between Irvine and Tustin to people who have never been to the United States.

Chen also has to be able to explain how home-buying works in this country. Many of Chen's customers own businesses and are successful in their native land. However, that does not mean they understand how home sales work in the United States.

"In Taiwan you can still buy property on a napkin. Here it's a book full of paperwork and timelines," she said. "There's a lot of education I have to do."

## Wake-Up Calls

For Chen, it leads to a lot of Skype calls in the middle of the night. It also means a lot of missed sleep, because of the time difference between China and the United States.

"Eleven p.m. to 2 a.m. — that's the best time to talk," she said.

Chen now lives in Irvine, but was born in Taiwan. About five years ago, she saw a business opportunity. Homes were not selling easily in Southern California at the time. However, rich overseas Chinese were looking to buy.

Many of Chen's customers were Chinese-American. She began asking them if they knew anyone back in China who might be interested in buying a house here. She told them that good money could be made. Buyers could rent homes out or sell them for more money later on.

At first, overseas Chinese buyers were a little cautious, she recalled. "They'd say, 'OK, I'll buy one property.' Six months later they were amazed at how much they were getting back. They'd call and say, 'I want to buy more.'"

## Get It While It's Hot

Today, Chinese citizens are snatching up Southern California real estate. During the 12 months that ended in March, they bought $22 billion worth of homes in the United States. The Greater Los Angeles area is their favorite place to buy.

Some buyers are planning to move here and are getting homes for themselves. Others are buying homes for their children to live in while they attend college. Others buy homes to make money.

Selling homes to overseas buyers can be complicated.

U.S. home buyers are usually familiar with an area's neighborhoods. They can explore the streets around a property to get a feel for a place. A buyer from China is much more limited. They are forced to rely on Internet searches and maybe a quick shopping trip. Many of Chen's overseas customers buy U.S. homes without ever seeing them.

Chen has to spend a lot of time describing different neighborhoods.

"They know Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Irvine," she said. "They say, 'Where's Tustin? Where's Lake Forest?' I tell them they're right next to Irvine."

## Business Is Good, For Now

Chen now has offices in Irvine, Chino and Taiwan. Business has been good, but she wonders how much longer that will last.

The Chinese government and the U.S. government may soon make it harder for overseas Chinese to buy and make money from U.S. homes. Overseas buyers may not be be willing to pay as much as they have been. If that happens, home prices will probably drop. Chen would then start to make less money. Her earnings are based on the prices of homes she sells.

Of course, there could be an upside. People in the United States who are not rich might have an easier time buying homes.

"I think the next few years are going to be a good time for first-time buyers," Chen said.
