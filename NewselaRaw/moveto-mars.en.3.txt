DALLAS — Like many 20-somethings, Cole Leonard has reached a crossroads: Should he follow a safe job path? Or should he go for a dream that might not work out?

But few people his age face such an unusual choice: He must decide between becoming a lawyer — or dying on the surface of Mars.

It's a difficult decision for the 27-year-old, who hails from Texas. Leonard has been accepted into law school at Texas Tech for the fall. But he is also one of 705 people competing to become part of the first human colony on Mars.

## Lots Of People Signed Up

The journey is being organized by Mars One, a company founded by a Dutch [businessman](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) Bas Lansdorp. Last year, the group began inviting would-be colonists to step forward. So far, more than 200,000 people from around the world have signed up. The list will be whittled down to 24 by next year, organizers said.

Each colonist would undergo at least eight years of training. They'd learn about space travel. And they'd learn how to live on a planet with vicious dust storms, temperatures below minus 200 degrees and a lack of breathable air.

## Did We Mention You Won't Be Back?

There's just one big catch: With current technology, there is no way to return from Mars. It would be a one-way trip.

That sounds like a good deal to Leonard, though he doesn't much fit the bill of an astronaut. He doesn't have much training in flight, engineering, agriculture or medicine. When you get down to it, he doesn't yet have any of the necessary skills.

But in other ways, he says, he's a perfect choice. He's young and healthy. He has always been interested in space and science fiction. And, more importantly, he is deeply excited by the idea of exploring.

"For some reason, people think that exploration just ended" with Columbus, he said.

Still, there's some uncertainty on his part. Leonard says he doesn't doubt Mars One's sincerity, but he needs to be convinced the group can pull off its grand idea. Before leaving Earth, he'd want to know that everything has been carefully worked out. After all, he'd hate to run out of food or power or water 34 million miles from home.

## Maybe It's All Just A Dream

Leonard has simpler worries, too. He can't study to become a lawyer and train to be an astronaut at the same time. He's hesitant to give up law school for a dream that may not become real.

He'd also miss music and simple, everyday things like relaxing outdoors on a patio if he moved to Mars. There are still lots of places on Earth he hasn't seen. And, of course, there's his family, who don't want him to go.

"They flip between" being angry and "thinking it's all a joke," Leonard said.

His twin, Mitchell, said that's not completely true. The family thinks he'd be a good pick. They just don't want him to leave the planet, or to regret his decision as he journeys through space.

"The whole family knows that Cole can get picked," said Mitchell. "They already see him flying off into the sky."

Leonard said he understands that law school would be a more practical choice — and one that might lengthen his life. But certain death on Mars doesn't scare him, he says. After all, death is certain everywhere.

If he becomes a lawyer, he said, "I am going to die here in some crappy retirement home in Florida." If he's going to die anyway, he feels, why not do it somewhere exciting? "Why not Mars?"
