By springtime, a lot of high school seniors are cruising to the end of school. Maceo Rucker-Shivers cannot afford to join them.

His class work at Olympic High School in Charlotte, N.C., and his after-school job at nearby Bosch Rexroth Corp. are preparing him to work with machines. His bosses at the German company are watching to see whether his skills and work ethic measure up. If so, they will pay his community college tuition after graduation.

"You have to bring your A-game every day," Rucker-Shivers said.

His career-focused studies led him to discover a passion for building precision manufacturing equipment. "Machines excite me. They really do," he said, beaming.

The future of public education may look a lot like what Rucker-Shivers is doing right now.

## Linking Schools and Employers

It is a future with closer links among K-12 schools, community colleges and private employers. In Europe, it is common for students to follow an apprenticeship model. In the U.S., many are coming to realize training for skilled jobs is more meaningful than a four-year degree for many students. Apprenticeships also have the benefit of allowing students to start earning money right away, instead of borrowing for college.

According to a 2011 Harvard report, America's current approach to education is not just bad for the students who drop out of high school. Almost half the students who go to a four-year college leave without a diploma. And minority and low-income students finish college at a lower rate.

The report recommended offering multiple routes to adulthood, with employers playing a greater role in shaping those paths. In Europe, the report says, employers and educators not only develop the next generation of workers; they also help young people make the transition from school to "real life." Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Superintendent Heath Morrison is among those pushing this model.

The 2013-14 Charlotte school budget calls for creating career-tech hubs at traditional high schools. It also plans to launch new schools focused on internships and career skills. Olympic got a head start when it split into five career-themed mini-schools in 2006. Business partnerships, career exploration and real-life projects were a big part of the new approach.

## Forget Memorization

The usual testing and memorization will not help students in the real world, said career development coordinator Michael Realon. He used to work for business groups and now links Olympic to the business community.

Realon says Olympic helps students explore career prospects. It starts with an online assessment of their skills and interests. That gives them a list of their 20 best career "matches." It is sort of like online job "dating."

"We tell them it's like eHarmony. It's going to connect you to your soul-mate career that will make you happy," Realon said.

Rucker-Shivers knew he enjoyed hands-on work. He built houses with the charity Habitat for Humanity. He also took classes in drafting, carpentry, wood shop and principles of engineering.

Three of Olympic's five small schools have career academies. Advisers from private industry help educators create classes to prepare students for skilled jobs. At the math/science school, which Rucker-Shivers attends, the themes are energy and engineering.

Last summer, Rucker-Shivers landed a paid internship with Siemens, a German company. He worked three days a week, shadowing machinists and engineers, and spent two days studying a design process called mechatronics at a community college. It opened his eyes to a world of high-tech work.

"Siemens is three minutes from my house and I didn't know it existed," Rucker-Shivers said.

Siemens has a tradition of apprenticeship, paying young people -- generally high-school graduates -- for a combination of classroom work and on-the-job training. Now a few high school students also get a chance.

## Paid While Going to School!

Realon says students who get apprenticeships earn $9 to $10 an hour. They even get paid for finishing high school and attending community college.

Five out of 10 summer interns were offered apprenticeships, but not Rucker Shivers. This taught him another lesson: "You're not a kid anymore." You have to take initiative, he said, and solve problems to make the grade.

In January, Bosch Rexroth started hiring high school interns in the plant that makes manufacturing equipment. Rucker-Shivers was chosen, along with Carla Bailey, a senior at Hopewell High in Huntersville, N.C.

Companies are not just giving apprenticeships to be nice. Textbook knowledge is not enough to do the work. It is tough to find workers who can jump in. In Germany -- and even at the Bosch plant in Greenville, S.C.- - apprenticeships are an established way to recruit talent.

## No "Killer" Loans

"The skills we need have been lost," said Mark Rohlinger, who works in technical plant management in Charlotte. "The hands-on, practical stuff really makes or breaks people here."

Rucker-Shivers and Bailey have been adjusting machines and writing up instructions for various jobs. Rucker-Shivers took the internship with the hope of earning a full-fledged apprenticeship. That would give him paid tuition and continued on-site training. Instead of having to borrow for a traditional college education he would get a free education and near-certain employment. "Student loans are a killer," he said.

Bosch staff will not discuss pay. Realon says a national report shows machinist technicians can earn $60,000 to $100,000 a year.

Educators' enthusiasm about high-tech career training is weighed down by one reality: Creating labs at schools is expensive. That is another benefit of partnerships. A school district may not be able to afford to create machine shops at high schools, but students can go to the real workplaces instead.

Meanwhile, Rucker-Shivers recently got good news about his own economic future. His hard work paid off: He got an apprenticeship with Bosch.
