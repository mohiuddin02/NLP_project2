ENGLEWOOD, N.J. — Gerald Marion is used to fighting fires, not racism. The Englewood resident is the city's second black fire chief. He is known as a calm, strong advocate for his department who stays out of politics.

But Marion changed that on Saturday. A Florida jury said George Zimmerman was not guilty of murder. Zimmerman had admitted to killing Trayvon Martin last year. Martin was an unarmed black teenager.

The fire chief entered the racially charged controversy around the verdict this week. He asked the City Council to join a boycott. If they say yes, Englewood would not do business with companies in Florida. It and other states have stand-your-ground laws. The laws allow people to defend themselves with force if they believe someone is trying to hurt them. They don't have to retreat.

"I've never been an activist," the 46-year-old said. "I'm fed up. It should not be a law that you get to murder because you're uncomfortable."

## Boycott Movement Spreads

Marion said stand-your-ground laws hurt blacks more than other races. This is even more true when law enforcement and others think black teens are up to no good. White teens get the benefit of the doubt, he said.

"We read the news every day and you're always coming across a story … an African-American gets shot because the shooter was threatened by their presence or the shooter was reacting to a stereotype," he said. "It could be me. It could be my son. It could be my nephew."

Marion may be the first public official in New Jersey to try and boycott Florida businesses. But he is far from alone. Many people want to make Florida business leaders lean on state lawmakers to get rid of the controversial self-defense law.

Singer Stevie Wonder said he would join the boycott. That means no concerts in Florida or other states with stand-your-ground laws. More than 10,000 people have signed online petitions. People on Twitter have used hash tags such as #boycottflorida and #notflorida.

## "Has To Start With Us"

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is thinking about joining it too, said Anthony Cureton. He is an Englewood police officer and the local NAACP president. He grew up with Marion. He said he understood the fire chief's anger and the reason for his request.

"I share the same position," he said. "He has belief in this. He doesn't hold back when there's something he's passionate about. I stand with him on that point."

Marion said he would "not spend one taxpayer dollar" on anything made in Florida.

Englewood's Fire Department used to buy its trucks from a company based in Ocala, Fla. Marion said companies in New York and Wisconsin sell good fire trucks too.

"I don't want to be a target anymore," he said. "And I want someone to help. And that has to start with us."

## Anger Over Stand-Your-Ground

But elected officials may not be able to boycott. New Jersey's law does not allow preferences when a town puts out a bid to get equipment or services, said Bill Dressel. For example, if a town wants to buy a fire truck, it puts out a bid. Companies respond by naming a price. The town picks the lowest bidder.

"Local governments must follow state law," said Dressel. He is the executive director of the New Jersey association of cities.

Dressel said state lawmakers could change the law. They did years ago in boycotting South Africa when it was under apartheid, a system of laws that separated whites from non-whites.

Englewood only works with one Florida company right now. It was hired in May to make an online list of vacant properties. "This was publicly bid and they were the only bidder," City Manager Timothy Dacey said.

Councilman Marc Forman called stand-your-ground laws "an abomination," something disgusting and hateful. But he wasn't sure a boycott was the right course of action.

"I mean, we are the United States," he said. "Florida is not the only state with stand-your-ground laws."
