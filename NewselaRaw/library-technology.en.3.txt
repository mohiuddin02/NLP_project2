MINNEAPOLIS — Ridwa Yakob thought libraries were just for books.

Then she saw the Teen Tech Center at the Minneapolis Central Library. The center has rows of new computers and iPads. It has the latest video equipment. It even has its own recording studio.

"Growing up, I used to be super into reading. That's what I thought libraries were for," said Yakob, 18. Now she is a member of the library's Teen Tech Squad. As a member of the tech squad, she helps other kids use the latest technology.

Shhhhhhh. You may not know it, but libraries have become community tech centers. They don't just offer computers with free Internet. They have 3-D printers, e-readers and social media. Growing catalogs of e-books let people connect to libraries from home.

## From Books To Facebook

Librarians were once just experts on helping people find books. Now, they have become experts at finding information online as well. They help people with everything from how to use a computer to Facebook.

Library visitors wouldn't have it any other way.

People value the Internet almost as highly as books. This is according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. Most people who go to the library said that borrowing books was "very important." About the same number said free Internet also was "very important."

Libraries began offering a lot more technology after many people lost their jobs in 2008. Job seekers needed to learn computer skills. They also needed help looking for jobs online. Librarians learned to help them set up e-mail accounts. They taught computer skills. Librarians also helped people find   the most useful information online.

About the same time, e-books became popular. People started walking in with e-readers, like the Amazon Kindle — and questions.

## Using the Library Without Leaving The House

"They come and ask me for e-book help. They usually end up with a little bit more," said Andrea Egbert. She works for the Anoka County library system. Some people walk in with new e-readers, still in the box. They don't know how to turn them on. Others ask how to share photos and videos online.

Most librarians are happy to help. But they can't always solve the problem. If your iPad won't turn on because you dropped it in the bathtub, they will likely send you elsewhere.

This means that people may not visit their library as much. They may never actually see the librarian they "chat" with. People can download e-books without going to the library. And students can get free homework help by chatting with tutors on the Internet.

Librarians don't complain about these changes. They see these changes as a good thing. People don't need to set foot in the library to be able to use it, said Bernie Farrell. He is a librarian in Minneapolis.

Gretchen Christenson learned this after taking computer classes at local libraries. Since then, she uses free online help from her library. "It gives you a start, the ability to learn on your own," she said.

People also come to libraries to use technology that they don't have at home. The Ramsey County, Minn., library system bought a 3-D printer two years ago. People are able to print three-dimensional solid objects with it. The printer was bought mainly for teen programs. It became very popular. So, the library organized 3-D printing classes for adults.

Still, librarians say, there will always be books.

Barbara Stripling is the president of the American Library Association. She said that most people would rather read the regular way, ink on paper.

Libraries aren't throwing away their books anytime soon.
