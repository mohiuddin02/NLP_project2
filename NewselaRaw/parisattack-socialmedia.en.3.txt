Paris, France, suffered a horrible terror attack Friday night. More than 132 people were killed. Almost immediately Facebook and Twitter filled up with signs of support for France.

People posted old photos of themselves in front of the Eiffel Tower. Others said they were praying for Paris. Many people overlaid their pictures with the red, white and blue of the French flag.

Then suddenly a story about another terror attack popped up online. This time the attack was in Kenya.

"Man, what's happening with the world right now?" one Facebook user wrote.

"147 dead in terrorist attack on Kenya college," actress Bex Taylor-Klaus wrote. "Hate consumes and destroys."

## Finding Out About Older Attack For First Time

Several people quickly found an article on the attack written by the British Broadcasting Corp. news service. Then, they passed the article on to other people. Soon, thousands and thousands of people had read the article.

What many people did not notice was when the article was written. It was first published more than seven months ago, on April 3, 2015.

The attack in Kenya was just as terrible as what happened in Paris. Fighters killed students and others at Kenya's Garissa University College. Yet back in April there was almost nothing about it on Facebook and Twitter. There was no outpouring of sadness and support, as there was for Paris.

In fact, the old article was the first time many people had heard about the Kenya attack.

## Different Victims Spark Our Different Reactions

Many people feel that we react to terrible events differently depending on whom the victims are. Some deaths seem to matter more to us than others.

For example, the city of Beirut, Lebanon, was attacked the day before Paris was attacked. It was hit by the same violent group, Islamic State. Also called ISIS, the group wants to start its own country under Islamic law and has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq.

Hardly anyone mentioned the Beirut attack on Facebook or Twitter.

Some people think the difference is unfair, even racist. They believe it shows that Americans and other Westerners care less about people who are not Western or white.

The problem is complicated. It certainly has something to do with which stories get covered more by the news. Many people simply had not heard about the attacks in Kenya and Beirut. Perhaps that is less their fault than it is the fault of newspapers and TV, which decide which stories are most important.

## Caring Tied To Our Feelings Of Closeness

One thing seems clear, though. People are more likely to care when terrible things happen to people and places to which they feel close.

It is perhaps only natural that most Americans were more upset by the attack in Paris. Many Americans know Paris in a way they do not know Kenya and Beirut.

After all, Paris is a popular vacation place for Americans and other Westerners. Even those who have never set foot in France are familiar with Paris. They have learned about it through books, TV shows and movies.

## Americans Hold Paris Dear

It is that closeness to Paris that made so many Americans express their sadness and shock on Facebook and Twitter. It was almost as if a friend had died.

Not many Americans have traveled to Kenya or Beirut. For that reason it is understandable that Americans did not react as much to the killings in those places. However, that does not mean it is right for us to care less.

It does not matter that we do not have vacation photos taken in Kenya or Beirut. We do not get to ignore the horrible killings in those places.

Deep down, everyone knows that. Knowing it is what made so many people share an article from seven months ago. They wanted to show the world that they care about Kenya too.
