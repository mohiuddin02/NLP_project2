CHAMELA, Mexico — Although it is one of history's most powerful storms, Hurricane Patricia caused surprisingly little damage Saturday.

The storm landed in an area of Mexico's Pacific Coast where few people live. It then crashed into the mountains and quickly blew over.

The popular beach city of Puerto Vallarta and the port of Manzanillo were spared the worst of the violent weather.

Authorities were still checking on some areas, where roads had been blocked by fallen trees. Yet the hurricane caused far less destruction than feared.

## Damage But No Deaths Or Injuries

There were no reports of deaths or injuries, said Roberto Lopez Lara, a top official for the Mexican state of Jalisco, where the hurricane landed. Later, President Enrique Pena Nieto reported that between 3,000 and 3,500 homes had been damaged. The storm also affected about 8,650 acres of farmland. Nieto also said that 235,000 people had lost electricity when the storm hit.

It was a remarkable ending, considering that Patricia had been a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest on a scale of 1 to 5. Winds blew up to 200 miles per hour before coming ashore. It landed in an area dotted with sleepy villages and a few fancy hotels.

## "Five Hours Riding The Monster"

Townspeople described a terrifying night.

"Those were the longest five hours of my life," said Sergio Reyna Ruiz. He took cover in a neighbor's home when Patricia passed over the village of La Fortuna, about two miles from the ocean. "Five hours riding the monster."

Before the storm hit, Reyna Ruiz tried to tie down the shingles of his roof with metal cables. The storm blew off some of the shingles, and blue sky could be seen through the ceiling. He and family members tried to clean up the damage. They sawed through a fallen tree and put wet mattresses and books into the sun to dry.

All were thankful that everyone survived. "It's something to tell the grandchildren," Reyna Ruiz said.

## Returning Home To Find Village Flattened

Down the road in Chamela, people searched for anything that could be saved. All 40 families that live there took shelter in nearby San Mateo. When they returned, they could hardly recognize their village.

Arturo Morfin Garcia's home collapsed into a jumble of bricks and beams. The only part left standing was a concrete bathroom at one end.

"It was hard to come back and find this," Morfin Garcia said. "So much work to build something. It makes me very sad, but what can we do with these natural phenomena?"

About 200,000 people live in Puerto Vallarta, including thousands of U.S. residents and visitors. The city was largely unaffected by the storm, which touched ground about 65 miles southeast. After the hurricane passed, people snapped selfies next to a seaside sculpture, and business owners swept sidewalks as they would on any morning.

"We were fortunate as to where it made landfall. It was not a densely populated area," said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist for the National Hurricane Center, run by the U.S. government. "You and I would be having a very different conversation if this went over the top of Puerto Vallarta."

## A Quick Rise, A Quick Fall

On Saturday, Patricia's winds dropped to 30 miles per hour, according to the hurricane center.

It seem like a miracle that such a monster storm could cause so little harm. Patricia formed suddenly Oct. 20 and quickly strengthened to a hurricane. Within 30 hours it had zoomed to a record-beating Category 5 storm, surprising many with how rapidly it grew.

By Friday, it had become the most powerful hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere.

Patricia's power while still out at sea was about as strong as Typhoon Haiyan, according to the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization. The typhoon, a hurricane at sea, left more than 7,300 dead or missing in the Philippines two years ago.

## Well Prepared For Storm — But Also Lucky

Hurricane experts praised Mexico's skill at storm preparations and gave credit to good fortune.

The mountains in the area quickly weakened the storm. Another factor was the speed of the storm. It was moving so quickly at landfall — about 20 miles per hour — that its heavy rains did not stay in place long enough to create terrible flooding, said Jeff Masters. He is the head meteorologist at Weather Underground, a weather information service.

A top government official in Mexico, Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, put it another way, "Nature was good to us."
