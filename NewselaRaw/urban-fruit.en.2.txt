CHICAGO, Ill. â€” It used to be nothing but a patch of dirt on the South Side of Chicago. But then Breanne Heath came along with a simple idea to transform the unused land: Turn it into a farm where visitors can pick their own fruit. That's exactly what she's done.

The site is nearly half an acre. It is now a pick-your-own-farm in the city. It will offer fresh raspberries, ground cherries, rhubarb, pumpkins and other produce. It will open this summer as The Pie Patch.

Heath loves to garden and help others. She enjoys picking fresh fruit but realized there was nowhere to do it in Chicago. She would have to drive to a different state if she wanted to pick apples or strawberries.

Her goal with The Pie Patch is simple: Get more food to more people.

## Su Casa's Not-So-Secret Garden

The plot of land is owned by Su Casa Catholic Worker. Su Casa is a nonprofit that helps Spanish-speaking women and children in Chicago. Heath will manage the farm and donate the money she earns or fruit she grows back to Su Casa. The nonprofit has a food pantry and a soup kitchen, so Su Casa will use the food to help the people it serves.

Su Casa and Heath are using the land creatively. Before they came along, it was an empty plot. Heath says they are providing a benefit to the community by working together.

Heath does not expect to make a profit on the farm. But she is OK with that.

"This is something that people might find value in, something that's good for the community," she said. "It's more about doing something that is needed than doing something that is going to give me a profit."

The Pie Patch is not the only urban farm in Chicago. Still, Heath says the idea of picking your own food is unique, and it appeals to many people who want to eat healthy local food.

## Food Lessons "Right Off The Vine"

Sarah Krieger is a registered dietitian and nutritionist with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. She helps people decide what they should be eating. She thinks urban gardens like The Pie Patch are great. They are educational because people learn more about their food and the nutritional value of what they're eating. She said this is important for kids.

"If they only see fruits and vegetables in the store, they think they grow right outside the grocery store," Krieger said. "But if they get in the dirt, pick it right off the vine and eat it, it's a great learning tool."

Cecelia Pompeii is a dietitian at The University of Chicago. She said that urban farms are beneficial in low-income neighborhoods. When people may have access to only public transportation, travel to other grocery stores may be difficult. Having a garden close by is helpful.

An urban farm like The Pie Patch may also plant an idea about healthier eating. Produce is an alternative to unhealthy choices, like processed or fast food.

## Discounts For Food-Stamp Users

The goal of The Pie Patch is to provide low-cost, healthy options to local residents.

Some of the produce they will sell may be priced by the pound. But mostly, customers will pay a set amount of money for a container. Then they can fill the container up with whatever looks good and fresh.

The Pie Patch also will let customers who do not earn a lot of money use food stamps to pay for their produce. People using food stamps will get a discount. The farm has special technology to accept the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program card, which is like a credit card for food stamps.

## Plenty Of Produce In A "Peaceful" Place

The Pie Patch will offer a great variety of produce depending on the season, including raspberries, rhubarb, grapes, strawberries, sweet potatoes, pumpkins and squash. The earliest the farm will open is June.

Until the farm opens, Heath will be busy finding space for about 3,000 strawberry plants. Strawberries will be the farm's biggest crop, but they will not be ready until late spring 2016.

When she isn't spending time at The Pie Patch, Heath works as a garden and education manager at Peterson Garden Project. In her free time, she will manage The Pie Patch. She expects that visitors will be able to pick fruit twice a week at the farm to start.

Heath called the space "peaceful" and said she hopes the farm can be a place where people  "linger and have a picnic and just enjoy things." Heath grew up spending her days outside among blackberries and flowers. She hopes, she said, to provide other people with similar experiences.
