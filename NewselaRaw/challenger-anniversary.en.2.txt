ORLANDO, Fla. — A little more than a minute after launch, space shuttle Challenger was ripped apart. A rubber seal separating parts of the spacecraft had failed. Spurts of rocket flame broke through and set a giant fuel tank on fire.

Challenger's disintegration high above Kennedy Space Center occurred 30 years ago this Thursday. Seven astronauts were killed, among them teacher Christa McAuliffe.

"We will never forget them," President Ronald Reagan said in an address to the nation shortly afterward. "The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them."

## Drive For Space Has Faded

However, today nearly half the country is too young to remember the disaster or was not yet born when it happened. The memory of America's first loss of astronauts in flight has faded. With it, the drive to keep pushing into space has faded as well.

Howard Lieb is one who remembers Challenger's fate vividly. A New York dentist, Lieb lives part of each year in Florida. As a father, he has not forgotten the faces of McAuliffe's parents in news photos.

At the time of the disaster, he said, there was national will to try again and do better. Many were inspired by Reagan's promise that "nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue."

However, in the past 30 years the country's attitude toward the dangers of space flight has changed, Lieb said. Today, "we've begun to look at such risks as unacceptable," he said.

## Government Shuttle Program Ends

How Challenger lessons will affect the nation's future in space remains unclear. The government-run National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has neither the money nor a spacecraft to send astronauts to Mars anytime soon. 

In 2011, NASA's space shuttle program was ended — but that does not mean an end to space exploration. A private, commercial rocket business has developed to take NASA's place.

Private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin have helped restore excitement around space exploration. Cape Canaveral saw 17 rockets launched last year, marking a 12-year high. The launch count is expected to increase this year.

Not everyone has forgotten the Challenger disaster, of course. At the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, it is far from forgotten. The center's mission is to make sure that Americans continue to honor and be inspired by the astronauts' sacrifice.

## Challenger Center Inspires Students

The center was founded in 1986 by the families of the astronauts who died. Since then its programs have expanded to more than 40 schools, universities and museums.

"When you enter a Challenger Center, all of them have pictures of the crew on the walls," said Lance Bush, the group's president. "When children come in to get their briefings, they are told about these heroic individuals."

So far, more than 4.4 million students have visited the centers. 

Families of the seven-member crew lost in the shuttle Columbia accident in 2003 have added their support. 

"It's important to have programs like this that inspire adventure and discovery," said Laura Husband, 25\. She is the daughter of Rick Husband, commander during Columbia's ill-fated flight.

## Disaster Led To Focus On Safety

Roger Launius helps run Washington, D.C.'s National Air and Space Museum. NASA once seemed like it could do no wrong, he said, but following the Challenger disaster that image was lost.

After Challenger exploded, NASA pledged to redesign the shuttle's flawed rockets. It also promised to remake the agency's approach to safety.

Then came a second disaster, 17 years later. In 2003, space shuttle Columbia disintegrated during re-entry. The investigator of that disaster said NASA was still failing to do enough to make flights safer.

NASA and others began trying to figure out what had gone wrong.

## Memory Of Explosion Still Strong

Bob Crippen was a pilot during the first shuttle flight in 1981 and flew three more times as commander. In his opinion, the lessons of Challenger and Columbia remain important today.

When rocket parts were damaged during earlier spaceflights, NASA did not do enough to figure out what went wrong, he said. Instead, it went ahead without having really solved the problem. He hopes future shuttle projects will learn from those mistakes.

At the Kennedy Space Center visitors' area, manager Mike Ciannilli said he often hears stories from people who remember exactly where they were when the Challenger exploded: in a fourth-grade classroom, at home watching television with family, or outdoors craning their neck to see Challenger rising.

The memories remind Ciannilli that the moment does not belong only to NASA. Instead, the explosion had an enormous effect on many who witnessed it, he said.

It is an extremely important event in their lives, Ciannilli said.
