RIYADH - Saudi Arabia is the one country in the world where women are not allowed to drive. On Thursday a group of Saudi women went driving anyway in protest. Then, they posted photographs and video clips on the Internet showing them driving. The women risked arrest with their actions.

Things are slowly getting better for Saudi women who want to drive. More people support the idea. The supporters are also talking more publicly. On Tuesday, a female member of the powerful Shoura Council suggested women should be allowed to drive. The Council is appointed by King Abdullah and advises the government.

Right now, though, Saudi women cannot get a driver's license. And women who do get behind the wheel have been arrested. They've been charged with disorderly conduct or for protesting.

The recently uploaded photos and videos showed women driving on busy streets in the capital city of Riyadh. One clip showed a woman driving in the traditional veil, with only her eyes showing. Passing motorists slowed and gave her a thumbs-up sign.

## Saudi Roads Becoming More Open?

One of the women was stopped by police. She was taken to a police station, though it's still not clear if she will be charged with a crime.

Another female activist said uploading the video clips and photographs was the first step of a two-part effort. The goal is to change people's ideas about women driving in the kingdom.

In the second stage, women with driver's licenses issued by other countries will get behind the wheel. This action will take place on Oct. 26.

"To drive with a license should not be against the law," the activist said. Also, many Saudis have become more open to the idea of women driving, she said.

"The authorities, the country, how people think has changed," she said.

## Religious Conservatives Clamp On The Brakes

But a number of powerful religious figures are still against the idea of women driving. They argue that if women start to drive, men and women will mix too freely. Many in Saudi Arabia believe women shouldn't talk to men they aren't related to.

Others point out how inconvenient it is that women can't drive. It makes it very hard for women to work, pick up their children or go shopping. Many families are forced to hire expensive private drivers.

They also point out that Saudi women living outside of cities frequently drive. They usually aren't stopped by police.

The Shoura Council must now decide whether to accept its female member's suggestion that women be allowed to drive. If it does, it will pass the idea on to the government.

The councilwoman's suggestion was widely reported in the Saudi press. Some newspapers even declared that women should be allowed to drive.
