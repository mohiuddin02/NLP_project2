FOXBOROUGH, Mass. â€” The Super Bowl is this Sunday. It is the biggest, most important football game of the year. This year, the New England Patriots are playing against the Seattle Seahawks.

To get to the Super Bowl, the Patriots beat the Indianapolis Colts on January 18th. They won the game 45 to 7. But now some people are saying that they cheated.

The footballs that the Patriots used against the Colts did not have the right amount of air in them. As a result, they were softer than normal footballs and easier to throw and catch. This may have helped the Patriots beat the Colts. If air was let out of the balls on purpose, it would have been cheating.

## Footballs Used In First Half

You may not be able to tell when you're watching a game on TV, but each team uses its own footballs when it is on offense. The two teams take turns playing offense and defense, and the balls that are used switch with each turn. It seems that the balls that the Patriots played with were softer and easier to handle than they should have been.

After the first half of the game, the Colts told referees that the balls were underinflated. The footballs were tested, and it turned out to be true. New balls were used for the second half of the game.

People have nicknamed the mystery "deflategate." The big question, now, is how the footballs came to be deflated. Was it an accident, or a case of cheating?

Patriots coach Bill Belichick said that his team did not do anything wrong. He spoke to reporters on Saturday afternoon. "We feel like we followed the rules of the game," he said. "We try to do everything right."

## Loss Of Air Pressure

At first, Belichick said that he had no idea why the balls were deflated. On Saturday, however, he had a guess.

He blamed the weather. He said a drop in temperature could have caused the change in air pressure of the footballs. If you take a ball from a warm place to a cool place, it loses air pressure. The balls were inflated in a warm room by NFL officials. Then they were used in the game, which was on a cold day.

He also explained that the Patriots had looked into how they prepare balls before each game.

Teams are allowed to rub new footballs to break them in after they are inflated. It helps make them softer and easier to grip. Belichick suggested that the friction caused by rubbing the balls could have raised their temperature, which would raise the air pressure inside. After they were taken out of the warm room, there would be an even bigger drop in temperature, and a bigger drop in air pressure.

He admitted that this was just an idea. He does not know for sure. "I'm not a scientist. I'm not an expert," Belichick said. "I'm just telling you what I know."

## Team Of Cheaters?

Not everyone believes his explanation, however. People have been arguing about what really happened since "deflategate" began.

After the game, news reports came out that the Patriots' footballs had been deflated. The NFL is trying to figure out how it happened.

People began asking if Belichick had deflated the balls on purpose. Others were suspicious of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Like Belichick, Brady denied having done anything against the rules. He said that he didn't know how the footballs were deflated.

"Deflategate" has led some people to call the Patriots a team of cheaters. Belichick defended his players, however. He does not think that his players did anything wrong.

In his opinion, the Patriots are the best team and deserve to go to the Super Bowl. "I know that because I've been with them every day. And I'm proud of this team," he said.
