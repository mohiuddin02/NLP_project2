NOVOAZOVSK, Ukraine â€” Russia invaded Ukraine Thursday, a Ukrainian official said. Russian tanks fired missiles at the Ukrainian military, he said. Ukraine's guards on the border were beaten. Russian tanks then rolled into the country.

The United States also said that Russia had invaded Ukraine. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) gave evidence of the invasion. NATO is a group of countries that defend one another.

A NATO official said at least 1,000 Russian soldiers were in Ukraine. They fought against Ukrainian soldiers. He said another 20,000 Russian soldiers were right over the Russian border.

Rebels inside Ukraine have been fighting against Ukraine's government for months. Russia supports the rebels. The rebels consider themselves to be Russian even though they live in Ukraine. They also speak Russian. They want parts of Ukraine to separate from Ukraine and join Russia.

## Fears Of Widening War In Eastern Ukraine

The southeastern town of Novoazovsk is thought to be under the control of Russia and the rebels. The invasion spread the war to southeastern Ukraine. Before, the war was fought north of Novoazovsk.

Some fear that Russia is widening the war. It could push the U.S. and some European countries to stop trading with Russia.

There are already some blocks on trade. The trade blocks are meant to punish Russia for taking over the Ukrainian region of Crimea in March. Russia sees Crimea as part of Russia. Until 1954 it was part of Russia. Over half of the Crimeans consider themselves Russian.

Blocks on trade were increased after a Malaysian airplane was shot down. There were people from many other counties on the plane. The U.S. and some European countries blamed Russia. They said the rebels shot down the plane with a Russian missile.

## NATO Photos Show Russians In Ukraine

NATO spokesman Nico Tak said that Russia wants to help the rebels win the war. Tak said the Ukrainian military had been winning in the northern part of eastern Ukraine.

NATO also took satellite photos. NATO said they prove that Russian soldiers are inside Ukraine.

Tak said Russia has given tanks and other weapons to rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Alexander Zakharchenko is the leader of the rebels. He said on Russian television that 3,000 to 4,000 Russians have fought alongside the rebels.

U.S. government spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Russia was hiding its actions.

She said Russian forces are being sent inside Ukraine. They are not told where they are going, Psaki said. She also said that reports tell of soldiers being buried in Russia after getting killed in Ukraine.

## Rebels Reach Town Through Russia

Journalists have reported seeing rebels outside Novoazovsk. On Wednesday the rebels entered Novoazovsk. The only way rebels could have reached it was coming through Russia.

Novoazovsk lies along the road connecting Russia to Crimea. Russia still controls Crimea.

Some experts think that the rebels want to link Russia and Crimea by land. It could give them or Russia control over the Sea of Azov. Experts think the sea is rich in gas and minerals. Russia could gain money from controlling all of the Sea of Azov.

Journalists have run into many Russians among the rebels. Ukraine also captured 10 Russian soldiers Monday inside Ukraine.
