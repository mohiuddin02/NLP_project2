BALTIMORE â€” Nathaniel Epstein was going to get on an airplane. He waited in line at the airport with his mother, Jennifer Bishop. Flying on an airplane is very hard for Nathaniel. He has autism.

Autism makes people think about the world differently. People with autism sometimes do not know why we do things. It can be scary for them.

Today they were going to get on an airplane. But the airplane will stay at the airport. The airplane will not move. They were going to practice how to fly. When you practice, you do something to get better at it.

Jennifer and her son were in a special program. It is called Wings for Autism. It teaches kids with autism how to get on and off airplanes.

## Airports Can Be Scary

Flying on an airplane can be scary. For people with autism it is worse. Airports have long lines to wait in. Airport workers look inside everyone's bags. People with autism do not know why.

Airports are also noisy. There are noises you do not hear at school or at home. Airplanes zoom past outside. It can be scary.

Nathaniel is 14 years old. He flew on a plane once before. He was only 4 years old. The trip was very hard. Nathaniel was scared. But his mother was ready to try again.

Nathaniel can walk. But he spends a lot of time in a wheelchair, Jennifer said. New places scare him. If he is afraid, he sometimes sits down and will not walk.

## Good Job!

Many families were at the airport to practice. They got on the plane and sat in seats. They got pretzels and water. The airplane did not fly anywhere.

The families were off the airplane in 30 minutes. It was the fastest little trip to nowhere.

Nathaniel had a hard time getting on the airplane. At first, he did not want to get out of his wheelchair. He wanted his mom next to him. She was behind him pushing the wheelchair.

So Nathaniel's mom walked with him onto the airplane.

They sat down in the first seat. Nathaniel smiled. He had done it.
