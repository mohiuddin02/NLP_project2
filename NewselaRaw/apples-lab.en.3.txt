GENEVA, N.Y. — The trees at Cornell University's research orchard this fall are loaded with apples. There are waxy apples, deep-red apples, round apples, oval apples. You can smell autumn in the air.

The thousands of trees here are tended for a single goal: to grow apples with just the right mix of sweetness, tartness and crunch.

The orchard is part of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station. Essentially, it is a 50-acre lab devoted to developing new kinds of apples. These have to be tasty, but also easy to grow and ship.

The station has released 66 apple varieties over more than a century, including Cortland and Macoun. Now it has two new kinds of apples that will be offered at farm markets this fall: SnapDragon and RubyFrost.

## A Taste Testing Tree Trek

"I could never be a medical doctor; I don't like blood. But I can create," breeder Susan Brown said. By crossing different kinds of apples, she can make fruit no one has ever seen or tasted. "Sometimes it's a home run and sometimes it's a spitter."

Brown is a professor of agriculture at Cornell University. Since 1990, she has been breeding apples. On a sunny day this week, she walked through rows of her apple trees and offered fruit to taste. One apple was juicy but mushy. Another was exceptionally firm and crisp.

"You would not want to eat this with dentures," she said with a laugh.

Brown's team is looking for crisp and tasty apples. They also pay close attention to the smells that add so much to an apple's flavor. An appealing apple might smell a bit like cherry. Or it might have a certain grassiness to its aroma.

But researchers also want apples that are easy for farmers to grow. That means they must hold up well against insects and tree diseases. And they look for apples that aren't easily bruised during shipping.

## Delicious, But Blisters Phase It Out

One promising variety was rejected because many of its leaves turned spotty. A green apple that tasted delicious also had to be dropped because it developed blister spots.

Those blister spots were only "skin deep," Brown said. Still, people probably would not buy the apples because of them.

The researchers here have the latest technology. But most of their work is pretty much the same as what breeders have done for hundreds of years. First, pollen is collected from unopened blossoms. Then, it is applied to female parts of another tree's flower. Once a seedling — a young new tree — is created, it can take four years before its fruit is ready for tasting.

Researchers try to add together the good parts of two different kinds of apples — say, the sweetness of one with the way another holds up against insects. But things often don't turn out as expected. After all, human parents can have children who aren't much like them. So too, new apples often turn out in ways no one could have guessed. About 95 percent of the seedlings are rejected.

"It's a numbers game. We plant out thousands and thousands of seedling trees," Brown's assistant Kevin Maloney said. "If they're not exceptional quality or something we can use in the breeding program, they're removed."

## SnapDragon: The Next Generation

Brown has high hopes for two new apples that will be sold at dozens of farm markets in New York this fall.

SnapDragon crosses Honeycrisp with a Jonagold-like apple that is easier for farmers to manage. RubyFrost is high in vitamin C. It also resists browning, which is important now that apple slices have become popular in stores and restaurants.

But Brown is already thinking of creating an even better apple. She believes she can breed an apple that is still more resistant to browning. And she thinks she can make it have as much vitamin C as an orange.

"I've already made the next generation, crossing SnapDragon and RubyFrost," she said.
