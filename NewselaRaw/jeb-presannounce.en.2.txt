MIAMI, Fla. — Neither his father nor his brother was in the audience on Monday. Still, Jeb Bush joked about his connections to both men. He drew laughs when he said he met his first president the day he was born and the second the day he came home from the hospital.

Bush had come to Miami Dade College to formally announce his run for the White House. He soon turned serious, and made his point clearly and humbly: The presidency, he said, was something to be earned, not inherited.

"Not a one of us deserves the job" because of seniority or family connections, the former Florida governor said.

"It's nobody's turn," Bush went on, in what also served as a poke at the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton. "It's everybody's test, and it's wide open — exactly as a contest for president should be."

## Family Connections Could Be A Hurdle

Jeb Bush is the son of former President George H.W. Bush and the younger brother of former President George W. Bush. His family connections have made him the assumed Republican front-runner, yet they could work against him as well. Voters may resent him if they think he believes he deserves to be president simply because he is a Bush.

The official launch of Bush's candidacy was a mere formality after six months of heavy campaigning. Still, it served as a fresh start of sorts for a candidacy that has proved less than overwhelming. The event drew hours of television coverage and dozens of reporters to swampy south Florida. It was attended by his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, and his wife, children and other family members.

The launch was carefully designed to signal that Bush will be a new sort of Republican, even at age 62.

Indeed, Bush's rally was no ordinary Republican gathering. The typical Republican voter is aging, white and rural. On Monday, Latin music pulsed outside the college gymnasium where the announcement was made. English, Spanish and several other languages mingled together at the event.

## He Hopes To Attract New Voters To The Party

Many people think that to continue to do well politically the Republican Party will have to attract new voters, because the party's traditional white, rural base is shrinking. Jeb Bush hopes to be able to do just that.

On Monday, Bush delivered the message he hopes will serve him through the long, grinding campaign. It featured can-do confidence and a highly flattering recitation of his record as governor.

Bush also took turns criticizing the administration of President Barack Obama and swatting at his Republican rivals. He suggested that his time as governor had prepared him to serve as president. "Executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that," he said.

## Much Of His Message Sounds Traditional

Yet for all the newness he sought to project and despite the many young people in the audience, much of Bush's message was traditionally Republican. It included calls for lower taxes, less regulation and more limited government. His promise to banish the special interests and "shake up the culture of Washington" is standard for candidates of both parties.

Bush laid out an ambitious goal of 4 percent annual growth for each year he is president. The result, he said, would be 19 million new jobs.

Bush, who started in Florida politics in the early 1980s, had been mentioned as a presidential prospect for years. Still, he surprised many in December when he finally expressed interest in running.

Perhaps more surprising, though, has been his somewhat poor performance since.

## Bush Faces A Crowded Republican Field

Far from being the commanding front-runner, Bush has failed to break free of a large and growing field of Republican rivals. More than a dozen hopefuls have declared their candidacy or are weighing a White House bid.

Even Marco Rubio, Florida's junior senator, declined to stand aside for Bush, who helped guide Rubio early in his political career.

Bush last ran for office more than a dozen years ago. His political rustiness has shown, most notably when he fumbled an easily foreseen question about whether he backed the unpopular war his brother launched in Iraq. Bush finally said that, given what is known today, he would not have supported the war.

Bush is also out of step with the Republican Party overall. The party has grown much more conservative — more attached to traditional ideas — since he last ran for office. Many Republicans may see him as not conservative enough and too much like a Democrat.

On Monday, Bush suggested that to win the presidency he would bring the Republican Party to his way of thinking, not the other way around. If he succeeds, that in itself would be a historic achievement.
