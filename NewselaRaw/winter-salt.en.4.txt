SEDALIA, Mo. â€” Cities and towns across the country use rock salt to keep their roads safe in winter. But now the salt is hard to get.

This winter has been really fierce. The weather doesn't look like it is getting any better, either.

Pettis County, Mo., is an example. The county just received 8 inches of snow in a nasty storm. Schools were closed for two days.

There are about 200 tons of salt left piled in the county. That may not be enough. The county has already used 400 tons. Last winter it used only 50 tons.

"If we don't have more ice storms we'll be fine," County Commissioner Brent Hampy said.  "But if we have two more ice storms, we're going to be out."

## Some Places Out Of Salt

The cold has spread over much of the country. That means there's a greater need than usual. Salt producers are forced to limit what they sell to each customer. Some cities are so low on salt that they are salting only main roads. They use sand for the rest.

"I think pretty much every salt mine in the country is out now, or very nearly," said Harold Mayo. He is general manager of the Hutchinson Salt Mine in Kansas. Much of the Midwest's salt is mined at Hutchinson. "It's just a very unusual winter as far as demand."

The mine is producing 3,300 tons of salt a day. That is all it can produce. People who call trying to buy salt are still being turned away.

People who use salt at home on driveways, sidewalks and stairs are also being hit. Hardware stores in Missouri and Kansas said they were out.

Many private snowplow companies are out of salt too. Jileen Wingerter works at Marcum's Landscaping near Kansas City, Mo. She said her company was told it couldn't order any more. States and cities had too much demand. "We're totally out," she said.

Some places are trying to mix salt with other things to keep the roads safe. They are using beet syrup and potato juice. Some have even tried the salty waste that comes from making cheese, called brine. Tomatoes and a corn-based product are also used to improve how well the salt sticks. That cuts down on the amount of salt they use.

## Moving Salt Supplies Around

Mike Demaray is the sales manager for Beet 55. The sticky stuff turns the snow a brownish color. But Demaray says it can cut the amount of salt used by a third. That would save money, he said.

Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation is trying out Beet Heet. The product is made from sugar beet molasses. Other states are using the same or similar products.

Officials are also trying to move salt around the country. They want to get it from places it isn't needed to places that have nearly run out.

"We have enough in the state, but just not in the right places," said Michael Sproul. He is an engineer for the state of Wisconsin.

New York the is changing rules to get salt where it is needed. It is not enforcing national limits on driving hours for salt truck drivers. The drivers can work as long as they have to now until the emergency is over. Transportation officials are ignoring weight restrictions on bridges for now. The change allows larger loads of salt to move through.

Some counties may not be ordering up more salt any time soon, even if they can get it. That's because the price has doubled because of the need, Pettis County's Hampy said.
