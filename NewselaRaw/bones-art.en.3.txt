LEXINGTON, Ky. â€” Even before he started school, Jason Borders tended to collect unusual objects. Among them were animal bones. He found them while exploring his neighborhood, the Henry Clay Estate in Lexington, Ky.

He always had a little cabinet of weird things in his room, and in the garage, Borders remembers.

Years later, Borders still is collecting bones and other curiosities. These days, though, Borders covers them with his own detailed designs. They hang in art galleries, where they sell for hundreds and thousands of dollars each.

Borders now lives in Portland, Ore., with his wife, Elizabeth. He was back in Lexington this month to show his work at a downtown shop.

## Look Like Paisley Patterns

The pieces are animal bones, mostly skulls. Into each Borders has engraved and inked complicated designs of lines and dots. They look like the patterns found in traditional tattoos from India and the Middle East.

The designs usually are not symmetrical. Instead, they take on forms that can look like old maps or paisley patterns, among other things.

Borders says he doesn't go into an artwork with any set plan. He lets the design guide him, and is frequently surprised by the results. When done, he usually inks and puts a finish on the bone, often giving it a particular color.

Borders says he remembers always making things with his hands. Growing up, he took classes presented by the Lexington Art League. Eventually, he began working with Lexington artist Gayle Cerlan.

After graduating from high school in 2005, Borders went to the Columbus College of Art and Design. Shortly after finishing art school, he moved to Oregon.

## Day Of The Dead Elk

At first, Border only used traditional art supplies, such as paper or clay. Then, a few years ago, he happened to come across a dead elk.

He loaded most of it into his car, Borders says, laughing. "I almost got arrested doing this."

At home, after cleaning the bones, he noticed his grinding tool. Someone gave it to him for Christmas.

"I picked it up and started working on" the bones, Borders says.

At first, Borders says, the bones were just something he experimented with. Over time, however, they became more and more central to his work.

Mulberry &amp; Lime has several of Borders' paintings, but his bone pieces are more famous.

Not surprisingly, his use of bones gets a lot of attention. Some people find it scary, others find it daring and cool. Borders doesn't like either view. It annoys him "when people just see them as carved bones and aren't actually paying attention to the art."

The same Borders style is visible in the bones, his paintings and his other work.

## From Bone To Bone

"I always work in the same way, have the same approach," he says.

In addition, one bone is not the same as another.

"With bones, they may be similar in shape, but there are all different kinds you could imagine." Beyond that, there's the hardness and thickness "of the bone, how long it was left outside, the age of the animal when it died." All those things "affect the way I work and the way it looks at the end." From bone to bone, "nothing's ever quite the same."

A question he frequently gets is, How does he get the bones?

"I will often go trade with local farmers," Borders says. He might "do a couple hours work or trade them a small piece of art for a bunch of bones."

He adds, "I find them. I keep a bunch of trash bags in my car. I go out to the woods a lot. Nowadays, though, I'm the bone guy. People bring me bones, a lot."

He says he tried to count all the skulls in his house and lost track at about 40.

His wife is cool with that.

"We've been together 12 years," Borders says. She's used to him by now.
