An Illinois lawmaker wants to change the state's hunting law. She wants to keep hunters from using unmanned planes. The small planes are called drones. They can be flown by someone on the ground.

Illinois lawmaker Julie Morrison proposed a law this month. It would stop people from using drones to hunt and fish.

The law would be based on the idea of "fair chase." That means giving animals a fair chance against hunters.

## An Unfair Hunt With Drones

Illinois already has several rules to preserve fair chase. The state does not let hunters use bait to attract wildlife. Dogs cannot be used to kill. Hunters also cannot use certain lights to see animals at night.

Chris Young works for the Illinois department in charge of wildlife. Young said there have been no reports of anyone using drones for hunting yet. However, he said drones have become cheaper. The state wants to take action before there is a problem.

Hunters might use drones to coax wildlife to them, Young said. They might also use drones to locate wildlife. Then they could go to that spot to hunt.

Drones would limit fair chase, Young said. Fair chase is an "important" idea in hunting, he said.

## Hunting Is Not Easy

Other states already limit the use of drones in hunting. They include Montana, Alaska and Colorado. Animal-rights supporters and hunters have welcomed this.

John Bostic owns a business that guides hunters in the woods. He has been hunting for more than 40 years. He is also in favor of banning drones for hunting in Illinois.

"It's not hunting to me if it's too easy," Bostic said.

Linda Estrada also wants to stop hunters from using drones. Estrada runs a group that protects animals.

"The animal wouldn't have a chance whatsoever," she said.

## Why Not Drone Scouts?

Some hunting guide businesses disagree. They want to use drones to scout for animals.

Scouting involves exploring a hunting area ahead of time. Hunters do this to gather information on the animals. Drones could help them. Video cameras can be attached to the drone. The cameras would send pictures and information from the wilderness back to the person controlling the drone.

Jason Parent is a New Hampshire lawmaker. He also owns a hunting guide service. He says hunters should be able to use drones. It could be good for business, he said. Customers could save time and money. It would also increase the chance of hunters finding animals.

He said hunters already use other devices. They use cameras on stands in the woods to watch for animal activity. They also use stands in trees, he said. Those let hunters look for animals from up high.

"Tell me, where does the cheating start?" he said.

## Using Drones Could Be A Crime

Young said the Illinois wildlife department wants to make changes to the new law. They want to prevent scouting with drones within 24 hours of hunting. Drone scouting would still be allowed before then.

Illinois already has many rules to protect fair chase. They include limiting the use of vehicles in hunting. Some people thought that vehicles meant drones too. Young said the proposed law would make it clear.

The law would let the state take away drones that are used for hunting. The hunter could be charged with a crime for breaking the law.
