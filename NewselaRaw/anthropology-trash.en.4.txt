NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” Robin Nagle studies garbage. She rides around on New York City garbage trucks all the time. She tries to figure out how people live by looking at their garbage.

New York City's garbage collection department calls Nagle its anthropologist-in-residence. An anthropologist studies how people live. She is in residence because she is allowed to go on garbage collections. Nagle is also a professor.

## From Trash To Treasure

New York is the largest city in the United States It has almost 8.5 million people. They throw out almost 3.5 million tons of trash each year.

What does she learn from this trash?

Nagle says New Yorkers throw out anything. They put furniture and clothing in the trash. They even throw out perfectly good electronics.

Most of the city's apartments are small. People need to make more room, so they keep throwing things out. Nagle says the trash is a gold mine.

Many people bring other people's garbage home. Some dig for food that has never been cooked. They look for bagels, rice and pasta. A person could fill their closet with clothing and shoes they find in the garbage. People also grab sofas and beds. They even take paintings that have been thrown out.

## What Sanitation Workers See

Garbage collectors are called sanitation workers. They get to know people from their garbage. Diapers show up in the trash when a family has a baby, for example.

Nagle kept asking to be named anthropologist-in-residence. She asked for two years. The people in charge of garbage in New York gave her the job in 2006. She does not get paid. Nagle has written books about the garbage she has studied. Nagle even teaches a class about New York's garbage. She also tries to get businesses to use more recyclable materials.

## Dirty Hands, Clean City

Nagle has gotten her hands really dirty. She trained to be a garbage collector. She learned to drive the trucks. Nagle even worked for almost a year as a sanitation worker.

Nagle also makes garbage collectors feel better about their job. The city has 6,400 sanitation workers. Nagle talks with new trash collectors. She tells them to be proud of their work. The department clears streets of the garbage. Nagle says if the garbage stayed, it could bring rats and disease.

"I get to work with people who make a difference every single day," Nagle says.
