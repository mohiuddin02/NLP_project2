ASHEBORO, N.C. — The school board in Randolph County, N.C., voted last week to ban Ralph Ellison's famous novel of African-American anxiety, "Invisible Man." The decision embarrassed many of its residents.

Now it is reconsidering the decision.

In a 5-2 vote, the board barred the book from all school libraries in the county. The vote came after the mother of an 11th-grader complained that the novel was "too much for teenagers."

But the board was confronted by an angry backlash and concerns that the ban had shamed the county. So it backed down. It scheduled a special meeting Wednesday in order to take another look at the ban.

## "Dim-Witted"

That only seemed to make residents more angry that the board had brought negative attention to the county, about 85 miles northeast of Charlotte. The ban made national news, and the local newspaper was flooded with 168 reader comments, virtually all ridiculing the board's decision.

"The Randolph County Board of Education has now offered itself as the laughingstock of the United States," one reader wrote to the Courier-Tribune. The reader also called the board "dim-witted."

"Can you imagine showing yourself off to be this lowbred and stupid in public?" another reader wrote of the board.

A third reader wrote: "I think we should be embarrassed."

## No Endorsements For The Ban

Ray Criscoe, the paper's editor, says he hasn't published a letter in favor of the ban because he hasn't "received anything that remotely resembles an endorsement." He said he could not recall another issue that prompted as much reader response.

The board's timing was amazing. This week is the American Library Association's annual Banned Books Week, which celebrates the freedom to read. The association and the Kids' Right to Read Project sent letters to the board condemning the ban and asking that it be lifted.

The book was published in 1952. It is number 19 on Modern Library's list of the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century. It explores the effects of racism on both the people who discriminate and their victims. The unnamed narrator notes, "I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me."

## Long Waiting List

At the main county library here, 23 people were on a waiting list to check out "Invisible Man." The ban was a prime topic.

"Embarrassed? Of course I am," Pat Dillard said as she made her weekly library visit. "I'm embarrassed not just for our county, but for our entire state. We're going backwards."

Shakema Steele, an Asheboro 10th-grader visiting the library, said of the ban: "That's just not right. That book is timeless. How can they ban it based on one person's complaint?"

School board Chairman Tommy McDonald pronounced the book "a hard read" before voting to ban it. Board member Gary Mason said he "didn't find any literary value" in the novel.

Juniors at Randleman High School were asked to choose "Invisible Man" or one of two other books for assigned summer reading. Kimiyutta Parson, the mother of a junior, sent the board a 12-page letter outlining her objections to "Invisible Man."

"This novel is not so innocent; instead, this book is filthier, too much for teenagers," she wrote.

The book includes passages describing violence and other adult topics. But several Courier-Tribune readers pointed out that the Bible contains vivid references to those topics, too.

## Publisher Giving Free Copies

The ban made Evan Smith Rakoff, an editor for Poets &amp; Writers magazine, and journalist Laura Miller very angry. They persuaded the book's publisher to offer free copies to county high school students. Vintage Books is providing 100 copies of the book through the Books-A-Million store in Asheboro.

"Banning any book, but especially a great American novel like 'Invisible Man,' just doesn't fit the values of the Randolph County I know," said Rakoff, who is from Randolph Country but now lives in New York. "The people of North Carolina want their children to have open, expansive minds."

Russell Perreault, a Vintage spokesman, said, "We can only hope the attempt to ban the book will bring even more readers to Ralph Ellison's magnificent novel."

The Books-A-Million outlet here quickly sold its 10 copies of "Invisible Man" after the ban. There is a long waiting list for the book, said Cory Saxe, a store employee.

The Randolph County Public Library has ordered four more copies, along with two e-book copies and an audio version, said Ross A. Holt, the library director. Holt said no one had complained about "Invisible Man" in his 30 years at the library.

## "Might As Well Ban The Dictionary"

"It's a modern classic," Holt said. Most high schools and colleges have included the book in their courses for many years and it has been "a highly respected" part of collections in the country's public libraries, he said.

Ian Fletcher, 30, a library employee, said he was disturbed, though not surprised, by the board's actions. "They might as well ban the dictionary," he said.

The Courier-Tribune reported that board members were provided copies of the book before the Sept. 16 meeting, but it was not clear whether all members had actually read it.

"I doubt the entire board read the book before they decided to ban it," one reader wrote the newspaper. "No worries. No surer way to elevate a book to the Must Read list of teen readers than to ban it."

## Story Update

ASHEBORO, N.C – Nine days after the Randolph County school board banned the book, it reversed itself at a meeting Wednesday night. Members voted 6-1 to return the novel to school bookshelves.

Several said the public outcry had opened their eyes to other viewpoints. They said it widened their outlook on the importance of all types of writing.

Before Wednesday's vote, board members heard from two teachers. The educators stressed the novel's teaching value. They said that today's students can still relate to the narrator's experiences as a black man in the segregated 1950s.

"Some of the students in our classrooms right now feel that same cloak of invisibility," English teacher Justine Carter said.

Board member Tracy Boyle voted for the original ban, but then changed his mind. He choked back tears as he said his son had been in combat overseas, "fighting for those freedoms that I'm here passing a vote to take away."

"Is that right of me? No," Boyles said.

At Wednesday's meeting, board member Matthew Lambeth said the board had made an honest mistake.

"We've been accused of being ignorant bigots and racists," he said. "That is simply not the case."

Lambeth added: "We should all be proud. When concerned citizens bring their displeasure at what their government has decided ... that is the pinnacle of the democratic process."
