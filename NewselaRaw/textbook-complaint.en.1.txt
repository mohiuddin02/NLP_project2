Mothers of teenagers are used to getting frustrating text messages from the children. But the text that Roni Dean-Burren received from her 15-year-old son last week wasn't about alcohol, dating or money for the movies.

Instead, it was about history.

Her son, Coby, had sent her a photo of a colorful page in his ninth-grade McGraw-Hill World Geography textbook. In a section titled "Patterns of Immigration," a speech bubble pointing to the continent of Africa read: "The Atlantic Slave Trade between the 1500s and 1800s brought millions of workers from Africa to the southern United States to work on agricultural plantations."

"We was real hard workers wasn't we," Coby retorted in a text he later sent to her.

## Mom Studies Power Of Language

The image alarmed Dean-Burren, who was an English teacher for 11 years at the Pearland, Texas, public high school that her son attends. Now a doctoral candidate in the University of Houston's Language Arts program, Dean-Burren has spent much of her life thinking about the power and dangers of language. The motive behind the textbook's choice of words seemed clear.

"This is erasure," Dean-Burren said. "This is revisionist history â€” retelling the story however the winners would like it told."

In calling slaves "workers" and their move to the United States "immigration," she noted in Facebook posts, the textbook suggests that her African-American ancestors arrived on the continent willingly. It also makes it seem like they were compensated for their labor.

## Publisher Says "We Can Do Better"

McGraw-Hill Education sought to correct these implied untruths in a Facebook announcement Friday. The publishing company said that the geography program "meets the learning objectives of the course." However, it went on to say, a close review revealed that "our language in that caption did not adequately convey that Africans were both forced into migration and to labor against their will as slaves."

"We believe we can do better," it continues. "To communicate these facts more clearly, we will update this caption to describe the arrival of African slaves in the United States as a forced migration and emphasize that their work was done as slave labor."

The publisher said the changes will be made in the textbook's digital version and included in its next print run.

While McGraw-Hill's action came swiftly, it was only after tens of thousands of people had already expressed their outrage on social media. By the time Dean-Burren received news of the company's response, her video about the textbook's impact had been viewed half a million times.

## New Print Version Due In 10 Years

Dean-Burren has mixed feelings about the outcome. "On a surface level, 'Yay,'" she said. "I understand that McGraw-Hill is a textbook giant, so thumbs up for listening."

On the other hand, few students use the digital version, and since her son's textbook is brand-new, another print version likely won't come out for another 10 years.

"I know they can do better," she said. "They can send out a supplement. They can recall those books. Regardless of whether you're left-leaning or right-leaning, you know that's not really the story of slavery."

Dean-Burren added, "Minimizing slavery in any way is a way of saying those black lives, those black bodies, that black pain didn't matter enough to give it a full description."

## Texas Materials Criticized Earlier

The educational publisher has been criticized for its Texas materials before. McGraw-Hill was one of a handful of textbook companies that came under fire after the Texas State Board of Education adopted new standards for its social studies curriculum in 2010. Many educators said the standards interfered with teaching history accurately.

A Washington Post article noted that a lesson plan devised under the proposed mandate "plays down the role of Thomas Jefferson among the founding fathers." It also "questions the separation of church and state, and claims that the U.S. government was infiltrated by Communists during the Cold War."

While the changes were made only to books sold in Texas, some feared that school districts in other states would use the textbooks.

As recently as last year, scholars reviewing textbooks based on the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills guidelines found a number of historical problems. The textbooks declared that a Muslim headscarf hinders women's rights. It also downplayed the inequalities African-Americans faced under Jim Crow laws in the South and represented slavery as only a secondary cause of the Civil War.

Most of the textbooks found to be problematic in the review were nevertheless approved.

Southern Methodist University history professor Edward Countryman said that including little more than a mention of race and slavery in textbooks does students a disservice.

## Student Realizes He Made A Difference

"It's kind of like teaching physics and stopping at Newton without bringing in Einstein," said Countryman, who reviewed some of the Texas books for this school year. Countryman was referring to Isaac Newton, the scientist and mathematician who discovered gravity and died in 1727, and Albert Einstein who developed the theory of relativity and the famous formula E = mc2.

As it so happens, McGraw-Hill's description of the Atlantic slave trade has had a positive educational impact on at least one student.

Shortly after the publisher's response, Dean-Burren and her son were sitting next to each other on the couch when Coby started dialing his mother's cellphone number.

"Why are you calling me?" she asked, confused.

"Answer your phone," he urged, and speaking into his, Coby fulfilled a request that Dean-Burren made when her son started high school.

"Mom," he said, "you told me to call you when I realized I could change the world."
