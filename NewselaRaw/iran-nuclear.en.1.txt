TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's agreement with world powers to limit its nuclear program may signal a new era for the Islamic Republic. But there is little sense on the bustling streets of the nation's capital that momentous change is near.

Official efforts to lower expectations and hide details of the agreement appear to have left many ordinary Iranians mystified. They are as worried as ever about the high cost of living and scarce job opportunities in the Middle Eastern country. Since Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions, or trade restrictions, on oil-rich Iran, blocking weapon sales and most trade.

On Sunday, the agreement officially went into effect, 90 days after it was signed in Vienna, Austria, by Iran and six other nations, including the United States. The purpose of the agreement is to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and to ensure that its nuclear program is used for peaceful purposes, like generating power. Tehran must now begin reducing its nuclear program in exchange for lifting the sanctions.

## Hope With A Strong Undercurrent Of Doubt

Still, many ordinary Iranians are doubtful that things will get much better — or just not sure what all the fuss is about.

"I can't figure out what this deal is, but I hope it will be good for us," said Bahram Asgari, 54. The carpet salesman and father of three was outside the capital's busy Grand Bazaar. "All I know is that prices keep going up and it is harder and harder to make ends meet, no matter what the politicians say."

In the underground gold market, shop windows glittered with bracelets, rings, necklaces and other jewels. Vendors said sales have been slow.

"Business is very slack," said Asghar Nouzad, 40, seeming depressed as he manned his stall. "I don't see much to hope for in the future."

## Change Will Be Long Time Coming

On Sunday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned that no tangible benefits are expected until spring, when most sanctions may be lifted on Iran's oil industry. It was another dose of reality meant to curb unrealistic beliefs that the deal is some kind of cure-all. But few here seem to believe that anyway.

Last week, Iranian lawmakers officially signed off on the deal, signaling an end to what has often been an incendiary debate.

Hypersensitive to any suggestion that it has made concessions to Washington, D.C., Iran's conservative leadership has ramped up anti-Western speech. In recent days, the military theatrically unveiled a new generation of long-range ballistic missiles, hidden deep underground. Predictably, it drew sharp rebuke from the Obama administration.

## Key Issues: Enriched Uranium, Nuclear Facilities

Western officials say it will take months for Iran to begin complying with the deal's complex details. These include reducing the country's ability to enrich uranium, a key step in making a nuclear bomb, as well as shrinking enriched uranium stocks and beginning to scale down its nuclear facilities. Enriching uranium separates out the type of uranium needed to make an atomic bomb from common uranium. Sanctions should be ended sometime in 2016, officials say.

Because of economic hardship, many Iranians have been forced to take several jobs, and many senior citizens have began driving taxis.

Ali Reza, 62, retired 10 years ago after working as a technician with the Iranian air force. His pension, worth the equivalent of $2,500 a month a decade ago, is now valued at about $600 a month.

"I have three children; my benefits aren't enough," said Reza, who now works as a cabdriver to supplement his income.

"Nothing will ever change here," Reza said, adding that he had little expectation of economic progress after the nuclear accord.

## Optimism Greater Among Young Iranians

Casual conversations here suggest a higher level of hope among Iran's youth. They are major supporters of Rouhani, who was elected in June 2013 with a pledge to end international sanctions. Young Iranians celebrated in the streets after Rouhani's surprise victory two years ago and after the nuclear deal passed in July.

"I just hope people have more money to spend so they can invest more in decorating their homes," said Parisa Jalili, 24. She is an interior decorator who was with her boyfriend, Ramin Haderi, at the Naderi restaurant.

Many in Iran's young and highly educated population have found it difficult to find employment equal to their skills and education levels.

Haderi, 25, is an engineer earning the equivalent of about $600 a month. He said he was optimistic that foreigners would now invest in the country and that much-needed infrastructure projects, like roads and bridges, would now begin.

"I'd say there's a cautious optimism out there now," said Sam Madikians, an Iranian-born Californian who owns the Naderi restaurant.

## Clergy Emphasizes Western Values Won't Be Adopted

But Iran's religious leadership has been repeatedly making a point: Relief from sanctions and greater foreign investment in Iran do not mean that the country will be more open to the West.

At Friday prayers on the grounds of Tehran University, 88-year-old Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati warned that Western values — including homosexuality — were not welcome. An ayatollah is a high-ranking Muslim religious leader.

"Yes, we made the nuclear deal, but that's it," said Abbas Khorramabadi, 44, who eagerly participated in a "morals" march after the fiery sermon. "We will not allow for any other compromises. ... No Western values shall prevail."
