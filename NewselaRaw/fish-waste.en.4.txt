There are many fish in the sea. There are also many fish in the garbage.

People throw away a lot of seafood. It is a bad thing. Eating fish is good. It keeps us healthy.

Families and restaurants buy fish. Some never eat it or use it.

## One Fish, Two Fish, Healthy Fish

Fisherman are part of the problem. Sometimes their large nets pull up too many fish. The fish are tossed back into the water. Often the fish are hurt or killed.

Scientists say people should not throw away fish. It is so healthy to eat. Scientists did a study. They followed 872 men. They watched them for 20 years. These men ate fish one or two times a week. They were much healthier than men who did not eat fish.

## Let's Cook Fish!

It is not easy to get people to eat fish. Seafood can go bad if it is not cooked and eaten quickly. It starts to stink. Then it can make people sick. It can also go bad when people are not excited to eat it.

Christopher Lischewski is the boss of a seafood company. It makes canned tuna. He says some people are fussy about seafood. If we tell them seafood is healthy, maybe they will eat more. We can teach them how to cook seafood.

This might not work. People might buy more fish. What happens if they forget to cook it? Food can only sit in a refrigerator for so long.
