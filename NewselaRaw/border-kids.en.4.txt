WASHINGTON â€“ Every day, 80 to 120 children cross the Texas border illegally. They do it by themselves.

This is going on in other states too. More kids under the age of 18 are coming into the country illegally and alone. Meanwhile, fewer adults are doing that.

Agents caught more than 24,000 children arriving alone in 2012. That is more than three times as many as in 2008. The government sent a record number of children to a group known as the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).  Its job is to take care of children while government officials and judges decide if they can stay in the country.

Most of the kids are teenagers. They are temporarily cared for in shelters and group homes. Most are from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.

Many say they are running from violence from gangs and drug dealers. They are also trying to get away from abuse. Some of it caused by their own family members.

Others are trying to get a better life in the United States. Or they are trying to reunite with family members. Whatever the reason, the rise in the number of children crossing the border alone has been huge.

## Care Is Not Cheap

Housing and caring for these children is not cheap. The growing cost of the program also comes at a time when lawmakers are looking to change immigration rules. At one point last year, the federal government used military bases in Texas to house some of the children.

People on the side of the immigrants say the federal government worked hard to open emergency shelters. The shelters have been replaced with homes and centers with beds for 1,300 children. Most of them are in Texas, which borders Mexico.

A decade ago, the United States would have tried to send the children back to their countries. New laws after Sept. 11, 2001, gave ORR the duty of caring for and placing these children.

The shelters where the children are sent are better for them than the adult immigration holding centers. The kids in the shelters get to wear jeans and T-shirts. They do not wear jumpsuits as the adult immigrants do.

## "Still A Shelter"

Children younger than 12 are placed in smaller facilities. These are more like homes. They get medical services and some schooling.

"But it's still a shelter," said Jessica Jones with the Women's Refugee Commission. "It still feels like detention to them."

More than two-thirds of these children from 2008 to 2010 wound up staying with people in the United States. Those people are called sponsors. The best sponsor is a family member. But some kids go to programs like a shelter for homeless youth.

People on the side of the children worry that the government is not paying enough attention to the sponsors. The huge number of immigrant children entering the country is making it hard. There is not enough staff to screen or check the sponsors.

The government needs to make sure that the family members or family friends can take care of the children. The children need to go to someplace safe. There is also a concern that some children are being released to people who claim to be the parents but are not.

## Losing Track?

ORR also is not required to do background checks on the sponsors. Nor do they have to visit the home of the sponsor.

"A sponsor is just part of the equation," said Kristyn Peck. She helps run an agency that helps protect immigrant children. Peck explained that inspecting the home where a child will go to live is just as important.

Once the children are placed with sponsors, the U.S. government often loses track of them. "No one really knows what is happening to these children. When these children are released to these family members, there is very limited support for them," said Kimberly Haynes, director of children's services for the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.
