JAKARTA, Indonesia â€” In Southeast Asia, thousands of migrants have been abandoned at sea by their smugglers. Over the past two days, hundreds have reached land and relative safety. However, an estimated 6,000 Bangladeshis and Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar remain trapped at sea in crowded, wooden boats. With food and clean water running low, some could be in real danger.

One vessel that reached Indonesian waters early Monday was stopped by the Indonesian navy. The people on board were given food, water and directions to Malaysia. The fishing vessel was said to be in good condition and the migrants reportedly looked fine, but cramped.

## Global Groups Discuss Refugee Crisis

Fears are growing that boats will start washing to shore with dead bodies on them. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the United States and several other foreign governments and international organizations have held emergency meetings to discuss the crisis. So far, however, there are no immediate plans to search for vessels in the busy Malacca Strait.

One of the concerns is what to do with the Rohingya if a rescue is launched. The minority group is denied citizenship in Myanmar. Other countries have long worried that opening their doors to a few would result in an unstoppable flow of poor, uneducated migrants.

"These are people in desperate straits," said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch.

Robertson called on governments to band together to help those still stranded at sea, some for two months or longer. "Time is not on their side," he said.

## Muslims Struggle Where Most Residents Are Buddhist

As Muslims, the Rohingya suffer widespread discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. The government of Myanmar considers them illegal settlers from Bangladesh, even though their families have lived in Myanmar for generations.

In all, about 1.3 million Rohingya people live in Myanmar. In the last three years, attacks on the Rohingya have left up to 280 people dead and forced 140,000 others from their homes. Many of the displaced now live in crowded camps just outside the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, where little schooling is available and health care is poor. For all Rohingya in Myanmar, job opportunities are scarce.

Such conditions have led many desperate Rohingya to leave Myanmar by boat, in hopes that some other country will take them.

## More Than 100,000 Escape Since 2012

Chris Lewa has been monitoring boat departures and arrivals for more than 10 years. She estimates that more than 100,000 men, women and children have boarded ships since mid-2012. Most are trying to reach Malaysia, where the majority of the population is Muslim.

Recent regional crackdowns on human trafficking networks have made things much harder for the migrants now at sea. Smugglers have gone into hiding, and their absence has made it impossible for migrants to leave their boats.

Lewa believes up to 7,000 Rohingya and Bangaldeshis are still on small and large boats in the Malacca Strait and nearby international waters.
