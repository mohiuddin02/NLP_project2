LOS ANGELES — By working in a brand new way, scientists using NASA's Kepler Space Telescope have found 715 confirmed planets huddling around 305 stars. It nearly triples Kepler's previous total of 246 confirmed planets in the Milky Way galaxy.

Nearly 95 percent of them are smaller than Neptune. Four of them are in their star's habitable zone, the region where temperatures make liquid water — a necessary ingredient for life as we know it — able to exist. When planets are found too close to their star it's too hot for life to exist. Too far away and conditions are too cold for life.

The planet-hunting telescope's pointing ability was crippled last year. Yet before this happened, the spacecraft turned up a trove of strange and wonderful worlds, researchers said — bringing them ever closer to finding "Earth 2.0."

The researchers have been able to deliver "more than 20 times as many planets as have ever been found and announced at once," said Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center.

## Finding Life As We Know It?

The research, which covers the first two years of information after Kepler's 2009 launch, has turned up a bounty of smaller planets — and all in multiplanet systems. The scientists increased the number of confirmed Earth-sized planets by 400 percent, super-Earths (larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune) by 500 percent, and Neptune-sized planets by 200 percent. The number of Jupiter-sized worlds, on the other hand, rose by a mere 2 percent.

This highlights the move away from the massive gas giants like Jupiter that characterized Kepler's first finds. This new haul featured planets that are in the right size range to potentially host life as we know it.

"Certainly it will have ramifications for any mission that finds planets," Kepler project scientist Steve Howell said of the findings.

Kepler gets better at finding smaller planets with longer periods over time. This allows it more time to search for the tiny shadows planets cast as they pass in front of their home stars. This mission collected about four years of information before the spacecraft stopped functioning properly. (Plans to repurpose the spacecraft, called K2, are currently in the works.)

Even though the Kepler mission has found 3,601 possible planets, only 246 had been previously confirmed. It takes a lot of extra, painstaking work to ensure that the dips in light that Kepler picks up really are from a planet. Instead Kepler might be picking up drops in light caused by two stars that regularly block each other.

The new method researchers used to find and confirm these 715 planets relies on the idea that planets seem to cluster in systems with other planets. Like in our own solar system, the method found that multiple planets orbiting around a single star is common.

## Strange Planets Like Mini-Neptunes

"Multiplicity is not random," Lissauer said, calling it "a powerful technique for wholesale planet verification."

Two teams of researchers were able to devise a probability-based method that focused on these multiplanet systems. It resulted in the largest single haul of exoplanets (planets found outside our solar system) since the first one was discovered in the 1990s. It nearly quadruples the number of confirmed planets found with Kepler (from 246 to 961). And it doubles the overall number of confirmed planets to about 1,700. Many exoplanets have also been discovered using another technique, which looks for the gravitational influence of a planet on its star.

"I'm super excited about this," said Sara Seager, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the work. The multiplanet systems will help scientists understand our own solar system's development, she said.

For example, many of these systems seem to have multiple planets clustered in an orbit smaller than Venus, or even Mercury, around our sun. It begs the question: Why are our own solar system's inner members relatively spaced out?

The findings will also shed light on strange planets like mini-Neptunes. No comparable planets are found in our own solar system. Scientists hope the findings will sharpen their search for Earth-sized, potentially Earth-like planets.

"Nature wants to make small planets," Seager said.
