WASHINGTON, D.C. — The No Child Left Behind education law was passed in 2002. It laid out the way U.S. schools should be run. 

The law lets the U.S. government tell states how to run their schools. Students have to take statewide tests. Teachers are judged by how well their students do on those tests. Schools where too many students get low test scores are punished.

On Thursday big changes were made to No Child Left Behind. President Barack Obama signed a new bill that changes how teachers are judged, and how and when schools are punished. The bill might also change what students learn. 

Obama called the bill a "Christmas miracle." He said it was a gift for students, parents, teachers and schools.

States will now have much more power to decide what happens in their schools. U.S. schools will no longer all have to follow the same rules.

## Previous Law Wasn't Working Well

Obama was joined on Thursday by lawmakers, students and teachers. He praised the No Child Left Behind law for having the right goals. However, he said it has not been working well. 

No Child was too standardized, the president said. All schools had to follow the same rules, no matter how different their students were.

One key part of No Child Left Behind remains, however. Students will still have to take statewide reading and math exams. 

The bill does encourage states to limit the time students spend on testing, however. In addition, schools will no longer be automatically punished for low student test scores.

## How The New Law Affects Different Groups

Teachers, students and schools will all be affected by the new bill.

The bill gets rid of the rule that teachers must be rated according to how well their students do on the statewide tests. Teachers hated that idea. They said it was unfair to teachers whose students were less prepared, perhaps because they came from poor homes. 

In addition, schools were punished if too many students got low test scores. As a result, many schools began to spend too much time preparing students for the tests. Teachers say such over-testing actually hurts learning. It makes school very stressful and much less fun. 

States will now be allowed to judge teachers in different ways. They can consider student test scores, but they do not have to. They can look at other things too in order to decide how well teachers are doing.

The nation's 50 million public school students will still have to take the statewide reading and math exams. They will take them in grades three to eight and once in high school. However, the bill encourages states to limit the amount of time students spend on testing.

## On Common Core, Schools Can Choose

Many states have been using Common Core standards. Common Core lays out what each student must learn in math and English by a certain grade. For years the U.S. government has pushed states to use Common Core. 

Many parents and teachers have been very unhappy with Common Core, however. They believe students have different interests and needs. They think teachers should have more power to decide what students learn.

The new bill says the U.S. government cannot try to force schools to use Common Core. It will now be up to schools to decide whether or not to stick with it.

## An Equal Education For All Children

States can now come up with their own goals for schools. They can now decide on their own how to fix struggling schools. 

The new bill says all children must have an equal chance to get a good education. 

For that reason, states will have to step in when schools are performing particularly poorly. They will have to take steps to improve those schools with the lowest average grades. However, now they can do it the way they think is best.
