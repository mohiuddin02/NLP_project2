People are getting sick from malaria in a place called Malaysian Borneo. One kind of malaria used to be found only in monkeys. Then it spread to humans. People with malaria often feel like they have the flu. Some patients can get very sick and even die. 

Scientists say that people are getting malaria because trees are being cut down. Clearing trees is changing the rain forest. The change might be making people sick.

Malaysian Borneo is part of a country called Malaysia. It is on the island of Borneo. The island is in the Pacific Ocean. It has rain forests where trees grow close together. The rain forest is warm and wet.

## One Kind Of Malaria Happens More Now

Scientists noticed more of one kind of malaria on the island. It is usually found only in monkeys called macaques. Mosquitoes bite the monkeys and then bite people. Malaria spreads through the bites. Many people on the island have become sick.  

Scientists wanted to know why malaria is spreading faster now. They thought the problem might be a change in the rain forest.

Kimberly Fornace is a scientist. She says clearing trees in the rain forest puts macaques too close to people.

Fornace studied people who were sick with malaria. She noticed where they lived. Then she looked at where trees were cleared. Fornace found more malaria in places where many trees had been cleared. 

## Monkeys Must Move As Forest Changes

Places with most of the forest still standing also had malaria, though. Scientists call this the edge effect.

The rain forest where animals and plants live in Malaysian Borneo is changing. The trees are being cut down. It happens fast.

Fornace says she thinks that malaria spreads at the edge of the rain forest. The edge is where the rain forest ends and open land begins. The macaques are forced to move because of the clearing. Sometimes they have to leave the forest to find food. 

There are people living at the edge of the rain forest. Mosquitoes bite the monkeys and then bite the people.  

Fornace says knowing this helps scientists. They can draw maps that show where people might get sick. Fornace also says that people should plan to cut trees with more care.
