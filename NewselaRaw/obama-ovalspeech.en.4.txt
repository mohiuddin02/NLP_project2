WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Last week, two people attacked a holiday party in California. They killed 14 people. Another 21 people were hurt.

A married couple did the shooting. The wife posted on Facebook that she was loyal to Islamic State. It is a violent group, also known as ISIS. It has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. ISIS has attacked people around the world.

On Sunday evening, President Barack Obama gave a speech. He spoke from the White House. He wanted to make people feel safer. Obama told the country that Islamic State will not win.

Obama said the couple probably acted on their own. So far, there is no proof that anyone sent them to attack. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is looking into what happened. It wants to know if the couple was linked to Islamic State.

## Working Together

Obama did not announce any big changes. He also did not give many new options for fighting the violent group. His speech shows that defeating the group will be difficult.

Marco Rubio is running for president. He is a senator from Florida. Rubio belongs to the Republican Party. It is a political group against Obama's party, the Democrats. Rubio said that Obama did not make people feel safer.

Obama said he wanted companies and police to work together. Sometimes Islamic State fighters use message apps on cellphones to talk secretly. Obama said the companies and police must stop this. The fighters should not use technology to hide.

The president also asked people to treat Muslims fairly. People should not turn against them. The Islamic State is a Muslim group. The attackers also belonged to the Muslim religion. Most Muslims are nothing like Islamic State, Obama said. He asked Muslims in America and around the world to fight extremism.

## Need More Gun Control

Obama also repeated his call for more gun control laws. It is important to keep guns away from people who would kill. He called it a good way to stop violence. The United States must make it harder for people to kill.

Obama has little chance of getting lawmakers to agree. Most of the lawmakers are Republicans. They are usually against Obama's plans.

Republicans are asking if Obama knows how to fight the Islamic State. Even some Democrats wonder if he knows what he is doing.

Hillary Clinton is one of these Democrats. She is running for president. She said the United States is not winning against Islamic State.
