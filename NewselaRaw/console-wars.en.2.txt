The latest battle of the video game systems is coming to stores near you.

Sony's new console, Play Station 4, was released Nov. 15.

A week later, Microsoft launches the Xbox One console, a follow-up to the Xbox 360.

The newest game systems will fight to win over game players â€“ and get a prized place under the living room television.

## Deployed For The Holidays

Each company has tried different ways to get people to buy their systems.

Sony portrays the PlayStation 4 as a console for serious game players. The company is targeting the kind of customer who won't mind standing in line for hours to be among the first to buy the latest hardware. PlayStation4 costs $399.

Microsoft, meanwhile, says people can play games on its $499 Xbox One, but also do a lot more.

Analysts think both devices will be hot sellers this holiday shopping season. They say as many as 5 million consoles may be purchased before the end of the year.

Cowen &amp; Co. game industry analyst Doug Creutz said, "There's clearly pent-up demand for the new boxes."

Video games used to be seen as something socially awkward teenage boys played. Now almost everybody uses them. In the United States, more than half the households own a gaming system. People spent nearly $20.8 billion to buy video games, hardware and the other equipment that goes with them last year, according to the Entertainment Software Association.

Globally, researcher DFC Intelligence estimates people spend almost $63 billion a year to buy the video games. Almost half of those who play games are women. And roughly one-third are older than 36.

## Targeting Dedicated Gamers

Some experts thought "casual" games like "Candy Crush Saga" would mean fewer people would buy traditional systems. After all, people can now play games in their spare moments on social networks such as Facebook. They can also play them on apps that run on smartphones and tablets. But the new ways did not end up making people stop playing traditional video game systems.

Instead, more people overall play games, said P.J. McNealy, who runs Digital World Research. "It's no longer just the 14- to 30-year-old male. It's anyone who has played 'Angry Birds,' 'Temple Run,' 'Bejeweled.'" It's also anyone who has played any game on a traditional system, he said.

The initial buyers of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are expected to be the most dedicated gamers.

Sony is trying to appeal to this group of buyers. In a demonstration of the new system in San Francisco, people from the company emphasized how it is 10 times more powerful than the PlayStation 3. They also pointed out it has new games like "Killzone Shadow Fall" that no other company has. Meanwhile, social-networking features let gamers share video from within the game.

"We've always said the PlayStation is about the gamer," said Jack Tretton, the head of Sony Computer Entertainment America. He said it's the best gaming machine ever made.

Microsoft also made its case at a test drive of Xbox One last week in Venice, Calif. The company talked about the Xbox One as an all-in-one entertainment system. Its Kinect controller recognizes the user when he or she enters the room. It automatically loads favorite games, TV channels, movies, albums and Skype contacts on the TV screen. Its voice control lets users seamlessly switch from playing a game to watching a TV show or streaming music or a movie.

## Seasoned Fighters For The Wallet

Game analysts note that the systems have a lot of things in common. PlayStation 4, like the Xbox One, lets people use online movie and TV services such as Netflix and Hulu Plus. Xbox One, like the PS4, enable players to record, upload and share game play highlights.

Colin Sebastian, a technology analyst with Baird Research, said a lot of people who play games might not think there's a lot of difference between the two systems. One difference they might care about is what games they can play on each one. Which one people decide to buy might come down to other factors. "It may come down to things like price, where Sony has an advantage." he said.

Tretton said Sony is working hard to avoid the difficulties that hurt the November 2006 introduction of PlayStation 3. The system came out a year after the competing Xbox 360 system. The PlayStation 3 cost $599 which was $200 more than the top Xbox 360 system. It also ran into a problem because it did not have enough of a key part for its Blu-ray disc player.

"I feel more confident going into this generation of hardware than ever before," Tretton said.

Microsoft, which rushed its Xbox 360 to market in late 2005 to get a jump on rival Sony, had its own problems. It had a problem at first that people who played the game dubbed the "red ring of death." The malfunction cost the company $1 billion, according to published accounts.

Both game systems overcame those hurdles. McNealy said 80 million units of each were sold worldwide.
