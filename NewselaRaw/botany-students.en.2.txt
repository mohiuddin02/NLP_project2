MOUNT IDA, Ark. â€” The plant world could become a mystery in the future as fewer college students take botany, or the study of plants. Several universities are also closing their plant collections.

Since 1988, the number of universities offering botany degrees has dropped by half, according to information from the National Science Foundation. Meanwhile, the National Center for Education Statistics reports that fewer than 400 botany degrees were awarded in 2012. Educators say that's because students are being pushed into technology-related majors.

Current botanists fear this will lead to fewer people who can teach about, identify and use plants. This lack of botanists could harm conservation efforts. It could even make it harder to develop alternate fuels and important medicines. At the same time, universities and states that do not have enough money are closing herbaria. These collections of plant species help botanists to do research, but they are sometimes expensive to maintain.

"We aren't going to understand what we have in the world. By some estimates only 20 percent of the (plant and animal) species in the world have been identified," said Joe Miller of the National Science Foundation's Division of Environmental Biology.

## Plant Biology A Major Contributor To Medical Research

About a dozen researchers recently scoured the rocky area in a clearing on the side of a highway in Arkansas. They were looking for a threatened plant. It is called the Missouri bladderpod and it blooms with clusters of small yellow flowers. Only 75 groups of the threatened plant exist in the world. All are close enough to cities to be in danger, Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission botanist Theo Witsell said.

The 39-year-old Witsell plucked a few purple flowering plants from the ground by the root.

"I think one of the things that's happening in this field of study is there aren't a lot of open jobs," Witsell said. "But as people get older and they retire, you then have fewer people who are qualified for those jobs."

Witsell hopes to conserve some of the open spaces, or glades. He said scientists are still finding new types of plants in the glades. That's where botanists' skills are irreplaceable, Miller said.

If scientists can name a plant, he said, then they understand how it behaves and what it is made of, or its biology. If they understand its biology, then they can "understand and predict how it could be used," he said.

For example, Quinine is a treatment for the tropical disease malaria. Quinine is found in cinchona trees. Miller said if botanists identify plants with similar biology that react similarly to their surroundings, plant biologists could do research to find medical uses.

## States, Universities Closing Herbaria

Herbaria are a major reference source for botanists. However, increasingly there are fewer of these collections. States and universities have closed or combined their herbaria. Researchers say these bulky collections of plants that are mounted, dried, dated and tagged with important information can be hard to maintain. They require temperature and moisture control, and space to prepare the plants in.

The University of Missouri announced May 18 that it would donate its over 200,000 plant specimens to the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis.

The building where the plants were kept was getting too old, said Jordan Yount, a spokesman for the university. "Regulating the humidity and temperature was critical and getting to be a problem." The university had to decide whether it should spend a lot of money to fix the building or find someplace else for the collection, Yount said.

## Fighting To Keep Collections Alive

From his office in downtown Little Rock, Witsell is fighting the closures. The University of Arkansas at Fayetteville herbarium was almost closed in 2003 and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock closed its collection a few years later. After that, Witsell decided the commission needed its own collection.

A handful of commission workers and Witsell have searched through the state over the past 12 years. They have been finding, collecting and preserving more than 70,000 native plant species. The commission's collection is now the most actively growing in Arkansas.

"This is the physical record of the plant life of the planet, of this state," he said. "You can't get all of the information from a photograph."
