Humans are great at many things but terrible at measuring time. Our sense of how much time is passing may change depending on what is going on in our lives. It may also depend on what we have going on that day, or even our mood.

Our sense of time causes a lot of unusual things to happen. One example is called the "return-trip effect." This is what happens when you go somewhere new for the first time and then return home. When we make a new trip, it sometimes feels that the way back took less time than the way to go there.

A new study looked at the "return-trip effect." It discovered that this actually exists.

## The Movie Experiment

A study in Japan split people into two groups. Both groups sat in a dark room and watched a 20-minute movie showing a man walking around a city. People in both groups were asked to tell the scientists every time they thought three minutes had passed. Then a second movie was played. It was a different movie for each group, but the trip was the same length in each one.

The first group watched a man walk to one place, and then take the same road back. The second group watched a man take two different trips.

The study found that the two groups did equally well at telling how time had passed during the experiment. They were then asked to think back to how much time had passed. This time, the answers were very different between groups.

The first group remembered the second part of the man's journey to be shorter. The second group did not, because the second half of their movie showed a different road.

##  Do You Remember The Way?

The study says that the "return-trip effect" has something to do with how people remember an event. To experience the effect, you need to know that you are making a return trip.

One idea is that the "return-trip effect" depends on how people notice time. When you think about time, it seems to take forever. When you are distracted by more interesting things, time passes quickly.

This presents an interesting idea. By paying attention to the present, we may be able to slow our brain's idea of time and make events seem longer.

Scientists also have another idea. On the way to a brand new place, you do not know the route. Yet, the way back is more familiar because you recognize things you saw before, and this makes the trip seem to go faster. Yet people do not experience the "return-trip effect" on trips they take often, like to work. This is because they already know the route and have a good idea of how long the journey will take.

## Our Brains Fake Us Out

There may be other reasons for the "return-trip effect" too. One study found that people can experience the effect even when they do not know the route back.

In a 2011 study, scientists asked people to ride bikes to a fair. They then split the group in half after they arrived. One group rode home on the same road that they took to get to the fair. The other group took a different way back, but it was exactly the same length as the first group. Both groups reported feeling the "return-trip effect."

This study decided that people are often too positive on their first journey, and expect it to be a short trip. If we expect it to be really short and it is not, our brain thinks the trip is longer than it was. On the way back, our brains expect a really long trip, so the journey back ends up seeming shorter.

The "return-trip effect" may be caused by all of these things.
