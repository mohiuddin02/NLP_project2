One hundred years ago this month, the Panama Canal officially opened when a ship named the SS Ancon steamed through from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.

The canal took more than 30 years to build, but its debut was quieter than intended because World War I had just started in Europe. Sixteen million men were rushing into the fight, and thousands had already died in early battles in Belgium and France.

People had first discussed building a canal in Panama in the 1500s. A canal would allow ships to cut straight through the American continents rather than sailing all the way around South America. A shortcut would save time. For international trade and commerce, saving time means saving money.

The French, who successfully completed the Suez Canal in 1869, began work on the Panama Canal in 1881. But the new project proved to be much harder than building a canal in Egypt's arid climate. The humidity, heat and muddy soil made work difficult. More than 20,000 died due to tropical diseases and accidents.

## A Third Set Of Locks Being Built

At the time, Panama was part of Colombia. The United States supported Panama in declaring independence. In 1904, the U.S. bought the French machinery and the rights to finish the canal.

The Americans brought a new army of workers and focused on keeping them healthy. They also brought the latest steam-powered machinery. They battled the muddy ground, digging deep, and constructing gigantic concrete locks to raise and lower ships. The locks, using a system of gates and varying water levels, allow ships to move between different levels, either uphill or downhill.

The Panama Canal had many advantages, and a 1912 article in Scientific American written by a U.S. official highlighted some of the benefits. "The great investment of capital has been made for the purpose of shortening ocean routes, first of all to enable the commerce between the Atlantic and Pacific to be handled more economically, and second, to add to the military power and prestige of the United States."

A century later, international trade still depends on the Panama Canal. It still contributes to U.S. military power, even though the U.S. no longer owns the canal. More than 900,000 ships have used the canal since it opened. Almost 5 percent of world trade passes through it today.

The history of the canal is still being written. Cargo ships are increasing in size and some now exceed the "Panamax" sizes that fit in the locks. The Panama Canal authority is building a third set of locks, set for completion in 2015.

## Another Canal Through The Americas?

Since the beginning, the Panama Canal has had competition. Governments and engineers have discussed many alternatives. Even before it opened in 1914, there were proposed routes through Nicaragua. Some even suggested a railroad that would carry ships over the narrow Isthmus of Panama from one ocean to the other.

Today, one of those plans is being resurrected. The government of Nicaragua has joined with Hong Kong group HKND to build a canal that would compete with the Panama Canal. It is expected to cost $40 billion.

It's not clear if the new canal will really be built, but at least one major ocean shipping company thinks it's a good idea. The Maersk Line, owner of 20 of the largest cargo ships afloat, some of which are too big to fit through the Panama Canal, said the proposed Nicaragua Canal "makes good sense."
