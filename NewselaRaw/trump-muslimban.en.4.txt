MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Donald Trump is a Republican candidate running for president. 

There are several steps to become president. First Trump must win the primary elections. The primaries will be held next year. In the primaries Republicans run against other Republicans. They are called candidates. Democrats run against other Democrats. The winning Republican and Democrat candidates run against each other in the election. 

Trump wants to stop Muslims from entering the United States. Muslims are people who follow the Islamic religion. Other Republican candidates do not like Trump's idea.

Trump said he does not care what other Republicans think. "I'm doing what's right."

## Candidate Compares Self To Roosevelt

Trump defended his plan. He compared his plan to one during World War II. In 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt put many Japanese-Americans in a type of prison camp. They had less freedom and rights at the camp. Roosevelt did so to protect the nation. Now many people think what Roosevelt did was terrible.

"This is a president who was highly respected by all," Trump said. "If you look at what he was doing, it was far worse."

Many people think Trump's idea is bad. British leader David Cameron said it was "quite simply wrong." Muslims do not like the idea. 

## Policy Meant To Protect U.S., Trump Says

Trump said his idea is fair. There have been several attacks by Muslim terrorists. One attack killed 130 people in Paris, France. Another attack killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California.

"We are now at war," Trump said. 

When he announced his plan on Monday, people cheered. He made his announcement in South Carolina.

## Other Candidates Blast Plan To Ban Muslims

Some Republican candidates criticized Trump's idea. Jeb Bush said Trump's "proposals are not serious." Ted Cruz said, "That is not my policy."

Lawmakers passed a law stopping Chinese people from entering the United States in the late 1800s. Leti Volpp is a professor. Volpp explained that the U.S. has never stopped people from a religion. It would be against the law, Volpp said.
