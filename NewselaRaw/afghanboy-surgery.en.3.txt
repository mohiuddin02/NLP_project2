CHARLOTTE, N.C. â€” In Kabul, Afghanistan, Salim lives with his parents, six brothers, aunts, uncles and cousins.

Afghanistan is a country in Asia. A war is happening inside Afghanistan. Salim has left Afghanistan and come to the United States.

Here in the United States, 14-year-old Salim is part of a much smaller family. He lives with Sandy Tabor-Gray and Jim Gray in Mooresville, North Carolina.

Salim (sounds like Sa-leem) has been living with the Grays since June. He is being treated for a damaged arm. The treatment is free. It comes from Solace for the Children. Solace means help or comfort. Solace for the Children is a group that helps sick or hurt children who live in war-torn countries.

## Salim Is Still Growing

Since arriving in the United States, Salim has had an operation on his left arm. The arm was badly hurt in 2013 when Salim touched a live wire while trying to untangle his kite. He was electrocuted. Doctors had to remove most of Salim's arm.

In 2014, he was chosen by Solace for the Children to come to the Hanger Clinic. The clinic treats people who have lost arms or legs. Salim was fitted with a prosthetic, a man-made arm. This year, Salim returned because his prosthetic arm no longer fit.

As soon as Michael Jenks saw Salim, the reason why was clear. Salim had grown, so the prosthesis was no longer the right size. Jenks runs the Hanger Clinic.

So Jenks called his friend, Doctor Glenn Gaston, who said he would help Salim.

## Group Works For Free To Help Kids

In August, the doctor operated. Later, Salim and Tabor-Gray, went back to see Gaston and Jenks to make sure everything was healing well.

"Hey, buddy. How ya doing?" Gaston asked Salim as he walked into the exam room. Salim smiled shyly.

Salim said he was feeling no pain. He showed the doctor that he could move the arm easily.

"That's awesome," Jenks said. He measured Salim for a new prosthetic arm.

Each summer, Solace for the Children brings a group of children to the United States. The trip costs $6,000 to $8,000 for each child.

Solace for the Children is given the money it needs by people who want to help. Almost everyone who works for them works for free. The group is in Mooresville, North Carolina. It finds families where the children can stay in cities such as Los Angeles, California, and Boston, Massachusetts.

## "We Send Them Home As Friends"

Tabor-Gray heard about Solace for the Children from people at her church.

She and her husband have hosted 10 children, including Salim, and she has traveled to Afghanistan twice. She said Solace for the Children helps to bring peace.

"We want to show these children what peace looks like," she said. "We teach them, you are brothers and sisters of one country. We send them home as friends."

Salim will be in the United States for a few more weeks before returning to his family in Afghanistan.

He is learning exercises that will make him stronger so he can handle the weight of his prosthetic arm.

He is also learning new ways to do things he used to do with his left arm. For example, Salim was left-handed before his accident. He has learned to write his name with his new arm.

Asked how he feels about Tabor-Gray, Salim answered through a translator. "She's really nice," he said. "I'm thankful that she loves me like her own son."
