So one day in August, she was at a training center in Illinois. It was a really hot day, one of those days when a mouthful of ice would feel really good.

But her mind was on ice for other reasons. She was thinking about how good she wanted to feel when she got back on it. She was remembering her success as a first-year bobsledder. It still sent chills of excitement through her.

The training was part of Evans' path to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

## Box Jump Exercises

Evans, 25, went into the gym to begin a workout with her trainer, Jacob Ross. She was wearing a purple top, black tights, and pale turquoise sneakers with purple shoelaces. She had a bright smile. At least it was bright when it was not twisted by effort.

In bobsledding, teams of two or four jump into a sled. Then they race down a narrow, twisting track trying to get the best time. The pusher has to be able to shove the sled at the beginning and get it off to a fast start. So Evans was trying get as strong as she could.

One of her exercises was box jumps. In box jumps, you spring forward from a seated position to a stack of pads. The pads are about 2 feet in front of the seat. Evans jumped to the top of a stack that was 4 feet, 3 inches high.

That is pretty good for someone her size. She is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds.

Sports success runs in Evans' family. Her father, Fred, was a swimming champion for Chicago State. He was the first black swimmer to win a national title in college. Her uncle is longtime baseball player Gary Matthews and her cousin is Gary Matthews Jr. who has played baseball for 12 years.

"But no one grows up bobsledding in their backyard," Ross said.

Especially if that backyard was in the south and west sides of Chicago.

## Passing Her First Tests

Like many people, Aja Evans' knowledge of bobsledding had consisted of what she saw in "Cool Runnings," a movie about even more unlikely bobsledders. They were from Jamaica.

She learned more about bobsledding during the 2010 Winter Olympics. Her University of Illinois track coach, Mike Erb, decided to compare Evans' scores in sprinting, jumping and power to those used to test other people who push bobsleds. Erb realized her skills would make her a great sled pusher. He encouraged her to try the sport.

An online search told her about bobsled tests in the summer of 2012. She went and got the highest score. She also stunned everyone by winning the dry-land push trials.

Three months after the tests, Evans found herself on ice at the Olympic bobsled track in Lake Placid, New York. She was about to plunge into the unknown: sitting in the back of a 375-pound sled for about 50 seconds at speeds beyond 70 miles per hour.

Bonny Warner, who has been in the Olympics three times on another kind of sled, the luge, once described what happens when a bobsled goes by. "The ground shakes," she said. Steering it was like trying to control an overloaded truck. The bobsleds, she said, "sound like a locomotive in a tunnel and are as smooth and graceful as a drunken elephant."

Evans does not even like roller coasters.

## Setting Start Records

After the first practice run, Evans wondered what she was doing there. But with her mother's encouragement, Evans decided if she made it through that second run, she would stick with it. The whole way down, she was thinking, "It's worth it, it's worth it, it's worth it."

By the end of the season, she would be USA Bobsled's rookie of the year. She would win two World Cup medals and set start records on tracks in Park City, Utah; Koenigsee, Germany; and the 2014 Olympic venue in Sochi, where she and the top U.S. driver, Elana Meyers, also would win a World Cup silver medal.

The push part comes at the beginning of a bobsled race. The driver and pusher, also known as pilot and brakeman, push for a little while. They then jump into the sled. The pusher sits with her head down and tries not to move her upper body, which could move the sled off the line the driver is steering.

The silver medal Evans won in February in her last match of the season in Sochi was special. It still makes her eyes teary when she talks about it.

Evans' grandfather, Lemorse Mallory, had always supported her. But he died at age 95, six days before the race, and she wanted to be back with her family in Chicago. Evans' mother persuaded her to stay.  Her grandfather would have wanted her to, her mother said.

Evans said she is proud she was able to fight all of those feelings and do well. It made her even more excited to return this season. "I feel like I have gotten through the hard part," she said.
