When Bradley Manning was serving in the U.S. Army, he took secret military papers and handed them over to a Web site. The army charged him with helping the enemy and sent him to a trial. On Tuesday, a military judge said he was not guilty of the crime.

Manning, 25, was still convicted of most of the other charges against him on Tuesday. The charges included spying and stealing. He still could spend a very long time in prison.

But the helping the enemy charge was the most serious one. It could have sent him to prison for the rest of his life.

Many people were watching how the case turned out. It raised an important question: if you are in the army and promise not to tell secret information, is it OK to break the promise if you think the government is doing something wrong? Does the public have right to know the secret information?
## Biggest Leak In U.S. History

Manning's leak of secret information was the biggest in U.S. history. He admitted giving more than 700,00 pages of secret papers to the Web site WikiLeaks.

Manning has been in jail for three years. He already admitted to the other charges. The punishments for those crimes are shorter. But they could still add up to about 130 years in prison.

On Twitter, WikiLeaks called such a long prison sentence "dangerous extremism" by the Obama White House.

The judge, Col. Denise Lind, will decide Mannings' sentence on those crimes during a second part of the military trial.

Lind did not explain why she said Manning did not aid the enemy. She said she would give a written report later, according to The Associated Press.

Military lawyers said that Manning is a "traitor" for sending the secret papers to WikiLeaks. The Web site tries to stop governments and others from keeping secrets. Some of the information wound up in the hands of terrorists, the military said. Manning worked in intelligence in Iraq in 2009 and 2010. That meant he could get to the secret information.
## Will Others Leak State Secrets?

The papers included information about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The Web site also showed combat videos from an army helicopter gunship. A TV news cameraman and his driver were killed during a shooting that was shown. So were other people.

Army lawyers also said that Manning wanted to be famous. They said that he did not care about how the leaks could hurt U.S. safety. Or other soldiers.

Manning's lawyers said he had the chance to get a lot more information to WikiLeaks. But he only gave out some information. He wanted to get people to talk about how the United States acted during the wars, his lawyers said.

Some Manning supporters showed up outside Fort Meade, where the trial was held. They carried signs. One read: "Stop the Wars Expose the Lies Free Bradley Manning," a news agency video showed.

One of Manning's lawyers briefly spoke to the supporters. He talked about the possible prison term, The Associated Press reported.

"We won the battle, now we need to go win the war," said David Coombs.

Lots of people have been watching the case. They want to see how it could affect others who might leak state secrets in the United States. Some people thought a guilty ruling on aiding the enemy could scare others. They might be afraid to leak something, even if they thought it was really important to do so.
## Another Big Leak Case

Even the "not guilty" decision on that charge offered only limited relief.

Manning still faces a long time in prison, said Elizabeth Goitein, a security expert at New York University School of Law. She called that "very scary."

The U.S. government is currently involved in another big leak case.

Edward Snowden recently revealed efforts by the government to spy on Americans' cellphone and Internet traffic. Snowden is currently stuck in a Russian airport. He is trying to get to another country to avoid U.S. criminal charges.

The Guardian newspaper received Snowden's leaks. It reported that Snowden said that one of the reasons he left the United States was the way Manning was treated by the military.

WikiLeaks creator Julian Assange praised Manning's actions.

"Bradley Manning is a hero," he said to CNN this week.
