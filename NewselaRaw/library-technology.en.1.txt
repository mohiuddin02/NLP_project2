MINNEAPOLIS — Ridwa Yakob thought libraries were just for books.

Then she saw the Teen Tech Center at the Minneapolis Central Library. This new digital playground has rows of new computers and iPads, as well as the latest video equipment and even its own soundproof recording studio.

"Growing up, I used to be super into reading. That's what I thought libraries were for," said Yakob, an 18-year-old who lives in Minneapolis. Now she's a member of the library's Teen Tech Squad, helping her peers with all sorts of high-tech resources, learning as she goes. "It gives me access to tools I don't have at home."

Shhhhhhh. You may not know it, but libraries have quietly become community tech centers where the digital tools go far beyond computer terminals with free Internet. Their offerings are expanding to 3-D printers, e-readers and social media. And a growing catalog of e-books, e-magazines and other online tools extend resources far beyond the library walls.

## Helping Others Research Online

Librarians were once masters of the card catalog, a filing system in which each book had its own card arranged in alphabetical order. Librarians have learned to search for information online, offering help with everything from basic computer skills to Facebook and LinkedIn. When it comes to e-readers, in particular, librarians have become the go-to people for answers.

"We're still teaching literacy. Now it's digital literacy," said Kim Johnson, who manages a library in Anoka County, Minn.

Library visitors wouldn't have it any other way.

At the most basic level, library users value Internet access almost as highly as books, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. Eighty percent of library-goers said that borrowing books was "very important." About the same number said free Internet access also was a "very important" library service.

The library's tech services really kicked into gear during the economic downturn starting in 2008, when many people lost their jobs. Job seekers needed to brush up on tech skills, search online for jobs, and get help with resumes. Library staff members quickly learned to help set up e-mail and LinkedIn accounts. They taught the basics of software like Microsoft Word and Excel, and guided people toward the most useful information online.

"If you were laid off in the last few years, you have to apply for unemployment online," said Maureen Gormley, information services manager for the Dakota County, Minn., libraries. "We're the place to go to learn that and basic skills."

## Tech Support For Those Who Need It

About the same time, e-books hit the virtual shelves. People started walking in with e-readers, like the Amazon Kindle — and questions.

"They come and ask me for e-book help. They usually end up with a little bit more," Anoka County library services assistant Andrea Egbert said of the many tech-related questions that people bring to her. Some walk in with new e-readers, still in the box, unsure how to switch them on. Job seekers ask for help formatting resumes. Others ask how to share photos and videos online.

Usually, Egbert knows what to do. If not, well, there's nothing like a question to motivate a librarian to search for answers.

"We all have that thirst for the hunt," she said.

While most library staffs are happy to help with downloading e-books, browsing the Internet and computer literacy, a librarian's tech support expertise isn't unlimited. If your tablet won't turn on or a screen is cracked, they will likely direct you elsewhere.

"We're not the (Apple) Genius Bar. If somebody drops their iPad in the bathtub, I can't help you," said Ben Trapskin, assistant director for Anoka County Libraries. "We try to focus on how the technology interacts with our resources."

## Expanding Access To Information

In some cases, technological advances mean less face-to-face contact at the library. People can download e-books without ever setting foot in their local branch. And students can get free homework help by live-chatting with tutors on the library's website.

Rather than complaining about these changes, librarians like Bernie Farrell see them as a way to expand access to information.

"What the library can do for you is not bound by bricks and mortar," said Farrell, senior librarian at the Minneapolis Central Library. "This size of the unseen library is pretty immense."

Gretchen Christenson of Eden Prairie, Minn., discovered this after taking basic computer skills classes at local libraries. Since then, she's used free online tutorials through the library. She's learned about everything from Microsoft Excel to the Cloud, which allows computer services and programs to be shared across multiple computers online.

"It gives you a start, the ability to learn on your own," Christenson said of the computer classes.

The library can also be a place to explore technology that most people still don't have at home. The Ramsey County, Minn., library system bought a MakerBot 3-D printer two years ago, mainly for teen programs. It proved so popular that they've organized 3-D printing classes for adults and purchased two new MakerBots.

"These are products that are new and people are sort of figuring out how to use them," said Marcus Lowry, teen librarian for Ramsey County.

Despite all of the technological advances, librarians say, there will always be books.

Barbara Stripling, president of the American Library Association, said that most people still prefer reading the old-fashioned way, ink on paper.

"We're not throwing away the relationships and the conversations and the reading of printed books," Stripling said. "We are adding on and maybe deepening the reading experience through technology."
