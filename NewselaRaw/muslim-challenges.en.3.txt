PITTSBURGH — Friday is a busy day at the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh. About 500 people gather to hear the weekly sermon. Volunteers in booths recruit people for different activities at the mosque.

There are children's activities, a food bank for needy people, and adult education.

But for many Muslims at this large Pennsylvania mosque, the terror attack in France earlier this month is on their minds. The attack was committed by men who called themselves Muslims. They killed people at the Charlie Hebdo paper in Paris because of cartoons showing the Muslim Prophet Muhammad.

## Messages Of Peace

Mosque organizers hope to get more people involved. They hope to fight back against violent messages put out by Muslim extremists.

The men who killed journalists in Paris were extremists. Boko Haram is an extremist group in Nigeria. In Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State — also known as ISIS or ISIL — is committing acts of violence. Al-Qaida, which carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States, is planning more attacks around the world. All these groups say they are Muslims.

In Pittsburgh, local Muslims are sending a different message.

Esra Daghestani is a 29-year-old who recently graduated from Duquesne University with a nursing degree. She was working at a booth to recruit volunteers for children's activities.

"Everything that's going on around the world is sad," she said. "The best thing you can do is try to help with the generation that's coming now."

She added, "It's important to tell the youth that ISIS and al-Qaida aren't really related to Islam. They're just people who use the name of Islam to get attention."

## Violence Is Not A Response

Sheikh Atef Mahgoub, the mosque's religious leader, or imam, leads the weekly prayers. He strongly criticized the Paris attackers.

The men "were not defending the honor of Islam," Mahgoub said. "They did exactly the opposite. Muslims all over the world are suffering because of this. Innocent people were killed, including a policeman who was a Muslim."

To fight back against groups preaching violence, Mahgoub said more education is the answer.

"Go to scholars, go to people who have more knowledge," he said.

The Prophet Muhammad would never respond to a personal insult with violence, Mahgoub said.

Muslims who really want to defend Islam's honor should live according to Muhammad's teachings, he said, which include "mercy" and "gentleness."

Muslims do not show Muhammad in pictures because the religion warns believers only to worship God, not an image or object showing God.

## On The Defensive

Charlie Hebdo not only published cartoons showing the Prophet Muhammad, it showed him in negative ways.

The cartoons upset many Muslims, which Mahgoub said is understandable, but it does not excuse violence.

"You definitely have the right to be offended, but you don't have the right to respond physically," he said.

Shahid Madni, who runs the mosque, said Islam is often on the defensive, and has to explain that it does not teach violence. "We always tell people we're not this, we're not that."

He hopes the mosque can reach out to the community so "we don't have to tell people what we're not, because people already know us."

## The Biggest Message

These Muslims in Pennsylvania are fighting a battle of ideas with violent groups like the Islamic State. The Islamic State produces propaganda — articles and videos pushing its violent message — and puts it out online.

Several young Muslim men at the mosque said they had never seen any of the violent propaganda.

Niaz Khan is a 23-year-old recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh. He plans to go to medical school.

He said young Muslims are fighting against this propaganda by bringing their friends into mosque activities. The mosque has a study room for students and many of the food-bank volunteers are students.

"Here, they'll get the appropriate Islamic knowledge to handle those kinds of things." Khan also said Islam teaches that injustices should be forgiven. "That's the biggest message."
