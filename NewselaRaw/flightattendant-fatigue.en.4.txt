Henry Lund was beat after a long day as a flight attendant when he arrived at his hotel in Alaska. He was desperate to sleep. He had a 4 a.m. wake-up call for the trip back to Minneapolis-St. Paul. He remembers taking a sleeping pill — maybe two.

That summer trip ended his career at Delta and Northwest airlines.

Lund, 49, got fired for shoving and insulting another flight attendant. He says he doesn't remember it.

His experience brings up a bigger problem for U.S. flight attendants. They work with less rest than those in foreign airlines. And they can rely more on sleeping pills than pilots do. Yet, like pilots, they must look out for passenger safety.

Exhausted flight attendants have sometimes forgotten safety duties. Airlines have cut rest periods to save money. This may have increased the risk of mistakes.

## Too Tired To Work Safely?

"They're showing up to work impaired," said Peter Roma. He does research for the Federal Aviation Administration on lack of sleep and fatigue. The FAA makes sure air travel in the U.S. is safe.

The dangers of tiredness appear in flight attendants' own words.  Dozens of reports have been filed with the FAA.

"If there were an evacuation, I doubted my abilities," wrote one. This was the effect of working 12 hours without a break.

Another injured a foot after she was struck by coffee pots she forgot to secure. "This occurred because I was very tired," the flight attendant wrote. "I did not sleep well the night prior … constantly watching the clock in anticipation of my early wake-up call."

There has been concern about tired pilots. The FAA in 2011 toughened its rules for pilot rest. This came after a flight crashed in upstate New York. Safety investigators found that pilots in the crash were likely too tired to fly properly.

The FAA set a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots prior to duty. It goes into effect next January.

But less attention is paid to flight attendants. That's even though the FAA calls them the first line of defense in an emergency.

## "They Can't Be Run Down"

"These are not just cocktail waitresses," said Jim Oberstar, a former congressman who works on transportation issues. "If the flight attendant has to get you out of that plane in 90 seconds, they have to be alert. They can't be run down."

One expert thinks flight attendants and pilots should get similar rest.

"Why would we not want to keep fatigue managed to the same degree?" asked John Cox. He runs a flight safety company. "The stresses are different, but the days are equally long or longer."

Rest times for many Northwest Airlines flight attendants have shortened. This happened after Delta Airlines bought Northwest. "Our duty days have gotten two to three hours longer in a lot of cases," said flight attendant Julianna Helminski.

The FAA typically requires at least nine hours' rest. But that can be cut to eight hours sometimes.

## Getting Less Sleep And Working Longer

FAA studies were conducted from 2008 through 2012. The studies surveyed thousands of flight attendants. They focused on sleep patterns of 200 working domestic and international flights. They revealed that:

—U.S. flight attendants catch fewer than six hours' sleep a day. That's the average on domestic routes. They get fewer than five hours' sleep on international layovers.

—Sleep times declined during the bad economy. Airlines often scheduled flight crews "up to the regulation limits."

—Forty percent of flight attendants used sleep aids.

An American Airlines flight attendant finds this familiar. He flies between Miami, the Dominican Republic and Panama. He says he often works 14-hour days with a 10-hour layover. He does this twice a week.

"By the time you close that door behind you at the hotel, it's usually 9:30 or 10 o'clock," he said. He had a  6:30 wake-up the next morning.

"The first thing I do when I get to the hotel is take my Ambien because it takes a good hour to kick in," he said. Ambien is a popular sleeping pill. "I can't sleep without it."

On short sleep, he said, he'll sometimes fail to secure carry-on bags. He asked to not be named for fear he would be fired.

## Bad Side Effects From Sleeping Pills

An FAA rule says pilots generally can't use sleep medications. There is no such rule for flight attendants.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns about Ambien and other sleeping pills. They've been linked to rare but "serious side effects." Some of those side effects include bad behavior and confusion.

Lund supposedly showed such behavior on his final flight. Apparently, crew and passengers saw Lund shoving a colleague. He was heard calling him a jerk.

Lund was a flight attendant for 14 years.  He was not acting like himself that day, said Tim Oyler, a former Northwest manager. "He was known as an excellent flight attendant. … I was shocked when I heard."
