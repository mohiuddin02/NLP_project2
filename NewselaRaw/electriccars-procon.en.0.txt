### PRO: Continue subsidies to shore up industry, economy

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — It would be very unwise to "pull the plug" on electric-car subsidies at this time. Without the subsidies, the auto industry would be forced by unavoidable regulation to sell electric vehicles at huge financial losses. One of the few bright spots in the current American economy, a thriving auto industry, would be thrown into turmoil.

That regulation presents a huge challenge to automakers: between now and 2025 the average fuel economy of a new car or light truck must increase from less than 30 miles per gallon to more than 50 miles per gallon while the share of "zero emission vehicles" — mostly electrics — in California and nine other states must rise from less than 1 percent to 15 percent of new vehicle fleets.

These regulations were adopted with laudable goals: reducing oil dependence, and thereby enhancing the security of the U.S. economy; and improving environmental quality by reducing smog and the greenhouse gases linked to [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).

One can argue that these policies are overly stringent or unrealistic but they are not scheduled for reconsideration by the federal government until 2017.

Recognizing the formidable challenge imposed on industry, the federal government and the states enacted generous subsidies for the nascent electric vehicle industry — the battery suppliers, vehicle manufacturers, recharging companies and consumers.

That is why, given the long lead times necessary to launch a new electric vehicle industry, this is the wrong time to do a policy U-turn although the temptation is understandable.

Critics argue correctly that President Obama's national goal of one million plug-in vehicles by 2015 was overly optimistic and will not be accomplished. However, the rate of sales of plug-in vehicles from 2010-2013 is accelerating rapidly.

From 2010 to 2013 the growth rate of plug-in vehicles has already surpassed the growth in sales of conventional hybrids, including the Toyota Prius, when they were first introduced from 2000 to 2003.

In the next few years, much can be learned from the experience of Oslo, Norway, where plug-in vehicles are already becoming the preferred choice of many consumers.

It is true that the first generation of plug-in vehicles, including the Chevrolet Volt, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla sports car, do not meet the transport needs of most American motorists at an affordable price.

However, based on hard work that began four years ago, the second generation of plug-in vehicles is about to hit vehicle showrooms, as every auto maker from Toyota to Volkswagen will be offering some form of plug-in vehicle.

The industry has entered a healthy phase of competition where each auto maker is striving to offer the plug-in vehicle with the best combination of driving range, recharging time, performance, and price.

The subsidies that now exist can be seen as support for a large demonstration project for a promising new technology that could prove to be a breakthrough for the entire transport sector of the U.S. economy.

In the long run, the electric vehicle must win its place in the marketplace without any government subsidy. Indeed, electric vehicles should ultimately be taxed to help pay for road maintenance and repairs, just as owners of gasoline-powered vehicles now pay a tax on gasoline and diesel fuel.

But the right time to reconsider tax policy and subsidies is 2017, at the same time that the federal regulatory system is scheduled for refinement.

### CON: Electric cars are running on empty promises

WASHINGTON — If government actually could mandate innovation, we could all fill up our cars with garden hoses.

But even Washington can't turn water into automotive fuel and that's why federal subsidies premised upon technological breakthroughs — such as those for electric cars — are a waste of money.

What we drive says a lot about us.

What an electric car says about its owners is that they either don't have children or have no reasonable hope of ever having any.

Electric cars simply don't provide families with the right combination of price, size and range for their needs.

Children are very expensive, with the average cost of raising a child the first 18 years now over $240,000. Add college tuition to that and the cost of each child can easily exceed $340,000.

At the same time, the higher one's income — and the more likely one can afford higher-cost electric cars — the less likely one is to have children. The bottom fifth of wage-earners are nearly 50 percent more likely to have children than top fifth.

Electric cars don't deliver the value families need. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the lifetime cost of an electric hybrid car is $12,000 more than a conventional vehicle, so subsidies have to be at least 60 percent higher than the current maximum federal subsidy of $7,500 to overcome the cost disparity.

But no amount of federal action can resolve other problems.

—These cars are too small, as space is sacrificed for technological needs and to minimize vehicle weight to extend the range.

—The typical all-electric car has an under 100-mile range between charges.

—Charges can take hours and leave one vulnerable to the increasingly unreliable power grid.

Electric-gas hybrid cars are a better alternative, but are more expensive and less spacious.

Range is a huge issue for families. As the automotive evaluation firm J.D. Power and Associates notes, electric cars are best for "drivers with predictable, unwavering daily driving requirements."

Kids' schedules are many things, but reliable isn't one of them. As anyone who has children can attest, kids have unscheduled band, choir, soccer, football, and dance practices. They occasionally get sick and need to be taken home. They even, from time to time, get detention and must stay late.

The $7.5 billion we'll spend over 10 years promoting electric cars will accomplish only one thing: Propping up a niche product.

J.D. Power says electric car owners "most often cite environmental friendliness as the most important benefit" of such cars. But even here, electric vehicles fail.

A Journal of Industrial Ecology report found that manufacturing electric vehicles produces over double the carbon dioxide emissions of building conventional automobiles. Furthermore, electric vehicles are charged with electricity generated from conventional fossil fuels and require batteries containing toxic chemicals. Environmental benefits are marginal at best.

It was 116 years ago that the first commercially-available electric car went on the market.

Electric cars have been running on empty promises ever since. When it comes to federal subsidies, it's time to pull the plug.
