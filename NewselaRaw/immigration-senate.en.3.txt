WASHINGTON â€” The Senate passed a bill on Thursday to improve the nation's immigration system. The plan reaches far and wide to create a path for millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally to some day become citizens.

At the same time, the government will have to go to great lengths to tighten up security on the border. The bill passed with 68 Senators in favor and 32 against.

The measure represents the most sweeping changes to immigration law since the 1980s. After sailing through the Senate, it now faces a tough path through the House of Representatives, where Republicans outnumber Democrats.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said flatly: "The House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes. We're going to do our own bill."

Everyone was expecting the bill to pass. But the vote had some drama. The Senators had to vote from their seats, which usually only happens during history-making occasions. One by one, they rose to declare their votes. The Senate gallery was packed with observers, including an entire section of college students and parents wearing bright blue "United We Dream" T-shirts.

## Bill Of A Thousand Pages

Senators from both parties wrote the bill, which was a thousand pages long. They put in changes just this week to win more support from members who were not convinced. Fourteen Republicans joined 52 Democrats and two Independents in voting yes. Thirty-two Republicans voted no. The eight authors of the bill are known as the "Gang of Eight" senators.

The debate stirred strong emotions on the Senate floor.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., recalled Sen. Edward Kennedy, who worked tirelessly to fix immigration before he died in 2009. "Senator Kennedy knew the day would come when a group of senators divided by party, but united by love of country, would see this fight to the finish," Reid said.

"That day is today. And while I am sad that Senator Kennedy isn't here to see history made, I know he is looking down on us proudly. He is not alone," Reid said as he closed the debate.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., played a major role in creating the bill. Some conservatives blasted him for trying to find common ground. He talked about his parents before the vote. Both his mother and father came from Cuba.

"Well before they became citizens, in their hearts they had already become Americans," he said. "It reminds us that sometimes we focus so much on how immigrants could change America, that we forget that America changes immigrants even more."

He added, "This is not just my story. "This is our story. It reminds us that we are 'E Pluribus Unum.' Out of many, one."

## 13-Year Path To Citizenship

The bill says that companies must check to make sure a worker is allowed to live in the U.S. It will also raise the number of  skilled workers allowed to immigrate into the U.S. to work in technology jobs.

There are believed to be 11 million immigrants who came to the U.S. without permission. The bill would make it possible for them to become citizens in 13 years. They would have to pass a background check, have not been convicted of a serious crime, pay any taxes owed and pay a $500 fine.

But the bill says that the path to citizenship can only be opened if the U.S. beefs up border security. The plan calls for more towers, sensors, [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), helicopters and boats to prevent more people from crossing the border illegally. A 700-mile fence would be built between the U.S. and Mexico.

Twenty thousand more Border Patrol agents would be added. There are already 18,400 working along the border.

## A Growing Hispanic Population

Opponents said the plan pardons people who broke the law. They questioned whether the security measures are realistic.

Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., lead the Senators who were against the bill. He warned that it will not "end the lawlessness in the future."

Other Republicans had a different take. They mostly come from states with a large or growing number of Hispanic people. They are worried that an important voting block is slipping away. Last year, their presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, won only about one-fourth of the Hispanic vote.

"If someone is going to be here in this country for 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years, I want them to assimilate," said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. "I want them to have the rights, and more importantly, the responsibilities that come with citizenship."
