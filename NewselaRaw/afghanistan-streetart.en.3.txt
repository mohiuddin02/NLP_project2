KABUL, Afghanistan — Kabul once had wide avenues lined with rose gardens. That was before nearly 40 years of war.

Today, its street are crowded with traffic and bordered with concrete blast walls. After recent bombing attacks, the blast walls were put up almost overnight. They appear in rows outside government buildings, businesses and the homes of powerful people. They protect the people inside from bombs and bullets.

Kabir Mokamel is an artist who returned to Kabul from Australia four years ago. Mokamel uses street art to show the problems in Afghanistan caused by wars.

He calls his group the Art Lords. He named it to criticize the country's warlords. They are the military leaders who are celebrated as warrior heroes.

"I want people to define who really are the heroes of my city — the people who clean the city, for instance," said Mokamel. "Throughout the history of Afghanistan, it's all about the people who fought, who have swords, who have guns. We want to include something else, like the people who take part in the betterment of the city and of our lives."

## Changing Perceptions Of Who Is Heroic

Artists from his group recently painted a picture of street sweepers in orange work jackets and traditional scarves on a blast wall. Next to it, they wrote,"The Heroes of My City: The Street Sweepers." The words are written in large black letters that can be clearly seen by drivers in the street.

Ahmad Jan is a 26-year-old worker. He stopped one sunny afternoon to look at the mural. "It's interesting to Afghans," he said. "Everybody crossing the street will take a look and read the message and then get a different" view.

Volunteer Maryam Kohi comes every day to help paint. She said the walls are blocking the streets and "make the city look like a prison." The city is polluted with dirt and officials are not honest. She said they are corrupt, which means they take money for favors. "With these paintings we want to take our anti-corruption message to the people," Kohl said.

## Dishonesty, Corruption Hurt Afghanistan

Ashraf Ghani is the Afghan president. He said officials who are not honest threaten the country. Afghanistan has been named by Transparency International, an anti-corruption group, as one of the most corrupt countries on earth.

Mokamel said corruption is more than just dishonesty. Corruption is also not working hard, not standing in line, dangerous driving and bothering women on the street.

Kabul was originally built for 450,000 people, but about 4.5 million now live in the city. Transportation, water pipes and sewers have not kept up with the growing population.

"People were very trusting and very friendly," he recalled. "These values have disappeared" because of the wars.

Mokamel hopes to help people treat each other well again. "I learned a lot outside and I wanted to bring it back," he said.

## Healing The Wounds Of War

The Art Lords' work includes a series Mokamel described as "healing the wounds of Afghanistan." It features red hearts on a white wall. One heart is a balloon held by a little girl and one is being pulled in a handcart. A red map of Afghanistan is covered with a Band-Aid. The next series will be about the bombings, which have killed many people.

Mokamel's street art first appeared in July on a wall in front of a government building. He painted a picture of a pair of beautiful woman's eyes. They are a warning to corrupt officials.

Afghans were excited by the eyes, because they immediately understood their meaning. Corruption and not enough jobs are among the biggest problems in Afghanistan.

The arts are beginning to return to Afghanistan, but ordinary Afghans, who are poor, have little chance to see them. Fans of the Art Lords' street art come back day after day to help. "I tell them it's really important because the minute you put the stroke of a brush on a wall, that much of the wall has disappeared," Mokamel said.
