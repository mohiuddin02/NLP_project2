MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan â€” Sara Bahai is a brave person. She is the only woman in all of Afghanistan who works as a cab driver. Women in her country are not supposed to work outside the home.

Bahai took on her unusual job because she loves driving. She also has a large family to support.

She still remembers her first time behind the wheel. "I felt like I was in the sky, and I totally fell in love with driving," she said.

## Driving Is A Bold Choice

In Afghanistan, many people still feel women should not work, except at home. Men get angry if a woman even goes out by herself.

Bahai is about 40 years old. She has been following her own path for years. She never got married, as women are expected to do in Afghanistan. She had to support her parents and other people in her family, she said. She feared a husband would stop her from working.

Because she had no children of her own, Bahai adopted two boys. Both are now in high school.

Bahai's brother-in-law was killed some years ago. After that happened, Bahai took in her sister and seven nieces and nephews. She now supports a dozen people.

## She Wants To Change Things For Women

Bahai drives her cab around the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. Her yellow and white cab is spotlessly clean.

Bahai gets phone calls from people who tell her to "not drive in the city because I am a woman," she said.

Men who get into her cab seem "very jealous," she said. Often, they are very rude to her and some threaten her.

"I don't care what they think of me, I am not afraid," she said. She will do what she can to change things for women in her country, she said.

Bahai began driving a cab in 2002. She also fixes cars and teaches other women to drive.

## Stuck In Old Ideas

Ideas about women are slowly changing in Afghanistan. However, outside the big cities, things are pretty much the same as they always were.

Many Afghanis still feel that women should not go out alone. They think women should only go outside with a man from their family. Women who go out alone can be treated very badly.

Still, things have gotten better. Millions of girls now go to school. It is no longer unusual for women to travel to other countries by themselves. Some women now live alone in big Afghan cities.

## It Can Be A Happy Place To Live

Rula Ghani is Afghanistan's new first lady. She has been fighting for women's rights since her husband became president in September.

The first lady gave an important speech on Sunday. She said that Afghan "women should be respected both inside and outside their homes." They should become "doctors, engineers, soldiers, police officers."

Bahai says things are slowly getting better for Afghan women. They are starting to live their own lives, just like her.

"Step by step everything is going to be all right," she said.

"My message for Afghan women is to stand up for yourselves," she said. "Help to make Afghanistan a happy place to live."
