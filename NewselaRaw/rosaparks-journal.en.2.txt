WASHINGTON — Rosa Parks is known as "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement." At the time of her arrest in 1955, buses were segregated — meaning they had different seating areas for blacks and whites. Parks was arrested after she refused to give up her seat for a white male passenger. Her courageous stand inspired a historic campaign to end segregation on buses.

Despite her prominent role in the fight against segregation, the public has never thought of Parks as a forceful, angry protester. Instead, she has always been portrayed as proper, gentle and ladylike.

A black-and-white photograph that shows Rosa Parks re-enacting her refusal to give up her seat fits the image we have of her. She is conservatively dressed and holds her handbag tightly on her lap, so as not to bother any of the other passengers. She certainly does not seem militant — that is, forceful and combative.

## A Complex Woman

There was much more to Parks than her public image suggests. Journals and letters from the same period as her 1955 arrest show that she was feeling hurt and angry. They reveal that she found segregation in Montgomery, Alabama, so soul-crushing that "the line between reason and madness grows thinner."

"Such a good job of 'brain washing' was done on the Negro, that a militant Negro was almost a freak of nature to them," she wrote. An African-American who spoke up forcefully against injustice was often "ridiculed by others of his own group."

Both sides of Parks' personality — the calm, determined protester and the furious agitator for change — can be seen in newly released documents. The collection includes 7,500 manuscripts and 2,500 photographs.

The documents are on loan to the Library of Congress for the next 10 years.

The collection opens to the public on Wednesday, which would have been Parks' 102nd birthday. Parks died in 2005 at age 92.

## A Time Capsule Of Her Life

The journals detail the injustices of her daily life as a seamstress in the Montgomery Fair department store. Black employees of the store were forced to eat lunch leaning up against the blacks-only bathroom. They also show her raw anger at the murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till in Mississippi, less than four months before Parks' arrest. Parks called Till's murder a killing "that could be multiplied many times in the South."

The documents are very varied. They range from a peanut butter pancake recipe scribbled on the back of a bank envelope, to a program for a brunch honoring militant activist Angela Davis. There are postcards from the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., along with a worn Bible.

Parks deliberately maintained her image as shy and proper, said Adrienne Cannon, an expert on African-American history. During the 1950s, a woman — particularly a black woman — was not expected to be forceful. An angry black woman would be seen negatively by the public. If Parks had let all her feelings out she might have hurt her cause, so she tried hard to always seem gentle and ladylike. However, Cannon said, "in this collection, we hear more of that militant voice."

Cannon said that she believed Parks wanted history to have a fuller picture of her. The papers were maintained as a sort of time capsule, for a day when her more militant side could be understood.

"She held onto them until the end of her life, the most personal of the personal," Canon said. "She wanted us to know the true Rosa Parks."

## "The Law Is The Law"

Parks wrote about her experiences growing up in rural Alabama. She recalled her fear as a 6- or 7-year-old, seeing her grandfather stand watch with a shotgun to protect their home from the Ku Klux Klan, a racist group responsible for attacks against blacks.

"I wanted to see him kill a Ku Kluxer," she wrote.

Parks was already an activist by 1955, when she refused to give up her seat on the bus. She had been influenced by her husband, her grandfather and an Alabama group known as the Women's Political Council.

"I had been pushed around all my life and felt at this moment that I couldn't take it any more," she wrote. "When I asked the policeman why we had to be pushed around? He said he didn't know. 'The law is the law. You are under arrest.'

"There is just so much hurt, disappointment and oppression one can take," she wrote.

## She Made A Difference

Parks' arrest for staying in her bus seat inspired a successful 13-month campaign to end the segregation of Montgomery buses.

Parks, who lost her job after her arrest, moved to Detroit in 1957. In 1965, she began working for Democratic Congressman John Conyers Jr.

In 1996, President Bill Clinton awarded Parks the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Parks never had children, but later in her life she received birthday cards from students all over the world. Among them was a batch she kept from the Prairie View Intermediate School in Texas, sent in 2000.

"Dear Mrs. Parks," a student named Zack wrote, "I think what you did for African-Americans is great. Was it scary to go to jail?"
