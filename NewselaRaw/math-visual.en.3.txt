SAN JOSE, California â€” Do you hate math? Are you bad at it? If so, it is probably not your fault. It could just be the way math is taught in schools.

Many students have a hard time in math class. Carol Dweck and Jo Boaler say confusing explanations are the reason. Both are professors at Stanford and are experts in how people learn.

The two women have come up with what they say are better ways to teach math. More and more math teachers are starting to use the women's ideas in their own classrooms.

## Practice, Practice, Like Music Or Sports

In a regular math class, students are supposed to memorize the right answers to a lot of different problems. They are expected to solve problems as quickly as possible.

The new approach involves talking through problems instead of having kids just memorize. Teachers often use pictures to demonstrate ideas. Each student is given a lesson at their own level and teachers make sure no one remains confused.

"Learning to do math is no different from learning to play the piano or learning to play a sport," David Foster said. He works with a group that helps improve the way people are taught math. He does not think it is true that some people are born bad at math, while others are naturally good at it. Everyone can learn to understand math, Foster added. "A lot of it is about hard work and practice," he said.

Dweck says that teachers should help students try again if they do not understand a math problem at first. Getting an answer wrong is nothing to be ashamed of. Mistakes can help students learn and understand if they are given enough time to think through a problem.

## Doing The Math Out Loud Helps

Last summer Boaler offered a free online math course that 85,000 people took. Lessons looked at the ways people use math in everyday life. Students talked about math problems, instead of just memorizing. Talking through problems helped them to  better understand how math works.

Many kids get the idea that math class is only about getting the right answer quickly, Boaler said. "Then they get the idea that they can't do it," she added.

In a regular math class, "it feels like you have to do it faster," said sixth-grader Sahin Dokal. "I can't think that hard."

Math classes should not be just about solving problems quickly, Dweck and Boaler said. They should be about getting all students to understand, even if it takes them a while. Student effort should be recognized too, not just getting the right answer.

At San Francisco 49ers Academy in California, math teacher David Hicks will often ask his students a puzzle-like math question. Then he guides their thinking as they solve the problem step by step. Hicks writes everything the students say on the class whiteboard. They talk it through.

## Connecting The Math Dots

Good teaching is the most important thing when it comes to getting kids to understand math. A good teacher will keep track of each student and will make sure no one is still confused at the end of a lesson.

Sixth-grader Michelle Rojas said she hated math when she was younger. When she asked a question, teachers "explained it in their own college way." They did not match their answer to "the grade level you were in," she said. These days she is understanding lessons much better.

Connecting math to everyday life is also important, teachers and students say.

"The more you can connect the math to their life," the better, said math teacher Mona Keeler. It makes math meaningful and "takes off that pressure" to get the correct answer right away.

What is the evidence that these new ways work? For one thing, there are plenty of happy stories from teachers themselves.

"I've seen humongous growth" in students' math abilities, Keeler said.

"We can have kids loving math," Boaler said.
