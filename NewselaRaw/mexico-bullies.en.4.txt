MEXICO CITY — The government in Mexico hopes to stop a dangerous problem in Mexican society: school bullying.

Mexico's president spoke against [bullying](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying) during a visit to a Mexican state with a violence problem. Famous Mexicans joined in on Twitter. They held signs with the hashtag "#ElBullyingNoEsUnJuego," or "Bullying is not a game." And on June 11, Mexico's government said that it would work with teachers to stop bullying.

"The government has made a commitment … to make schools free of acoso escolar," the president said. "Acosco escolar" is Spanish for the "hurting of students."

People paid more attention to the anti-bullying message after a 12-year-old boy died in May. He had been grabbed by a group of students. They threw him against a wall. Newspapers said the boy told his teacher about being bullied but was ignored.

## Standing Up To The Violence

A top official in the government said they had been working on fixing the bullying problem since last year.

He said that before, bullying had been mostly ignored.

"I think it was given less importance for many years. It was considered normal," he said.

The government official said the problem of bullying comes from outside of school. It often starts in families. But he said that schools should at least be a safe space for students.

Mexican journalist Monica Garza does not support the anti-bullying movement. She said the word could just become a trendy term. The country is full of social problems, she says. Bad treatment and abuse of people of all ages has been a problem for a long time.

"Mexico is a violent country that tolerates violence," Garza wrote. "Bullying," she said, "has become the word of the moment."

## Time To Talk About The Word

The anti-bullying effort was inspired by anti-bullying programs in the United States. It's not surprising that in Mexico, the English word has been adopted into everyday language.

Because there is no single Spanish word for "bullying," children outside a middle school on the southern edge of Mexico City use the English word. They pronounced it "boo-leeng." Sometimes they used Spanglish verbs like "buleando."

Using the word "bullearon," 12-year-old Julian Perez said, "I've been bullied because of my stature. I'm short. But I've become used to it and if I don't pay it any mind, they leave me alone."

Parent Renata Fernandez, 44, had a slightly different thought.

"I think bullying has always existed," she said. "But now it's in fashion to talk about this theme. Before it didn't get a lot of attention."
