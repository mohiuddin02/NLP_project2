LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” Joanna Robles was searching in a Spirit Halloween store for something for her baby son to wear on Halloween. She saw a Batman bib-and-booties for $14.99.

The baby's father really likes superheroes, she said.

Robles is one of 157 million Americans who are expected to celebrate Halloween this year. They may walk their kids around the block for free candy. They might carve a pumpkin or wear a costume to a neighborhood party.

Halloween was once mostly for children. It has grown into a major shopping holiday. People who celebrate now include 18- to 34-year-olds, known as millennials. Older adults also get in on the fun.

"It's not just for kids trick-or-treating anymore," Spirit Halloween's Trisha Lombardo said. The company has 1,150 stores that open just for the Halloween season.

## Getting Into The Halloween Spirit Is Expensive

Shoppers will spend $6.9 billion on Halloween this year, the National Retail Federation says. It is a group that represents people who run stores. That is an average of $74.34 a person. The numbers are based on a survey.

The estimated spending is down from a high of $8 billion, or $79.82 a shopper, in 2012. Still, it is more than double the Halloween spending 10 years ago.

The spending is mostly done at stores and theme parks. It also helps farmers who grow pumpkins. Pumpkins are big sellers around Halloween.

Businesses say there are several reasons that the holiday is popular.

One reason is that young people really like group activities, Lombardo said. This leads to extra costume sales and more trips to theme parks, she said.

## Show Me Your Costume, I'll Show You Mine

People also love sharing online. They post photos and videos of their Halloween costumes, decorations and celebrations, experts said.

About 1 out of every 8 people used Facebook or Pinterest to look for costume ideas, the National Retail Federation said. Nearly 1-in-3 said they looked online for Halloween costumes.

"I post stuff after I pick out my outfit," especially on Facebook and Instagram, said shopper Jessica Medina. "I also search online to see what's out there and my friends post things."

The growth of social media like Facebook has been a big deal for Halloween, said Jeff Green. He helps retailers improve their businesses. The growth in Halloween spending over the last 10 years has been almost the same as the growth in social media during that time, he said.

## Don't Forget The Jack-o-Lantern

Spending on Halloween is still far less than what people spend on the winter holiday season. Shoppers spend about $616 billion during the Thanksgiving and Christmas season. People also spend more on Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and Father's Day.

The reason is people mostly do not give Halloween gifts, said Kathy Grannis Allen. She is a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation.

Nonetheless, "it's still a huge business for a retailer," she said.

Halloween sales are expected to drop a bit this year compared with 2014. One reason is that many people are re-using older Halloween items.

Items such as candy and pumpkins spoil, though. They cannot be reused. Nine out of 10 Americans are expected to buy candy this year. They will likely spend about $2.1 billion, slightly less than last year.

Just fewer than half of all Americans will carve a fresh pumpkin. In fact, most pumpkins grown in California are for Halloween sales.

## "Scary Farm" If You Dare

One big Halloween retailer is Party City. Halloween is huge for the company. One-quarter of its sales each year come from Halloween.

Then there are the haunted amusement parks. One is Knott's "Scary Farm" in the Los Angeles area.

Knott's does not say how much it makes just around Halloween. Still, Knott's spokesman Jason Soyster said Halloween is an important time of year for the company to make money.
