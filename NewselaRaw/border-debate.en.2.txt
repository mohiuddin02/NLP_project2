There were fewer children stopped crossing the border on their own in October than there were last year at the same time, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The organization keeps track of who comes into the United States to make sure that people do not immigrate illegally.

Yet the announcement came as another government battle over immigration seems to be unavoidable.

President Barack Obama has said he will issue an executive order changing some immigration rules. The executive order will let him avoid seeking the approval of Congress. Among the proposals being considered is action that would let more than 5 million illegal immigrants stay in the country.

## Getting Ready For Battle

Republicans have vowed to fight the president, who is a Democrat. They argue that an executive order would ruin any relationship with the new Congress. The Republican Party won control over both houses of Congress in elections earlier this month. Until the new congressional session begins in January, Republicans have a majority in the House of Representatives and the Democrats have a majority in the Senate.

Over the summer, a huge number of children and their families were caught illegally crossing the border into the United States. The situation only worsened the ongoing immigration debate. There are already more than 11 million people living in the United States without permission. In general, Democrats argue they should be allowed to stay. Republicans insist that border security must first be strengthened to prevent even more people from crossing the border illegally.

## The Numbers Tell The Declining Story

The latest tallies show that the number of children crossing the border on their own fell about 40 percent in October 2014 compared with October 2013. Last October, 4,181 unaccompanied children were stopped at the border. This year, there were 2,529, the agency said.

The number of families who were caught trying to enter to country also fell. In October 2013, 2,414 families were stopped at the border, compared with 2,163 in October 2014, a decrease of about 10 percent, the agency said.

The decrease is part of a continuing trend, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said last month. He is also in charge of the border protection agency.

Johnson said that over the last 15 years, the number of illegal immigrants stopped on the border with Mexico declined significantly. It is at its lowest level since the 1970s, Johnson said

## Many Steps Taken To Control Crossings

Last summer, the largest number of children traveling by themselves and others crossed the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley. The valley is located along the southern tip of Texas along the Rio Grande River, the border with Mexico. Johnson said the immigrants were searching for family members and a better life in this country. He said the border agency responded forcefully. "And, in fact, now the numbers of unaccompanied children crossing into the Rio Grande Valley are at the lowest they've been in almost two years," he said.

Johnson said the government has been able to cut the number of illegal immigrants for several reasons. Hundreds of border patrol agents were moved to the Rio Grande Valley. The government started doing more to stop criminal groups, which helped people cross the border illegally. More flights were added to send people back Central America. It also increased public awareness campaigns to stop people from leaving and persuaded Mexican officials to stop immigrants from crossing Mexico. Most of the illegal immigrants entering the United States were coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in Central America.

## President, Congress Face Off

The seriousness of the immigration issue was emphasized Friday. During a news conference Obama spoke about an immigration reform bill that would have allowed at least some of the people in the country illegally to stay. Last year, the Senate passed the bill. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives took no action on the bill, so it did not become a law.

Obama said that he warned a congressman that if "Congress failed to act, I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better."

Obama said, "And that's going to happen. That's going to happen before the end of the year."

Republicans have loudly criticized the president's promise to let the illegal immigrants stay.

"We're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path. This is the wrong way to govern. This is exactly what the American people said on Election Day they didn't want," John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, said Thursday. "And so, all the options are on the table."

Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is the new Senate majority leader. He said an executive order by Obama would "poison the well" as far as the new Republican majority in the Senate was concerned.

It is unclear what action Obama will take. One possibility is protecting parents, husbands and wives of U.S. citizens and permanent residents from being deported. The order would prevent them from being forcibly sent back to their home countries. Obama is also considering expanding a program that protects young immigrants from being deported.
