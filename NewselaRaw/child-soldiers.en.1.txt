SIBUT, Central African Republic — At 14, Jordy doesn't look much taller than the gun he carried for the rebels.

"It was a way to protect myself, and it was a way to survive," said Jordy, a former child soldier for a rebel army.

"I did a lot of bad things," he said, eyes downcast. "I ransacked. I pillaged. I took people's things by force."

The conflict tearing the Central African Republic apart has turned neighbor against neighbor and has brought childhood to a halt.

## Soldiers And "Wives"

Children have seen their parents hacked to pieces and watched as boys and girls just like them were shot or maimed. Some have been forced to make cold calculations far beyond their years, taking up arms with the same fighters who upended their lives or killed their relatives.

Children have been pawns in virtually every conflict in this country, one of the poorest in the world and plagued for decades by coups, mutinies and rebellions. When a mostly Muslim rebel coalition known as the Seleka seized power from the government a little more than a year ago, as many as 3,500 children were in the ranks of armed groups. The number of child soldiers swelled to 6,000 or more as self-defense militias started fighting back, UNICEF estimates.

Some children, like Jordy, were handed guns, while others were enslaved and forced to carry heavy loads or serve as "wives" to the rebels.

Children barely in their teens still accompany fighters along the rutted 100-mile road from Bangui, the capital, to Jordy's hometown, Sibut. Even by day, armed men threaten travelers from makeshift roadblocks. Other fighters march the winding route to Sibut with rifles and machetes slung over their shoulders and protective amulets draped around their necks.

The Seleka left behind nearly 400 children when they were pushed from power in January. Recently, the humanitairan organization UNICEF negotiated the release of more than 1,000 boys and girls from the militias.

The agency made some of the former rebel children available to tell their stories on the condition that their precise location and their full names not be used.

On a recent day, dozens of the children were gathering on a shaded veranda in Sibut.

Although several of them appealed to the visitors with shy, winsome smiles, a few were angry, shouting that they needed help. A pregnant young girl was pushed forward. "See what they did?" a boy said of the rebels.

## Charly's Story

Not long ago, Charly had money, a rebel uniform that commanded fear, and an AK-47 he wasn't afraid to use.

The thought of the return back to his old life, before he became a soldier, makes him sit rigid with anger, his eyes flashing.

"See the shoes I'm wearing?" the teenager snapped, pointing at a pair of dusty blue flip-flops full of holes.

With the rebels, he had power, he said, adding, "I had boots, a uniform and a gun in my hand."

More than a year ago, Charly was 15, and selling soap, sugar and other goods from a market stall here in Sibut. His father was dead, and his mother couldn't support him.

The fighters streamed in on motorcycles and in pickup trucks, he remembered, firing their guns, ransacking homes and businesses, and setting them on fire.

"When they saw I was brave, and I could point out houses to rob, they accepted me," he said. He was given a Kalashnikov assault rifle and sent on patrols around his hometown, his fear replaced by arrogance.

"Everyone saw me carrying an AK," he said. When an old woman tried to curse his grandmother, "I was furious, so I shot her in the foot."

When the rebels continued their advance on Bangui, the capital of the country, Jordy, Charly and other youths went with them. Some were forced to go, but others were enticed by the prospect of looting in the capital.

"When I saw them starting to kill people, that's when I left," Charly said.

Charly had a grandmother who took care of him, but many  children don't even know where their relatives are — hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in the fighting. Humanitarian workers who are caring for some of the former fighters and sex slaves can spend months trying to locate the children's families.

When the families can be traced, they may be reluctant to take back a former fighter, since children who are used to carrying weapons find it hard to obey their parents.

## Mireille's Story

Mireille was 14 when a rebel colonel spotted her last year and announced he wanted to marry her.

"I said, 'No, I'm still young,'" recalled the slender girl with intricately braided hair, sitting hunched on a bench, wringing her hands in her lap.

That night, the rebel colonel showed up at her home, and took her to a Seleka base, where he gave her a new name, Kadija, and raped her.

"I wanted to escape, but I couldn't because everyone had weapons," she said.

After several months, the colonel lost interest in Mireille and took other "wives," including her older sister.

The reunification process has been especially difficult for the 78 girls freed by the Seleka, many of whom, like Mireille, were sexually abused. Their families and communities often consider them tainted.

It took two weeks for Mireille's mother to allow her into the house again, and today Mireille has no interest in getting married or starting a family.

Many children still march with the fighters, but those who have left struggle to find a way forward.

Mireille said she'd like to go back to school, Jordy said he would like to try farming, while Charly has already been approached by militias eager to take advantage of his knowledge of the Seleka.

"With a gun," he said, "you always have money."
