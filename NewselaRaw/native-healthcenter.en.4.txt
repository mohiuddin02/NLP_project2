DALLAS, Texas â€”There is a special medical clinic in Dallas. Many patients who visit are American Indians. The clinic doesn't look like a normal doctor's office. There are orange boxes of Nike shoes everywhere.

These shoes aren't normal sneakers. They are designed for the patients in the clinic. They have decorations that American Indians like. The shoes are brown and feel like leather. There is also a star decoration on the toe.

## Free Sneakers For Healthy Feet

The clinic gives these sneakers to patients with diabetes. The shoes are given away for free. Diabetes is a disease that affects the body in different ways. Many diabetic patients have problems with their feet. Some even have to get foot surgery. Doctors hope that the shoes will prevent these foot problems.

The clinic is led by Dr. Rodney Stapp. He is a foot doctor. He came to the clinic because he wants to help American Indians.

## Unfair Treatment Led To Problems

Stapp says American Indians have been treated unfairly in the past. The American government forced them to move. They had to move on special places of land. American Indians felt trapped. Today many of them have health problems.

Stapp designed the shoe to help American Indians with their health. He worked with Nike to create the shoe. The shoes are wider than normal sneakers. He said that American Indian feet are larger at the heel. The shoes are made to fit their feet.

## Many Programs To Meet Many Needs

The clinic has many types of programs. It is more than a doctor's office. The center holds classes, too. These classes teach patients how to find jobs. There is a garden that grows vegetables. The clinic is also a meeting place. People who visit have the chance to get to know the other American Indians in Dallas. There are about 30,000 American Indians who live in the area.

Stapp hopes that the center will help American Indians. He wants people to be healthy, he said.
