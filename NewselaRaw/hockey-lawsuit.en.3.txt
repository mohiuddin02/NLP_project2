The retired hockey players are also targeting the violence of the game. They say fighting caused their injuries. In addition to money, they also want more study of their health problems.

The retired players are Dave Christian, Reed Larson and William Bennett. They filed a lawsuit in court on Tuesday. They say the league has promoted fighting and has not taken the risk of head injuries that come from it seriously enough.

Charles "Bucky" Zimmerman is the lawyer who filed the lawsuit. He thinks that the league's celebration of violence could be its worst weakness. "If anything comes of this, the focus on the glorified violence and perhaps the change to that will be a good thing."

## "We've Seen It In Football"

The lawsuit has a lot in common with one brought by retired football players. They sued the National Football League. Hockey players have also filed lawsuits in Washington and New York.

Bill Daly is the NHL's deputy commissioner. He said the league expected another lawsuit. "Nothing changes our belief that all of these cases are without merit and they will be defended accordingly," he said.

The NHLPA, the union that represents the hockey players, declined to comment.

Zimmerman also worked on the legal case against the NFL. That league settled its case. It agreed to pay $765 million to thousands of retired players. That settlement is still awaiting a judge's approval. Still, the headlines it generated have been partially responsible for hockey players making their own case against the NHL.

"We've seen it in football. It's now here in hockey," Zimmerman said. The leagues knew about the injuries but did not protect the players, he said. He added that rules still have not been changed to prevent fighting in hockey.

## Fights Breaking Out

The lawsuit claims "the NHL hid or minimized concussion risks from its players." A [concussion](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) is a brain injury. It is caused by a blow to the head. The lawsuit said that because of the NHL's actions, players were at a much higher risk for developing symptoms. These include memory loss, trouble thinking, and even brain-related diseases.

Some argue that the NFL case is different than the NHL case. They say that by fighting, players willfully take on the health risks.

"You could make that argument only to a point," Zimmerman said. But the fighting would not exist if the NHL had not allowed the fighting as a way to sell tickets, he said.  Zimmerman said that the players don't make the rules. The league does. "If they would outlaw fighting, there wouldn't be people who would fight."

Zimmerman said he thinks more players will join the legal fight like they did in the NFL case.

"The light went on for them as the football players' story was becoming more told," Zimmerman said. "I think the hockey players started to see that their story was going to be heard and told. It's not that we haven't known about football players or hockey players getting hurt. It's now become more important that we talk about it and do something about it," he said.
