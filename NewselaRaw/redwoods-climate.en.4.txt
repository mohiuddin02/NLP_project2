SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” Climate change is melting glaciers. It is making droughts worse. Other damage is also happening as the planet heats up.

Scientists were worried that ancient redwood trees might also be hurt. But new research shows [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) may actually be helping the trees. At least for now.

"We're not seeing any evidence" that fewer trees are growing, said Steve Sillett. He is a redwoods expert. Some places are actually seeing more redwood growth, he said.

The trees may prefer warmer temperatures. More sunlight or a longer growing season might help. Many years of work to limit forest fires may also be helping. Or the trees might even like the higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Nobody knows yet.

## The Good, The Bad, And The Foggy

Sillett and other researchers are working on a four-year study. They looked at two types of old trees in California: coast redwoods and giant sequoias. It turns out that the trees actually grew more in the 20th century. This happened while polar bears, coral reefs and other things suffered from climate change.

Redwood forests near the California-Oregon border have grown the most. People concerned about nature are happy about the news. But they are cautious.

"Redwoods are an incredibly hopeful story" said Emily Burns of Save the Redwoods League. The nonprofit group is paying for the research. "They are growing vigorously." But the growth comes while other very bad things are happening to the planet, she said.

Scientists continue to be worried about water. One study showed there is less fog in redwood areas along California's coast. Fog is made of water droplets.

But so far the lack of fog may have been a good thing. It may have allowed more sunlight to reach the trees, said scientist Todd Dawson.

Giant sequoias live in the Sierra Nevada mountains. They are cousins of the redwoods. Warmer weather may have increased their growing season because the trees are under snow for fewer days.

## Less Rain On The Horizon?

The news is good now. But some scientists working on the project worry that conditions could get worse for the trees if rising temperatures lead to less rain and snow in California.

"There's a tipping point," Dawson said. One thing that will happen is there will be less thick, packed snow. That means less water for giant sequoias, he said.

The researchers work in the world's tallest and largest trees. They have climbed dozens of immense redwoods and sequoias.

The scientists put sensors on the trees to measure temperature, rain and other things like fog. They used lasers to help measure the heights of trees. They conducted studies to re-create the weather from centuries ago. They took samples from inside the trees. These let them know how old the trees were and how fast they were growing.

Sillett discovered the oldest known coast redwood tree in existence during this research. The tree in northern California is at least 2,520 years old. "We were way off the trail," Sillett said. "We stumbled upon this tree. I was like, 'Oh my God, this tree is big.' It looked old."

The tree is nearly 300 feet tall. Yet it is still a lot shorter than the world's tallest tree. A 379-foot-tall redwood called "Hyperion" was discovered in 2006 in a remote corner of Redwood National Park.

## Carbon Dioxide Levels Worry Scientists

Redwoods have been around for 120 million years or more. They once lived side by side with dinosaurs. They grew in Canada, Utah, Montana and Southern California. Today, coast redwoods exist only in a small area of California, up to the Oregon border. Giant sequoias live only in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

There is more cause for concern.

There is a lot more carbon dioxide in the air now than in the mid-1800s. It comes from burning fuels like oil, coal and natural gas. Some scientists say if things keep going like this, redwoods will not be able to live in parts of California by 2100.

That would be sad. It would be like losing a famous work of music, Dawson said.
