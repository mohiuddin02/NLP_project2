HOUSTON, Texas — Leilah Abdennabi arrived at a popular Austin, Texas, cafe this week, to meet her friend for lunch. When she got there, she was surprised to find her friend crying.

Through tears, her friend Sirat Al-Nahi, 20, explained that while Abdennabi was parking, she had been harassed by an elderly white man in the cafe. He suggested that Abdennabi did not know how to drive and "should go back to Saudi Arabia."

Shocked, Al-Nahi asked the man to repeat what he had said. He did, this time adding, "Do you have a gun? You should just shoot me."

The restaurant staff seated the man and his companion as Al-Nahi started crying.

## A Friendly Lunch Turned Ugly

Al-Nahi is a senior at the University of Texas at Austin and a devout Muslim who — like her friend — wears a headscarf. She hadn't expected to be confronted at a locally owned restaurant in Texas' decidedly liberal capital where people were usually tolerant. The cafe even serves a dish called Nabil's Mid-East Feast.

Abdennabi, 24, asked to speak to the manager, who said there was nothing she could do. When Abdennabi asked the man to repeat what he had said, he told her to go away.

She surveyed the restaurant.

"No one was doing or saying anything. I was like, 'Just so you guys know, we were told some very racist things at this restaurant and no one did anything because who cares about us?' And someone shouted 'Nobody,'" Abdennabi told the Los Angeles Times.

Since the attacks in Paris, France, and San Bernardino, California, Muslim women wearing headscarves have become obvious targets. They are harassed more often than others, frequently by men.

## Islamophobia Incidents On The Rise

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Council on American-Islamic Relations has documented dozens of Islamophobic incidents nationwide since last month. Many have been against women wearing headscarves.

In Cincinnati, Ohio, a driver tried to run down a young Muslim woman. In New York City, a customer called a female pharmacist wearing a headscarf a terrorist and told her to "get out of his country." In San Diego, California, a man shoved a pregnant Muslim mother's stroller into her belly. A San Diego State student reported a man tugged at her headscarf while yelling at her in a parking lot.

"It's not unexpected at all. In fact, it's what my research shows: that Muslim women will be targeted because they are more easily identifiable; they can't pass as non-Muslim," said Sahar Aziz, an associate professor at Texas A&M School of Law.

Aziz researched similar harassment after the terrorist attack last January on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris. She found harassment ranged from assaults to microaggressions, such as passing comments and stares. Now, she said, "I suspect what happened in Austin is the tip of the iceberg."

## Robbed Of Right To Practice Faith Freely

She said it is like women in Muslim countries being harassed for not wearing headscarves: "It disempowers women from making choices about how they practice their faith."

As a result, some Muslim women in the United States have stopped wearing headscarves to avoid being targeted. Aziz said immigrants may be most likely to abandon the headscarf. She said those born in the United States, like Abdennabi and Al-Nahi, have deeply rooted confidence in their rights and will not sacrifice their faith.

"It really is an individual choice based on a person's upbringing and beliefs, particularly in the U.S.," said Aziz. She is Egyptian-American and has worn a headscarf for four years.

"Many of these women are putting the headscarf on as a feminist statement, desexualizing themselves. This needs to not just be a Muslim issue, but an American women's rights issue."

## Determined To Wear Her Hijab

Abdennabi, a teacher's assistant, is Palestinian-American and has worn a headscarf, or hijab, since she was 18. Though she has heard some women talk recently about taking off their headscarves, she said she will not give in.

"I don't think we should shrink ourselves or hide ourselves. … Unlike when I was growing up, we have Facebook and Twitter and we can share our stories," she said.

She and Al-Nahi posted on Facebook about the incident at the cafe. They received numerous supportive comments, including some non-Muslim men offering to escort them for their own safety. The women also received calls and a public apology posted online by Mason Ayer, the CEO of the restaurant, Kerbey Lane.

"There should be no place for racist, ignorant behavior in our society, and it's incredibly upsetting that an incident like this occurred at all," Ayer wrote. Thinking back, he said staff should have asked the "hateful guest" to leave.
