PRESCOTT, Arizona â€” Bruce is the chestnut-colored horse that just could not win.

Bryce Runyan gave him a chance. Bryce is 25 years old. He is a calf roper. A calf is a young cow.

## Looking For A Good Horse

A calf roper rides a horse and chases a calf. He or she tries to catch the calf with a rope. Then, the cowboy gets off the horse. He or she ties three of the calf's legs together. Bryce thought Bruce would be a good horse for calf roping.

Before Bryce had Bruce he had Maverick. Maverick was a great horse. He and Bryce got first place and $5,000 in last year's Prescott rodeo. Maverick was getting older. Bryce needed a new horse.

Bryce and Bruce did not do so well at the Prescott rodeo this year. They ran out to chase the calf too early. This is not allowed.

## A Winning Ride!

A few days later the cowboy goes to a rodeo in Taylor, Arizona. Bryce needs to win. If he does not, he might not make it to the National Finals Rodeo.

At the Taylor rodeo he got Bruce ready. The calf ran out of the gate.

Bryce and Bruce ran out. Bryce caught the calf with the rope. He tied its three legs together. He finished in 9.7 seconds. The time surprised him. It was his fastest time ever, even better than with Maverick.

## Better Than Money: The Right Partner

Bryce did not even smile. An older cowboy told him "Good ride."

This is the way it is in rodeos. He just got a handshake and $2,000.

Bryce left the rodeo with something even better than the money. He now knows he had been right. Bruce was a good rodeo horse. He and Bryce only needed the right partner.
