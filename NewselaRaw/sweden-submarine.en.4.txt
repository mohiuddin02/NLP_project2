STOCKHOLM â€” For the past four days, Sweden has been looking for a mystery vessel. It thinks the underwater boat, or submarine, is foreign. It says it entered Swedish waters without permission. The search is making countries around the Baltic Sea very nervous.

Sweden's search is bringing back bad memories of the Cold War.

The Cold War stretched from 1945 to 1991. It wasn't a regular war. Instead, it was a standoff. On one side were U.S.-led Western countries; on the other side were the Soviet Bloc countries led by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, in turn, was controlled by Russia.

In 1991, the Soviet Union broke up. Russia then lost control of many of the Soviet republics. Among these were Ukraine and the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

## Return Of The Cold War?

Several times during the Cold War, Soviet submarines entered Swedish waters. The most serious event occurred in 1981. A Soviet submarine became stranded off Sweden's southeastern coast. The sub was armed with nuclear weapons. For 11 days, Sweden refused to release the sub. Eventually, it allowed the vessel to return home.

Suddenly it's looking like the Cold War all over again. On Monday, Swedish ships, helicopters and troops continued their search.

Sweden hasn't accused any country specifically. Russia, for its part, denies having anything to do with the sub.

Still, the search sent a chill through the Baltic Sea region. For many, Russia is the natural suspect.

There have been three sightings of the mysterious sub since Friday. On Sunday, Swedish officials released a photo taken at a distance. It shows a dark speck surrounded by foaming water.

## Worries About Russia's Actions

More than 200 people are involved in the search. It has made headlines in countries across the Baltic region.

The Baltic countries that are most worried are Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. All three used to belong to the Soviet Union.

The three counties have been made nervous by Russia's actions in Ukraine. Ukraine, too, was once part of the Soviet Union. Earlier this year, Russia seized the country's Crimea region. Since then, it has backed pro-Russia fighters in eastern Ukraine.

Russia says its actions in Ukraine were necessary. It claims it had to act to protect Ukrainians with a Russian background. Russian-speaking Ukrainians, it said, were being mistreated.

Many are not convinced by that claim. They feel it was just an excuse for a land grab.

## "The Eyes Of Fear"

Recently, a top Russian official made the same claims about the Baltic states. He said people of Russian background are being mistreated in those countries too. The Baltic states have been alarmed by such talk.

There is now growing fear that Russia may make some move. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are all worried. For its part, Russia denies it has any such plans.

Russia also claims the Swedes are overreacting. Russia's official government newspaper questioned whether there was any submarine at all. It noted the Swedes hadn't found anything yet.

Perhaps, the paper wrote, nervousness is making people see dangers where there aren't any. "The eyes of fear," it wrote, "see danger everywhere."
