LONDON, England â€” Queen Elizabeth is the queen of England. She lives in Buckingham Palace in London.

Her palace is falling apart.

## Queen-Sized Mess

Mice run through the palace. Insects chew up wires. The roof leaks. Brick walls are falling apart.

Her palace needs to be fixed up. The queen may have to leave for a while.

The Palace of Westminster is also in London. It has many of the same problems. Its roof leaks and the pipes are breaking down. England's lawmakers meet there. They may also have to move.

## Queen-Sized Repair Bill

The repairs could cost billions of dollars. British citizens are not happy about spending the money.

Dickie Arbiter used to work with the queen. He said Britain must repair the buildings.

The country cannot let the palaces fall apart.

Some people think the queen should pay. She is one of the world's richest women.

Arbiter laughs at this idea. The queen does not own Buckingham Palace, England does.

## Will They Fix It?

Buckingham Palace has 240 bedrooms. It has 78 bathrooms. Repairs would cost about $230 million.

The Palace of Westminster would cost much more. It could cost $5.4 billion to $8.8 billion to fix it up.

Steven Fielding teaches at the University of Nottingham. It is in England. He said lawmakers need a good place to work.

He also thinks Britain will spend the money. It will fix up the two palaces. No one will be very happy about it, though.

## Palaces Are Important

There are other ideas. The first is to make lawmakers travel around the country. The second is to get rid of the Palace of Westminster. Lawmakers can meet in a smaller building.

Neither of these ideas is likely. Fixing up the two palaces would be expensive. Yet, they mean a lot to the people.

They also are popular with visitors to the country. It costs $28 to look around the Houses of Parliament. Visiting Buckingham Palace costs $32.
