WASHINGTON â€” A library without books? It once would have been unthinkable. But the new public library in San Antonio has gone completely book-free.

Six months ago, BiblioTech became the nation's first totally digital public library. The name plays off the word "biblioteca." That means library in Spanish.

The library lets readers check out e-books over the Internet wherever they are. U.S. soldiers can even download the latest titles from [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan).

No computer? No problem.

Readers in San Antonio can check out tablets or e-readers for free. They can also use the library's computers. Children can check out Nook readers already loaded with 150 books for kids.

## Big Benefit For Lifelong Learners

In Washington, D.C., the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library cleared shelves of books last June. It created a wide, bookless area. The library calls the section "Digital Commons." It's part computer lab, part design center and part reading room.

The book has been around for more than 500 years. And it's not going away anytime soon. But new technology is slowly taking over.

Several digital projects have began. They scan in records, original writings and books, including rare treasures. The materials can be found online by anyone with a computer. The Digital World Library just reached its 10,000th entry last week.

"This project is of enormous benefit to students, teachers, scholars and lifelong learners," said James H. Billington. He is the librarian at the country's biggest library, the Library of Congress. Billington added he's pleased to see that it continues to grow.

At the MLK library, there's a giant touch screen for teaching classes and a 3-D printer. A 3-D printer creates three-dimensional objects. The library also has a sound studio, a machine that will print and bind a book, and work areas. In the children's section, kids can read and play on a touch-screen table.

At North Carolina State University's new library, its 1.5 million books are stored underground. Students can check out books with the help of a robot. The bookBot delivers books in five minutes or less.

"There are a lot of libraries that are shifting that way," said Barbara Stripling. She is president of the American Library Association.

## Collects Books, Reads E-Books

The person who came up with the idea for San Antonio's bookless library was Nelson Wolff. He is the county's top official. He's in his 70s.

It all started with a book about Steve Jobs, said Wolff. Jobs created Apple Inc. Wolf was interested in how quickly he developed new technology.

So, within about a year, Wolff began the bookless library in a poor part of San Antonio. The library was up and running by last September. It just added another branch in the jury room of the courthouse. Citizens must go to the courthouse every few years to sit on a jury. It often involves a lot of waiting.

At first, BiblioTech's collection only had 10,000 e-books. But the library has since added another 10,000. And it hopes to add another 10,000 e-books each month.

Wolff collects rare 20th-century books.

"I (used to) refused to read e-books," he said.

Now?

"I don't read hardcover books," Wolff said. "I buy them but I don't read them."

## "People Connecting And Sharing"

That kind of thinking may be spreading. BiblioTech attracts a steady flow of online visitors from around the world.

"The main thing is people are using it," Wolff said.

He's especially tickled that the jury duty branch is taking off.

"It's been a big hit with all the jurors sitting around," he said.

The library has gotten back the e-readers and tablets it loaned out.

"We've had a 100 percent return rate," said Laura Jesse, the county spokeswoman.

In D.C., visitors to the MLK library come from all income levels. Its computers are the only way many poor people can use the Internet. They can't afford to buy computers for their homes.

Nick Kerelchuk is the manager of Digital Commons. The MLK library scene is "people connecting and sharing together," he said.
