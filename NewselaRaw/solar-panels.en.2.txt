PHILADELPHIA â€“ Researchers in Pennsylvania may have come up with a new material that could make solar energy less expensive.

Solar panels generate electricity by absorbing sunlight. But more happens after that. Once electrons in the panel are energized, they must be moved in the same direction. To do that, solar panels typically are made with layers of two kinds of materials.

But a team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University may have taken a step to change that.

The scientists said they created a new class of ceramic material. The material could both absorb the energy and channel the electrons cheaply and efficiently. The scientists wrote about the new material in the journal Nature.

## Harvesting, And Sending, Energy

So far the group has created just small bits of the new ceramic. But members predict it can be used to make panels that are better at harvesting energy than the silicon-based models that dominate the market. The ceramic panels would be less expensive, too, the researchers said.

The researchers say their new ceramic also would have an advantage over "thin-film" solar panels. Those panels tend to contain materials that are rare, poisonous, or both. The new material contains potassium, niobium, barium, and nickel. Those materials are relatively abundant and environmentally friendly.

So is silicon. But silicon requires lots of processing and manufacturing to be used in solar panels. The scientists say their combination of materials will be cheaper in the long run.

"We've opened up a new category of ways of making a solar cell," said Penn chemistry professor Andrew M. Rappe.

Solar power accounted for just a quarter of 1 percent of energy consumed in the United States in 2012, the government reported. Solar energy companies say more solar energy is used. It says the government does not have complete information about panels installed on rooftops.

But by any measure, the amount of power being made by sunlight is climbing steadily. Money the government offers to taxpayers for solar panels have helped drive that increase. And for scientists, the sun remains an intriguing source of untapped power.

## Absorbing Visible Light

Materials that can channel the flow of electrons are described as having polarity. They have been known to science for decades. But they have not been used to make solar panels because they primarily absorb energy from ultraviolet light, not from the light we can see.

The Penn-Drexel team started with a material with polarity. It is called potassium niobate. Then the team used computer models to predict what other elements could be added so that it would absorb visible light.

Barium, which replaces some of the potassium in the structure of the ceramic crystal was one of those elements. Nickel was also chosen. It replaces some of the niobium.

"The nickel is really doing the job," Rappe said. "The barium's kind of along for the ride."

Making the material involved a multistep process of grinding and heating. By adding different amounts of barium and nickel, the scientists found they could make small changes to the material. The changes let it absorb different wavelengths of visible light.

## The Approach Has Potential

In theory, this type of ceramic could be more than twice as efficient at making energy as the current solar panels, the authors said. Still, a lot of work remains to be done, they added.

Lane W. Martin, a professor at the University of Illinois, agreed that the approach had potential.

"It's a pretty promising first step," said Martin, who was not involved with the research.

Future research will involve actually making a solar "cell," complete with electrodes. Yet Drexel professor Jonathan Spanier was plenty excited by the small tablets. Spanier conducted tests revealing that the material had the desired properties.

"It's a mixture of excitement and satisfaction and thrill," he said.
