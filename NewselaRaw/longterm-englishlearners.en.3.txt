LOS ANGELES â€” A new program is trying to help some students in Los Angeles and other California school districts. They struggle to learn English because it is not their first language.

The students have been in school for many years. But they are still not fluent in English. Many speak languages like Spanish at home. The students are called "long-term English learners."

## The Languages Get Confused

Dasha Cifuentes is one of them.

After more than 11 years in Los Angeles public schools, Dasha still is not speaking or writing English at the level for her grade. Dasha was born in the United States. Her parents are Mexican immigrants. Dasha was raised speaking Spanish at home.

The junior at Fairfax High said that the two languages get confused in her mind.

"I should be more confident in English because I was born here," she said. Dasha said she was "embarrassed that I haven't improved myself."

Now a new law means the state must find out which students are long-term English learners. California is the first state in the United States to do so.

## The Numbers Are Huge

The state released its first information about the efforts this week. It said nearly 350,000 students in grades six through 12 have attended California schools for seven years or more and are still not fluent in English. They make up three-fourths of all junior high and high school students still learning English.

Among them, nearly 90,000 are considered to be long-term English learners. It means that they also have failed to do well on the state's English test for two years in a row. They also score below grade level in other English tests.

Shelly Spiegel-Coleman works for Californians Together. The group pushed for the law. She said that often these kids are sitting in general classes, not getting the special help they need.

Meanwhile, many teachers say that students who speak their first language well can more easily learn English. But a law from 1998 made it harder to teach classes in English and Spanish at the same time.

Things have changed since 1998. Now, some people are pushing for teaching in two languages at one time, called bilingual education. In November 2016, Californians will vote whether to keep the 1998 law or get rid of it.

## Extra Classes Are Helpful

Los Angeles schools have added two new classes to strengthen language skills for students like Dasha. The district has also improved teacher training. In addition, the district makes teachers try to work with the parents as well as their students. The goal is to let parents know about their child's progress.

At Fairfax, Dasha said the new classes have helped. In one class, she and her classmates watched a TV news program on Los Angeles Lakers basketball player Jeremy Lin. Her teacher then asked the students questions about it to check their understanding. What made Lin want to play basketball? How many colleges offered him scholarship money for school? What helped him succeed?

Not many of the students answered the questions correctly. However, it was hard to know if they understood the program or not. They may not have wanted to pay attention. The teacher said keeping students interested is one of the biggest challenges in teaching English.

## Afraid To Ask For Help

Dasha said she ignored her problem for years, failing to follow the advice of her teachers and parents to read books and use the dictionary. She said she was too scared to ask for help.

"Now, I'm regretting my life not developing myself into a better person, and that hurts me the most," she said.

But she said the pace of the Fairfax classes are slower. The teachers are more patient. In addition, a Fairfax program links each student to a teacher who coaches them. It has helped her talk about her problems, she said.

"I'm more motivated, like a turtle coming out of its shell," she said.
