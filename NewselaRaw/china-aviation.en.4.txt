TAIYUAN, China — Air China Flight 1236 was supposed to take off for Beijing at 8:10 p.m.

The plane was parked in Xian, a city famous for its clay warriors. The trip to Beijing ended up being so slow, it felt like those warriors could have marched faster. What was supposed to be a 100-minute flight took around 18 hours instead.

In China, there is often not enough room for all the planes, in the skies and on the runways. And that means flights are usually late, very late.

During the month of July, only 17.8 percent of flights from Beijing's airport were on time. The next month was better, but still not so good: 28.8 percent were on time. Beijing is ranked the worst of the world's top 35 airports when it comes to delays. Shanghai is close behind.

## Flight Attendants Learning Kung Fu

The delays have been bad for businesses. They also have caused near-riots. Between May and August, there were 26 fights at Chinese airports. One Hong Kong airline has started teaching its workers kung fu.

Flights are delayed for one big reason: the growing number of travelers. Airports simply haven't kept up.

Since 2003, the number of airline passengers in China has nearly quadrupled. Last year, there were 319 million.

Another problem is that the Chinese army controls 80 percent of the skies. And that airspace is reserved for military planes only. In the U.S., only 17 percent of airspace is controlled by the government.

The Chinese also have tough rules about how close planes can be. Flights are spaced about 7 to 10 miles apart. This means only 20 to 40 planes can land on a runway every hour. In the U.S., 60 per hour can land.

## "Passengers Just Get Angrier"

China is a huge country, and full of mountains. It's easier to travel by plane than by train. In 2011, the Chinese government announced it would build 55 new airports. One in Beijing is expected to be the world's largest.

But for now, more passengers means more delays. And more anger. YouTube is full of videos of passengers throwing chairs and smashing telephones and computers because of the delays.

In July there were three separate fights at a Shanghai airport during a single night. Passengers beat up airport workers. Some had to be taken to the hospital. The next weekend, 30 passengers ran on to a runway after a seven-hour delay.

"The airlines are always coming up with different excuses. You never find the right person to ask. And the passengers just get angrier," said Tao Yuanyong, a Beijing travel agent.

This summer new rules were introduced. Planes now can take off whether they already have permission to land or not. Also, airlines can now be punished if they have too many delays.

## Sitting On The Runway For Hours

But the new rules haven't really helped. Airlines simply hurry passengers onto planes. Then, planes pull away from the gate, making it look like the flight is on time. But passengers end up waiting hours to take off. Or they end up in flight, circling an airport for a long time. This wastes fuel and creates pollution.

The Air China flight from Xian last month was delayed nearly two hours. Then, it landed in Taiyuan instead of Beijing. The airline said a storm was the reason.

After an hour on the runway, the flight to Beijing was canceled. Passengers were put up in a hotel for the night.

After all this, many passengers decided to take the train to Beijing. They arrived at 3 p.m. Those who waited for a plane did only a bit better: They made it to Beijing at 1:30 p.m. — nearly 16 hours late.
