Apple Inc. wants new music released through its iTunes store before it comes out anywhere else.

Its plan would keep people from listening to new music through streaming services, such as Spotify, at least at first. The information came from people familiar with talks between Apple and music companies that put out albums.

Apple's leaders worry that people are streaming music over the Internet instead of downloading it through iTunes. This is eating into Apple's sales. The Apple executives are pushing record companies to release new music only through iTunes. After the release period is over, other services, like Spotify, can stream it. Some Hollywood movie studios have a similar setup for movies released for home viewing.

The music business insiders did not want their names used. The digital market is changing, they said. And Apple is scrambling to fight the streaming services for business. Apple is based in Cupertino, Calif.

## Times Are Changing

"These are really changing times. And I think everybody's going to be trying different things, whether it's iTunes, Spotify" or the music companies, said Irving Azoff. He manages the Eagles, Christina Aguilera and other music acts. "It's kind of up for grabs."

Eight out of every 10 songs or albums that are downloaded in the U.S. are done through Apple's iTunes online store. For about 10 years, the iTunes store grew steadily. But in 2013, its download sales began to drop.

Music business insiders say there are several reasons behind the drop in sales. But, the popularity of streaming services is the biggest one.

Smartphones have become the new Sony Walkman. The Sony Walkman is a portable music player. It came out in the U.S. in 1980, and became the first device that let people listen to music anywhere they went. About half of smartphone owners use their phone every day to stream music. Just four out of 10 people use them for downloading music, says Nielsen SoundScan. Nielsen tracks the sales of music in the U.S.

Apple makes the most smartphones of any one company, but it only makes the iPhone. More people in the U.S. own phones running Google's Android software, which are made by several companies. This came from a survey by the Yankee Group. iTunes is the world's biggest music seller. But Android phones don't work with iTunes. Only iPhones run iTunes.

## Beyonce's Solo Act For iTunes

Apple has been meeting with the heads of major music companies. They have also approached individual musicians. An Apple spokesman declined to comment for this article.

"I've never had anyone (at Apple) say 'streaming is killing our business,'" said Jim Guerinot. His Rebel Waltz Management company handles the business for No Doubt, Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) and other acts. Guerinot said that for the last 10 years, Apple has wanted music that no one else has. He says Apple has been forceful about setting itself apart from other companies.

To make its case, Apple has pointed to the excellent sales of Beyonce's album in December. The album was offered solely through iTunes. It became iTunes' fastest-selling album.

Few artists are as popular as Beyonce. But Apple says it's a good example to show how releasing music first on iTunes increases its sales.

But Beyonce's album also angered Target and Amazon.com, which refused to carry the CD.

## Streaming Slices Into Apple Sales

More recently, hip-hop artist Kid Cudi's release, "Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon," was sold only through iTunes and other digital websites. It debuted last week at No. 4 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts, selling 87,000 units.

Another rap act relied heavily on streaming to publicize a forthcoming release. It came out at the top of Billboard's album chart last week.

Schoolboy Q's "Oxymoron" was heavily promoted on Spotify. U.S. Spotify users listened to 3.3 million streams before the album came out. It sold nearly 139,000 copies in its first week. Two of the rapper's earlier albums sold just 17,000 and 48,000 copies.  The albums were "Setbacks" and "Habits &amp; Contradictions."

Ken Parks is responsible for Spotify's music content. He said Apple shouldn't tell people how to listen to music. "It just doesn't work for anyone," he said.

Mark Mulligan has watched the music business for a long time. He said streaming services may be taking away Apple's most devoted music customers.

"It's not that streaming is replacing downloads in a larger sense," Mulligan said. What it's doing is going after the spending of Apple's download customers who spend the most.
