KERN RIVER CANYON, Calif. â€” Gold hunter David Fiori stood waist-deep in the Kern River. His eyes wandered to a spot across the water.

He couldn't get there today. The river was too deep and too fast. But he knew the water level would go down soon.

"That's where I'm going next, as soon as I can," Fiori said. He nodded toward the other side of the river. "Another couple months, this thing will be down to a trickle. It's going to be amazing."

California is in the third year of severe drought. According to a study, 2013 was the driest year since the 1500s. For farmers, the drought has been a disaster.

But for gold miners, like Fiori, it's been good.

## Gold Fever

Gold prices are high. An ounce of gold costs more than $1,250. A lot of people are trying to strike it rich. The gold bug is even spreading to dry areas.

During the California gold rush of the mid-1800s, about 300,000 people came to California. They wanted to find gold and get rich. There was more gold then. Miners sometimes were able to pluck gold nuggets off the ground.

Today, it's more like a gold fever than a big gold rush.

Nine people stood shoulder to shoulder in the middle of the chilly river. They were all looking for gold.

"It's not the normal, that's for sure," said Farris Farnsworth. "If somebody was to walk up and see us down here, they'd probably think we were a little nuts."

## "A Big Old Nugget"

The miners scooped up muck from the bottom of the river. They used large metal trays.

First, they sifted the muck, handful by handful. Then they swirled it with water until they could "see color." That's what they call tiny flakes of gold.

Miners usually see some gold. But they almost never find actual nuggets.

"I (once) found one that big," said Jay O'Dell. He held up a small pebble.

Today, the gold in his pan won't even pay for gas for the ride home. But he hopes he'll find a big one. That hope is what brings people back to the river again and again.

"Grab a pan, man, and jump in," Farnsworth called. "You never know. You might get you a big old nugget."
