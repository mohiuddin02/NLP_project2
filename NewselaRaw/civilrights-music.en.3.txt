Music has long been a big part of the civil rights movement. It still is today.

The song "Glory" is in the Oscar-nominated movie "Selma." In it, rapper Common tells how words, music and a protest came together during the civil rights movement.

"We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through," he raps. "Glory" won best original song at the Academy Awards on Sunday.

Many African-American protesters were hurt in a voting rights march to the Alabama capital of Montgomery from Selma 50 years ago. But as "Glory" suggests, what happened in Selma is hardly in the past.

## A Movement Rich In Song

"The movement is a rhythm to us, freedom is like religion to us," Common raps. Then he mentions the '50s civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. He connects Parks with last year's protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Those protests started after a police officer killed an unarmed African-American teenager. His name was Michael Brown.

"… That's why Rosa sat on the bus, that's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up," Common raps.

Other singers sang about similar issues in the months after the outrage stirred by the deaths of Brown and another unarmed African-American, Eric Garner, in New York. Singer D'Angelo released his first recording in more than 10 years. It was called "Black Messiah." The album included references to the events between Selma and Ferguson.

Songs for the civil rights movement continue to be written. As Newsweek magazine said of the civil rights movement in 1964, "History has never known a protest movement so rich in song."

## "People Get Ready"

During the '60s, African-American "freedom songs" aimed to motivate protesters to march into dangerous situations. The songs also spread news of the struggle to a bigger audience. The gospel, or religious music of black churches spoke to a better life in heaven. However, other types of music – soul, R&amp;B and jazz – said that the good life could be experienced now. Artists who performed the music included Chicago's Curtis Mayfield, Sam Cooke and the Staple Singers.

Mayfield wrote and sang on a string of message-oriented records. These included "Keep on Pushing" and "People Get Ready." Cooke sang "A Change is Gonna Come." There were many other songs.

All this creativity was inspired by the pain, struggle and violence the protesters faced. The three Selma marches in 1965 aimed to draw attention to the struggle for black voting rights. They proved to be a turning point in the struggle. Police used tear gas, dogs and clubs on the unarmed protesters.

Pops Staples led the well-known Chicago gospel group the Staple Singers. He saw media coverage of the event, and was horrified. He had become friends with Martin Luther King Jr. Staples and his family had been appearing at Civil Rights rallies with King.

## Riding The "Freedom Highway"

What he saw and experienced in the company of King made him political. "If he can preach it, we can sing it," he said. After Selma, Pops wrote one of the signature songs of the movement, "Freedom Highway." The song was first performed only a few weeks later in a concert at a church on Chicago's South Side.

The concert was recorded. The record was originally issued on Epic Records in 1965. It is being reissued next month. The album is one of the great concert recordings ever.

Pops continued writing and singing about the movement until his last days. His final recording shows this. "Don't Lose This," released this week, was recorded with his children in the years before his death in 2000.

On "Sweet Home," Pops and his daughter, Mavis, sing a duet. The struggle they joined in during the '60s shows no sign of ending. "Lord, I wonder will I ever get home?" they sing.

They are tired and it shows in their voices, but they're still on the freedom highway.
