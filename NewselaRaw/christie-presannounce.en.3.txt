LIVINGSTON, N.J. â€” New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced that he is running for president. He says he plans to "change the world."

Christie made his announcement in the gymnasium of his old high school. Supporters cheered as he broke the big news.

Christie belongs to the Republican Party, one of the country's two main political groups. At one time he was a favorite among Republicans. His popularity has faded since then, however. He is now trying to climb his way back up.

## First Things First

Christie will first run against other Republicans in the primaries. Primaries are early elections to weed out weaker candidates. If he wins in the primaries he will then run against a Democrat next year in November.

Christie said he has been "fighting for fairness and justice and opportunity" in New Jersey. He now wants to do the same for the country, he said.

America is tired of "weakness" in the White House, Christie said. "We need to have strength and decision-making" back in the White House again, he added.

## Says He Is Ready To Lead On

Christie said he was proud to be making his announcement at his old high school.

"Going back to where you were when you were 15, or 16, or 17 years old" is special, he said. "To be able to stand in front of that group of people and offer yourself to the presidency is a really, really amazing moment."

The New Jersey governor said he is ready to "lead our country and to change the world."

## Fading Popularity In Home State

Four years ago, some of Christie's backers tried to persuade him to challenge President Barack Obama in the 2012 elections. Christie chose not to run for president then. Instead, he ran for governor of New Jersey a second time.

Christie won his re-election easily. But since then, he has become much less popular. Many people in New Jersey are out of work. Christie promised to do something about it, but has not gotten far enough.

Many people in New Jersey are angry at Christie for another reason as well. Three people who worked for the governor were caught pulling a nasty trick on a Democratic New Jersey mayor.

When Christie ran for re-election, the mayor refused to support him. To punish the mayor, Christie's people deliberately caused terrible traffic jams near the mayor's town. They figured people would blame the mayor for the mess. Christie says he knew nothing about the scheme, but not everyone believes him.
