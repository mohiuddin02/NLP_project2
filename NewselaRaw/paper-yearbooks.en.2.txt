CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Hundreds of students at Prospect High School set aside their smartphones and tablets in favor of the glossy pages in their yearbooks.

"With social media, the pictures and messages we post kind of go up, and then they go away," said high school senior Caroline Chengary. She is the editor of the 2015 edition of the Prospect High School yearbook Crest.

"I always loved looking at my mom's old high school yearbooks," she said. The yearbooks are the one thing from high school "that you can keep with you, and look back at when you're older."

## Digital Yearbooks? Not Yet ...

Today, teenagers are strongly tied to technology and some rarely open hardcover and paperback books. But students, teachers and business experts agree that high school yearbooks remain popular with students.

The use of printed textbooks has continued to slow as improvements in technology allow for more materials to be digitized. Yet yearbook sales have managed to hold steady for the past five years. This is because there has been an increase in class sizes at schools.

Kevin Miller is the vice president of Lifetouch, a company that produces yearbooks. He said that Lifetouch had tried making digital yearbooks, but decided to stop making them. There's something special about being able "to actually feel the book in your hand," he said about hard-copy yearbooks.

## ... But Digital Links In Some

That is not to say that the yearbook hasn't changed.

Murad Velani works at Jostens, a Minneapolis company that has published yearbooks for 65 years. He said that some high schools are even bringing digital technology into their hard-copy yearbooks.

The technology uses a smartphone app. It tags photos with digital links to videos of special events, like a prom or a winning football game. The students can then use their phones or tablets to watch these videos attached to these photos.

Still, Velani thinks that many high school students prefer the traditional style of hard-copy yearbooks.

"Facebook and other kinds of social media have their place, but the messages are just fleeting moments in time," Velani said.

## "Permanent And Old-Fashioned"

Pete Macabobby works at Wheaton Warrenville South High School and advises the students who design its yearbook. He said that this past year, the school sold 1,300 yearbooks for $50 each.

Macabobby said the school sells a yearbook to more than half of the students. His school's yearbook is produced by 10 students who are members of a yearbook club.

The school looked into using video clips for its yearbooks, but students seem to prefer "a high school yearbook that's permanent and old-fashioned," Macabobby said. He senses that "there's starting to be a bit of backlash from students who don't want to be too plugged in. The kids seem to have a desire to dwell on things a little bit more."

At New Trier High School, the spring tradition of distributing the school yearbook includes a celebration for the seniors. A jazz band performs while students gather to write in each other's yearbooks.

"Our yearbook sales are as strong as they've ever been," said Kevin Bond, a yearbook adviser at New Trier. "Students tweet, text and Snapchat, but they see that as a very temporary thing. When it comes to reading, many kids I talk to overwhelmingly prefer a real book in paper, which is so different from all their media experiences."

At Prospect High, junior Brady Schwartz was all smiles as he picked up his yearbook. "It's always exciting to see your pictures in the yearbook," he said. "And when the yearbooks are handed out, you know it's that much closer to the end of the school year."
