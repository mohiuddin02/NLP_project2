JIM THORPE, Pa. — Olympic gold medalist and famous athlete Jim Thorpe had both [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) and European ancestry. When he died at age 64 in 1953, his children held a traditional Indian burial ceremony on the Sac and Fox Reservation in Oklahoma. Mourners shared a meal as the great sportsman's body lay in full view inside a lodge.

The ceremony came to an abrupt halt when Thorpe's widow and third wife, Patsy Thorpe, barged in. Accompanied by state troopers and a funeral hearse, she seized the body and drove away.

"It was a complete shock to all of us," recalls William Thorpe, the athlete's 85-year-old son, who was there that day. "We are all set to bury Dad in Oklahoma and then — boom! — he was gone, never to be returned."

Patsy Thorpe had cut a deal with two struggling towns in Pennsylvania called Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk. They agreed that if the towns merged, renamed themselves Jim Thorpe and built a memorial to honor him, she would present them with his remains for burial. The famous athlete had never set foot in the mountain borough.

## Town Appeals Judge's Ruling

Thorpe was born in Oklahoma in 1888 and raised on the Sac and Fox Reservation. William Thorpe says the town of Jim Thorpe has done a wonderful job caring for his father's grave for 60 years, but it's "time for my dad to come home."

William Thorpe, his brother and the Sac and Fox Nation won a federal lawsuit in April demanding that the town return his father's body for burial on the Oklahoma reservation. A judge ruled that the town was subject to the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Those laws govern the return of human remains and other Indian artifacts.

The town of Jim Thorpe appealed the decision and is now defending itself. "People in this town are determined to keep our memorial, and keep the body here," said Mayor Michael Sofranko. "We've done nothing wrong. We've done nothing but honor Jim Thorpe all these years."

The grave site rests on soil from Oklahoma and Stockholm's Olympic stadium, where Thorpe won gold medals in the decathlon and pentathlon in 1912. He also played professional football and baseball. In his prime, Thorpe's fame was similar to that of quarterback Peyton Manning or Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps today.

The athlete, whose full name was James Francis Thorpe, is buried in his favorite white buckskin jacket along with a rosary. The memorial overlooks a grassy slope featuring statues saluting his varied athletic career. Tributes are inscribed on the monuments and the stone building that holds his body.

## "Thanks, King"

One of the inscriptions is a comment to Thorpe from King Gustav V of Sweden at the Olympic medal ceremony in 1912 that reads, "Sir, you are the world's greatest athlete." Thorpe supposedly replied, "Thanks, King."

At Anne Marie Fitzpatrick's gift shop downtown, a sign on a glass jar stuffed with cash says "Keep Jim Thorpe In Jim Thorpe." Fitzpatrick has set up several donation jars around town to raise money for the appeal. "He's been here 59 years, and we're not about to give him up," Fitzpatrick explains.

Fitzpatrick, 72, was in grade school when Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk merged in 1954 to form Jim Thorpe. For years, she's helped organize an annual Jim Thorpe birthday ceremony in May at the memorial.

It is difficult for outsiders to comprehend the adoration for Thorpe from townspeople whose only connection to him is his name. Residents, private groups and the borough council have raised money over the years. Through these efforts, they have erected a $60,000 statue of Thorpe throwing a discus and a $50,000 one of him running with a football. Fundraising is underway to add a baseball statue.

Not everyone in the athlete's family agrees that his body should be taken to Oklahoma. "The town was built around my grandpa — people revere him," says John Thorpe, 56, a grandson who lives in South Lake Tahoe, Calif. He has joined with another Thorpe grandson to fight their uncles and tribe in an effort to keep Jim Thorpe in Jim Thorpe.

## Oklahoma Govenor Dropped The Ball

Mike Koehler, 75, believes the town has honored his grandfather's memory well. "For God's sake, leave him alone," he says. John Thorpe and Koehler have traveled here for years to take part in Jim Thorpe celebrations. They point out that Oklahoma could have kept Thorpe in 1953 but passed on the chance.

According to a history compiled by the Sac and Fox Nation, Thorpe's widow and Oklahoma's governor agreed on a deal for the state to build a grave site and memorial after Thorpe's death. But after funding was approved, the governor abruptly changed his mind and dropped the plans.

Furious, Patsy Thorpe began, in the words of William Thorpe, "shopping my dad's body around the country." She traveled to Philadelphia, where she tried and failed to persuade the commissioner of the National Football League to pay for a grave site and memorial. Thorpe played pro football and was the NFL's first president.

William Thorpe said his stepmother also failed to enlist Carlisle, Pa. This town was home to Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where Thorpe excelled in football and track. The teams were called the Indians. Thorpe was sent to the boarding school at age 16 by his father to learn a trade.

While in Philadelphia, Patsy Thorpe saw a news story about Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk holding "nickel-a-week" fundraisers to save the depressed towns. She contacted town leaders and negotiated the deal that brought the towns a new name and Jim Thorpe's body.
