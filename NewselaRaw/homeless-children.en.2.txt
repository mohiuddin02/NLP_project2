WASHINGTON — The number of homeless children in America is at an all-time high of 2.5 million, according to a new report.  One in 30 of American children has no home, but these kids are not necessarily on the streets. They sleep on friends' couches, in all-night diners or hop from motel to motel.

"Child homelessness has reached epidemic proportions in America," said Carmela DeCandia, director of the National Center on Family Homelessness (NCFH). The organization prepared the child homelessness report. "But the nation hasn't really prioritized family and child homelessness. How are we going to target resources if we're not on the same page about the size of the problem?"

## Hard To Get Services

According to the U.S. Department of Education, 1.1 million school children do not have a fixed address. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) counts the number of families living on the street, in shelters or in cars at a specific point in time, coming up with a total of about 138,149 homeless children.

In 2010, President Barack Obama unveiled an ambitious plan to end overall homelessness by 2020 that focuses on adults. The number of homeless vets and chronically homeless has decreased by more than 20 percent. The chronically homeless are those who have been homeless for more than a year or in and out of homes.

The number of homeless children, though, has nearly doubled since 2010.

Many homeless children "can't get the full range of shelter services, food assistance and counseling to manage the trauma of being homeless — and they can't get it because they're kids," said Ed Walz. He is the vice president of the nonprofit First Focus Campaign for Children.

## "Hidden Homelessness"

Poverty is the great cause of homelessness. Homeless children typically belong to a family headed by a single mother in her 20s, without much education and who is frequently out of a job. Many of these mothers avoid going to shelters for as long as possible. They don't want their children to live in shelters or they are afraid the family will be split up.

"They are the group at greatest risk," DeCandia said.

Add in the lack of cheap housing, and low-income families easily "topple over the cliff," DeCandia said. A 2014 report found that a full-time worker earning $7 or $8 an hour cannot afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment.

"People are surprised that (homelessness) impacts children so much," said Patricia Nix-Hodes, director of the Law Project at the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. "It tends to be less visible. People call it the hidden homelessness." These families are not literally on the street. She said they may be moving place to place, staying with another family or living in a shelter.

## Hungry, Sick, Struggling

According to the NCFH report, homeless kids are more likely to be hungry or sick and have a mental illness. They are more likely to struggle in school, miss classes and repeat grades. They are also more likely to eventually drop out of school.

Fifty-one percent of kids without a permanent home are under age 6. About 25 percent of homeless preschoolers and 40 percent of homeless school-age kids have mental health issues. Homeless kids are also more likely to be beaten, said Barbara Duffield, policy director for the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth (NAEHCY).

Some homeless youth are on their own, while others are separated from their families who also are homeless. By law, shelters receiving government money can't turn away families with boys older than 10 or 12. Privately funded shelters can and do turn them away, and in the process, break up families. Teens are often left to fend for themselves.

Over the past few years, Nix-Hodes of the Chicago homeless coalition said she's seen child homelessness in the city skyrocket. In the previous school year, nearly 60,000 school children in Illinois were identified as homeless. That number is double the 2008-2009 school year.

## Some States See Improvement

Similarly, Chicago has also seen a dramatic increase with more than 22,000 homeless children enrolled in the public schools. The federal Education Department reports that more than 1.1 million homeless children went to public schools during the 2011-2012 school year.

"We're seeing this dramatic and shocking increase year after year," Nix-Hodes said. She added that there is not enough money for housing or for school districts to provide all the educational and mental health services the children need.

States that are more successful at reducing child homelessness coordinate services for families. They also have a state plan to combat the problem, as well as money to find them shelter.

"This report is a call to action for states," said Richard Bloom. He is a California State Assembly member who would like to see more effort to deal with child homelessness in California. "We need to focus resources on the very at risk children. We are going to be creating the next generation's chronically homeless populations if we don't address their needs now."

At the federal level, advocates for child homelessness are pinning their hopes on the Homeless Children and Youth Act. If passed, the law would enable HUD to redefine homelessness to include more children and youth.

The recent economic problem "has changed who is homeless in America," said NAEHCY's Duffield. "The problem is, HUD's definition hasn't changed with it."
