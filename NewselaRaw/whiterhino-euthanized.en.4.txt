The number of northern white rhinos on Earth just went down. Nola was the only white rhino in the United States. She was put to sleep by the San Diego Zoo. Nola was 41 years old. She was old and sick. Now there are only three of the huge, two-horned animals left.

There are two kinds of white rhinoceroses. The northern white rhino is one. The other kind is the southern white rhino. Northern white rhinos are among the largest animals on land. Only elephants are bigger. The northern white rhino can run at speeds of more than 30 miles an hour. Northern white rhinos once lived in many parts of Africa. 

Now the places they used to live are no longer safe. People hunt them for their horns. The horns sell for high prices. 

## Laws Helped Save Southern White Rhino 

In 1960, there were 2,000 northern white rhinos. By 2015, the number fell to five. Then two more died this year.

The southern white rhinoceros has done much better. More than 20,000 of them are alive in the wild. They were almost wiped out. Fewer than than 20 of the rhinos were alive in the year 1900. 

Southern white rhino numbers went up for many reasons. Laws were passed to save them. Many of them mated and had babies. Hunting was not allowed much. 

## Scientists Working On Plan To Make Babies

The three northern white rhinos that are left live at Ol Pejeta Conservancy. It is in Kenya, in Africa. The male rhino is too old to mate. The female rhinos cannot have babies. When they die, this kind of rhino will be gone from Earth. Their only chance is if scientists find a way to save them.

Barbara Durrant works for the San Diego Zoo. She and other scientists have a plan. They hope to grow a rhino embryo in a lab. An embryo forms when a male rhino fertilizes an egg from a female rhino. An embryo can grow into a baby. A southern white rhino female would carry the embryos of northern white rhinos. She would give birth to northern white rhino babies.

The San Diego Zoo will pay for the new plan.
