AKRON, Ohio â€” Most people would call Vera Kap's eggs beautiful. They might notice how detailed and carefully done they are.

But Kap knows they're so much more.

Kap, who lives in West Akron, Ohio, is a pysanky artist. Her Easter eggs are decorated according to centuries-old Ukrainian customs. To her, the eggs aren't just springtime ornaments. They are a part of her roots. They are proof that old ways can outlast hard times.

Kap's decorated eggs can be seen this weekend at Elegant Egg &amp; More. This once-a-year show is devoted to eggshell art. It is being held in a church.

## An Easter Connection

Pysanky (PIH-sahn-kih) are eggs decorated with colors and symbols that have special meanings for Ukrainians. A single egg is a pysanka.

Kap is the child of Ukrainian-born parents. She learned the art of pysanky from her mother when she was growing up in Cleveland.

Among Ukrainians, "this is something that's passed from mother to daughter," she said. "For centuries."

Pysanky-making is believed to have started in pre-Christian times. Indeed, it has probably been around for thousands of years.

The country of Ukraine officially became Christian in the 10th century. The symbols used on the eggs were then given Christian meanings. Pysanky became a form of folk art connected to Easter.

The way the art form has lasted so long amazes Kap. It survived years of war and hunger. It survived Communist rule, a time when religion was outlawed.

## Designs And Colors

After 1991, Ukraine was no longer under Communist rule. Suddenly, the work of many Ukrainian pysanky artists emerged. "So somebody had to have done them in secret for years and years," Kap said.

Pysanky are very complicated to make. The eggs are dyed several times, using different colors. Wax is applied to parts of the eggshell so they won't take on a particular color.

The designs on pysanky eggs have special meanings. A triangle, for example, stands for the Holy Trinity: God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. A rooster symbolizes fertility. Likewise, the colors have meanings: for example, yellow stands for youth and happiness, while red stands for God's love.

The egg itself represents two things: the reawakening of the earth after winter and the rebirth of people's link to Christ.

For her pysanky, Kap uses chicken and goose eggs. She starts by sketching a design onto an egg in pencil. Then, she covers those lines with a fine bead of wax. That way, the lines stay white during the dyeing.

The egg then goes into the first in a series of dye baths. Kap starts with the lightest color. Then, she moves on to darker colors and then to the darkest colors.

## Stays With The Old Ways

After each dip into a jar of dye, Kap applies wax to parts of the egg that she wants to protect from the next dye. They remain the color of the dye she has just used.

When the final dye bath is done, she melts off the wax. She then covers the brightly colored egg with three coats of gloss.

Kap turns her dining room over to pysanky-making for two or three months each year. She spends seven or eight hours a day on her art, she said.

A single egg might take three to five hours of work to complete.

Kap said she has designed only two pysanky of her own, because designing takes so much time. Mostly, she copies designs others have created. She's inspired by pysanky she sees in books and on the Internet.

People sometimes suggest she decorate her eggs with additions like rhinestones or glitter. Kap isn't interested: She plans to stick with the old ways.
