NASHVILLE, Tenn. — One day in 1960, Nashville officers carried John Lewis by his hands and feet to a police wagon for daring to take a seat at a whites-only lunch counter. On the same downtown block, today's fresh-faced police recruits are learning about the troubled history between law enforcement and African-Americans.

About 60 police hopefuls, many around the same age that Lewis was when he became a leader of the civil rights movement, gathered recently in the Civil Rights Room at Nashville's main library. Dressed in plain blue uniforms, they listened to stories about Lewis and other college students who helped make Nashville the first Southern city to desegregate its lunch counters. Words that Lewis uttered back then to urge his fellow students not to falter in the face of violence were inscribed on the wall above the recruits. They read, "If not us, then who? If not now, then when?" 

As confrontations between police and the African-American community once again trigger public outcry, law enforcement leaders around the country are looking for new ways to restore trust. In Tennessee, they have turned to the Nashville library's rich archive on the movement to teach new recruits about past injustices. They hope the lessons of history will lead to even-handed police work. The sessions with new recruits quickly became a core part of their police training. Other law enforcement agencies around the country have taken notice.

## Training And Gaining Empathy

Nashville police Chief Steve Anderson said that the training will make them remember an important lesson. "'When I approach someone or someone approaches me, I need to think about where they may be coming from,'" he said.

The library's Civil Rights Room is lined with pictures of Nashville during the era. For several years it has become the setting for regular programs about the role that civil rights leaders like Lewis, Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette and James Lawson played in the push for equal treatment.

Some Nashville officers who visited the room were so impressed that they asked the library to develop a program for new recruits. They later asked the library for teaching materials for veteran law enforcement officers, including members of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI).

## Applying History's Lessons To Today's Situations

"Civil rights education is a valuable part of the training we pursue for our agents," TBI Director Mark Gwyn said. "Remembering the valuable lessons learned from the mistakes of the past helps us to better serve the diverse public we encounter in our work every day."

At the library's first session with new recruits in April, instructors used images, films and oral histories. These connected the past to situations the recruits might face now.

Nashville police recruit Micah Wright said the images convey the hurt that people feel when their rights are denied.

"As long as civil rights aren't realized, then everyone is going to feel the burden and the pain from that," he said.

## Program Attracting Notice Across The Country

Andrea Blackman, who oversees the library's program, said police chiefs from across the country have visited the library to learn about it. Some have asked her to put programs together for their departments.

Chuck Wexler is the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, an organization of police leaders. The research organization is trying to improve policing around the country.

"Today's young officers weren't even alive back then, but this history is alive in people's memories and can't be swept under the rug," he said. By teaching these lessons to police recruits, "the Nashville Police Department distinguishes itself as a leader."

That view is shared by some of the legendary civil rights leaders the young recruits are studying.

## Officers Are Tasked With Protection For All

Bernard Lafayette recalled how during the lunch counter sit-ins, Nashville police stood by as he and other protesters were attacked. He said he hopes programs like the one at the library will help new recruits better understand their roles as protectors. He also hopes they understand just how much people trust them.

"You do more than simply stop the shootings; you create a sense of community," said Lafayette. He still teaches Martin Luther King Jr.'s principles of nonviolence all over the world. "Because, in my opinion, there is no separation between police and community."

More than a half-century ago, Lawson started training students in nonviolent protest in a church basement before the sit-ins. He said he believes such a program helps officers "adopt the notion that 'I'm going to treat this person exactly as I want to be treated.'"

"I'm not going to say that police officers can do that in every situation ... where life is being threatened or crime is being committed," he said. "But I do say that in the 80 or 90 percent of the encounters that they have as police officers, which usually have nothing to do with a crime being committed, they can treat the folk that they're facing and dealing with and incidents with that kind of character and spirit."
