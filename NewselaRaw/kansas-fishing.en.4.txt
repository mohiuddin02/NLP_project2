CLARK STATE FISHING LAKE, Kan. â€” Kansas is not famous for its fishing. That is why many people are surprised to find Bluff Creek Valley. It is a fishing paradise. Many people call it the prettiest fishing hole in Kansas.

The fishing lake is in a steep valley. The land around the lake is hard to get to, even for animals. There are roads around the lake. Cars driving through see a valley full of tall cottonwood and willow trees.

Across the valley there is a lake full of crystal clear water and many fish.

"These fish are so fat, their mouths always look small," said Joey Yeager. He has been a fisherman for years. "I don't think I've ever seen a skinny bass in this lake."

## Building It Was Hard Work

The lake was made in the 1930s using a special government program. The program gave people jobs. Men would work at places like Bluff Creek Valley to build public areas. They worked very hard. Often, the only tools they had were mules and shovels. The men were paid in meals and a place to sleep and a little money. They moved thousands of tons of dirt and rock to build the lake's dam.

The lake is full of many different kinds of fish. There are white bass, walleye and catfish.

## Many Fish And Lots Of Beauty

Yeager has been a fisherman for many years but sometime he does not catch anything. Still, he always leaves happy because there is so much beauty around him.

When Yeager fishes here, he takes time to look around the lake. There is much to see in nature. On one day, he watched a kingfisher fly across the water. He saw a white-tail deer near a cove. He gazed at the hills whose peaks rise above the lake. He pointed toward several stems poking through the lake's surface and said by early summer they will be holding lily pads. Each will have a pink flower.

"They'll be gorgeous. The entire lake is gorgeous," Yeager said. "This is the kind of lake where it's just good to be out here. It's all just good for me when I'm here."
