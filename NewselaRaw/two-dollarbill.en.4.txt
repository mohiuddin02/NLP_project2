John Bennardo really likes the $2 bill. He has always saved the bills. By last summer he had 11 of them in a desk drawer.

Bennardo starting thinking. He wondered why the two was unusual.

The $2 bill does not get a lot of respect. But now, it is going to get some attention. Bennardo is making a movie about it. He plans to tell the story of the two and its "magic."

"I think everyone's curious about it," he said. People always react when you spend one, he said.

## Not Just Funny Money

The bill has Thomas Jefferson on the front. It shows a drawing of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the back.

Many people save $2 bills. Others make a point to spend them. They want to see what happens next.

Bennardo owns Immagine Productions. He also teaches film and television editing.

Amy Byer Shainman also lives in Florida. She cares a lot about the bill. She is going to help Bennardo with the movie. Byer Shainman said she has kept a two that someone she liked in high school gave her. This was more than 25 years ago. She does not know why she kept it.

Bennardo got to work last summer.

He went to some places in South Florida. He talked to a man who turns $2 bills into art. He also filmed American Healthy Vending in Miami and the company explained why most snack machines don't take twos.

## Twos Make People Smile

Bennardo also traveled to several states. Among them were Texas, New York, Michigan and Oregon. He has talked to about 50 people in all.

One is Heather McCabe from New York City. She asks for $2 bills from her bank. Then she spends them at local businesses. She hopes the bill will catch on.

McCabe started spending twos about 15 years ago. She liked the added conversation with people behind the counter.

"It became something a little more special," she said. She also sees it as an experiment. "What's going to happen when I spend this $2 bill? It never gets old."

Most people smile at the sight of the unusual bill. They share a story about their experiences with it, McCabe said. Some take two singles out of their own wallets so they can pocket the $2 bill. Others refuse it. But McCabe said most take it.

## Two Plus Two Is - A Billion?

The federal government began printing the $2 bill in 1862. There was a 10-year period that the government stopped making them. But that ended in 1976, when the $2 bill was brought back to celebrate 200 years of U.S. independence.

If they had just disappeared, Bennardo said, "we wouldn't have this great piece of Americana saved. And I wouldn't have a movie."

As of last year there were a billion $2 bills around, according to the Federal Reserve. Forty-five million were printed in October at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Texas. Bennardo was there, filming.

Some groups use the two for certain reasons.

Several groups have used them to prove that the groups spend a lot of money. Bennardo interviewed people who wanted to make medical marijuana legal in Michigan. They spent twos around the state to show their spending power.

Other groups have done something like that. Those include out-of-work steel company workers in Utah in 2003, and black civil-rights activists in the 1980s.

Clemson University students spend $2 bills stamped with tiger paws in cities where the school plays football. It started in 1977, when Georgia Tech decided to stop playing football against the school. The tiger is the Clemson mascot.
