LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” There is no National Football League (NFL) team in Los Angeles. Still, the city has been important for the league. Many teams have used the threat of moving to Los Angeles to get new stadiums at home.

For example, the Indianapolis Colts mentioned that they were looking at a move to Los Angeles in 2002.

Three years later, in 2005, the Colts started building the Lucas Oil Stadium in downtown Indianapolis. It cost $720 million, but the team paid only $100 million. The city and Indiana paid the other $620 million.

Los Angeles did not get a team then. It still has not. In some ways, the city has been worth more to the NFL without having a team.

## Keeping The Home Team

This week came news that the owner of the St. Louis Rams plans to build a stadium near Los Angeles. The news sounded familiar.

More than half of the NFL's 32 teams have used moving to Los Angeles as a threat since the Rams and Oakland Raiders left the city after the 1994 season. Some were serious about it. Others were not.

The tactic works. Since the last pro game here, 27 NFL stadiums have been built or had $400 million in fixes made to them, with their home cities paying for much of it.

Rams owner Stan Kroenke hasn't promised to bring his team. Still, his stadium plan is a big step toward an NFL return. The last big attempt was in 1996.

Ken Behring, then the owner of the Seattle Seahawks, wanted a new stadium. The team starting working out in Los Angeles, for a week. The NFL threatened a fine of $500,000 a week if the team didn't return. Soon, the moving trucks were on a trip back to Seattle.

And the Seahawks eventually got their brand-new home field.

## Not Just A Threat This Time?

Kroenke's bid is different from past plans. It is the first time an NFL owner had a plan for a stadium and a piece of land to build it on. Even experts on football find the Kroenke plan promising.

"The question really becomes: Los Angeles is the second-largest market in the country and can the NFL afford to continue to use it" as a threat, said Bob Graziano. He used to be president of the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the 1990s, Graziano worked on the idea of an NFL stadium at Chavez Ravine, where the Dodgers play baseball. "Or at some point" can the league make more money with a team in Los Angeles, he asked.

The idea of using a city as a threat isn't new. Florida's Tampa-St. Petersburg area had that job for years in Major League Baseball before the Devil Rays (now the Rays) arrived in 1998. After the National Basketball Association's Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, Seattle became a spot for basketball teams interested in getting better deals from their cities. Las Vegas is mentioned as a spot for a National Hockey League, for the same reason.

## The "Open" City Of L.A.

The NFL has brought a team back to almost every big city that had lost a team. Los Angeles is the one place where that hasn't happened.

Even without a team in Los Angeles, the NFL is the country's most popular sport, and it earns more than any other. The league brings in more than $9 billion each year.

The NFL hasn't been hurt by not having a team in Los Angeles, said former Fox Sports President Ed Goren. He said teams are worth much more now, and the league makes more money from showing its games on television than ever before. He said keeping Los Angeles "open" with a team has been good for the NFL.

"You always want one guy on the outside and you use him. It's just good business," he said.
