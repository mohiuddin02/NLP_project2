The high seas is Earth's largest biosphere. It represents about 58 percent of our planet's oceans and yet, it is heavily exploited. Much of its rich marine life is dying off.

Several weeks ago, after a decade of agonizing discussions, the nations of the world finally agreed that the high seas are in great need of protection.

"For the first time in history, states recommended by consensus that an international treaty be negotiated to address the urgent crisis of biodiversity loss on the high seas," says Daniela Diz. She is a marine policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund, who has sat in on the talks at the United Nations. "It's an important step forward."

And it hasn't come a moment too soon. The Census of Marine Life, a decadelong survey of the global oceans, estimated that 90 percent of large predatory fish, such as tuna, billfish and swordfish, have disappeared from the seas.

## Bottom Trawling Deep-Sea Fish

Harmful fishing practices add to the threat. Most deep-sea fish in the high seas are caught by a method called bottom trawling, which scrapes heavy nets across the seafloor. The nets destroy everything in their path, including the fragile marine ecosystems, such as the deepwater corals and sponges that give shelter to fish. Much of the trawl's catch, its bycatch, is thrown back into the ocean dead.

A recent report by the Global Ocean Commission blamed the lack of adequate control for the dying off of the high seas. The commission is an international panel of heads of state, government ministers and business leaders.

Although not utterly lawless, the high seas is controlled by a jumble of institutions and regulations. There's the International Maritime Organization for shipping. For mining, there's the International Seabed Authority. For fishing, it is the Regional Fisheries Management Organizations.

The lack of coordination between these different bodies has made it virtually impossible to safeguard the high seas, no matter how large or small, the commission found.

"The new agreement will be about what we keep in the seas, instead of what we extract," says Karen Sack, director of The Pew Charitable Trusts' International Marine Program. Sack has been involved in these discussions since their beginning in 2004.

## The Oceans' National Parks

To prevent overfishing the agreement would, among other things, make it much easier to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the high seas.

MPAs are the oceans' national parks, and range in size and level of protection. Twelve percent of the world's land is currently protected in national parks and wildlife preserves, while in comparison, just about 1 percent of the high seas is protected. The plan is to increase this number to 10 percent by 2020 and eventually to 30 percent. The goal is ambitious, considering the amount of international cooperation that will be necessary.

The Global Ocean Commission calls on countries to quickly reach an agreement. According to the commission, other problems include harmful fishing subsidies, lack of tracking for fishing vessels, little accountability for offshore oil and gas exploration, and plastics pollution.

Should these rules not be put into effect within five years, the commission suggests closing the high seas to fishing. "This proposal is not anti-fishing," says RÃ©mi Parmentier, commission deputy executive secretary. "There is a body of scientific evidence that if you stopped fishing in the high seas there would be dividends or benefits in terms of fishing within" a country's coastal zone.

Coastal states would benefit from the measure, he says. Many of them are suffering economically, particularly in West Africa, because too many fish are being killed off by high-seas fishing fleets.

An article that scientific journal PLoS Biology published last year suggested that preventing fishing in the high seas is the best way to boost the recovery of large, migratory fishes. It would also increase the hauls and profits of fisheries.

## Ecological And Economic Benefits

The fear, says Matthew Gianni, co-founder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, is that a complete closure may lead countries to fish beyond their coastal zones, where they have exclusive rights to fish. Countries' coastal zones extend 200 nautical miles into the ocean. The high seas lay beyond this point, in international waters.

"There's a lot of merit to collective regulation," said Gianni, whose environmental group aims to save the high seas.

And yet, the evidence in favor of closing the high seas to fishing is growing. Earlier in February, a study from the University of British Columbia (UBC) suggested this would have ecological, economic and social benefits.

Researchers found that closing the high seas would actually increase the amount of fish caught annually. A greater number of countries could catch these fish within their coastal zones, making the high seas the "biggest savings account on the planet." Major fishing nations, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, however, would lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year.

If the agreement is successfully negotiated, there may be no need for closing down the high seas to fisheries. Key areas would be set aside for marine protection, while outside those areas, the impact of fishing and drilling would be studied, which would help ensure ocean health in the long run. "I realize what we have lost," says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Society explorer-in-residence and co-author of the UBC paper.

"I also see what the ocean of the future can be," added Sala, who dives in some of the world's most unspoiled waters. "It's the difference between the places that are degraded, and places that are pristine and beautiful that gives us hope."
