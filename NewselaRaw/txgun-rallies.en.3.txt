FORT WORTH, Texas â€” Texans are famous for loving guns. But the nation's largest gun-rights group is angry with some Texans. The group says demonstrations in favor of the legal, open carrying of weapons have grabbed headlines in the wrong way.

Some pro-gun Texans have recently held rallies. They have taken place at fast-food restaurants and home-improvement stores. But officials with the National Rifle Association say the rallies are "downright weird." They say the protests are "certainly not a practical way to go normally about your business while being prepared to defend yourself."

The group praises Texas for a strong "gun culture." But leaders of the group scolded "a small number who have recently crossed the line from enthusiasm to downright foolishness."

## Guns And Alcohol Don't Mix

Many Republicans are coming to their state convention in Fort Worth later this week. Some plan to carry long guns outside the Fort Worth Convention Center.

There is a question over whether guns can be carried into the center. The reason is that there is a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) license on the facility. That license includes rules about carrying guns.

Long guns aren't allowed in places that sell alcohol. The business could lose its permit to sell drinks. People who take guns there could face trespassing charges.

The Republican Party of Texas chairman issued a statement about weapons. He told members that "anyone carrying an openly exposed weapon will be asked to do so outside of the building."

Concealed handgun license holders will be fine. They and peace officers may carry their concealed handguns inside during the convention.

Gun supporters are telling people to carry black powder guns inside.

## State Of Open-Carry Confusion

There have been several local demonstrations. The most recent took place at a Home Depot parking lot.

Organizers have said around 150 people showed up. The event was meant to promote the desire of Texans to openly carry their handguns. Donations were accepted; black powder revolvers and ammunition were among raffle prizes given out.

North Richland Hills police say they are now investigating the raffle from the event. They say it might have been against state gambling laws.

A group called Open Carry Tarrant County also made national headlines. Their actions caused confusion at a Jack in the Box in Fort Worth. Somebody called 911. The caller was concerned about a group of men walking around with long-barreled guns.

Another demonstration took place at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Dallas. It gained attention when managers asked customers not to bring guns into the restaurants. That is, "unless they are authorized law enforcement."

Open carry has become a hot political issue. Candidates for Texas governor have said that a change in the law will be debated soon.

## Group Says Carry Considerately

Some leaders in the open-carry movement recently sent out a letter. It called on supporters to stop trying to carry long guns into Texas businesses.

"We ask that members take a step back," the letter said. "Help us get open carry passed for everyone." It was signed by four different groups.

NRA officials pointed out that they "love AR-15s and AKs as much as anybody."

However, they said to some people "it can be downright scary" to see the guns carried into public places. These people may be "perfectly open-minded about firearms" But seeing the guns in public places can make them feel "uncomfortable." They may question what pro-gun supporters are trying to do, NRA officials said.

Several restaurants asked that customers not bring long guns into their businesses.

NRA officials say these protests are "just not neighborly." They said that this "is out of character for the big-hearted residents of Texas. Using guns merely to draw attention to yourself in public not only defies common sense, it shows a lack of consideration and manners."

They added, "That's not the Texas way. And that's certainly not the NRA way."
