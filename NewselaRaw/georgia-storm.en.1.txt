ATLANTA â€” Under attack over their handling of the snowstorm that paralyzed Atlanta this week, state and school officials said they followed all the lessons from the storm of 2011.

But the problem was that storm wasn't this storm.

After the crippling snowstorm of 2011, state agencies and city officials created an 11-page snow and ice plan. They built up new salt piles, deployed new equipment, and started new plans to use private snowplows to clear the roads. With this snowstorm, though, the problem was not because there were too few resources. Instead, there were too many people.

The 2011 storm hit on a Sunday night, and people woke up the next morning to discover they were snowed in.

This one hit at midday Tuesday.

## State Officials Blame Meteorologists

The snow stranded thousands of people at schools, in cars and at work, and caused hours-long traffic jams from people trying to get home. The only thing that could have prevented this was if people were warned before the storm to stay home rather than go about their daily activities. But neither the governor nor his officials told anyone to do that, because it was not in the plan.

Nothing in the plan written after the 2011 storm gives officials any guidance about when to issue warnings to the public or tell them to just stay put.

"You know, this is a disaster event that was the result of human and organizational ... decision making," said Steven Picou, a professor of sociology at the University of South Alabama who researches disaster response.

After the storm, officials from Governor Nathan Deal on down said they learned new lessons, and promised to apply them the next time around. But they still were reluctant to say they made a mistake by not telling people to just stay home.

Instead, Deal and other state officials blamed meteorologists, saying they lacked clear information from the National Weather Service (NWS) on which to base a message.

The NWS rejected that claim, pointing out that it issued a winter storm warning for the entire Atlanta metro area at 3:38 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) Tuesday.

Keith Stellman, meteorologist in charge at the NWS office for the Atlanta region, said that it changed its snowfall prediction as the storm approached. But he said that its forecasts on the timing of the storm and the general area that would be affected "never wavered."

"That's a fact. That's an absolute fact," Stellman said.

Mike Smith, an AccuWeather senior vice president, also disputed suggestions that meteorologists were responsible for the chaos.

"It's just simply not true that this couldn't have been anticipated," said Smith, who is also a meteorologist.

## Followed The 2011 Plan

At Wednesday's news conference, Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) Director Charley English stressed that the state followed the 2011 plan. As one of the lessons learned in 2011, the GEMA director was put in charge of coordinating the state's disaster preparations. English said that GEMA did everything it said it would do, including getting extra plows and pretreating the streets.

But he rejected suggestions that earlier and stronger warnings would have made a difference. Without a "crystal ball," English said he would have made the same decisions.

As the disaster unfolded, GEMA's website gave no instructions to drivers. A link on its site to "winter weather" led to a week-old tip sheet from the "polar vortex" on insulating homes and cars. State Department of Transportation Commissioner Keith Golden said that before the storm, he and English never spoke about whether to tell people to stay home Tuesday.

Deal said that in hindsight he would have done that sooner. He also said the state had learned lessons for next time, such as urging the public to not all go home at once, but he said the timing of the National Weather Service's storm warning was a problem.

"Yes, I would have acted sooner and I think we learned from that and we will act sooner next time," Deal said. "But we don't want to be accused of crying wolf. Because if we'd been wrong, y'all would have been in here saying, 'Do you know how many millions of dollars you've cost the economy and the city of Atlanta?'"

## "This Was Man-Made"

At the local level, various officials also wrestled with questions over the nature and timing of the storm response.

Gwinnett County Chairwoman Charlotte Nash defended the Georgia Department of Transportation, saying that it did as well as it could under the difficult circumstances. Nash said it took her three hours to get home in the snow from downtown Atlanta Tuesday.

But others saw big room for improvement, especially in the area of public warnings.

"Sometimes you need to make a very conservative call," Fulton County Transportation Director David Ricks said. "For all of us, that's a lesson learned."

Roswell Administrator Kay Love was even more blunt, saying, "This was man-made."

"In a perfect world, we'd all be really connected," said Love, who believes there should be a way to coordinate information. Once schools, businesses and governments decided to close at midday Tuesday, so many cars were out on the road that all the roads couldn't be treated with salt and sand to melt the snow and keep cars from skidding.

An estimated 3,500 students spent the night at their schools because buses could not get them safely home.

State School Superintendent John Barge, a Republican who is challenging Deal for the governorship, was ready to criticize his rival.

He said his experience as an educator has taught him that "when something like that is coming in, you always err on the side of caution." Asked why he didn't tell schools to close on his own, he said he didn't want to be seen as abusing the powers of his office.

"Some districts might not receive that well," Barge said. "The thought that someone might make them close, they may see that as overreaching."
