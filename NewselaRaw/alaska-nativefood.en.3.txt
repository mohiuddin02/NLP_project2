ANCHORAGE, Alaska — The Inupiat are Native Alaskan people. Because the weather is very cold in Alaska, farming is not easy. For that reason, many Inupiat hunt for game, or large animals. They eat the meat to survive. Hunting is an important part of their culture.  

Some older Inupiat live in nursing homes. One is called Utugganaat Inaat. It means "a place for elders" in Inupiat. Not long ago, the residents were served musk ox meatloaf.

They loved it. Their visiting families loved it too. Val Kreil works at the nursing home. He recalled that one young relative said the meal was "the bomb!"

"You don't hear that every day about meatloaf," Kreil said.

## More Traditional Foods Are Being Cooked

The cooks at the nursing home are making more meals with traditional foods. The food is given to the nursing home by hunters. Last year, a new national law passed that will make it easier to serve foods loved by Alaska Natives and Native Americans.

The law allows some groups to donate, or give, food to nursing homes. They can also give food to programs for children and other places where people live or receive care. Some of the programs and places that will be getting food are run by Native American tribes and tribal groups.

Traditional foods like corn and bison can be bought. They are already served in some nursing homes and other places. The new law will allow many more foods to be purchased. Venison, moose, caribou and reindeer can now be bought.

## Elders Are Happy To Eat Special Meats

Leslie Wheelock works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA is a government department that makes food safety rules. The new law helps Native Americans continue eating traditional foods, she said.  

Some Native Americans live in an area called the Navajo Nation. It is a Navajo land inside Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. The Birds Springs chapter is a Navajo group in Arizona. It is building a nursing home. It will open next year. Residents will hopefully eat elk and deer, along with squash and beans from Navajo farmers.

Thomas Walker works for the chapter. He said the elders deserve to keep eating meals they have loved their whole lives. Their traditional foods make them happy and healthy.

## Caribou Stew "Was Wonderful"

Alaska already had a law that allowed some traditional foods to be served.

However, a new factory down the road will be very helpful to the nursing home in Alaska. Meat donated by hunters is cleaned and stored at the factory. 

The residents at the nursing home tasted their first donated meat a few months ago. It was the musk ox meatloaf. Until then, they had to wait for monthly family potluck dinners to enjoy the food they grew up with. 

Not long ago the factory processed caribou meat for the nursing home. Some of the meat went into a chunky stew with potatoes.

"It was wonderful," said Mary Reed, who is 80. She lives at the home. She had not eaten caribou for a long time. 

One thing is for sure. They gobble up their meals and do not leave any crumbs behind.
