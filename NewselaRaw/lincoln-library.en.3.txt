Have you ever wondered what President Abraham Lincoln was doing on your birthday 150 years ago? A new project may be able to tell you.

It is using modern technology to put historical Lincoln papers on the Internet.

"Millions of people around the world are fascinated by Abraham Lincoln," said Daniel Stowell. He is the director and editor of The Papers of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. He is also its director of its Center For Digital Initiatives. The museum and library is in Springfield, Illinois.

## Getting To Know Abe Better

Stowell and his staff are transferring more than 150,000 papers written by the president or to Lincoln onto computers. So far, they have put about 100,000 documents online. They are also posting as many day-to-day events in Lincoln's life as possible. Where Lincoln went and what he did on more than 7,100 days can be found on thelincolnlog.org.

For example, on March 9, 1844, Abraham Lincoln paid 25 cents for mittens. On Feb. 9, 1864, several artists painted pictures of him. One of them was the portrait used for the $5 bill.

Stowell and his staff think that even documents about Lincoln's death will help people understand him better. Lincoln was killed by a gunman 150 years ago this April.

The citizenlincoln.org website lets people read a letter from Britain's Queen Victoria to Mary Todd Lincoln after her husband's assassination. The letter was written on April 29, 1865. The queen called his death "so terrible a calamity."

## Lincoln Is Still Popular Today

People can also read what modern world leaders say about Lincoln today.

In October, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a letter to the museum. He said he got strength from Lincoln. He noted that streets in Israel are named after Lincoln. Netanyahu also said that Lincoln always had a desire to visit Jerusalem.

"I definitely see digitalization and Internet as a way to reach a young audience," Stowell said. He also wants to reach museum-goers and Lincoln fans of all ages.

The 200,000 Lincoln documents can be found on papersofabrahamlincoln.org. Stowell estimates about 50,000 more papers exist.

The project preserves these fragile papers and allows people to see them, he said.

## Letters To The President

Amy Henrikson and Joan Walters are among seven volunteers who work on the project. They do their best to read the handwritten letters and documents and copy them down.

Poor handwriting and hurried script can make their job challenging. But all of it is interesting, Henrikson said, and "much of it is moving."

She spoke about a letter written to Lincoln by a Louisiana teacher. The man begged the president for a job up North. He spoke out against the Southern states separating from the United States. He said he feared for his family's safety.

Walters remembers a letter written by Lincoln in February 1861. It was to the man who was going to rent Lincoln's Springfield home for $350 a year.

"Here is this man, inheriting one of the most difficult times in American history, and he is taking the time to write a contract for his house," Walters said. "His feet were always planted on the ground. He never was too big for any job that needed to be done."

## More To Learn About Abe

Daniel Weinberg owns The Abraham Lincoln Book Shop in Chicago. Recently, he let  Stowell know about 45 Lincoln documents in the shop. Stowell came to Chicago with his scanner to make copies of them.

"I've seen a lot of Lincoln signatures," Weinberg said. "Are there significant Lincolns still out there to be found? I can't say there aren't because every once in awhile something significant does come out."

Weinberg called Lincoln a true genius. "As a person, his moralities, his ethics, organization skills, use of mathematics. He's iconic. Why would we not want people worldwide to be able to learn more from him?"
