SAN PEDRO de MACORIS, Dominican Republic â€” Baseball is the favorite sport of the Dominican Republic. It is a small nation in the Caribbean Sea. Even though many people play, the game looks a little different than American baseball.

At the end of town, there is an old park. You have to walk past old buildings, garbage and stray dogs to get there. Kids and players hang around the park. They shout in Spanish. There are old baseball fields where kids are practicing. The sounds of baseball are everywhere. The crack of a bat hitting the ball. A baseballs thuds into a glove as it is caught.

"I want to play in the major leagues, of course," said Richard Paulino, a baseball player on the field. "I am passionate about the game. I am focused."

## "The Best Players"

Many people learn baseball at a young age in the Dominican Republic. The best athletes even move to the United States to play in Major League Baseball (MLB).

The sport gives many people hope. The Dominican Republic is poor. Becoming a baseball player can be a good job. The sport also creates jobs for other people, like cooks, cleaners and landscapers who take care of the fields.

By 2013, more than 500 Dominican players were signing to play for MLB teams.

"It's a lot easier than when I used to play," said Moises Alou. He used to play baseball for the Chicago Cubs, a major league team. Now, he is the general manager of a Dominican team. "Everybody now plays baseball. There's a lot of programs and tryouts and there's a lot of teams competing to sign the best players."

## At The Game

On a recent afternoon in the Dominican Republic, thousands of people came to watch a baseball game. There were nearly 10,000 in the stadium.

Kids wore the uniforms of local teams. They shouted and tried to see the field. Some people climbed over the walls. Others sat on top of the dugouts to watch.

Just before the game started, Richard Paulino walked into the stadium. He was there to watch the game with his friends. He pushed through the crowds. Paulino passed girls selling popcorn out of a big plastic tub. He walked by a woman selling soda from a shoebox.

Someone asked if he was every going to be on the field.

He smiled. "Someday."
