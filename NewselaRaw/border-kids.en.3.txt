WASHINGTON â€“ Every day, 80 to 120 children cross the Texas border illegally. They do it by themselves.

This is similar to what is going on in other border states. More children under the age of 18 are coming into the country illegally. Meanwhile, fewer adults are.

Authorities caught 24,481 children in 2012 crossing the border alone. That is more than three times as many as in 2008. The government sent a record number of children to a group called the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).  Its job is to take care of children while their cases are investigated. The ORR also keeps them in custody.

## Teenagers Fleeing Drugs, Violence

Most of the kids are teenagers. They are temporarily cared for in shelters and group homes. Most are from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.

Many say they are fleeing violence from gangs and drug dealers. They are also trying to get away from abuse, sometimes by their own family members.

Others are trying to break free from poverty and get a better life in the United States. Or they are trying to reunite with family members already here. In many cases, they crossed mountains and deserts, often relying on guides to get to the United States. Those guides are nicknamed "coyotes."

Whatever the reason, the rise has been huge. In a typical year, federal authorities handled between 7,000 and 8,000 unaccompanied children. The total was 13,625 in 2012. The government estimates that could climb to nearly 24,000 within the next year.

Housing these children and caring for them while their cases get worked out is not cheap. The growing cost of the program also comes at a time when lawmakers are looking to change immigration rules.

## Military Bases To Emergency Shelters

At one point last year, the federal government used military bases in Texas to house the overflow of immigrant children who had no guardians.

People on the side of the immigrants say the federal government worked hard last year to open several emergency shelters. The temporary shelters are now gone, replaced with an additional 1,300 beds in licensed homes and other buildings, mostly in Texas.

A decade ago, the United States would have tried to deport children who immigrated on their own. New laws passed after 9/11 gave ORR the responsibility for caring for and placing these children.

The shelters that house the children are better than the government centers for adult immigrants who arrive without permission. The kids in the shelters get to wear jeans and T-shirts. They do not wear the jumpsuits worn by many adults in federal immigration centers. Children younger than 12 are placed in smaller residential-type centers. They receive education and medical services.

"But it's still a shelter," said Jessica Jones with the Women's Refugee Commission. "It still feels like detention to them," she said.

Almost two-thirds of these children from 2008 to 2010 were finally placed with sponsors living in the United States. The ideal sponsor is a family member. But some go to licensed programs willing to accept legal responsibility of a child, such as shelters for homeless youth.

## Keeping Track?

Advocates worry the government is not paying enough attention to the sponsors because of the extra cases. They need to make sure that the family members or friends can take care of the children and that the home is suitable. Some worry that many children are being released to people who claim to be the parents but are not.

ORR also is not required to do background checks. Nor is the agency's staff required to do a "home study" that includes a personal visit to the sponsor.

"A sponsor is just part of the equation," said Kristyn Peck, associate director of children's services at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. "Assessing the home environment is equally important."

Once the children are placed with sponsors, the federal government often loses track of them. "No one really knows what is happening to these children. When these children are released to these family members, there is very limited support for them," said Kimberly Haynes, director of children's services for the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.
