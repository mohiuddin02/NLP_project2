Rickman was best known for playing professor Severus Snape in the "Harry Potter" movies. He died early Thursday in London. 

## A Bad Guy Who Was Fun To Watch

In the "Potter" movies, Daniel Radcliffe played the part of teenage wizard Harry Potter. Radcliffe said Rickman was "undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with." The two actors appeared together in eight "Harry Potter" movies. 

Rickman was born in London in 1946. He learned to act at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. 

In his movies Rickman often played evil, wicked people. Audiences had fun watching him act nasty.

Rickman appeared in many movies. He had big parts in 1988's "Die Hard" with Bruce Willis, 1990's "Truly Madly Deeply" and 2003's "Love Actually."

## Professor Snape Of Hogwarts

However, Rickman was probably best known for playing Snape in the "Potter" movies. Snape is a professor of magic at the Hogwarts school. It is never quite clear whether he is an enemy or a friend of young Harry Potter. He may even be both.

Radcliffe was very young when he began working on the "Potter" movies. Rickman was one of the first to treat him like a grownup, he said. Radcliffe said he learned a great deal from the older actor. "I will carry the lessons he taught me for the rest of my life."

Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling said she was shocked to hear of Rickman's death. He was a great actor and a "wonderful man," she said.

## "Gloriously Nasty" In Robin Hood

Rickman also played the part of the Sheriff of Nottingham in the 1991 movie "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves." In that picture, he was Robin Hood's great and evil enemy. The movie is set in the Middle Ages.

Mohammed Saghir is the real-life Sheriff of Nottingham today. Saghir praised the way Rickman played the part.

"His sheriff was a gloriously nasty character," Saghir said. It was "easy to love to hate" him. Rickman "appeared to have great fun playing" the part, Saghir added.

## Nice In Real Life

Rickman did not only play evil characters, however. He also played heroes, and sometimes funny characters. He acted in plays as well as in movies.

Rickman was a very nice person in real life. However, sometimes he kept playing his part even when he was not on camera. During the filming of "Harry Potter," he kept on acting like Snape even during shooting breaks. He did not want to forget what the nasty Snape was supposed to be like.

"You're as polite as possible, but it's not always possible," he said in 2011.

Rickman left behind his wife, Rima Horton. The two were together for 50 years.
