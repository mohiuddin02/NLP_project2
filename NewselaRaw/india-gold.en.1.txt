NEW DELHI — The Jariwal household could barely contain its joy on a recent weekday afternoon as family members prepared for their oldest daughter's wedding: The invitations had been delivered, a venue chosen, hotel reservations made.

But there was the gold problem.

Gold is widely worn at Indian weddings. But it is far more than just a nice thing to wear. It's a key element of the religion and culture in a country that consumes 20 percent of global production of the precious metal. In India, it is a status symbol, a sign of respect, a hedge against tough times — and, of course, something to make the bride shine.

But the nation's swooning economy, marked by a sharp drop in its currency in recent weeks, has pushed gold prices sharply higher. That pain has been compounded by the government's decision to increase import duties on precious metals to 10 percent from 4 percent.

## Drops In Economic Growth And The Rupee

That's left people like Kusum Jariwal, proud mother of the bride, in a difficult situation. She has had to grapple with some intricate social engineering as the December wedding date looms.

For one thing, there'll be a single "not too weighty" gold necklace-and-earrings set for daughter Kanika, 25, rather than the two that Jariwal had planned. It also means a pendant rather than a chain for the mother-in-law-to-be. Plus, a ring and watch for the groom — can't really skimp there — from a well-known jeweler because his family is a bit brand-conscious.

"We have to buy more, but prices are crazy," Jariwal said. "We'll just have to make do with less."

The government's decision to increase the tax on gold just before the November-February wedding season indicates how worried Indian economic planners have become. And their concern is understandable: economic growth has plunged to 4.4 percent, less than half its 2010–2011 level. Fiscal deficits have soared and the trade deficit has hit 4.6 percent. India's stock market lost nearly $100 billion in value during August alone.

Meanwhile, the rupee's 16 percent decline against the dollar this year has made it among Asia's weakest currencies. This has forced Indians to pay more for gasoline, imported medicines, foreign trips and education.

## Foreign Reserves Dangerously Low

"India has become the sick man of Asia," said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist with IHS, a market information firm.

Adding to the bad-news drumbeat, the nation's foreign reserves — or monies in foreign currencies — have fallen to $280 billion. This is dangerously low because Indians use foreign currencies — most frequently the U.S. dollar — to buy imports, including essential commodities. The $280 billion is the equivalent of just seven months worth of imports.

To prevent further economic deterioration and shore up foreign reserves, the Indian government has begun selectively applying import taxes. Oil is India's largest import, but significantly increasing taxes on it could choke growth. So the government has aggressively targeted gold, the nation's second-largest import.

Economists consider gold a "nonproductive asset" that sits idle in safe deposit boxes rather than fueling growth. Thus, the government would be glad to see Indians expend less of the country's precious foreign reserves on gold.

But it's unclear whether the government can chip away at Indians' love of gold. Previous attempts to severely restrict or license its import have failed.

## Smuggling Gold In Body Cavities

Biswas predicts that the latest gold tax will only encourage smuggling and provide an opportunity for organized crime. Last month, two Sri Lankans were reportedly caught in western India's Goa state with several pounds of gold, valued at more than $10 million, in their body cavities. Customs officials had noticed them walking awkwardly.

In May, a jeweler died in a tunnel collapse after a witch doctor convinced him there was a mass of gold under his house.

It's tough to change a culture that believes gold should mark every phase of life, from birth to marriage to death, said Partha Nath Mukherji, professor emeritus of sociology at New Delhi's Institute of Social Sciences.

Evidence of India's love of gold is everywhere, from solid-gold furniture, cricket bats, idols, and temple doors to chain-mail shirts worth millions of dollars. Gold is enshrined in ancient Hindu legends as well as the latest marketing campaigns, such as those for 24K-gold-plated iPhones.

When Tata Motors wanted to draw attention to its Nano car model in 2011, it coated one of the vehicles with 176 pounds of gold and gems. The publicity it gained far outweighed the $3 million cost of the shiny stunt.

## Indians Won't Stop Buying Gold

In the Jariwals' colorfully decorated living room, three generations of women proudly displayed their gold earrings and necklaces in worn jewelry boxes.

Bride Kanika, who admits to being a "riot of emotions" right now, said she suggested the family stop obsessing about the gold, given all the added expense and stress. But her mother wouldn't hear of it.

On one point everyone in the family agrees: Indians will never stop buying the stuff.

"Two years ago, gold prices were way down," the mother said with a sigh. "Oh, how I wish I'd bought more. Why didn't I just go for it?"
