WASHINGTON — On Monday, the Supreme Court voted in favor of religious freedom. It told employers that they cannot refuse to hire someone because of his or her religion. Employers must accept and allow different religious practices, the court said. Religious discrimination — treating people differently and unfairly because of their religion — cannot be permitted in the workplace.

The justices were considering a case involving Samantha Elauf, who is Muslim. When Elauf was 17, she was rejected for a job at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch because she wears a headscarf. The girl accused the clothing store chain of discriminating against her simply because she is Muslim.

The justices ruled in her favor, by a vote of 8 to 1.

## Store Managers Wanted A Certain "Look"

Elauf wore a black headscarf to a 2008 job interview for a sales position at an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store in Oklahoma. She was turned away because managers thought her scarf would clash with the company's image.

In its defense, the company said it wanted all its sales staff to have a certain "look," which did not include wearing a headscarf. It also said Elauf had never informed it of her religion. She did not bring up her need for accommodation — adjustments to usual practice — based on her faith, the company said.

However, in the courtroom Monday, Justice Antonin Scalia dismissed the company's claim. The store's managers must have known or "at least suspected" that Elauf wore the headscarf for religious reasons, he said.

Scalia said the Civil Rights Act of 1964 puts the legal burden on employers not to discriminate. It gives "favored treatment" to religion, he said, and "religious practice is one of the protected characteristics ... that must be accommodated."

The majority of the Supreme Court members ruled that it did not matter whether Elauf told the company of her need for religious accommodation. The problem was that the company avoided making accommodations.

## Decision Could Have A Major Impact

Experts in workplace discrimination said the decision could have a major effect.

"This case dramatically changes the standards that apply to employers," said Michael Droke, a Seattle lawyer. From now on, employees and job seekers will no longer have to request a "religious accommodation." Such accommodation will be the employer's responsibility, whether it is requested or not.

The court's decision was welcomed by a wide variety of religious groups.

Carlene Benz, a spokeswoman for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, denied that the company had discriminated against Elauf. She said the company allows workers to wear headscarves when requested for religious reasons.

Benz said the chain has a new dress code. Employees are now allowed to be more "individualistic" in their attire.

Law professor Richard Garnett said the court's decision reflects the nation's broad support for religious liberty. Religious freedom is an issue "every day, not just on holy days, and in all aspects of life, including work," he said.

## France Has Less Support For Religious Freedom

The broad support for religious freedom in the United States is in sharp contrast to the situation in France. In that country, courts have sought to keep religion out of public spaces and schools. Last year, a French court upheld the dismissal of a Muslim day care employee for refusing to remove her headscarf at work. A law banning the wearing of full-face veils in public was introduced in 2010.

The U.S. Constitution forbids the government from interfering with the "free exercise of religion." In addition, several federal laws forbid discrimination based on religion.

Monday's ruling was the second one this year in which a Muslim plaintiff prevailed. In January, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of a Muslim man who is being held in an Arkansas prison. He had sought the right to keep a short beard even though the prison has a "no beards" rule.

Until recently, the 1964 Civil Rights Act has rarely been used as a protection against religious discrimination. The law is better known for banning racial discrimination by schools, colleges, employers and businesses.

The law says employers may not "refuse to hire" or otherwise discriminate against someone because of their "race, color, religion, sex or national origin."

## Employers Must Make "Reasonable" Effort

Religious claims do not always win, however. The law says employers must make a "reasonable accommodation" for an employee's religious practices. However, an exception is made for cases in which doing so would create an "undue hardship" for the business.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces the law, sued on Elauf's behalf. A federal judge ruled she was a victim of unlawful discrimination, and a jury awarded her $20,000.

However, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver then reversed the decision. It said the company was not liable because she did not ask for a special accommodation for her religion. The case was then sent to the Supreme Court.

On Monday, Justice Clarence Thomas was the only judge to vote in favor of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.

Thomas said the company's dress policy was applied evenly to the entire sales staff. Wanting a particular person to follow that policy does not amount to "intentional discrimination," he argued.
