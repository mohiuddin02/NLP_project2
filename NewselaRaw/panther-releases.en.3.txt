FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. â€” Reporters and photographers watched as a panther in a cage was put on the ground in the middle of the forest.

The big cat crept out of the cage, looked around, and then ran off down a dirt road. He disappeared into the forest. After 18 months of raising the orphaned animal, wildlife officials were setting him free.

It was a heartwarming scene that was reported in newspapers and on TV.

Nine months later the panther was dead. It's a common fate for male panthers rescued and released by Florida wildlife officials.

## A Shrinking Space

Panthers are also known as cougars or mountain lions. They live in the forests, prairies and wetlands of Florida. These big cats are carnivores that eat deer, wild pigs, birds and even alligators.

Experts believe there are between 100 and 160 panthers living in the wild. With so few wild panthers out there, the species is in serious danger.

"Every panther life is important," said Jennifer Hecker. She is the head of a Florida wildlife group. "You're dealing with one of the most [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered species) in the United States," she said.

A disaster like a fire or hurricane could kill almost all of the remaining big cats, she added.

One major problem for the Florida panthers is a shrinking habitat. New houses and shopping centers are pushing the cats into a smaller and smaller living area.

With limited space, the panthers face more dangers. Last year 15 were killed by cars and trucks. Three were killed by other panthers.

That is why Florida wildlife workers are trying so hard to rescue orphaned animals, raise them, and release them back into the wild.

## A Dangerous World

But panthers released into the wild have a hard time, especially the males. Most have died. Some were killed by other panthers. One was hit by a car. Others got sick and died.

The females released during that time have done much better. Many of them have survived and had panther kittens.

Many panthers have died after being released. But experts say the program is important, and that it's not just a  waste of money.

It's hard and expensive  work to rescue these animals. Injured panthers need medical care. Orphaned cats are taken to the White Oak Conservation Center. There, they will grow up with little human contact and learn to hunt on their own.

Many people who live or hunt in this area don't like the program because it adds more panthers to a small space.

They say there are many more panthers in the wild than people think. They also point out that panthers who have no space are coming into cities and towns.

Last week, the wildlife workers found a young male found near a local beach. They captured and relocated him to the wild.

"There's no place for them to go," said Shirley Harner of Boca Raton, Fla. She owns land with her husband near the panther habitat.

"They're running out of food, and they're getting desperate. That's why pets are being eaten. It's cruel to the cats, and it's dangerous to people," she said.

## A Short Successful Life

Still, officials hope to keep releasing panthers into the wild.

A few younger males have managed to defend themselves. Others head north away from danger, traveling almost 200 miles. They are likely looking for space of their own.

But every panther that survives helps the group become stronger, biologists say.

Even the panther that died after nine months can be seen as a success, said Mark Lotz, a scientist who studies panthers. The cat was a skilled hunter. It killed a coyote on his first night in the wild and hunted enough prey after that to survive.

Officials discovered him sick and near death. He had scars on his face. This was evidence that he had survived fights with other panthers.

"He had been in a fight and survived," Lotz said. "He was 'man enough' to stand up to other panthers and walk away."
