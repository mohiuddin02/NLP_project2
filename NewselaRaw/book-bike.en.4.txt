In one Chicago neighborhood, a bicycle is parked in a playground. It's not just any bike. It's a book bike. Evanston Public Library's new book bike is motorized. It has a cart on its side. The cart holds about 50 books. Anyone can borrow them without going to the library.

Keiler Roberts sat with her 6-year-old daughter, Xia, last week at the playground. The two read together. Behind them, kids ran around playing hide-and-seek.

On Roberts' lap was a library book, "Thumbelina." On Xia's were two Barbie dolls ready to listen along. Roberts turned the page to show a glowing picture. Xia's eyes got wide. Her lips formed an "oh" of surprise.

"Wouldn't that be something?" Roberts said, "If you opened up a flower and a little girl was inside?"

The mother and daughter were delighted by the book bike.

## It's Easy To Get A Book

Librarian Jill Skwerski rides the bike to parks. People can come up to the bike to sign up for library cards. They can also check out books on the spot. The cart has books on many subjects.

Borrowing a book is fast and simple. Sophie Levy, 6, looked into the cart of books. She saw her favorite book, "Happy Pig Day!" by Mo Willems.

Sophie's mom, Christine, then pulled out a library card. She gave it to Skwerski. The librarian opened her laptop. She typed in the library card number. Sophie read the book's call number to her.

In less than a minute, Sophie had her book.

## The Book Bike Makes People Happy

The library hopes the book bike will get more people reading. In some parts of Evanston, few people have library cards.

"The more people hear about the book bike, the more excitement it can generate," Skwerski said.

Margaret Lo was in the park with her two sons, Onyx, 3, and Alarik, 2. They also checked out Mo Willems books. Lo said the bike is easier than a trip to the library.

Once the school year starts Skwerski said she may visit schools in town. For now, the librarian is happy to visit playgrounds. It gives her the chance to see children's excitement to read.

"What a gift, that this is my job," Skwerski said.
