WASHINGTON â€” It's springtime, testing season for schools around the country.

Experts say that the number of standardized tests students take is growing. Many people argue that there are too many of them.

Lawmakers say they are getting lots of complaints.

## Power May Shift To States

This spring, Congress will discuss education as lawmakers attempt to rewrite a 2002 law. The No Child Left Behind law was intended to improve education in all schools. The law stated students had to be tested in reading and math every year. The purpose was to make sure that schools were teaching students what they were supposed to. The law included penalties for schools that did not.

An agreement in the Senate about the education bill might reduce the pressure on schools to test. The Senate is one of the two branches of Congress, which makes laws for the country. The agreement would give states, not the government, the job of making sure that schools are doing good work. Each state could decide what tests its students take. The agreement would also let states decide what to do about schools that are not good enough.

Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Patty Murray of Washington are on the Senate's education committee. They say an updated law "should produce fewer and more appropriate tests."

Congress still needs to vote on the agreement, which is still some time away. Meanwhile, complaints this year about the amount of testing have, if anything, grown greater.

"We need fewer, better and fairer assessments," said Susie Morrison. She is an official with the Illinois State Board of Education.

## Not All Tests Are Created Equal

Morrison is not against testing. She said that parents deserve to know how their children are doing in school. A large number of students graduate from high school but need special classes in reading and math before they go to college. Testing makes it clear what students know and do not know, she said. Then they can get extra help earlier in school.

But not all tests are equally valuable, Morrison said. "Some assessments used by local districts can and should go away, in our opinion."

Education Secretary Arne Duncan is in charge of the government's Department of Education. He wants the federal government to remain in charge of the testing. However, Duncan has said that students, parents and teachers do have a real complaint. There is too much testing, as well as too much time spent on preparing for the tests, he said.

North Carolina, Texas and Virginia have all reduced the number of tests.

## More Parents Push Back

Rosemarie Jensen is one of the leaders of United Opt Out. The group encourages parents to opt out of, or  refuse, standardized tests for their kids. She said there are more and more parents who are against the tests and keep their children from taking them. In Florida, she said, there are 26 opt-out groups alone.

Testing is not a good way to measure a child, said Jensen, a former teacher who has two children in high school.

"None of this has anything to do with better education," she said.

In her own family, Jensen said, her son is a good student but a poor test-taker, while her daughter does well on tests. Jensen said the tests say more about the students than the teachers.

"My son's (test scores) make his teachers look bad, and they work so hard with him," she said. "That's not fair."

Debbie Veney is with the Education Trust. The group helps students from poor families. She said too many tests repeat each other or do not test what kids are learning in school. Some of them are just not useful.

"However, are tests necessary? Absolutely,"  she said. Veney added that it is not enough just to see how students score on tests. Schools need to give help to kids who are not learning the things they should be learning.
