LOS ANGELES â€”Theme park rides come and go. But a simple boat ride at Disneyland has stayed popular longer than most.

It's a Small World is turning 50 years old. Walt Disney himself first imagined the ride in the early 1960s. The World's Fair was coming to New York. Disney was asked to design something for the fair.

Disney wanted a happy and hopeful ride. He imagined dolls dressed in old-fashioned clothes from different countries singing a happy song.

## Its Message Of Peace

Brothers Richard and Robert Sherman wrote the song as a message of world peace.

Rolly Crump helped design the ride. He likes the ride's hopeful theme and detailed artwork.

"The technology today is burning people out," he said. "This ride is so simple, so clean."

Small World has been copied at other Disney parks. Visitors can take the same boat ride in Florida, Japan, France and Hong Kong.

In 2009, Disney changed the ride at Disneyland in California. It added new Disney songs. Characters, such as Ariel, Nemo, Woody and Tinker Bell, also appeared.

These changes angered some people. Some fans wanted Small World to stay the same. Still, the ride remained popular.

## "It Tells A Story"

Kim Irvine works as a designer for Disney. She said Small World riders see the world through the eyes of children.

"It tells a story that everyone would love to believe in," she said.

Cindy Oporto recently took her young son Logan on the ride for the first time.

"He likes the singing and the animals," she said.

Next up for the respected ride: a movie. Jon Turteltaub is directing it. He called Small World innocent and sweet.
