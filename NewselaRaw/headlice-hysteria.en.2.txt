LOVELOCK, Nev. — Deborah Pontius, who lives in the isolated central Nevada town of Lovelock,  is chief nurse for her school district's 600 students. Over the years, she's come to know one particular pest quite well: head lice, those grayish-white insects that suck blood from the scalp and cause terrible itching.

For years, checking for lice eggs was one of her duties. On some days, she'd actually pick through the hair of students found with live head lice.

But something bigger bugged her: the district's policy of sending children home when they were infested with head lice.

Pontius saw students with head lice miss weeks of school. And getting permission to return to class was difficult: Students couldn't come back until parents could prove that not a single bug remained on a child's head.

## Keeping Lice-Infested Students In Class

Aside from the "ickiness" of lice, Pontius wondered, was there a reason to isolate the youngsters?

To find out, Pontius consulted some experts. She contacted the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC), a government agency that works to stop outbreaks of major illnesses. She also got in touch with the American Academy of Pediatrics, a group representing doctors who treat children. She also interviewed families of students who had lice.

It turned out that in most cases students hadn't gotten the bugs while in the classroom. Furthermore, lice don't fly or jump, and need close bodily contact to spread. So it seemed reasonable that students being treated for lice could remain in class without risk to others.

Pontius persuaded the district to change its rules. A growing number of school districts have since followed her district's lead.

With Pontius co-writing the new guidelines, the National Association of School Nurses changed its position. It now suggests allowing students with head lice to stay in class.

But Pontius, 55, knows the battle isn't over.

Parents complain about not being warned by schools when a student is found with head lice. Not knowing, they say, leaves them without tools to fight infestation. So far, one New Jersey district has signaled it may bring back the lice ban.

## New Rules Cause Conflict

It's unclear how many districts nationwide have chosen to go with the new less-restrictive lice policies. But Nevada offers a hint: Of 14 counties with chief school district nurses, four have eased their rules on head lice since 2011. Others are cautiously considering the move.

"We know people will overreact," said Sheila Story, chief nurse for the Carson City School District. "Head lice just gets everyone overexcited."

Even in Lovelock, the new rules have caused conflict among parents, teachers and the school board.

Head lice policy, Pontius said, is one of the most controversial issues school boards have to deal with. "The best I can hope is that people accept that this condition isn't worth taking a child from school. What people really want is for the lice to go away, and that's not going to happen."

The CDC estimates that each year 6 million to 12 million U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 11 are infested by lice. The bugs crawl among children during sleepovers, play groups and other such activities involving close contact. The wingless insects live their entire lives on human scalps. They feed on blood and attach their eggs to hair follicles. Fortunately, they do not carry disease.

Under Lovelock's guidelines, Pontius calls the parents of students with lice and recommends chemical treatments. She does not send a general notification letter to other parents for fear of causing panic.

## "Lice 101" Fact Sheet

Pontius also gives out a fact sheet she calls "Lice 101: Everything You Really Didn't Want to Know About Lice." She and the others who worked on the new National Association of School Nurses policy jokingly called themselves "nit-pickers" and "lice ladies." Humor, they say, takes the edge off what they think is an overblown health scare.

But Pontius hasn't been able to get rid of the idea that head lice are a sign of bad parenting. "With even the mention of head lice, people itch — they scratch their heads," she said. "Many mistakenly see the bugs as signs of a dirty home."

Shea Murphy, principal at Lovelock Elementary School, at first opposed Pontius' plan, but has changed her mind. "We've taken the hysteria out of head lice," she said.

Pockets of resistance remain, however. Lovelock teacher Dana Montes calls lice a classroom nightmare. "One girl, all she did was sit there picking out the lice and putting them on the desk." She believes the bugs move among hats and coats on racks or among students working in close quarters.

That's how she got a case of head lice from a student six years ago: "I leaned over her at the reading table and saw lice in her hair. Then one dropped onto the desk. By then it was too late."

The bugs are gone, but not forgotten. "When I die and go to heaven," Montes said, "the first question I'm going to ask God is: 'Why did you create lice? What was that all about?' "
