BEIJING, China — Some residents took a smog holiday away from Beijing on Tuesday. They wanted to be elsewhere as the Chinese capital launched its first red alert for pollution. Schools closed, factories suspended their work and half of all vehicles were kept off the streets. 

This wasn't the worst smog the city has seen in recent years. However, it was the first time pollution has triggered a red alert. Under the 2-year-old system, a red alert is required when there is a forecast of at least 72 straight hours of high pollution. 

Beijing's hazardous smog has persisted despite the Chinese government's promise to clean up the pollution left from years of rapid growth. China has been developing at breakneck speed, building new cities and factories across the country. Most of the smog is blamed on coal-burning power plants. Vehicle emissions, construction and factories are also to blame.  

"This is modern life for Beijing people. We wanted to develop, and now we pay the price," Beijing office worker Cao Yong said during a break from work.

## Some Residents Plan Time Away

A gray, soupy haze surrounded Beijing's buildings. Convenience stores sold air-filtering masks at brisk rates. Health-food stores promoted pear juice as a traditional Chinese tonic for the lungs.

"And air purifiers at home are a must," Beijing resident Sun Yuanyuan said at a juice shop.

Under restrictions in effect Tuesday through Thursday, schools closed. Some residents grumbled about the disruption. A few international schools sought permission to reopen Wednesday.

A large number of Beijingers said via social media they planned to escape the gloom. They would need to travel relatively far, however, because nearly all of China's northeast was affected. Many cities — including nearby Shijiazhuang — were even worse than Beijing.

## Readings Soar To Dangerous Levels

After hearing of the school closings late Monday, Beijing resident Jiang Xia booked tickets for a 3,200-kilometer (2,000-mile) flight to Kunming. It's a relatively clean city in southwestern China. She brought along her 8-year-old daughter who she said suffers nosebleeds in the smog. She said in an interview from Kunming that they quickly packed before dawn Tuesday for their flight.

"But when we arrived in Kunming and breathed in this clean, fresh air, I was very glad I made this move," Jiang said.

Readings of dangerous air particles climbed above 300 micrograms per cubic meter in some parts of the city Tuesday. They were expected to continue rising before improving Thursday. The World Health Organization is the public health agency of the United Nations. The WHO says the safe level for the tiny, poisonous air particles is 25.  

## Smog Usually Worse In Winter

This city of 22.5 million people is putting several restrictions in place to reduce the dust and other particles in the air. Besides suspending factory operations, use of a car is restricted to every other day. Officials planned to deploy extra subway trains and buses to help people get around.

Some businesses closed and others said employees could work from home during the alert.

A Beijing resident who gave only his surname, Du, said he was taking advantage of a lack of crowds near the capital's ancient Forbidden City. He strolled around while taking photographs.   

"I like this kind of haziness. It gives a blurry feeling and makes you feel like you're in a dream," Du said.

Beijing's air improved in the first 10 months of the year compared with the same time last year, but it has suffered two recent long periods of severe smog. The condition is typically worse in the winter. Last time, levels of dangerous particulate matter climbed as high as 976 in some locations. A red alert is required when there is a forecast of 72 straight hours of pollution levels of 300 or higher on the city's air quality index. 

## Study Links Early Deaths, Pollution

Previous stretches of severe smog have lasted more than three days but without any red alert. At the time, authorities said they did not issue an alert because the early forecasts were not as extreme. However, critics say officials avoided the toughest restrictions so people would not get angry at their political leaders.

China's polluted air has had severe health effects. A study this year estimated 1.4 million people each year die prematurely because of China's pollution.

China is the world's biggest carbon emitter. Carbon is emitted into the air mostly when oil, coal and natural gas are burned. China plans to upgrade coal power plants over the next five years. Even then, it says emissions will keep rising until around 2030 before starting to decline. Charcoal briquette-burning ovens that were once a major contributor to pollution are now much less common in Beijing. In the countryside, they are still widely used.

Emissions standards have been tightened and the government is spending money on solar, wind and other renewable energy. China, however, still depends on coal for more than 60 percent of its power.
