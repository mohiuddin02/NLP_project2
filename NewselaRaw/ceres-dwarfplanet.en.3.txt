Ceres is a small and mysterious object located between Mars and Jupiter. The icy, rocky world will soon be explored up close for the first time.

NASA's Dawn spacecraft is currently heading toward Ceres. By March 6, it will have drawn close to Ceres. It will then begin to carefully map Ceres' surface.

Ceres is round and roughly the size of Texas. Because it is so small, it is not considered to be a regular planet. Instead, it is what scientists call a dwarf planet.

## Check Out Those Spots!

The only pictures of Ceres scientists already had were taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2004. Hubble's pictures are very blurry, though.

The Hubble pictures do show something interesting, however: a few bright spots on the surface of Ceres. Scientists are very curious to figure out what these are.

Dawn is already taking its own pictures of the dwarf planet from far away. The latest pictures were taken from a distance of 28,000 miles.

The new pictures are much clearer than anything Hubble took. Scientists can now see the bright spots more clearly.

The bright spots are actually quite dark compared to what we would consider bright here on Earth. They are called bright spots only because they are far brighter than the rest of Ceres. Most of the dwarf planet is blacker than coal.

## Icy Volcanoes? Maybe ...

No one knows for sure what the bright spots are. They seem to be ice. One theory is that they are splotches of water ice erupted by ice volcanoes. Another is that something collided with Ceres and left ice there.

If Ceres has ice volcanoes, then it must have a lot of water beneath its surface. Scientists would find that very interesting. A planet with large amounts of water is more likely to have life on it.

Ceres is not like asteroids that are "a dead potato just being smacked around by its neighbors out in space," says scientist Mark Sykes. "There is a lot happening on this object."

Dawn will not actually land on the surface of Ceres. It will remain around 250 miles above the dwarf planet. It will circle the entire globe repeatedly and will produce detailed maps.

## Could There Be Life?

Scientists will want to take a much closer look at Ceres if they decide life is possible there.

They could send another spacecraft there in the near future, Sykes says. Such a spacecraft could "go down to one of these spots." It could "scoop up soil, take a look and ask whether there are any dead bugs in there."

But, Sykes says, "It's too early to say whether this stuff is there." Still, he is very excited by the idea that life may soon be found on the tiny dwarf planet Ceres.
