A new law would allow guns in churches, airports and schools.

Its official name is the Safe Carry Protection Act.

But anti-gun groups call it the "guns everywhere bill."

In March, Georgia lawmakers passed the gun bill. It is waiting for the governor's signature. If it's signed, it will become a law. The bill has attracted national attention because it lets people carry guns in so many places.

The National Rifle Association is the national pro-gun group. The NRA wants people to be able to own and carry guns. The group called the bill a "historic victory for the Second Amendment." The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right to own and carry guns.

## Who Gets To Carry Guns?

Americans for Responsible Solutions is an anti-gun group. It opposes people owning and carrying guns. The group says Georgia has gone gun crazy. It called the bill the most extreme gun bill in the U.S. The group was founded by Gabrielle Giffords. She is the former Arizona congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting.

Recently, a number of states have loosened up on gun control laws. The laws were passed after people were shot by guns. But instead of making guns less available, the laws make guns more available.

But perhaps no state is making guns as available as Georgia.

The proposed Georgia law would let gun owners take weapons into churches. The church leaders would have to allow it, though. People could carry guns into airports and government buildings.

It would also let schools give guns to teachers.

## The Gun Bill's Big Support

"You're not going to stop crime by (taking guns away from) good people," said Jerry Henry. He is with GeorgiaCarry.org. GeorgiaCarry.org supports the gun bill. Pro-gun groups say that "good" people need to carry guns. They say this stops "bad" people from committing crimes.

Gun control groups want to stop the Georgia bill. If they stop Georgia, they think they can stop pro-gun laws in other states, Henry said.

Georgia Governor Nathan Deal hasn't said whether he will sign the bill. But many think the governor will sign it.  He has gotten good marks from the pro-gun NRA. He is also up for re-election. The bill is popular in Georgia.

The bill was supported by state Senator Jason Carter. Carter is former President Jimmy Carter's grandson. He is also running for governor.

Police are preparing for a big change. They are worried about gunfights breaking out in public places.

Christian churches in Georgia don't agree about the bill.

Francis J. Mulcahy is with the Georgia Catholic Conference. He doesn't like the bill and is worried that more people would get shot.

## Good Guys Vs. Bad Guys

Rob Wright and Scott Benhase are the heads of Georgia's Episcopal Church. They said it's hard to keep guns out of the hands of bad guys. It can be hard to know who the bad guys are. Legal gun owners carried out most of the recent shootings in schools and churches. They also had no history of committing crimes.

"They were 'good guys' until they weren't," Wright and Benhase said.

Mike Griffin, though, supports the bill. Griffin is with the Georgia Baptist Convention. He said that churches should be able to set rules for themselves.

"Georgia Baptists are not saying that they're for or against weapons being in churches," he said. "They're saying (that) churches should have the right to determine if they choose to have weapons."

A poll in January found that support for gun control is dropping.

Adam Winkler is a University of California professor. He said the Georgia bill "shows how strong the NRA is in some parts of the country."
