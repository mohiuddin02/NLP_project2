WASHINGTON â€” There are more homeless children in America than ever before, a new report said. About 1 in 30 children are homeless, a total of 2.5 million children. These children do not all live on the streets. Instead, they sleep at friends' apartments, in all-night restaurants or spend every night in a different motel.

Carmela DeCandia is with the National Center on Family Homelessness (NCFH). Her group prepared the report. She said the number of children without permanent homes is huge. Yet, the government is not taking the problem seriously enough.

## Many More Kids Are Homeless

In 2010, President Barack Obama announced a plan to end homelessness by 2020. The plan focuses on adults who are homeless. It is succeeding. The number of homeless adults is lower.

The number of homeless children, though, has nearly doubled since 2010.

Poverty, of course, is the great cause of homelessness. Homeless children usually belong to a family with a mother but no father. The mother often does not have much education. She usually is not working. Many of these mothers avoid going to homeless shelters for as long as possible. Some do not want their children to live in shelters. Others are are afraid the family will be split up.

"They are the group at greatest risk," DeCandia said.

These families easily become homeless, DeCandia said. Homes cost a lot. A person earning $8 an hour cannot afford even a small apartment.

## "Hidden Homelessness"

People are surprised that homelessness affects children so much, said Patricia Nix-Hodes. She is with the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. "People call it the hidden homelessness."

The hidden homeless do not live on the street, she said. Instead, they may move from place to place or stay with another family. They may also live in a homeless shelter.

According to the report, homeless kids are more likely to be hungry or sick. They are more likely to struggle in school and miss classes. They also are more likely to drop out of school.

Just over half of homeless kids are under age 6. About 1 in 4 homeless preschoolers are sad or have other emotional problems. For school-age kids, that number is 4 out of 10. Kids without homes also are more likely to be hit by adults, said Barbara Duffield. She is with the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth (NAEHCY).

## Teens On Their Own

Sometimes homeless kids are on their own. Other times they are separated from their families who also are homeless. Some homeless shelters receive money from the government. These shelters cannot turn away families with boys older than 10 or 12. Other shelters can and do turn them away, breaking up families. Teens are often left on their own.

Nix-Hodes of the Chicago homeless coalition has seen child homelessness go way up. Last school year, almost 60,000 school children in Illinois were homeless. During the 2008-2009 school year, there were about 30,000 homeless school kids.

Across the country, more than 1.1 million homeless children went to public schools three years ago.

## Some States Help More Kids

Year after year the child homeless problem gets worse, Nix-Hodes said. She called the increase in homeless children "shocking." School districts do not have enough money for the school and health services the children need.

Some states have been more successful in decreasing child homelessness. Two of them are Utah and Connecticut. These states have a plan to fight homelessness. They also spend money on housing for homeless kids.

"This report is a call to action for states," said Richard Bloom, a California lawmaker. He would like to see a better effort to end child homelessness in California. States need to do better to help kids at high risk for homelessness.

They must act now, Bloom said. Otherwise, they will create the next generation of homeless people.
