DALLAS â€” Everyone knows cigarettes are dangerous. Today, more and more young people smoke tobacco in a way that may be even worse.

Using a hookah, or water pipe, to smoke tobacco is becoming more common. More high school seniors are trying hookah. One in five young adults has smoked a hookah in the past year. With a hookah, a charcoal brick lights the tobacco. Then smoke passes through a water bowl. Finally, the user breathes the smoke through a tube.

Health experts worry that young people don't realize how dangerous this type of smoking is.

Dr. Thomas Eissenberg has studied the health effects of smoking hookah.

"There is no reason to believe that a water pipe is less dangerous than a cigarette," he says. "In fact, there is reason to believe it is more dangerous."

## Breathing Clouds Of Smoke

One puff from a hookah can give off as much smoke as one cigarette. Smoking hookah for an hour can give off as much nicotine and tar as a whole pack of cigarettes. There are 20 cigarettes to a pack.

Nicotine is the addictive chemical in tobacco. It is what makes people want to keep smoking. Tar contains carcinogens, which cause cancer.

Isaac Doss, 25, was sitting on the patio of Kush Hookah Lounge in Dallas. He inhaled from the hookah sitting in front of him. He breathed out clouds of smoke.

Doss has been smoking hookah for years. He started when he was 18 and in college.

"I smoked every weekend. I never considered how bad it would be for me," Doss said.

Packs of cigarettes have labels like "SMOKING KILLS." There are no warnings like that at hookah bars.

"If you go into a water pipe bar, there is nothing that tells you it's dangerous," Eissenberg says. Young people may think "It doesn't say it's dangerous, so it must be safe."

## "Not Good For You"

It's definitely not safe, new studies have shown.

Hookah smokers breathe in smoke harder and longer than cigarettes. It means that even more nicotine and carcinogens enter their lungs.

Hookah smoke also has high levels of carbon monoxide. It can cause brain damage and even death.

"If you know cigarettes are dangerous, then there is absolutely no reason to be smoking a water pipe," Eissenberg says. "Water pipe smoking will kill you also."

Farhad Ata owns Kush Hookah Lounge. He's been smoking hookah his entire life, but knows it's not healthy.

"It is still tobacco, no matter what," Ata said. "Your lungs are meant for air. Any type of smoke is not good for you, whether it's cigarettes or hookah."
