WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Barack Obama spoke to the nation on Tuesday in a State of the Union address. The speech is used to tell Americans his plans. It is also meant to tell them how the country is doing. This was Obama's last State of the Union speech.

Obama spoke to lawmakers in Washington, D.C. He also spoke to millions of Americans watching him on TV. He hoped his speech would change how he will be remembered as president. He wanted to share his opinion on the future.

In his speech, Obama asked Americans to keep believing in change. "Change" was part of his motto when he ran for president eight years ago. This year, there will be an election. The winner will replace Obama as the next president.

## A Big Problem

Obama faced a big problem as president. He had to work with two different political groups. The two groups are the Democrats and the Republicans. Lawmakers in the two groups often do not get along. They argue about which ideas should be turned into laws.

Obama is a Democrat. He warned the country that the election could bring more arguing. The Democrats and the Republicans both want to have a president who is from their party.

Obama did not mention the names of candidates, or people who are trying to become president. Still, he spoke about some of the things popular Republican candidates have been saying.

## They "Don't Look Like Us"

Obama warned against dangerous voices. Some candidates for president have called Muslims dangerous. Muslims follow the religion of Islam. Obama said these voices were urging Americans to not trust other Americans "who don't look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background."

The voices are afraid of a new enemy. It is called the Islamic State. The group is in the Middle East. Though the group claims to be Muslim, it is not. The Islamic State wants to hurt Americans.

Obama promised to destroy the Islamic State. He also said many Republicans make them sound more scary and strong. America is much stronger though, he said. Many believe that Obama is not doing enough.

## Looking To The Past And Future

Obama wanted the nation to look back at all he had done in office. He talked about creating jobs. He helped businesses grow.

Obama also wanted to look past his own time as president. He seemed to view his actions as a starting point. He wanted to think about the future.

Many Republicans did not like the president's address. Paul Ryan is an important lawmaker in Congress. Ryan said Obama did not explain how to solve the country's problems.
