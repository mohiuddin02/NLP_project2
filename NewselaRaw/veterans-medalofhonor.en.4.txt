WASHINGTON â€” On Tuesday, two dozen men who fought in war received the Medal of Honor from President Barack Obama. The Medal of Honor is the highest award given to Americans who fought in wars. Only the most courageous acts earn the medal.

The award ceremony took place at the White House. It was serious and tearful.

"As one family member has said, this is long overdue," Obama said. It was the single largest group of honored veterans since 1945. The veterans fought in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. The Medal of Honor was established during the Civil War. Since then, it has been awarded to more than 3,400 people.

Tuesday's presentation was special. It took many years for it to happen.

## Review Of War Records

In 2002, the government ordered a review of thousands of war records. The purpose of the review was to see if Latino and Jewish veterans had been skipped over for the honor because of their background or religion. It was thought that discrimination prevented them from getting the medal.

"I'm busting with pride," said Charles Baldonado, 77. His brother Joe R. Baldonado was among those honored. Joe Baldonado died at age 20 in Korea. He used a machine gun to drive back enemy troops. Grenades exploded around him. Eventually, he was killed by one.

Obama has awarded the Medal of Honor to young veterans of the war in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan). But Tuesday's veterans were different. Only three are still living. One was a 68-year-old retired postal worker. Another was a 72-year-old retired salesman and great-grandfather. The president noted that the third, a 76-year-old retiree, enjoys mowing the grass for his neighbors.

"Jose is such a humble guy," Obama said of Jose Rodela. "He did not even mention this ceremony to his neighbors." Obama said he thinks they would be "pretty shocked to turn on the news tonight."

The military hasn't said which veterans experienced discrimination. But in his remarks, the president spoke of setting wrongs right.

"No nation is perfect," Obama said. "But here in America, we confront our imperfections and face a sometimes painful past." He said that included recognizing "the truth that some of these soldiers fought and died for a country that did not always see them as equal."

## Acts Of Courage

Rodela and Santiago Jesse Erevia are both from San Antonio, Texas. They served in Vietnam. Melvin Morris of Port St. John, Fla., served there as well. They stood by Obama at the ceremony. A military officer described their achievements. Family members of the honorees who had passed away joined the president as well. Terrifying battle scenes were described.

"Their courage almost defies imagination," Obama said. Their acts included "manning their posts, some to their very last breaths, so that their comrades might live."

Not all of the veterans honored were Latino or Jewish. The review turned up some who got the Distinguished Service Cross. It's the second-highest military award. The military said some of them deserved the Medal of Honor instead. Details on all 24 veterans can be found at www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24/.

Obama called Erevia, Rodela and Morris personally. He told them on the phone that they would receive the honor. He also called family members of recipients who had died.

Morris, 72, was one of the nation's first Green Berets. The Berets are a small group of special forces. They handle important and difficult missions. Obama said that when he called Morris, "his first reaction was, 'Oh, my God, what have I done?' When I told him it was all good, the Medal of Honor, I could hear through the phone he almost passed out."
