KABUL, Afghanistan â€” Kabir Mokamel is an artist in Kabul.

Mokamel paints on the concrete walls that line the streets. The walls protect buildings from bombs. Afghanistan has been at war for almost 40 years.

Mokamel's pictures show the problems caused by wars.

## A Different Kind Of Hero

He calls his group the Art Lords. He named it to criticize the country's warlords. They are military leaders, but people think they are heroes.

Mokamel has a different idea of a hero. For him, people who clean the streets are heroes. They help make the city better.

Mokamel's artists painted a picture of street sweepers on a wall. The sweepers wore orange work jackets and scarves. Next to it, they wrote,"The Heroes of My City: The Street Sweepers." The words are written in large black letters. They can be easily seen by drivers in the street.

## Using Art To Help Heal Wounds Of War

Maryam Kohi comes every day to help paint. She said the walls are blocking the streets. They also make the city look like a prison. She said the city is dirty and officials are not honest. They take money for favors. The paintings show that people are against this.

Mokamel left Afghanistan when he was a teenager. People used to be trusting and friendly, he said. They have lost their trust because of the wars.

Mokamel hopes to help people treat each other well again.

Mokamel said some of the paintings are about healing the wounds of Afghanistan. A painting shows red hearts on a white wall. One heart is a balloon held by a little girl. Another heart is pulled in a cart. One other painting shows a red map of Afghanistan. It is covered with a Band-Aid.

## Keeping Eyes On Dishonest Officials

Mokamel began painting outside in July. He painted a wall in front of a government building. The picture showed a beautiful woman's eyes. They send a warning to officials who are not honest.

People were excited by the eyes. They immediately understood what they meant.

The arts are beginning to return to Afghanistan. Ordinary Afghans are poor, though. They have little chance to see art. Fans of the Art Lords come to help paint. Mokamel tells them it is important. The Art Lords are covering the ugly walls with beautiful paintings.
