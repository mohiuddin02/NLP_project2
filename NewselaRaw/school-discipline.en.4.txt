WASHINGTON  â€” On Wednesday, the U.S. government asked the nation's schools to make an important change. It called on them to stop sending misbehaving students to court.

Attorney General Eric Holder said "zero-tolerance" rules are often the problem. Because of them, the police end up being called.

Misbehaving students should end up in the principal's office, Holder said. They should not end up in a police station, he added.

But the problem is no t just about rules that are too strict, the government said. It's about race, too.

African-American students who misbehave are punished more than white students who misbehave. This happens even when what they have done is the same.

## More Police In Schools

Zero-tolerance rules became popular in the 1990s. Since then, they have led to more police in schools. Students are severely punished under the rules for things like skipping school, smoking or carrying a weapon. Students can end up with a police record.

David W. James is in charge of the Akron, Ohio, schools. He has been criticized for not suspending certain African-American kids. He said he just didn't think they deserved that punishment.

"We're supposed to be here for these kids," he said. Schools need to "work with them to find alternatives."

But Kansas City superintendent Jim Hinson sees things differently. He said his school system already does most of the things the government recommends. Hinson said the district does not have zero-tolerance rules. Except for students caught carrying weapons to schools.

"For carrying a weapon to school, yeah, you should probably be in serious trouble," Hinson said.

Overall, he said the government's claims were very unfair.

It's wrong to say that schools "are discriminating against kids," Hinson said.

## Some Schools Change Rules

But more and more people say the problem is real. Many teachers and principals agree that there are race-based differences. "Numbers don't lie. They are there," said former high school principal Beverly Hutton.

A new government study supports her claim. It found that black students were more than three times as likely as whites to be kicked out or suspended.

And what about cases where the police were called? More than half the time the students were black or Hispanic.

Hutton also pointed to an earlier study. The study showed that too many public school students in Texas were being severely punished. Nearly 6 in 10 had been suspended or expelled during middle school or high school.

These findings have led to changes around the country.

The Buffalo, New York, school district is one example. It adopted new rules aimed at reducing suspensions. It did this after a 15-year-old African-American boy died in a drive-by shooting in 2010. He had just left school after being suspended for wandering the halls.

The Fairfax County, Virginia, school board also made changes in 2012. It voted to soften punishments for possession of marijuana. This change came after the two students who had been severely punished killed themselves.

And in Miami last November, the school board agreed to get rid of zero-tolerance rules. Their goal was to stop kids from ending up in prison.
