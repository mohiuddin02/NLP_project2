Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio calls himself "the toughest sheriff in America." The Arizona lawman has made national headlines multiple times. He faces lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department and private citizens for allegedly singling out Latinos, a practice known as racial profiling. He launched an investigation into President Obama's birth certificate, and he published a biography called "Joe's Law" that included some controversial statements about Mexican-Americans.

Following the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy, officials all over the country are trying to figure out the best way to keep schools safe. Last week, Sheriff Arpaio put his own new school safety plan into action. He sent out his volunteer posse to patrol 59 schools in Maricopa County.

The posse is a group the sheriff assembled in 1993 to help with shopping mall thefts. Now, it is best known for its role in assisting the sheriff's workplace raids. The raids targeted immigrants who did not have documents to work in the U.S.

## Who Called The Posse?

Posse volunteers drive around school grounds looking for suspicious activity. They are not inside schools or even on school property. A lieutenant commander in the posse, Dennis Donowick, told The New York Times that when they are on patrol, posse volunteers look for someone they feel does not belong, such as "a guy in (a) trench coat in the middle of summer."

Most of the schools the posse currently patrols are in small, rural places the sheriff's office was already policing. School officials and parents were not asked if they wanted the volunteers.

Ann Donahue, a district spokeswoman, said that school officials heard of the sheriff's plans from the news, not from his office. She said school officials do not necessarily oppose the new plan, but that there are details that schools need to consider.

Sheriff Arpaio did not need extra money to finance the program because posse members do not get paid for working. They receive some basic training from the sheriff's department. Some volunteers are armed with automatic or semi-automatic weapons.

## Critics Question The Plan

The plan has its critics. Some wonder about the background of the volunteers and if they can be trusted. The posse includes military veterans and former police officers. However, a local television news investigation revealed that some posse members have criminal records, including assault and disorderly conduct charges.

Arizona State Representative Chad Campbell opposes the sheriff's plan. He has stated that he was not sure how effective officers could be by simply driving around schools and not interacting with administrators or teachers.

The sheriff says that publicity about the program will help prevent violent criminals from entering schools.

"This will be mainly a deterrent, prevention, that's why we're sending marked cars out there," Arpaio told The Arizona Republic. "But if we need to take action, we will."

## Armed Guards For Every School

The move by Sheriff Arpaio comes in a highly charged political climate. When President Obama made his new gun control plan public, he was surrounded by children who had written to him about gun violence. He vowed to convince the public to support better gun control laws. The plan would require universal background checks and would ban assault weapons. These are measures the National Rifle Association (NRA) opposes.

Instead, the NRA has called for armed police officers in every school in the nation. A new NRA ad aims to persuade the public to oppose Obama's plan. It asks, "Are the president's kids more important than yours? Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school."

The White House called the NRA video "repugnant and cowardly." Jay Carney, Obama's press secretary, said most Americans agree that a president's children should not be used as "pawns in a political fight." Secret Service agents protect the president's daughters. Their school has no armed guards on staff.

Sheriff Arpaio has said that he supports the NRA's plan for an armed officer in every school. He also says that his plan differs from the NRA's proposal. Its focus is on enhancing security in the area surrounding schools, not directly inside them.

The sheriff first spoke about his plan in December, shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. He told ABC/Univision in December that his plan was not up for debate. "It doesn't matter whether they like it or don't. I'm still going to do it. I can't imagine criticism coming when they're given free protection."
