WASHINGTON, D.C. – Major outbreaks of foodborne illnesses have more than tripled in the United States during the past 20 years. The germs most frequently involved have long been a source of trouble: salmonella, E. coli and listeria.

In the most recent five-year period — from 2010 to 2014 — these multistate outbreaks were bigger and deadlier than in years past. Together they caused more than half of all deaths related to contaminated food outbreaks, public health officials said Tuesday. A wide variety of foods were involved, including vegetables, fresh fruits, beef and chicken. Some foods had never been linked to outbreaks, such as the listeria-tainted caramel apples that killed seven people and sent 34 to hospitals in late 2014.

Just last weekend, a rash of E. coli cases in Washington state and Oregon prompted Chipotle to temporarily shutter 43 of its restaurants there. No deaths have been reported, but eight people have been hospitalized, according to Washington state health officials. At least 22 cases have been reported across the two states.

## Outbreak At Chipotle Traced To Tomatoes

The current outbreak follows one involving salmonella and tomatoes served at Chipotle locations in Minnesota, where more than 60 people reported getting sick in August and September. Kathleen Gensheimer, a senior Food and Drug Administration official in charge of food safety, said the restaurant chain's executives will soon meet with federal health officials. The goal is to "discuss what practices might be contributing" to the problem.

A new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) makes clear the danger of multistate outbreaks. The report identifies 120 multistate outbreaks, in two or more states, between 2010 and 2014. Although just a fraction of the more than 4,000 food-poisoning incidents reported during that period, the outbreaks accounted for 34 percent of hospitalizations and 56 percent of deaths.

## Larger Outbreaks With More Dire Results

CDC Director Thomas Frieden said the latest multistate outbreaks are more dangerous because they involve deadlier germs. Such outbreaks can be big and they can be fatal, he said.

Salmonella accounted for most of the illnesses and hospitalizations seen in recent multistate outbreaks. It was also the cause of the three largest outbreaks, which were traced to eggs, chicken and raw ground tuna.

Listeria killed the most people, however. It was responsible for 57 of the 66 deaths during the five-year period. A single outbreak of contaminated cantaloupe in 2011 killed 33 people.

## Imported Foods Faulted In 18 Outbreaks

Imported foods accounted for 18 of the multistate outbreaks. Foods from Mexico, including mangoes and papayas, were the leading source in those events, followed by foods from Turkey such as pine nuts, tahini and pomegranate seeds.

Regardless of an outbreak's scale, the effect can be significant. Contaminated foods sicken an estimated 48 million Americans annually, leading to 128,000 hospitalizations and about 3,000 deaths, the CDC said.

In September, the Food and Drug Administration finalized a new set of long-awaited food-safety rules. They will require U.S. food manufacturers to come up with detailed plans to identify and prevent possible contamination risks in their production facilities. The agency said it expects to finalize additional rules soon regarding the growing and packaging of produce, as well as requirements that imported foods meet U.S. safety standards. Most of the rules have not been put into place yet.

## Tracing Illnesses Back To Source Is Now Quicker

The CDC is also using new high-tech tools to track down the source of outbreaks faster. These tools allow CDC scientists to more carefully analyze and identify thousands of pieces of germ DNA. They are then able to link germs in sick people with the germs in contaminated food more precisely than was possible with the standard techniques. Officials say they have been able to solve some "cold cases" by finding contaminated food responsible for unsolved illnesses.

Such DNA "fingerprinting" played a key role last spring in a major incident traced to Blue Bell Creameries, the nation's third-largest ice cream maker. The company issued the first recall in its 108-year history after ice cream tainted with listeria monocytogenes, the bacteria that cause the infection listeriosis, was linked to illnesses and three deaths in Kansas and illnesses in Texas. The CDC was able to determine that cases dating as far back as five years ago were related to the outbreak.
