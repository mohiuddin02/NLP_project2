WASHINGTON, D.C. — Giant global food company Nestle SA has sold fish caught and processed by slave laborers in Thailand. The impoverished migrant workers were sold or lured by false promises to work under terrible conditions and with little to no pay.

This unusual disclosure comes from Nestle SA itself. In an act of self-policing, the corporation announced the conclusions of its yearlong internal investigation last week. Nestle hired the nonprofit organization Verite to look into its suppliers. Verite found virtually all U.S. and European companies buying seafood from Thailand are exposed to the same risks of abuse in their supply chains.

## Seafood Industry Slavery Confirmed

Nestle SA, based in Geneva, Switzerland, is among the world's biggest food companies. It launched the investigation in December 2014, prompted by reports from news outlets and nongovernmental organizations that tied brutal and largely unregulated working conditions to its shrimp, prawns and Purina brand pet foods. The investigation's findings echo reports from The Associated Press (AP) news service this year on slavery in the seafood industry. The AP reports have led to the rescue of more than 2,000 fishermen.

The laborers come from Thailand's much poorer neighbors Myanmar and Cambodia. Brokers illegally charge the impoverished migrant workers fees to get jobs, trapping them into working on fishing vessels and at ports, mills and seafood farms in Thailand. They are forced to work to pay back more money than they can ever earn.

"Sometimes, the net is too heavy and workers get pulled into the water and just disappear. When someone dies, he gets thrown into the water," one Burmese worker told Verite.

"I have been working on this boat for 10 years. I have no savings. I am barely surviving," said another. "Life is very difficult here."

## Nestle Says Reforms Are Imminent

Nestle said it would post the reports online, as well as a detailed strategy to solve the problem, as part of ongoing efforts to protect workers. It has promised to impose new requirements on all fish suppliers and will train boat owners and captains about human rights, possibly with rewards for changing their practices. Outside investigators will be brought in and a high-level Nestle manager will make sure change is underway.

"As we've said consistently, forced labor and human rights abuses have no place in our supply chain," Magdi Batato, Nestle's executive vice president for operations, said. "Nestle believes that by working with suppliers we can make a positive difference to the sourcing of ingredients."

Nestle is not a major purchaser of seafood in Southeast Asia, but it does some business in Thailand, primarily for its Purina brand Fancy Feast cat food.

## Workers Detail Irregularities, Abuses

For its study, Verite interviewed more than 100 people. They include about 80 workers from Myanmar and Cambodia, as well as boat owners, shrimp farm owners, site supervisors and representatives of Nestle's suppliers. Verite visited fish ports and fishmeal packing plants, shrimp farms and docked fishing boats, all in Thailand.

Boat captains and managers, along with workers, confirmed violence and danger in the booming Thai seafood industry, which exports $7 billion worth of fish a year. However, managers did say workers sometimes got hurt because they were drunk and fighting. Boat captains rarely checked ages of workers, and Verite found underage workers who were forced to fish. Workers said they perform labor without rest, receive barely any food and water and all outside contact is cut off. They also said that they are given fake identities to hide that they are working illegally. 

Generally, the workers studied by Verite were catching and processing fish into fishmeal fed to shrimp and prawns. But the group said many of the problems they observed exist throughout the industry and are not unique to Nestle. Migrant workers across Thailand's seafood business could be abused as they are recruited, hired and employed, Verite said.

## Anti-Slave Labor Group Applauds Disclosure

The company's disclosure is rare. While multinational companies in industries from clothing to electronics say they investigate allegations of abuse by their suppliers, they rarely share negative findings.

"It's unusual and exemplary," said Mark Lagon, president of the nonprofit Freedom House, an anti-slave labor organization in Washington, D.C. He added that corporate public relations and legal departments will not even say they are looking into a problem, because of the fear of lawsuits.

In fact, Nestle is already being sued. In August, pet food buyers filed a class-action lawsuit. It claimed that Fancy Feast cat food was the product of slave labor by Thai Union Frozen Products, a major distributor. It is one of several lawsuits filed in recent months against major U.S. retailers importing seafood from Thailand.

Some of the lawsuits refer to reports from the AP. The news service tracked slave-caught fish to suppliers of giant food sellers, such as Wal-Mart, Sysco and Kroger. It also found the fish in popular brands of canned pet food, including Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams. The seafood can turn up as calamari at fine restaurants, as imitation crab in a sushi roll or as packages of frozen snapper relabeled with store brands that land on dinner tables. The U.S. companies have all said they strongly condemn labor abuse and are taking steps to prevent it.

Nestle promises to publicly report its progress each year.
