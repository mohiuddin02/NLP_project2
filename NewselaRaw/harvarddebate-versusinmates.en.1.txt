BOSTON, Mass. â€” Months after winning a national title, Harvard's debate team lost to a group of New York prison inmates.

The showdown took place at the Eastern New York Correctional Facility. Convicts can take courses at this maximum-security prison, and even earn a degree from nearby Bard College. The courses are taught by faculty from Bard.

The inmates have formed a popular debate club. Last month, the Correctional Facility invited the Ivy League Harvard undergraduates, who are this year's national debate champions, over for a friendly competition. The Harvard debate team also was crowned world champion in 2014.

But the inmates are building an excellent reputation of their own. In the two years since they started a debate club, the prisoners have beaten teams from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York and the University of Vermont. The annual competition with West Point has even grown into a rivalry.

## Excellence And Exacting Standards

At Bard, those who help teach the inmates aren't particularly surprised by their success.

"Students in the prison are held to the exact same standards, levels of rigor and expectation as students on Bard's main campus," said Max Kenner, executive director of the Bard Prison Initiative, a program in six New York prisons that is designed to improve inmates' lives through education. "Those students are serious. They are not condescended to by their faculty."

## Outsmarting Harvard

Against Harvard, the inmates were asked to defend a position they opposed: They had to argue that public schools should be allowed to turn away students whose parents entered the United States illegally. The inmates brought up arguments that the Harvard team hadn't considered.

Three students from Harvard's team responded. The Harvard debate team argued in favor of requiring U.S. public schools to admit students whose parents came into this country without permission.

A panel of neutral judges declared the inmates victorious.

"The fact that we won is nice, but it isn't the most important thing," said Kenner, adding that the club is meant to help students express what they've learned.

## Praising The Prisoners

Students on the Harvard team posted a comment on their team's Facebook page shortly after the loss.

"There are few teams we are prouder of having lost a debate to than the phenomenally intelligent and articulate team we faced this weekend," they wrote. "And we are incredibly thankful to Bard and the Eastern New York Correctional Facility for the work they do and for organizing this event."

## Learning Without the Internet

Inmates can earn various degrees through the initiative, which is taught mostly by Bard faculty. About 15 percent of the all-male inmates at the Eastern New York Correctional Facility in Napanoch are enrolled.

Some graduates of the program have continued their studies at prestigious universities like Yale and Columbia, Kenner said. Harvard, Yale and Columbia are among the eight U.S. private colleges and universities - all on the East Coast - that make up the Ivy League. These schools are famous for their academic excellence and history. Seven of these eight schools were founded before 1776, the year of the American Revolution.

While in prison, the inmates learn without the help of the Internet, relying instead on books and other resources provided by Bard College.

"They make the most of every opportunity they have," Kenner said.
