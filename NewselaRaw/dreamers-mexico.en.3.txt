MEXICO CITY — For so long, Nancy Landa kept secrets.

Her family moved from Mexico to the United States illegally when Landa was 9 years old. Growing up in South Los Angeles, she never told friends her family secret. Because she was not a U.S. citizen, she knew that she could be kicked out of the country at any moment. If this happened, she would be sent to Mexico.

Landa was a hard worker and a successful student. In college, she was elected to be the first-ever Latina student body president. After graduating, she went on to work in government. All the while, she kept her fears about getting sent back to Mexico to herself.

Her secret caught up to her in 2009. Government officers forced her to leave the U.S. They dropped her off in Tijuana, Mexico, by herself. Landa knew no one there.

## "Los Otros Dreamers"

Her new life was hard. She had spent most of her life in California, and America was what she knew. Landa was not alone, however. She was one of many people who grew up in the U.S. but were forced to return to Mexico. Now, these returnees are joining together and speaking out.

They call themselves "Los Otros Dreamers," which means "the other Dreamers" in Spanish. The "Dreamers" are young migrants in the U.S. who are fighting to stay. Landa is one of the "other" Dreamers — someone who has already been kicked out and is now fighting for a chance at a better life.

Los Otros Dreamers are trying to make a number of changes to the way returnees like them are treated. For example, they met with Mexican officials to try to make it easier for returnees to get new ID cards. The group is also trying to make it easier for students to continue their education in Mexico.

## Hired For Perfect English

Los Otros Dreamers formed a couple of years ago with the help of Jill Anderson. She is an American professor doing work in Mexico City. She became interested in people like Landa when she noticed something strange about a call center near her house.

Call centers provide telephone services to help customers with their products. If your Internet doesn't work, for example, you can call in and speak to someone at a call center about the problem.

The person who answers could be anywhere in the world. Many American companies set up call centers in other countries in order to save money. The call center near Anderson's home was unusual, though. The workers there dressed in American clothes and spoke English with Southern California accents. They seemed American.

Anderson began a study of call centers and found that many of the workers in Mexican call centers were people who grew up in the U.S. Their perfect English made it easy for them to help Americans over the phone.

## Teased For "Broken Spanish"

Her study of the call centers made Anderson more curious. She began studying what life was like for people returning to a country that they had little or no memory of. Some were teased for their American accents or broken Spanish. Others had trouble joining communities that were foreign to them.

Landa experienced problems like these in her first months in Tijuana. She also had difficulty finding work. Her American college degree was of little help in Mexico. Eventually she found a job at a call center. She was not allowed to return to the U.S.,  but all of the sudden she was spending all her time talking to Americans over the phone.

Last year, Landa saw a message Anderson had posted online. The message asked people who had been forced to return to Mexico to share their stories. Landa responded and, through Anderson, connected with Los Otros Dreamers.
