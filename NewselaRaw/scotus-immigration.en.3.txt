WASHINGTON, D.C. — People who move to the United States from other countries are known as immigrants. Our country is a land of immigrants.

Some immigrants move to the U.S. without permission. They manage to live and work here for years anyway. There is much disagreement over what should be done about them. 

Some say they should be sent back to their home country. Others say if they have been here long enough, they should be allowed to stay.

## Immigrant Children Complicate The Issue

The problem is particularly complicated when immigrants who are here without permission have children. If their children are born here, the children are U.S. citizens. The children have the right to live in the country.

Many people feel it is not right to break up families by deporting parents. Immigrants who are deported are sent back to their home country against their will. 

To avoid being deported, many immigrants here without permission try to hide from the government. It can be very hard for them to find a good job.

## Immigrants Could "Come Out Of The Shadows"

In November 2014, President Barack Obama announced a new government plan to deal with this problem. The plan is known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, or DAPA. It would make life easier for up to 5 million immigrants living in the United States without permission. It would allow them to work openly. 

In 2014, Obama said DAPA would allow people to "come out of the shadows and get right with the law." The plan mainly covers immigrants who have been in the United States more than five years. 

Twenty-six states challenged DAPA as soon as the president announced it. Texas soon took the lead. It and the other states got lower-level federal courts to block the plan. So far, DAPA has not gone into effect anywhere.

## Obama Says He Acted Because Congress Wouldn't

The wait could soon be over. On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to rule on whether DAPA should be allowed to go forward. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land.

The Supreme Court will decide whether to undo lower-court orders that blocked the plan. It will also decide if the president went too far with his executive power. 

The states say Obama did not have the right to introduce DAPA on his own. They say he should have gotten Congress to agree first. Congress makes our country's laws.

Obama says he acted on his own because Congress failed to do enough about the problem. 

The court will make its final ruling in June.

## Immigrant Activists Praise Decision

People fighting for immigrants' rights praised the Supreme Court for taking up the case. Senator Harry Reid said many immigrants live in "fear of being separated from their children. These families must be allowed to step out of the shadows." Parents should be able to work openly, Reid said.

The future of DAPA will be decided just as Americans are thinking about who will become president after Obama. Right now, around 15 candidates are running. Each belongs to one of two political parties.

## Political Parties Disagree On Immigration Policy

The two main parties are the Democrats and the Republicans. In a few months, each party will pick one person to run. In November, Americans will choose one of the two. The winner will become our next president. 

For months, the candidates have been arguing about immigrants. Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised to protect many immigrants from being deported.

Republican Donald Trump has the opposite view. He wants to deport all immigrants living in the United States without permission.
