A 400,000-year-old leg bone was found in a cold, damp Spanish cave called the "Pit of Bones." Most old bones found in Europe are from the Neanderthals. They're an ancient relative of humans who all died off thousands of years ago.

But this bone isn't from a Neanderthal. It seems to be from another old relative called the Denisovans. But we don't know much about them. They lived thousands of miles away in Siberia, a very cold part of Russia.

Modern humans are Homo sapiens. They don't come from Neanderthals or Denisovans, say scientists. But, they did live at the same time. And they may have made children together. About 30,000 years ago, the other groups died off. That left only us.

Scientists don't know why the bone is in Europe.

## Oldest Known DNA Of Human

"This really raises more questions than it answers really," said German scientist Svante Paabo. "It's a big surprise."

Paabo and his partners made the discovery.

They found out who the bone belonged to by getting DNA information from it.

The DNA is the oldest known material ever found from an early human. It beats the last record by roughly 300,000 years.

DNA holds the code for every cell in your body.  And it tells cells what to do.

But, the scientists don't have all the answers about this bone yet. They couldn't get the best kind of DNA information.

What they got was taken from cell mitochondria. They are tiny structures that make energy for the cell. They have far less information than DNA from a cell nucleus. The nucleus is the control center of the cell.

But, mitochondria doesn't break down fast. That makes it easier to study in old bones.

## Looking For Better DNA

The bone might be from a group that was related to both Neanderthals and Denisovans. Neanderthals might have gotten different DNA after the two groups split off.

Or, maybe this group actually had children with something much older, like Homo erectus. And maybe it got its DNA from them.

Humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans all came from Homo erectus orginally.

The scientists are trying to get better DNA from the bone.

But the scientists don't know that it will be a success. DNA breaks down into smaller pieces over time.

Older DNA samples have been gotten from other animals. Scientists got the DNA of a 700,000-year-old horse. But those remains were found in freezing conditions. That helped preserve them. Human remains haven't been found in such cold places.

## Few Fragments Of Bone

But, new technology could made it easier.

Bone remains can tell us what Neanderthals looked like. They were bigger than modern humans. They had more muscles and probably were more used to living in a rough and cold climate, Paabo said.

This is not the case with Denisovans, however. All scientists have are a piece of bone from a child's finger and two teeth. Those bone pieces were found in Siberia.

We have their DNA, "and we have two teeth, and those teeth are huge. The only thing we can say is they must have been very big, or at least had big mouths."

There are still plenty of questions about the bone. But still, scientists say it's a huge leap forward.

"This is positively exciting," said Andrea Manica, a scientist in England. It means that much older remains can be explored by looking at DNA.
