LOS ANGELES — Myths die hard. Especially when they are about a painting that helped give birth to a much-loved American art movement. The painting is Jackson Pollock's huge 1943 work "Mural."

"Mural" was something entirely new for American art. Nearly 8 feet high and 20 feet wide, it was covered edge-to-edge with lines and bold shapes. These lines and shapes didn't represent anything in particular — they were abstract. Still, the artist compared them to a stampede of mustang horses. The great painting did much to start the art movement called Abstract Expressionism. This movement began in New York City after World War II.

Abstract Expressionism was the first American art style to be famous around the world. For a time, it put New York at the center of the art world. Paris was usually the center. Abstract Expressionist painters didn't paint people, scenery or objects. Instead, they aimed to express feelings. They valued creating in the moment, without planning.

Pollock's painting can now be seen at the J. Paul Getty Museum.

## An All-Night Session ...

For years it was believed that Pollock painted "Mural" all at once. The usual story is that Pollock was unsure of what to do for months. He kept on staring at the blank canvas, day after day. Its blankness almost seemed to make fun of him. Then came a sudden burst of brilliant, all-night action and by morning, the masterpiece had been created.

Now, science has proven that that is not what really happened. We now know that the painting took many days to make. Maybe even several weeks.

Gallery owner Peggy Guggenheim asked Pollock to paint the work in the summer of 1943. She was planning a big Pollock show.

She wanted a painting that was four times bigger than anything Pollock had done before. He was probably a bit nervous.

The myth was that a day before the painting was due, Pollock still hadn't done anything. Just after the sun went down, he began to paint. He finished "Mural" after 15 tiring hours of work.

"I had a vision," Pollock later explained.

## ... Well, Not Really

But now we know for certain that story isn't quite right. This is thanks to the Getty Museum's careful study of the work's layers of paint.

Their examination shows something surprising: Pollock did the painting in several stages.

For the first stage, he placed wet paint on top of wet paint. The idea was to sketch out a rough idea of what he was aiming for. This may indeed have been done all at one time.

However, much of the paint was applied later. And the separate layers each required drying time. Some needed many days to dry.

More than 25 paints have been identified. That includes white patches of ordinary house paint — a surprise discovery.

## How Artists Really Work

So now we know that the story of the all-night painting binge is untrue. We can only guess why Pollock and others stuck to the tale. Perhaps they thought it made Pollock seem more special or manly during the war.

Which raises a question: Does knowing the real story make "Mural" a less important painting? And Pollock a less important artist?

The answer is no. In fact, the truth should make us appreciate Pollock even more.

The new discovery reveals something important: Pollock didn't paint in one mad burst. He worked hard to make sure all his ideas for the painting made sense. He slowly built up his great painting bit by bit over days (or weeks).

That may not match today's idea of the artist. We like to think that great ideas just come to artists, out of the blue and fully formed. But that's not how artists really are. Pollock was a real-life artist. He thought a lot about "Mural," and he worked very hard.
