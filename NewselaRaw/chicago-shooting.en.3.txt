CHICAGO — A gunman shot people at a basketball game in a Chicago park late Thursday night. He fired the type of gun used by soldiers. Thirteen people were injured, including a 3-year-old boy.

The shooting attracted the attention of reporters from around the world, not just the local press. They questioned whether the city had reached a new low. Chicago has been known to have many shootings, but not so many victims at once. And never with such a powerful weapon.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel was raising money on the East Coast when the shooting happened. He cut the trip short and flew back to Chicago.

The basketball courts at Cornell Square Park were soaked with blood. Bullet casings found were the kind typically fired from AK-47 assault rifles, a military weapon.

## Players And Spectators Wounded

Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said it was a miracle that nobody was killed.

"Illegal guns, illegal guns, illegal guns drive violence. … A military-grade weapon on the streets of Chicago is simply unacceptable," he said.

The park is in an area with a lot of gang activity. But it is not in a so-called impact zone, McCarthy said. Impact zones are flooded by officers to prevent crime. Cornell Square is protected only by occasional patrols. The park also closes at 11 p.m.

At least one gunman walked to the basketball court and opened fire 45 minutes before the park's closing time, police said. The 13 people hit included both players and people watching the game. Nobody was expected to die from their wounds.

Kevin Gordon, 31, said he was talking to his cousin when he was shot in the buttocks and fell to the ground.

"It was the longest seconds of my life. It felt like forever," Gordon said. "I was about to run but I couldn't. I could feel 'em whizzing by me. Then it stopped. I looked up and everything was over with. I'm like 'I'm hit.' I looked around; it was like everybody was hit."

## "It's Out Of Control"

Three-year-old Deonta Howard was shot near the ear, police and relatives said. The bullet exited through his cheek.

"They shot my baby with a gun that's bigger than him," said his mother Shamarah Leggett. "It's out of control."

Relatives said the boy's uncle was shot and killed over the Labor Day weekend.

"This gun violence has to stop," Leggett said. "It has to. My baby is only 3. How is he shot in the face with an army gun? Where are they getting army guns from?"

Police believe the shooting stemmed from an argument between two gangs. They did not know if any of the victims were the shooter's targets.

The first paramedics on the scene found more than a dozen people lying across the court. One person lay near a bicycle that was on its side. A pair of white gym shoes were left near an out-of-bounds line.

## Mayor Attends Prayer Gathering

Ambulances kept coming for nearly a half hour after the shootings. Wounded people were carried out on stretchers. They included a 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl. About 60 police officers swarmed the park and crime lab investigators combed the scene.

McCarthy repeatedly refused to say whether the shooting hurts the city's reputation.

"Every time somebody is shot in this city, it's a setback," McCarthy said. "But this is not a problem particular to the city of Chicago."

Emanuel spent 40 minutes at Mount Sinai Hospital, where he spoke with Deonta's mother. The boy was being prepared for an operation during the visit. The mayor did not speak with reporters, but later attended a prayer gathering where he urged people who live in the city to live by a "moral code."

"The parks in the city of Chicago belong to the families of the city of Chicago. The streets of the city of Chicago belong to the families of Chicago. The front stoops of our homes belong to the families of the city of Chicago," he told the crowd. "You go out there and you enjoy our city."

## One Victim Shot Three Times

The shooting came just days after the FBI released information showing that Chicago had more murders than New York in 2012. McCarthy argued Friday that the information was more than nine months old. He said it did not show the progress made in the city. The murder rate has dropped by one-fifth over the past year.

Mario Campbell was shot three times in the abdomen at the park. He had been worried about gang fighting in the past week, his mother Diane Cade said. The 25-year-old, who wants to become a cook, stayed inside most of the week but went to the park with friends to watch the basketball game.

"Out here it's hard for a boy, no matter what you try to do with your life, no matter how you try to change … it's hard," Cade said.
