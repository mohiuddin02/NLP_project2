BEIJING — Nearly every day in China, women go to work in smoke-filled offices. The fumes to which they are exposed come from cigarettes smoked mainly by male co-workers. After work is over, many go home to breathe in secondhand smoke created by husbands or other family members.

China is known as the Smoking Dragon, but its addiction to tobacco is not shared equally by men and women. According to the most recent national survey, 288 million men smoked regularly in China in 2010, compared with 13 million women.

The women are striking back. Last fall, China's State Council proposed the nation's toughest restrictions yet on indoor smoking and the advertising of tobacco. The announcement was a major victory for China's tobacco-control movement, which includes several women who have been on the front lines of fighting tobacco for decades.

"This is a very important step," said Yang Gonghuan, a doctor who has been documenting tobacco's toll on Chinese public health since the 1980s. "It is very difficult to push for these kinds of changes on a national level," she said. "It has taken many, many years."

## Battle Is Far From Over

Although China is known for its smog and other environmental problems, no public health issue poses more of a threat than tobacco. An estimated 1 million Chinese die each year from lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases.

China's anti-smoking movement includes many prominent men. For example, retired pro basketball player Yao Ming has lent his name to the cause.

Yet in government and among tobacco-control groups, women are leading the charge. China's health commissioner, Li Bin, has been outspoken in seeking a national indoor-smoking ban. Li sits on the State Council, a top-level panel that drafted the restrictions unveiled in November.

The battle against smoking is far from won, however. Although smoking rates have declined in recent years, more than half of Chinese men smoke regularly. Some 700 million Chinese — twice the population of the United States — are routinely exposed to secondhand smoke, which kills about 100,000 people there annually.

It is not entirely clear why so many women are driving China's tobacco-control movement, but cloud-filled rooms may be a factor. The issue of secondhand exposure is a big concern for women, many of whom are increasingly aware of the potential health effects on children.

## Women Used To Take Up The Pipe

The Chinese have smoked tobacco for centuries, and up until the early 1900s women regularly could be seen with men puffing on pipes. With the arrival of cigarettes, however, Chinese intellectuals and foreign missionaries started frowning on women who smoked. Female cigarette smokers were seen as overly modern and improper.

As a result, women quit smoking. At the same time, Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping smoked openly in public, encouraging the habit among men.

Today, China is the world's biggest consumer of tobacco. It is also the largest manufacturer, producing more than 2.3 trillion cigarettes yearly, nearly half the world's total. Unlike in the United States, private companies do not dominate the market. Instead, the government-run China National Tobacco Corporation controls nearly all the cigarette brands sold.

That puts the Chinese government in an unusual dual role: One arm of the government, the Health Ministry, tries to restrict tobacco use and warn of its dangers, while other government agencies benefit from tobacco's profits and taxes on cigarettes. Tobacco raised $120 billion for the government in 2012, about 6 percent of what the government brought in that year.

"This is why tobacco control in China happens so slowly," Yang said. "The tobacco industry is very powerful."

## Leaders Banned From Public Smoking

Smoking has remained common in public places across the country, particularly in rural areas, where half of the population lives. Large numbers of doctors in China smoke, and it was not until 2010 that the Health Ministry banned smoking in its own building.

In recent years, attitudes toward smoking have started to shift. Top Chinese leaders are either nonsmokers or are careful not to be spotted lighting up. Late in 2013, the government banned officials from smoking in public or giving cigarettes as gifts. Individual cities have enacted their own restrictions on tobacco.

The draft regulations unveiled in November, if enacted and enforced, would take China into another realm. The proposed rules would ban indoor smoking and make private businesses responsible for enforcing the ban, and subject to fines if they do not. They would further limit the advertising of tobacco in China and require larger warning labels on cigarette packs.

## Cultural Shift

Xu Guihua, of the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control, said enforcement of the rules would be all-important, and would require a shift in the culture of China. Average citizens will need to get involved, since police cannot be everywhere.

"In the past several hundred years, people have cultivated the habit of smoking wherever they want," she said. "Changing this will take some time."

Even so, Xu is hopeful that change will indeed come. For one thing, China's new president, Xi Jinping, sees the issue as important.

Xi's position is thought to be influenced by his wife, Peng Liyuan, who has long been active on public health issues. Since 2009, Peng has served as an "ambassador for tobacco control."

Yang said concerns over rising health care costs were getting the government's attention. As of 2010, one study showed, the costs of treating tobacco-related diseases totaled $253 billion yearly in China, far more than the money generated by selling tobacco.

The government, Yang said, is now being forced to consider the costs created by smoking.
