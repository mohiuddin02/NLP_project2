MOJAVE NATIONAL PRESERVE â€” Out in the California desert, J. Craig Venter is field-testing a new technology. Venter is both a businessman and a scientist. His invention will completely change the search for life on other planets.

Venter says his technology will spot DNA hiding in soil or water samples collected on other planets. DNA is the basic building block of life, and finding it will prove once and for all that we are not alone in the universe.

And Venter says his technology will be able to decode the DNA it finds. It will spot the order or sequence of nucleotides that is special to each type of DNA.

Venter claims the technology also will be able to beam DNA sequences back to Earth. And he says scientists will then be able to do something simply amazing: They will be able to reconstruct living copies of alien lifeforms in a lab.

## Capturing The Imagination

What he's talking about would work something like a fax machine: Call in with a DNA sequence; hit print; and presto: a living organism prints out.

"We can re-create the Martians in a P-4 spacesuit lab, if necessary," the 67-year-old says matter-of-factly.

It may sound outrageous, but Venter's idea has captured the attention of scientists at NASA. Half a dozen NASA scientists are on hand to help with the field test. They include experts in astrobiology, geology and planetary and environmental science.

The idea of building a device that could land on other planets and analyze samples without having to return to Earth is very appealing: Such a device would save billions of dollars. It also would get rid of the risk of bringing home alien diseases, said NASA scientist Simon "Pete" Worden.

"The next mission to Mars will be in 2020," Worden said. "That mission may well have this (technology) on it."

The Mojave Desert has long been used as a stand-in for Mars.

## Looking For Green Crud

Last weekend, a team of scientists trudged through the Mojave, flipping over rocks. They were, NASA scientist Chris McKay said, in search of a bacteria with "super powers."

The bacteria they were looking for is a green crud called Chroococcidiopsis. It can be found covering the bottom of quartz rocks. Chroococcidiopsis can survive in extreme cold and extreme heat. And the stuff refuses to die when deprived of air and water.

Scientists believe this is the sort of thing that may be hiding out on other worlds. For that reason, the team plans to use it in their Mojave test run.

"We're in love with this organism," McKay said. "It's the closest thing we have to Martians."

The game plan was to load samples of the bacteria into a DNA sequencer. Once found, the bacteria's DNA sequence will be uploaded. Scientists at Venter's company, Synthetic Genomics, will then download the sequence.

## A Unit's Field Test

In the Mojave, all this work is taking place in a huge trailer. And it requires a team of scientists. If it's ever going to be used on Mars, the technology will need to run itself. And it will have to be a lot smaller.

"It needs to be the size of a shoe box," McKay says.

The desert field experiment was a test of the unit that would send back information from Mars. But how would they receive the message? That technology already exists as well, Venter said. The device downloads a DNA sequence and prints out the right molecules. It will be available for sale in 2014.

Venter says it will be the size of a computer printer at some point.

This technology will have many uses on Earth, Venter said. For example, people will be able to "download" and "print out" medicines at home.

"We hope to sell a lot of these machines," Venter says.
