WASHINGTON â€” The number of people in the United States who don't speak English at home is growing very fast.

States and cities are having to change the way they do things because not everybody can understand important information.

In some states, people believe that everybody must learn how to speak and write English well. They also think that the government should only write documents in English.

Other states are home to people from many countries. They believe the government should make it easier for those who do not speak English.

## Groups Have Different Views

The United States is different from most countries in the world because it does not have an official language. The government does not force people to speak and write only in English.

But states and cities are allowed to make those rules.

There are 31 states that have made English their official language. All government communications in those states must be done in English. Five more states are considering laws to make English their official language too. The states are Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

Karin Davenport works with a group that is in favor of teaching English to immigrants. She explained that choosing English as the official language doesn't cause problems. It will not stop people from also speaking other languages.

She believes asking immigrants to learn English can help them. It makes it easier for them to mix with others.

## Drugstores Are Getting Involved

Even in states where English is the official language, it is difficult to follow the law.

California is one example. English is the official language of the state. To be helpful, the government also writes state documents in other languages.

The state even has a website in Spanish for its Department of Motor Vehicles.

California may make drugstores carry instructions on drugs in other languages. It will help people who cannot read English on medicine bottles.

Some people worry that something bad could happen if there is a mistake with the instructions. Others say that it is safer to have the instructions translated.

Evan Weibel works for Language Scientific, a company that offers translating services for drugstores. He said the need for translations is "not going to go away."

That is because the number of people speaking other languages in the United States keeps growing.

Almost 61 million people speak a language other than English at home. Fourteen years ago, that number was just 55 million. Now, almost half of California's population speaks a language other than English at home.

## A Nation Of Many Languages

"Things are changing," said Patricia Gandara, a professor of education at the University of California.

The country is becoming a place where many languages are spoken, she explained.

Still, the number of people supporting English as the official language is also very high. They are asking more states and cities to make English their official language.

A group called ProEnglish in Arizona is asking Arizona's government to make sure people follow the rule that makes English the official language in the state.

The group tells a story of a college student who was suspended after she complained that members of her class were speaking Spanish during group work.

ProEnglish says the student should not have been suspended.
