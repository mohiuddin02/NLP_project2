LIVINGSTON, N.J. — New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced his 2016 campaign for president. He declared that he is "out to change the world."

The Republican governor held the kickoff rally of his campaign in the gymnasium of his old high school. A one-time Republican favorite, Christie has faded in popularity and is now trying to climb back.

Christie said his political career in New Jersey has been about "fighting for fairness and justice and opportunity." He wants to do the same for the country, he said.

"America is tired of hand-wringing and indecisiveness and weakness" in the White House, he said. "We need to have strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office. And that is why today I am proud to announce my candidacy."

## Ready To Lead The Country

Christie will first run against other Republicans in the primaries. If he wins in the primaries and is selected to represent the party, he will then run against a Democrat in the general election.

Before making his announcement, Christie spoke with donors — who give money to political campaigns — and his friends and supporters from outside New Jersey. "Going back to where you were when you were 15, or 16, or 17 years old" is an emotional thing to do, he said. "To be able to stand in front of that group of people and offer yourself to the presidency is a really, really amazing moment."

Christie said he is "ready to go" on what he hopes will be "a really noble and successful effort to try to lead our country and to change the world."

## Taking No-Nonsense On The Road

Four years ago, some of Christie's backers tried to persuade him to challenge President Barack Obama in the 2012 elections. Christie chose not to run for president then, but won re-election to the governorship with ease. However, he has struggled to bring down New Jersey's high unemployment rate. As a result, his popularity has declined sharply.

Christie has also faced fallout from the actions of his three former staff members. Those onetime aides were charged with deliberately creating traffic jams to punish a Democratic New Jersey mayor. The mayor had declined to back Christie during the governor's re-election campaign.

The governor may have a hard time attracting large numbers of Republican voters nationwide. Nonetheless, during visits to early voting states he has done well with the lively town hall meetings he is known for at home. There will be plenty more of those now that he is a confirmed candidate.

Christie sees himself as someone who can work with both Republicans and Democrats. His political successes in heavily Democratic New Jersey prove that, he says.
