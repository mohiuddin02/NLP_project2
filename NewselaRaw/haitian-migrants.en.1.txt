OUANAMINTHE, Haiti — The deadline has passed for Haitians to apply to live in the Dominican Republican.

But thousands of people from Haiti or merely of Haitian descent are not waiting to see if they will be forcibly removed.

The end of a yearlong application period has sparked a mass departure to Haiti of people who failed to qualify for residency. Some plan to wait out what they fear could be a wave of mass deportations, while others will start uncertain new lives on the poorer side of Hispaniola. Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the Caribbean island.

## Hardship For Haitian Father Of Five

Both countries have a fraught history, with generations of Haitians crossing into the Dominican Republic to take low-wage jobs in fields like agriculture and construction. They have also encountered discrimination and periodic crackdowns.

Among those who have left the Dominican Republic recently is Haitian farmworker Eragene Moncher, although he actually qualified to stay.

He returned to the homeland he left more than 20 years ago after he failed to get the documents for five of his children to stay in the Dominican Republican, even though they were born there.

"We're arriving with nothing," he said while boarding a truck in the border town of Ouanaminthe with two of his children and headed toward the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. "I'm trying to figure out how we're going to make a living."

## Dominican Republic's Tough Rules

Dominican officials say migrants in the country could stay if they prove they arrived before October 2011 and have taken steps to establish themselves by getting a job or going to school. Nearly 290,000 of the estimated 524,000 migrants in the country — the majority of them Haitians — applied by the June 17 deadline. The government says those who did not apply or who did not get legal permission to stay should leave or risk deportation.

The Dominican government says nearly 40,000 people had left as of July 6.

Many people going to Haiti say they fear the violent, often traumatic deportations that have occurred periodically in the past. They also say they are frustrated by requirements for documents that many of them cannot obtain.

The Dominican Republic has been heavily criticized in recent years for immigration policies that tend to affect mostly Haitians and people of Haitian descent. They tend to be darker skinned than most Dominicans and often find themselves victims of racial discrimination.

In September 2013, the Dominican Republic's Constitutional Court ruled that children born in the country to non-citizens did not qualify for automatic citizenship. The court said their migrant parents — most of whom were Haitians — were "in transit."

Countries around the world protested. Then the administration of the Dominican Republic's President Danilo Medina announced that it would grant citizenship to the estimated 55,000 people it said were born in the Dominican Republic to at least one parent who was a citizen or legal resident.

The Dominican government also created a program for people who were born in the country but never obtained a birth certificate or other identification. Before it closed in February, only about 9,000 people applied for the program that let them register as foreigners and become citizens. Rights activists fear that Dominican-born people without proper paperwork, like birth certificates, could be as easily deported as foreigners.

"They're saying there are going to be deportations," construction worker Wasley Abraham said as he, his wife and daughter prepared to cross the Dominican border into his native Haiti. A pink bike with training wheels peeked out among belongings loaded on a truck. "It's best to move now."

## Terrible Toll of Deportation

Pedro Cano is the coordinator of the Jesuit Migrant Service in the Dominican border town of Jimani. He said sudden deportation can be devastating for people who have spent years, sometimes their entire lives, in the Dominican Republic.

"The main reason these people are leaving is because they do not want to endure a deportation and lose the meager belongings they've earned after many years and much sacrifice," he said.

Before last month's deadline, some Dominican officials warned they would search for immigrants and showed off a fleet of buses for deportations. Mass deportations have not occurred, however.

"At no time will indiscriminate and collective deportations be made," Jose Tomas Perez, the Dominican ambassador to the United States, said in a letter defending the immigration program.

Foreigners seeking to stay complained of difficulties such as a requirement to find seven neighbors to vouch they were living in the country before October 2011. There were delays and high fees for birth certificates and other documents from the poorly functioning Haitian government.

"It's complicated, you spend a lot of money, and you don't get your papers," Miguelle Saint Juste, a construction worker, said while loading suitcases and a TV onto a bus to Haiti with his wife and three daughters. Saint Juste said he was told he did not meet the requirements to be eligible to stay.

## Dominicans Deny Haiti's Cruelty Claims

The situation has strained relations between the two countries. Haitian Prime Minister Evans Paul has accused Dominican officials of treating people inhumanely.

Paul said 21 migrants, including eight children, were whisked across the border on a 15-hour journey without a break to eat or drink — an allegation the Dominican government denied. "The way this group of migrants was treated is unacceptable," Paul said.

The Organization of American States is a group of 36 countries in the Americas that work together to promote cooperation in the region. On Friday, it sent representatives to the Dominican Republic and Haiti to investigate allegations of mistreatment.

Moncher, the farmworker, said that after crossing the border, he would stay temporarily with a sister near Port-au-Prince in Haiti. He hopes his relatives can help him find work in a country where more than half the population survives on less than $2 a day.

"Who knows if they'll receive me?" he said. "They don't have anything to offer."
