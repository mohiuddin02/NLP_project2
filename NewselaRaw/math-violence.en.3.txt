CHICAGO â€” Robert McDaniel was puzzled when the Chicago police commander dropped by his West Side home unannounced last month. Commander Barbara West was polite, but her message was clear: Stop committing crimes or be prepared for the worst.

West told the 22-year-old that she knew his best friend had been killed last year in Austin, their dangerous South Chicago community. She cautioned that the same thing could happen to him if he didn't change his ways.

McDaniel has only a minor arrest record, so he was surprised to learn he was on the police department's so-called "heat list." This list identifies people whom the department considers most likely to be involved in violence.

McDaniel had been arrested for minor offenses like smoking marijuana and gambling. In his neighborhood, those are common activities. "I haven't done nothing that the next kid growing up hadn't done," he said, disbelievingly.

## Sorting Through Arrest Records

Chicago police are trying to figure out who is most at risk of shooting someone. Or of being shot themselves. To do that, they enter arrest records and other information into a computer system. Then, they use complicated mathematical calculations to sort that information.

Police officials said they had come up with a list of 420 names. They had looked at a series of questions, such as: How many times had a person been arrested? Have they been arrested for carrying weapons? What kind of criminal records do their friends have? And have any of those friends been shot in the past?

Those who rank highest on the heat list stand out dramatically. They are more than 500 times more likely than the average person to be involved in violence, according to police.

People on the list are warned that further crimes, however minor, will result in severe punishment. But police don't just issue a threat: They also offer help. Those who want it can receive job training or other kinds of assistance.

McDaniel most likely made the heat list because of a childhood friend. The two had once been arrested on a marijuana charge. Last year, that friend was fatally shot in Austin.

McDaniel said he was offended at being singled out by West, who is commander of the Austin police district. "I have no background, so why watch me?" said McDaniel. "And if you're watching me, then you can obviously see I'm not doing anything."

## List Proves Prophetic

But the police were right to be concerned about another young man. This month, 21-year-old Jacobi Herring was fatally shot in his South Chicago neighborhood. He had just left a late-night party a few blocks from his home when he was gunned down.

His uncle, Koland Herring, was not surprised to learn that his nephew was on the heat list. Jacobi, he said, had given in to neighborhood peer pressure.

"He was never a shooter, burglarizing or stealing cars, anything like that," Herring, 49, said outside his nephew's home as friends and relatives stopped by to pay their respects to the South Shore High School graduate. "Some of the people that he knew did. They're hard-core. And in order to get around and to be accepted out here, you have to be around them."

Herring was arrested only a handful of times. And those arrests were mostly for minor things like trespassing and hanging out with known gang members.

But four others who were once arrested with Herring also made the list. In addition, another man who was once arrested with Herring was shot and killed in March in broad daylight. And Herring himself was shot in 2008.

"We talked about him getting shot all the time," said Herring's father, Floyd Redmond, 41. "I used to see my son hanging out, and I used to ride down on him. I feared for my son being out on these streets because I know what these streets are all about, man."

As for McDaniel, he's considering taking up the police department's offer of help. A high school dropout, he has a 2-year-old daughter to care for and another child on the way. But he insisted he doesn't belong on the heat list. "I don't too much appreciate that," he said.
