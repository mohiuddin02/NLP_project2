DALLAS â€” Chuck E. Cheese's is a place where a kid can be a kid. But it also wants to be a place for adults too. Now mom can get a cappuccino and dad can order a fancy pizza.

This week, Chuck E. Cheese's introduced the biggest change to its food in more than 10 years. It is meant to make the restaurant more appealing to adults.

The new menu includes things like thin and crispy pizza. For dessert, it will have New York-style cheesecake.

Tom Leverton is a top official at Chuck E. Cheese's. He said that while children may be the ones who want to visit the restaurant, their parents have to drive them there.

"If we provide a good experience for mom and dad, they are going to be more willing to take their kid to Chuck E. Cheese's," he said.

## Wraps And Churros

The company has rolled out a new Cali Alfredo pizza. It also has introduced whole-wheat tortilla wraps. And it added churros with dipping sauces.

All Chuck E. Cheese's stores in North Texas are being fixed up. Some will include coffee bars, featuring cappuccinos and lattes. Others will have dessert bars.

If those foods are popular here, they may be introduced in other restaurants.

The company's website says, "we're not playing games with our food anymore."

In addition to the new foods, the company is thinking about replacing those jingling game tokens, or coins. Instead, it may use a "play pass" like the one at Dave &amp; Buster's. It also wants more people to come in for take-out.

So far, parents love the additions to the menu, Leverton said.

The chain is trying to attract more customers because other pizza restaurants are doing the same. Last year, Pizza Hut said it was adding fancy pizza to its menu.

## Pepperoni Pizza Popular

Still, some parents like the pizza at Chuck E. Cheese's just the way it is.

At a store near Dallas, Texas, this week, pepperoni pizza seemed to be the most popular choice. None of the parents spotted during dinner were eating the new foods.

Brandie Bohmer is a mom of four who said she has at least two birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese's every year. She and her children like pepperoni pizza best. Bohmer said she'd buy it even if it was sold somewhere else.

Nearby, Zab Herrera also handed out slices of pepperoni pizza to his daughters. It's easier, he said, to just get one pizza that the whole family likes.

Right now, the company is working to improve the food.

Leverton said the company is building a bigger test kitchen to develop new foods. It will also have a new chef, who went to a respected cooking school.

## Cards Replace Tokens

Beyond the food, the company is adding Wi-Fi to its U.S. restaurants. And in some stores, it will test the new "play pass" system and use cards instead of coins.

That's a scary thought for Bohmer.

"Because this is for younger kids, I say no," Bohmer said. "If they lose one token, I'm not going to cry over that. If they lose a card with 100 tokens, I'm going to cry."

But the company said that won't be a problem because customers can get another card. Leverton didn't give many details about the test. Mostly, the company is excited to talk about the food.

"We want to make sure the adults are as excited about the visit as the children," he said. "The menu was a great opportunity to really do that."
