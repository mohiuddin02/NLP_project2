GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — Israeli troops battled Hamas militants on Wednesday near a southern Gaza Strip town in continuing fighting. More than 680 Palestinians and 34 Israelis have been killed in the 2-week-long war.

The top U.S. diplomat, Secretary of State John Kerry, flew to Israel Wednesday. He reported progress in efforts to end fighting.

Neither side, however, appeared to be backing down. Palestinian rocket fire led several international airlines to halt flights to Tel Aviv on Tuesday. Israeli troops clashed with Hamas near the Gaza town of Khan Younis, where fighting forced dozens of families to flee.

Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal later demanded Gaza's borders be allowed to open. He called Palestinians "the true owners of the land." Hamas has ruled over Gaza's 1.7 million people since 2007.

The Palestinians are seeking their own country. They and the Israelis have been negotiating — and fighting — over the land for decades.

## Secretary Of State Is Working On It

Israel insists it must stop the ability of Hamas to launch attacks. The U.S. government seems to increasingly support Israel's position.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration banned flights into Israel Tuesday. A day earlier, a Hamas rocket landed near the main airport. Even so, Secretary of State Kerry flew into Tel Aviv Wednesday, showing his determination to end the fighting.

He met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier, he held talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon, who is also in the region.

In Jerusalem, Kerry said negotiations toward a Gaza cease-fire were making some progress. "We certainly have made steps forward," Kerry said. "There's still work to be done."

On the ground, meanwhile, Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters near Khan Younis. The Israelis were backed by tanks and drones; the Palestinians were armed with rocket-propelled grenades and attack rifles. At least eight militants died, a Palestinian health official said.

## People Seek Shelter In Schools

The Palestinian Red Crescent, which is part of the International Red Cross, was trying to evacuate some 250 people from the area.

Hundreds of residents of Khan Younis were seen fleeing their homes as the battle unfolded. They said they were seeking shelter in nearby U.N. schools.

"The airplanes and airstrikes are all around us," said Aziza Msabah, a resident of Khan Younis. "They are hitting the houses, which are collapsing upon us."

Farther north, the Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City saw intense fighting earlier this week. An airstrike destroyed a home, killing 30-year-old journalist Abdul Rahman Abu Hean, his grandfather and nephew.

Meanwhile, a foreign worker in Israel was killed when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed in southern Israel on Wednesday, police said. The worker's nationality was unknown.

Israel said five more of its soldiers have died in the conflict, bringing the military's death toll to 32. Two Israeli civilians have been killed in 15 days of fighting.

## Both Sides Get A Warning

In Jerusalem, 30,000 people attended the funeral of Max Steinberg, a 24-year-old from Southern California serving in the Israeli military. Steinberg was killed in an attack on Sunday.

"I spoke with him a day and a half ago," his mother, Evie Steinberg, told Israeli TV. "I said 'are you afraid?' He said 'no. I am afraid only for you.' He's a hero."

The Palestinians say Israel is not being careful in its use of modern weapons in Gaza. The Palestinian death toll stands at 684, mostly civilians, said Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra.

Israel says it launched the Gaza operation to halt Hamas rocket fire into Israel — more than 2,100 rockets have been fired since the conflict erupted.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, meanwhile, warned both sides against targeting civilians and said war crimes may have been committed.

She noted an Israeli bombing that killed three children and wounded two others while they were playing on the roof of their home.

"There seems to be a strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes," Pillay told the 47-nation U.N. Human Rights Council. She said such incidents should be investigated.
