WASHINGTON â€” A modest change in what food labels say about sweeteners should not have been that controversial. But a big food fight has broken out over the proposal ever since First Lady Michelle Obama announced it last year.

The objections have not only come from candy companies and soft-drink makers.

The governor of Massachusetts implored the Obama administration to rethink its proposal. The governor of Wisconsin protested as well. So did the government of Australia, which warned the move could violate international trade agreements.

## Sugar Is Sugar. Or Is It?

The proposal being considered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would add a new line to labels on packaged food products. The new information would note how many teaspoons of sugar had been added.

The outrage over the idea reveals the extent that extra sugar is added to even the most unlikely foods. It also shows how concerned manufacturers are about consumers finding out. The FDA has received 287,889 public comments on the plan, many of them from major food companies and trade associations.

Nutrition advocates say the strong reaction shows just how much is at stake.

"They know this will impact how people choose their products, and that terrifies them," said Renee Sharp. She is the director of research for the Environmental Working Group, one of several advocacy groups campaigning for the label change.

But food industry officials say the proposal is unnecessary. Current labels reveal the total amount of sugar in a product, combining the sugars that occur naturally in a food and what is added during its manufacture. Sugar is sugar, and no evidence justifies singling out one type for added labeling, they say.

"The lack of science to justify added-sugar labeling sets an alarming" example, the president of the Sugar Association, Andrew Briscoe, wrote to the administration.

## Not-So-Innocent Flavored Milks

Opponents warn of a slippery slope that starts with sugar but does not end there. Any number of other ingredients could be targeted, they say.

For the administration, too, the issue has taken on outsized importance. Healthy eating is a huge issue for the first couple. Food labels that could tell consumers more about what they are eating are a legacy the Obamas would like to leave along with the White House vegetable garden, which they planted.

Dessert makers are not the only food makers opposed to the label change.

"Consumers already have the information they need to make healthy dietary choices," the Dairy Institute of California wrote. The group had many objections to the administration's plan. Among them, it warned, the trade secrets of the flavored-milk industry would be disclosed if dairies had to reveal how much sugar they added to each carton of chocolate or strawberry milk.

The loudest alarm is being sounded by the cranberry industry, which got the support of Republican Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin and then-Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat. The governors wrote to the FDA that forcing food makers to disclose how much sugar they add to cranberry products would be unfair. Unlike other fruits, cranberries are so bitter that they would taste terrible without it, they said.

## The List Of Opponents Is Growing

The Campbell Soup Company made a different sort of argument. It claimed that revealing how much sugar they put into each can of soup could help make Americans more obese.

"Such information could confuse consumers by taking their focus off of calories," it wrote to the agency.

Another of the dozens of companies calling on the FDA to cancel the sugar plan is the Roman Meal Company, which makes whole-grain breads. The American Nutrition Society also joined the fight, with members including Kellogg Company, Coca-Cola and Dannon, the yogurt maker.

## There's Sugar In That Turkey!

Nutrition advocates say the uproar only supports their argument that unhealthy amounts of sugar are secretly added to foods.

"That one line on a label seems like a small thing," said Deborah Bailin, an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "But not having it covers up a very big fact that the food industry does not want people to know."

She added, "Things they want you to think are healthy are full of sugar."

When the Environmental Working Group analyzed 80,000 food products, it found that 58 percent had extra sugar added. That included most deli meats on supermarket shelves.

"I was shocked," Sharp said. "I mean, it's turkey. Why is there sugar in it?"

## First Comes Labeling

The FDA says it only wants to let people know what they are eating. But for advocacy groups, the aim is to get companies to lower the sugar content of their products. The groups are pleased that so many food manufacturers have warned that consumers would stop buying products if they knew how much sugar was added.

On that point, at least, the food industry and nutrition advocates agree.

"When you pick up a bottle of salad dressing, you can already see there are 47 different kinds of sugar in it," said Baylen Linnekin, executive director of the Keep Food Legal Foundation, which is against the extra-sugar labeling. "By forcing what amounts to an added-sugar warning on the label, the government is attempting" to direct what people want to buy.

He warned of what could come next.

"Look at trans fats," he said, of the type of fat shown to increase the risk of heart attacks. "First there was a requirement they be labeled. Now the FDA is moving to ban them."
