[Malala Yousafzai](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Malala), the 15-year-old girl who was shot in the head by the Taliban in October, resumed her education in March, enrolling in a new school in England.

The Taliban targeted Malala because she campaigned for education rights for Pakistani girls. Gunmen opened fire on her in a school bus, but she was quickly airlifted to a hospital. Five months later, she is fully healed and attending Edgbaston, a girls school in Birmingham, England, with the world at her back.

## Bulletproof Determination

Malala made a swift recovery from surgery that involved fitting a titanium plate to her skull and installing a cochlear implant to help her regain hearing in her left ear. After only five months in the hospital, she was strong enough to return to school and defy the Taliban, showing it will take more than a bullet to the head to keep her from getting an education.

"I am excited that today I have achieved my dream of going back to school," Malala said in a statement given to Time magazine. "I want all girls in the world to have this basic opportunity. I miss my classmates from Pakistan very much, but I am looking forward to meeting my teachers and making new friends here in Birmingham."

Proudly wearing a pink backpack over her school uniform -- a green sweater with the Edgbaston insignia and a blue skirt -- along with a headscarf, Malala expressed thanks and optimism in a video released on the Guardian website, calling her first day back at school her "happiest moment."

## Learning How To Change The World

"I will hold my books, my bag, and I will learn. I will talk to my friends, and I will talk to my teacher. I think there's no more important day than this day," Malala said. "I want to learn about politics, and about social rights, about the law. I want to learn how to bring change into this world."

The teenage Malala is already well on her way. She initially gained recognition in Pakistan and beyond when she was only 12 by writing a popular blog on the BBC's Urdu-language website. She chronicled her experiences as a schoolgirl in the Swat Valley, a region of Pakistan then coming under Taliban control. The Taliban had issued an edict banning education for girls, and began bombing girls schools.

Writing under the pseudonym Gul Makai ("corn flower" in Urdu, an official language of Pakistan), Malala exposed the violence and uncertainty of daily life in Swat, standing up to the Taliban's intimidation of ordinary people and adding a human dimension to the political and military coverage that had been the only news coming out of the Swat Valley at the time.

## Targeting A Schoolgirl

After the Pakistani army won back control of the region, Malala put her international recognition to work, campaigning for girls' education. But the remaining Taliban, unable to strike back against the army, picked Malala as a target for their wrath. On Oct. 9, gunmen stopped the school bus Malala was riding, asked the other children to point her out, and fired a bullet into her skull. Two other girls were wounded.

Malala was stabilized first at the top military hospital in Pakistan and then transferred to specialists in Birmingham. The Pakistani government was forceful in denouncing the attack. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said it was "an attack on all girls in Pakistan, an attack on education, and on all civilized people," vowing "the work that she led was higher before God than what terrorists do in the name of religion. We will continue her shining cause."

The backlash unnerved the Taliban. It took the unusual step of trying to positively spin the attempted murder of a child. "She was pro-West, she was speaking against Taliban and she was calling President Obama her ideal leader," Ehsanullah Ehsan, a Taliban spokesman, claimed in a statement aimed at justifying the attack. Millions of Pakistanis rejected this reasoning, however, rallying and marching to support Malala and pray for her recovery.

The Taliban's attempt to keep Malala from getting an education has now backfired. Not only is Malala alive and bravely continuing her campaign, but Nov. 10 was named Malala Day to focus attention on the world's estimated 32 million girls who are denied schooling. She is now the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee ever. A publisher offered her $2 million to author a book about her life and the struggle for girls' education.  She will have to write it in between homework assignments.
