Let other senior citizens take it easy. Despite gray hair, wrinkles and 17 great-grandchildren, Helen Dugan is a third-degree black belt in American karate. Now 80, she can still snap off a spinning back kick and break boards with her feet.

"Want to know what my grandsons say about me?" she says as a smile sneaks across her face. "Well, you know how kids in school say, 'My dad can beat up your dad?' They say, 'My grandma can beat up your dad!'"

Laugh if you want, but this karate grandma is no joke.

## Helping Kids With Special Needs

For 25 years, Dugan has used her karate skills to teach students often turned away by others. Her martial arts school is called Champs Achievers. It specializes in teaching people with special needs. About 20 of her 60 students are on the autism spectrum. People on the autism spectrum have trouble communicating and using social skills. Other students have illnesses and issues from attention deficit disorder (ADD) to hearing and vision problems.

"Helen is an amazing woman," said Angela Degnan, whose 3-year-old son, Aiden, began taking lessons in October. "She has dedicated her life to children with special needs. My son has special needs, and it's been a wonderful experience for him."

"I'm 35, and I can't do a third of what she does," said Serena Faith, whose 7-year-old son takes lessons from Dugan. "My goal in life is to be Helen when I get to be her age."

Dugan began learning karate when she was about 47. She started taking lessons with her two sons. Her kids lasted four years, but she stuck with it.

She earned her black belt, the highest level, at the age of 61.

Karate strengthened her body and mind. It gave her the self-esteem she had lost in childhood. Dugan founded her own karate school in hopes of helping others do the same.

You see, Dugan's students are not the only ones with a disability.

## Turning Failure Into Triumph

Growing up in Pennsylvania, Dugan failed many of her grade school classes. She was creative, but she could not do math and had problems remembering things. She struggled to learn and took longer than other kids to understand things.

It was not until Dugan was in high school that she realized she had a good brain. She just had to learn things in her own way.

She worked hard to get into nursing school. After graduation, she got a job at a hospital and then married her husband, Barney.

Dugan still struggles with "face blindness" â€” or prosopagnosia. This condition makes it difficult, if not impossible, for her to recognize faces, even of friends and family.

"It was very embarrassing to me to not know the kids," she said. Dugan overcomes this by taking pictures of her students, which she studies at home.

Dugan's first student was Michael Payne, who hurt his head and had balance and vision problems.

"Back then, there wasn't anybody doing this," said Michael's mom, Patti Payne. "It was Helen who thought about helping these people. Nobody taught her how to do it."

In time, the training improved Michael's balance, self-esteem and life.

"When you see a child get their first belt?" Dugan said. "When you see them get their first trophy? Remember, these are kids who don't get awards. They don't get trophies, and when you see the expression on their face when they get their first trophy, it's such a self-esteem builder."

## Praise From A Purple Belt

In a recent class, a group of children lined up on a red-and-blue mat. Up above hung karate belts in 14 colors. There were white signs that read "self-discipline," "respect," "attitude," "cleanliness" and "honesty."

For the last 14 years, Dugan's only paid employee has been Steven Nagorski. He is a purple belt with Down syndrome, a condition he was born with.

"She's the best sensei in the whole universe," said Nagorski, who also teaches karate.

Sensei means teacher in Japanese.

Karate and other martial arts can improve concentration and balance. They also build independence and self-esteem.

As she heads into her 81st year, Dugan intends to help special needs kids as long as she can.

"Put me with the kids," she said. "They keep you young."
