NEW YORK â€” A few weeks ago, Barbie was criticized for appearing in a bathing suit in a national magazine. Now, America's top doll is in trouble again.

This time the trouble is over a partnership between Mattel and the Girl Scouts. Mattel, which makes Barbie, is giving the Girl Scouts $2 million. In exchange, the Girl Scouts will get a Barbie activity book and a special Barbie website. Also, Girl Scouts will be able to earn a Barbie participation patch. It is the first Girl Scout patch sponsored by a company.

On Thursday, two groups started a campaign to get the Girl Scouts of the USA to end the partnership. They said Barbie is a bad role model for little girls. They don't believe the Girl Scouts should promote the doll.

 The Girls Scouts said they would not end the partnership.

## Partnership Promotes Barbie

Susan Linn is in charge of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, one of the groups. Promoting Barbie as a role model for Girl Scouts is a bad idea, she said. Many people think Barbie's curvy figure and tiny waist make girls feel bad about themselves. Some girls try to lose weight to look like Barbie.

Linn also said the Barbie partnership also hurts the Girl Scouts' mission to build "girls of courage, confidence and character."

She said the Barbie patch would turn these girls into "walking advertisements." The patch is aimed for 5-to-8-year-old Daisies and Brownies.

"This is product placement at its worst," said Wendy Philleo. She is the director of New American Dream, the other group.

Product placement is a form of advertising. A product, like a toy, is featured in a television show or movie. Viewers may not be aware that the placement was paid for.

Philleo said she admires the Girl Scouts.

But children are already blasted by ads at stores, online and on TV, she said.

## Pink Participation Patch

The Girl Scouts' national headquarters rejected the groups' request.

Kelly Parisi is with the Girl Scouts. She said the partnership with Mattel is about exploring careers. It teaches girls about women who do interesting things. And it does this in a fun way. "We stand behind this partnership," she said.

"It helps us bring to ... Girl Scouts the message that they can do anything," Parisi said. The are more than 2 million Girl Scouts.

The Barbie uniform patch is a bright pink oval with gold letters. The patch reads, "Be anything, Do everything."

Barbie was created 55 years ago. In that time, she has had about 150 different careers. In February, she gained a new one -- swimsuit model. Barbie posed in a bathing suit along with real-life supermodels in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. The swimsuit issue features women in bathing suits. Some people people think the swimsuit issue turns women into objects. The toy company was widely criticized for letting Barbie pose in the magazine. But some people liked it.

Girl Scouts head Anna Maria Chavez announced the partnership last year.

She said that the Girl Scouts and Mattel are teaching girls that anything is possible.

## $2 Million From Mattel

Parisi said Mattel gave the Girl Scouts $2 million for the Barbie programs. When the partnership was announced, the Girl Scouts were losing money. The national headquarters had to let go about one-fourth of its staff.

The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood said the Girl Scouts' Barbie website includes a Barbie game. The game encourages girls to identify careers based on costume. The costumes include a veterinarian in a miniskirt. Other careers include a U.S. president in a pink suit and a race car driver in high heels.

Linn, the director, said the website is little more than an ad for Barbie. It promotes Barbie's "message that women really are what they wear."

Linn began the group in 2000. It now has a membership of 54,000, many of them parents.

The group's advocacy campaigns have won many victories. It forced several companies to stop claiming that videos and other products could help infants learn. It also has helped prevent ads being put on school buses.

Due to its size and popularity, the Girl Scouts have been a frequent target of criticism over the years.
