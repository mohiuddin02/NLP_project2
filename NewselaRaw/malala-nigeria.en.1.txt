ABUJA, Nigeria — [Malala Yousafzai](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Malala), the Pakistani teen who survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012, celebrated her 17th birthday this Monday. She marked the occasion with a visit to Nigeria. Upon her arrival, she urged Islamic extremists to free the 219 schoolgirls who were kidnapped there three months ago.

Malala, who became world famous for standing up for women's rights and challenging Islamic extremists who do not believe girls should be educated, called the Nigerian girls her "sisters." She said Nigeria's president promised to meet for the first time with the kidnapped girls' parents.

"My birthday wish this year is 'Bring Back Our Girls' now and alive," she said, using the slogan that has been picked up around the world by those calling for the release of the schoolgirls.

They were kidnapped in April by the extremist group Boko Haram from a school in the remote northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok. Malala appealed directly to their captors.

## "Release My Sisters"

"Lay down your weapons. Release your sisters. Release my sisters. Release the daughters of this nation. Let them be free — they have committed no crime," Malala said.

"You are misusing the name of Islam," she added. The Quran — Islam's holy book — "teaches brotherhood," she said.

Malala also spoke against the custom of child brides in her home country, a tradition common in Nigeria, too. Boko Haram has threatened to sell some of the girls as brides if its fighters are not freed.

"Protect girls from cruelty," she said in her annual Malala Day speech. Girls, she said, should not be forced to marry or to leave school to become brides "when they should be girls," or to give birth to children "when they themselves are children."

Boko Haram attacks continued over the weekend. Witnesses blamed the group for the bombing of a major bridge, which further limited access to its base camps in the Sambisa Forest, where it is believed to be holding some of the girls.

Gunmen destroyed most of the bridge on the road between Maiduguri and Biu on Saturday night, making it impossible for vehicles to cross.

Malala met Monday with Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan. Following the meeting, she told reporters that the president "promised me that the girls will be returned as soon as possible."

## Meeting The Girls' Parents

She described an emotional meeting on Sunday with some of the girls' parents.

"I could see tears in their eyes — they were hopeless. But they seem to have this hope in their hearts," and they were asking if they could meet the president.

Jonathan has not met with any of the parents so far, even though some regularly make the dangerous drive from Chibok to attend daily rallies held by activists in Abuja.

When the activists tried to march peacefully to the presidential residence in May, they were blocked by soldiers and police. Jonathan canceled a planned trip to Chibok that same month.

On Monday, the president told Malala that criticism that his government is not doing enough "is very wrong and misplaced."

He said, "The great challenge in rescuing the Chibok girls is the need to ensure that they are rescued alive." The president insisted his government is "very actively pursuing" all possible options to achieve their safe return.

Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau released a new video Sunday, in which he repeated demands that the government release jailed rebels in exchange for the girls' freedom.

"Nigerians are saying 'Bring Back Our Girls,' and we are telling Jonathan to bring back our arrested warriors, our army," he said in the video.

Jonathan so far has refused, despite pleas from the parents.

## Boko Haram Increases Its Attacks

Since the mass kidnapping, Boko Haram has increased the number and deadliness of its attacks. It has followed a two-pronged approach: bombing cities and towns, and destroying villages by gunning down villagers, looting livestock and burning down huts.

In the new video, Shekau crowed over recent victories. Among the strikes he took responsibility for were two explosions at a fuel storage station in Lagos that the government tried to cover up. It would be the first reported bombing by Boko Haram in Lagos — Nigeria's business capital, with a population of some 20 million people. The attack also raises fears that the insurgency is spreading beyond its stronghold at the opposite end of the country.

At least four people died in the June 25 blasts, including an alleged female suicide bomber.

Shekau also claimed responsibility for another bomb that went off hours before at the biggest shopping mall in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. The explosion killed at least 21 people.

On Monday, Malala also appealed to the Nigerian government to dedicate more money to education. She urged the government to drastically reduce the number of children who are out of school throughout the country, not just in the area targeted by Boko Haram. Currently, hundreds of thousands of children are not attending school.

The rebel group's name means "Western education is sinful." Boko Haram wants to enforce an Islamic state in Nigeria, whose 170 million people are almost equally divided between Christians in the south and Muslims in the north.
