LOS ANGELES — A group of astronomers say they have discovered an Earth-size planet where water could exist in liquid form. The planet is the first yet found that is habitable, which means that it is the first planet where life as we know it could exist.

Experts don't know if the planet actually has water or an atmosphere to protect it from its sun. But they said the huge discovery suggests that a large group of Earth-like planets is waiting to be found much closer to home.

"This is really a tip-of-the-iceberg discovery," said astronomer Jason Rowe. He and his team spent a year analyzing information gathered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope.

Rowe and the others are still looking at far-away stars and planets found by the Kepler telescope. But after finding the Earth-like planet known as Kepler-186f, it seems reasonable to guess "that other ones are likely to exist. And that's going to be the job of future missions to find (them)."

## A Breakthrough

Scientists who were not involved in the study praised the find.

"This is a historic discovery of the first Earth-size planet found in the habitable zone around its star," astronomer Geoffrey Marcy commented. "This is the best case for a habitable planet yet found. The results are absolutely rock solid."

If such planets turn out to be common among the distant stars Kepler studies, it could mean that life might be possible outside of planet Earth. It will also mean that astronomers should be able to find plenty of similar planets closer to home.

Future NASA missions may let scientists add to the list of potentially habitable planets. Powerful telescopes in space will figure out which planets have the strongest signs of water and atmospheres that can support life.

The discovery marks a breakthrough in the search for planets that are not just Earth-size, but truly Earth-like.

## Size Is Important

Out of 1,800 or so confirmed planets, fewer than two dozen sit in a habitable zone. In these zones, it's not so hot that water would boil off into space. It's also not so cold that it would remain in a permanent deep-freeze. None of the other planets are as close in size to Earth as Kepler-186f. It is only a little larger than our planet.

Size is very important: If a planet is about one-and-a-half times wider than Earth, it could have an atmosphere that is too thick to be Earth-like.

Kepler-186f may be close to Earth in size, but it's not very close. It sits 490 light-years away. That means it would take 490 years traveling at 186,000 miles per second — the speed of light — to get there. It circles its home star, Kepler-186, in just 130 days.

That star is an M-dwarf, smaller, dimmer and cooler than our sun. So even though Kepler-186f sits closer to its sun than Mercury does to our sun, it is still safely located in a habitable zone.

Many scientists have thought that life couldn't develop near M-dwarf stars. This is because they give off more flares and damaging radiation than G-type stars like our sun. Kepler-186f, however, appears to sit far away enough from its star to be out of harm's way.

The discovery of Kepler-186f indicates that there may be more than one kind of habitable planet. From now on, scientists will look beyond planets circling stars similar to our sun.

## "That's Very Exciting"

"I believe that planets are very" varied, said astrophysicist Sara Seager. "A whole range of them could be habitable."

That's an encouraging thought, given that M-dwarf planets are easier to find than planets that revolve around larger stars. This is for two reasons: Their orbits are shorter and they block relatively more of their star's light. And given that M-dwarf stars account for 70 percent of the stars in the Milky Way, there could be billions of Earth-size planets throughout our galaxy.

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, set for launch in 2017, could look for such planets closer to home. And then there's the James Webb Space Telescope, the follow-up to the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be able to spot water and other things necessary for life in the atmospheres of nearby planets.

The discovery of Kepler-186f is a sign that scientists are homing in on the answers to key questions about life in the universe.

"Whether we are an extremely rare fluke — a phenomenon that only happens once in a universe — or in a galaxy teeming with life is a very basic question," said astrophysicist Dimitar Sasselov. It's a question "not only of science, but of our existence." For "the first time in human history we have a good shot at answering that question," he said. "That's very exciting."
