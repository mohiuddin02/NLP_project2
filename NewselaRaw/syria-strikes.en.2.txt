BEIRUT, Lebanon — The U.S. led overnight airstrikes across northern Syria, which appear to have caused major damage to the fighters it was targeting, according to reports Tuesday.

The main target was the Islamic State (ISIL). It is a group of fighters who have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. The U.S. government says the group is a great danger to the Middle East.

The group calls itself the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

The airstrikes are a sign that the conflict in the region is worsening. It was the first time the United States led an attack into Syria. Previously, the U.S. attacks had taken place only in Iraq, which borders Syria. It was not known how many people were hurt or killed, reports said.

The U.S. military planes struck across several areas of northern Syria. The strikes spanned more than 220 miles from the northwest near Turkey to the Iraqi border in the east, according to the U.S. military and witnesses on the ground.

## ISIL Main Base Was A Target

The attacks were aimed at four Syrian cities. Included among them was the city of Raqqa in north-central Syria. Raqqa is seen as the main base for ISIL.

The strikes were carried out by several different types of aircraft — fighter jets, bombers, and armed drones that fly without pilots. Tomahawk missiles were launched from U.S. vessels in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Five Arab nations participated in the strike. They were Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the United States said. The Jordanian government said its air force had destroyed "terrorist" targets.

All the planes involved returned safely to their bases, U.S. officials said.

The strikes "destroyed or damaged" multiple ISIL targets, said U.S. military leaders from the Pentagon. The planes hit training centers, storage buildings, vehicles, and the fighters themselves.

Islamic State fighters have begun attacks on the town of Ayn al-Arab on the border with Turkey. Ayn al-Arab is also called Kobane in Kurdish, the language of the people who live there. The Kurds are enemies of ISIL. More than 100,000 mostly Kurdish people have fled across the border to Turkey in recent days, due to the attacks. It was not confirmed that the airstrikes targeted Ayn al-Arab.

## Civil War In Syria

Separately, the United States conducted eight airstrikes west of the Syrian city of Aleppo. The attacks targeted a branch of fighters called the "Khorasan Group." The group includes longtime members of the al-Qaida terrorist network. The Khorasan was supposedly plotting an attack very soon against the United States and Western allies. The U.S. military did not give more details of the plot.

The president of Syria is Bashar Assad. Syrians have lived with civil war for three years as rebels have fought Assad's leadership. The United States has helped to support the rebel fighters. The rebels have often cooperated with the Nusra Front, the official branch of al-Qaida in Syria.

Nusra bases in and around Aleppo were hit in the U.S. strikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Seven fighters and eight civilians were killed, the Syrian Observatory said.

## "People Are Scared"

The airstrikes on Raqqa and its suburbs began around 3 a.m. local time, said Abu Khalil. He is an activist in the city, and uses a nickname for safety reasons. The strike included more than 18 separate hits, the activist said.

Seven of the 18 strikes were inside Raqqa. Most of them targeted offices that serve as the major headquarters for ISIL fighters, the activist said. Some were aimed at a pair of Syrian military bases. ISIL had recently seized the bases from the Syrian military, according to the activist.

The number of killed and injured from the strikes is unknown. Most residents either sheltered in their homes during the attacks or sought safety in basements, the activist said.

After the airstrikes, the fighters fled their headquarters, Khalil said.

"Of course the people are scared," Khalil said. He added that some of the Syrian people supported U.S. airstrikes, while others did not. "If the targeting is precise on ISIS, then I am for it," he said.

In recent weeks, activists and others say, ISIL has been moving much of its leadership and heavy weapons out of the city of Raqqa because they had been expecting a U.S. airstrike. President Obama announced on Sept. 10 that U.S. forces might target ISIL inside Syria. Obama declared that the United States would "degrade and ultimately destroy" the militant group.
