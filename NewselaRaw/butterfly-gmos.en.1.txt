WASHINGTON - The monarch butterfly has ignited a bitter debate between environmentalists and Monsanto Company.

The butterfly's rapid population decline in the United States has provoked environmental protection and food-safety groups to seek federal protections for the species. The groups claim that the federal government needs to more aggressively protect the butterfly and its habitat. Currently, the butterfly does not hold a special Fish and Wildlife Service protection designation.

Last year, the population of the monarch butterfly in the United States fell to 90 percent below its 20-year average. The dramatic drop has caught the attention of coalitions that are eager to halt the trend.

The proliferation of genetically engineered crops and herbicides is to blame for the unprecedented population decline, these groups say.

A coalition of various environmental stakeholders is asking the Fish and Wildlife Service to issue an endangered species designation to the monarch. The petitioners specifically blame Monsanto Company's Roundup herbicide and Roundup Ready crops.

## Where Has All The Milkweed Gone?

Monsanto is a multinational agricultural biotechnology company. They produce genetically engineered seeds and pesticides.

However, in a joint statement issued by the Center for Biological Diversity, the Center for Food Safety and the Xerces Society, environmentalists claim that this genetic manufacturing is disturbing the life cycles of monarchs.

"The vast majority of genetically engineered crops are made to be resistant to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, a uniquely potent killer of milkweed, the monarch caterpillar's only food," they said.

According to the statement, "the dramatic surge in Roundup use with Roundup Ready crops has virtually wiped out milkweed plants in Midwestern corn and soybean fields."

A Monsanto spokeswoman, Charla Lord, was quick to defend Monsanto's practice and point out that there is no single culprit behind the population decline. She cited a number of "inter-related factors" including the weather, logging practices in Mexico, and land use changes, as reasons for the decline in milkweed plants in North America.

She also added that Monsanto would help "restore habitat that supports the monarch migration."

## Climate Change Even Touches Butterflies

Indeed, modern society imposes many threats on the delicate species. Climate change, including waves of heat and drought, affects habitats and food sources for butterflies. Additionally, urban sprawl and logging can affect the wintering grounds for these insects.

According to the petition, the butterfly's population has dropped significantly over the last 15 years. In the 1990s, there was an estimated high of 1 billion monarchs. But in 2013, the number had plummeted to 35 million.

"We're at risk of losing a symbolic backyard beauty that has been part of the childhood of every generation," said Tierra Curry, a scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.

## Winter Could Help The Monarchs

Curry does offer a thread of hope.

Good weather this winter, she says, may boost numbers. An organization called Monarch Watch does a survey and count of the population each winter. The hope is that researchers will see an upward turn in numbers by then.

Regardless, the environmental groups remain anxious for the verdict on their submitted petition.

The Fish and Wildlife Service agency is required by federal regulations to respond within 90 days.
