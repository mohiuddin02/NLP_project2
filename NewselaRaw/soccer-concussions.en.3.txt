LOS ANGELESâ€”Heading the ball is an important skill in soccer. But a new study shows it may be a risky one. Players who used their heads to hit the ball a lot were more likely to injure their brains and have memory problems than players who did it less, the study showed.

Sports like tackle football and hockey get most of the attention when it comes to [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) and other types of serious brain injury. A concussion is caused by a jarring hit to the head.

But soccer is a very physical sport where the head can be as important as the foot.

Still, research has not linked heading to concussions. So players, coaches and doctors have not paid much attention to the health risks of the move.

## Studying A Group Of Adult Players

Many people cannot believe that minor injuries can be a problem, said Dr. Michael Lipton. He works at Albert Einstein College of Medicine where he studies brain injuries. Lipton wrote a report about the study.

Lipton said he hasn't headed a ball himself since he played soccer as a kid. But he is very interested in how the effects of repeated brain injuries add up. Soccer was a good sport for his research. People are going to head the ball and you can count how many times they do.

 Lipton and the people he worked with talked to soccer players from New York City. They took pictures of the players' brains. They asked the players how often they played soccer. They wanted to know how often they headed the ball. They also gave the players a number of  tests. The tests measured how different parts of the brain worked.

They divided the players into three groups, depending on how much they headed the ball.  Players who headed the ball the most had the lowest scores on memory tests. They also had the worst health for something called "white matter." The billions of nerve fibers that connect different parts of the brain are white matter. Bad measurements of white matter health have also been found in people who have suffered concussions.

Lipton and his team did not find a connection between heading and players' attention spans. They did not find a connection with the ability to do things that involved difficult thinking, either.

## A "Head Count" Suggested

Simply heading a ball did not lead to more injury.  Players could safely head the ball 885 to 1,550 times a year without having white matter problems. It took almost 1,800 headers for players to have trouble with their memory.

There were some players below those levels who showed problems. So some people may be more sensitive to heading the ball.

Lipton said players should not ignore the possible risks of heading the ball too many times.

He suggests that soccer start keeping a "head count" to monitor the number of headers the players use in a given game. The head count would be like the "pitch count" in baseball. Teams use that to make sure that pitchers do not throw too many pitches in one game.

Practice is also important to consider, Lipton said. There are usually more headers in practice than in games.

So should famous soccer player David Beckham have worn a helmet? Not so fast, Lipton said.

## More Research On The Way

Scientists cannot say for sure if heading the ball a lot injures your brain or gives you memory problems, he said. The study was based on a small number of players. Most were men. The time period of the study was short.

More research is on the way. The government recently gave Lipton's team $3 million to study the matter further.

In the meantime, there's an easy solution if you're worried about heading the ball too much: try out for goalie.
