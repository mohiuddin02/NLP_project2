WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” President Barack Obama announced Friday that he will not approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline project. The project was conceived as a way to bring large quantities of Canadian oil into the United States. Because the pipeline would cross the U.S. border, the president has the power to block it.

Many people are opposed to the pipeline because of the kind of oil it would carry: so-called tar sand oil. Tar sand oil is oil that is trapped in sand. For it to be removed, the sand has to be heated enough for the oil to melt out, a process that can be highly damaging to the environment.

In addition, many believe the United States should be using less oil, not looking for new sources of it. Scientists say fossil fuels like oil are the major cause of global warming, also known as climate change. Experts believe the steady rise in global temperatures is creating extremely serious environmental problems, including droughts, fires and rising sea levels. As a result, many environmental activists support a switch to cleaner sources of energy. Such alternative sources include solar power and wind power.

## Obama: Economic Benefits Were Minor In The Long Run

Obama said the Keystone project would not be good for the United States. He dismissed its possible benefits in creating jobs and helping the economy as being minor in the long run.

The president said he hoped his decision would end the long-running political fight over the pipeline.

The pipeline project was conceived almost 10 years ago. It was intended as a way to carry more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Canada through the United States. Over time, it grew into a political symbol. Opponents saw it as an example of oil companies behaving irresponsibly. Backers saw resistance to the project as environmentalists going too far.

Opponents have long warned that tar sands oil mining is harmful to wildlife and people. Construction of the pipeline would lock the United States into dependence on a destructive and hard-to-get-at form of oil, foes said.

Meanwhile, supporters said the pipeline project would have many economic benefits. They pointed to the jobs that the construction of the pipeline would create. However, a government study found that the pipeline would create only about 35 permanent jobs after construction was complete.

## An Important Step To Take

On Friday, Obama said the years of fighting over the pipeline hid the fact that Keystone is not as significant as it was made out to be. The pipeline would not create many new jobs, as some claim it would, Obama said. At the same time, he said, it also would not lead to the "climate disaster" predicted by others.

Despite this, Obama said rejecting the pipeline project was an important step to take. His decision to block it shows the U.S. is serious about fighting global warming, he said.

"We are continuing to lead by example," Obama said. If world leaders are going to protect the environment, he said, "we're going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them."

## Curbing Global Warming

A major international climate summit will be taking place in Paris next month. Obama and other world leaders are expected to agree on major new efforts to curb global warming. Any such efforts will probably involve pledges to cut back on the use of fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas.

America must hold itself to "the same high standards to which we hold the rest of the world," the president said.

Obama explained his decision earlier Friday to Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister. Trudeau supports the pipeline but has said he would take steps to limit any possible environmental damage.

## Environmentalists Celebrate

Obama's decision swiftly drew a wide range of responses. Leading environmentalists celebrated the president's move. Several said organized opposition in this country might have shaped the president's decision.

"The power of the American people decisively beat out the fossil fuel special interests," said Tom Steyer, a California billionaire. Steyer has poured tens of millions of dollars into fighting climate change. The pipeline project once seemed like a sure thing, he said, but a movement developed that refused to accept it.

Bill McKibben, co-founder of the environmental group 350.org, said environmentalists are "well aware that the next president could undo all this." However, he added, "this is a day of celebration."

## A "Troubling" Decision

Pipeline backers said Obama had given in to pressure from wrongheaded environmentalists.

Obama's decision proves he is not looking out for the ordinary working man, union leader Terry O'Sullivan claimed. He represents the type of workers who might have built the Keystone. The president cares more about pleasing environmentalists than about creating desperately needed jobs, O'Sullivan said.

Republican congressman Kevin McCarthy called the long wait for a decision "troubling."

The president's way of handling the matter and his final decision reveal "a lack of leadership when facing tough issues," McCarthy said.
