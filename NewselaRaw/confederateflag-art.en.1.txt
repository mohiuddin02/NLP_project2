ORANGEBURG, S.C. — Leo Twiggs' paintings could be considered controversial by some. Shadowy Confederate flags and faceless men with bulls-eyes on their backs are a few of the haunting images he has developed living as a black man in the South.

If some see the work as divisive, that is not at all Twiggs' intention. The 80-year-old South Carolina artist says he hopes the art sparks thoughtful reactions and helps people understand their shared history, even for those outside the South.

"This Confederate flag, the Civil War, they are part of the history of all of us," Twiggs said. "You take the stars off the bars, and it becomes a cross, maybe a railroad crossing. It can become a crossing over," something that we recall, but also "cross over" and perhaps move past.

## His Best Year Yet

Jovial and chatty at his Orangeburg studio, Twiggs said he is enjoying his best year as an artist. He has had more than 70 solo shows over his career, and three new shows recently opened in his home state.

Two of the new shows highlight his use of Confederate flags, which are rendered in red, white, or blue and smudged with brown or blood-red splotches. In several, the outlines of brown figures float in the background. Many flags are tattered, looking tired and rough. A black cow stands watch in some, recalling an animal Twiggs cared for as a child, growing up in racially segregated St. Stephens.

"We were poor, but we had dignity," Twiggs said of his childhood. "Ours was a struggle that speaks to a struggle experienced by all mankind."

## The Image Becomes His Own

Gallery owner Sandy Rupp said Twiggs has been exploring flag images since the 1970s.

"He's not trying to divide everybody," Rupp said. "He sees it as a historic symbol, a symbol of white supremacy that he makes into his own — he makes it his flag, and gives it his power."

As the smell of hot wax fills the room, Twiggs uses a metal pen-like tool to drip warm wax on a rough piece of fabric. He colors it with hand-mixed vegetable dyes, and then removes the wax with an iron, repeating the process over and over. It takes up to a month to complete each composition.

Museum director William Eiland said that for many in the South, the flag represents "an unrepentant South, perhaps a South rising again."

He added, "But Leo takes that image and lets it mutate, change, degrade, adapt, into an image that becomes part of his experience."

## "We All Have Things To Fear"

Other themes fill Twiggs' work. The rebel Confederate flag morphs into a white railroad crossing sign, symbolizing the tracks that divide many rural Southern towns, and many white and black neighborhoods. Black mothers from long ago — the ancestors of today's black Americans — pose in their Sunday-best clothes. White boss men in wide-brimmed hats stand over ghostly black and white figures.

Twiggs said his "Targeted Man" series of faceless men bearing bulls-eyes harkens back to the Ku Klux Klan using white robes and burning torches "to try to scare us." Once the nation came under attack during the Sept. 11, 2001, terror strikes, however, Twiggs said he realized the images also symbolize something broader: "We are all targeted, we all have things to fear."
