PHOENIX â€” Retired surgeon Peter Rork feels like Santa Claus with his sled.

"I've got all kinds of goodies in back of my plane," Rork said.

Rork's co-pilot is Doyle, his black Labrador retriever. His sled is a Cessna airplane. And his precious cargo sometimes barks.

Rork and Doyle, who live together in Jackson Hole, Wyo., spend their free time flying dogs and cats around the country. Their last flight in March included 30 small dogs traveling from Arizona to a shelter in Idaho.

## Dog Is My CoPilot

Rork's organization, Dog Is My CoPilot, is one of several groups around the country that take dogs by car and plane from one state to another. When there are too many types of animals abandoned in one part of the country, the groups take them to another part. The fear is if there are too many dogs of a certain breed, not all of them will be adopted and some of them may be put to sleep.

On trips out of Arizona, the breed usually filling Rork's plane is Chihuahuas.

There are too many Chihuahuas in Arizona, said Melissa Gable. She is the spokeswoman for the Maricopa County Animal Care and Control shelter. "Sending them some place where they might not have as many Chihuahuas certainly means they'll get adopted a lot quicker than they would if they stayed here."

In February, Arizona Chihuahua Rescue worked with Animal Care and Control. It transferred 25 Chihuahuas to an animal rescue group in Pennsylvania.

Judy Zimet is a Phoenix lawyer and the executive director of Dog Is My CoPilot. The group flies dogs to 10 states in the Western U.S. Since it was founded two years ago, Rork has flown more than 1,000 animals to no-kill shelters in other states. A no-kill shelter will not kill animals to make room for new animals when the shelter is full.

How the breeds are chosen comes down to supply and demand, Zimet said. In some states, the groups take big breeds from shelters and transfer them to cities that don't have them. San Francisco, for instance, may not have a lot of large, floppy-eared breeds.

## "Chihuahua Country"

Maricopa County sends many small dogs to out-of-state rescue groups.

"Arizona is specifically Chihuahua country for us," Zimet said.

"Before we were bringing dogs, people would go to the shelter and they wouldn't find what they wanted. And they'd end going to the puppy mills or they'd go on Craigslist or to breeders," she said. Puppy mills are dog breeding centers that have the reputation for putting profits over the health of the animals. "But now people can find what they need at the shelters, and that way we help reduce overpopulation," she said.

Kari Nienstedt is the Arizona director for the Humane Society of the United States. She said transporting animals to other regions is a national trend.

"I think it really kicked into high gear after Hurricane Katrina," Nienstedt said. Hurricane Katrina was a monster hurricane that hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005. Many pets were separated from their owners or were abandoned. After that, people realized some areas had too many pets and other areas too few.

"Up North there are a lack of puppies and small dogs. So sometimes they're shipping from South to North, sometimes they're shipping from West to East," she said. "It's a great opportunity to reduce euthanasia (killing animals) in some of these cities."

## "A Labor Of Love"

Michael Morefield is the shelter manager at the Arizona Animal Welfare League. Maricopa County has the second-largest rate of euthanasia for cats and dogs in the country. The first is Los Angeles County.

Morefield said Chihuahuas and pit bulls are the most common breed put down in Arizona.

In 2012, he said, 2,476 Chihuahuas were euthanized.

"It's massive; we have a very serious problem in Maricopa," he said.

"One of our dogs that was taken to Canada lasted three hours before he was adopted," he said.

Jonathan McDonell is with HALO Animal Rescue. He said working with Dog Is My CoPilot has been tremendously successful.

He called it "a fantastic opportunity." The group helps HALO get dogs that have been there awhile into communities that really want them.

Leigh Carter also works at HALO. She said 12 of the 30 dogs that were sent to Idaho last Friday have been adopted.

Rork, who supports Dog Is My CoPilot mainly himself, said he knows the animals he leaves behind likely won't survive. So he tries to pack as many dogs into the plane as possible.

"It's like a puzzle trying get all the crates in the plane," he said. "It really is a labor of love and money, but I enjoy it."
