NEW YORK — Most Americans born since the mid-1960s have a favorite "Sesame Street" skit. Jennifer Kotler Clarke watched hers on a black-and-white television set in her family's apartment.

There were two aliens: One of them had long arms that didn't move, while the other had short, moving arms. The aliens wished to eat apples from a tree, and they succeeded, after a couple of minutes, by working together. "Let's call this cooperation," one of them says. "No," the other replies, "let's call it Shirley."

Clarke grew up to be one of the show's vice presidents, and she has long believed that the program's laughs and lessons stick with children. Now, important academic research appears to back her up.

The biggest study ever done on the influence of "Sesame Street" was just completed. It finds that the famous show on public TV has had lasting educational benefits for millions of American children. The study claims the show's benefits are as powerful as the ones children get from going to preschool.

## More Children Stayed At Grade Level

The research was done by the University of Maryland's Melissa Kearney and Wellesley College's Phillip Levine. The authors found that the show has left children more likely to stay at the correct grade level for their age. This effect is seen most among boys, African-Americans and children who grow up in poorer areas.

After "Sesame Street" started, children living in places where they could watch the show started doing better at school. The researchers saw a drop in a student's likelihood of being behind in the classroom. Levine and Kearney note how Head Start, the pre-kindergarten program for low-income Americans, delivers a similar benefit.

They think "Sesame Street's" focus on presenting viewers with academic lessons was important, too. With a heavy focus on reading and math, the TV show appears to have helped prepare children for school.

It might seem strange that a TV show could have such effects. The results, however, build on studies done during the 1960s that found big short-term benefits in watching the show. There have also been years of studies of groups of children, called "focus groups," by the team of academic researchers who help write "Sesame Street" scripts. Several other researchers have reviewed the study, and none are known to have questioned its results.

## Could "Sesame Street" Replace Preschool?

The results also raise an interesting question, at a time when many lawmakers are pushing to spend more money on early-childhood education: Do kids need preschool if a TV show works just as well?

Yes, say economists, experts who offer advice on how money is best spent. The "Sesame Street" educational team agrees. The study's authors believe Head Start was designed to provide more than an educational boost: It delivers family support, medical and dentist services, and helps kids to develop emotional skills they need so they can be social.

Levine and Kearney see the study as a clear lesson in the value of a TV show as a very cheap addition to what preschool offers. One large implication they take from the study isn't about early-childhood education. It's about college, and the move toward low-cost massive open online courses, or MOOCs.

The authors think that "Sesame Street" was the original MOOC. "If we can do this with 'Sesame Street' on television, we can potentially do this with all sorts of electronic communications," Kearney said in an interview.

## First Educational Program For Children

"Sesame Street" started in 1969. Back then it had a mixed cast of humans and brightly colored fuzzy Muppets. The cast included Oscar the Grouch, Bert and Ernie, and, of course, Big Bird. It was the country's first specifically educational children's program, and it was an immediate hit. In the early 1970s, one-third of all American toddlers watched it.

That's the kind of share of American viewers that the Super Bowl gets. It's even more interesting, though, because another third of the nation's toddlers couldn't have watched the show if they wanted to. They didn't have the right kind of antenna to tune in to their local public television station.

## Show Focused On Low-Income City Kids

From the start, the program used academic subjects designed to help children. They particularly focused on low-income kids living in cities who were preparing for school.

At first the writers focused on basics: letters, numbers, cooperation. Over the years they expanded to include research on what children needed to succeed in the classroom and in life. "We're constantly changing the show, for good reasons," said Rosemarie Truglio, who helps design the educational content for "Sesame Street."

Kearney grew up loving "Sesame Street," and Levine, her co-author on the study, was of school age when the show hit the air. Kearney remembers running through her house with her sisters, singing a Big Bird song about the alphabet. Her favorite character was the Count — the one who most resembled an economist.
