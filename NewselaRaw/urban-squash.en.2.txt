PHILADELPHIA â€” A funny thing happened to Sakora Miller on the way to gym class.

Miller was a seventh-grader in a tough West Philadelphia neighborhood. She remembers being puzzled when a group of strangers visited her gym class and offered to teach the kids a sport.

Everyone already knew how to play basketball, the most popular game in the neighborhood, she remembered thinking. What else is there?

"They were like, (it's) squash," she said. "And I was like, I'm not learning that. It's not for me."

Miller turned out to be pretty good at it. Now, she's just become the first former student hired full-time at SquashSmarts, the after-school program she joined as a seventh-grader in 2004.

## Serving It Up

Inner cities are not the typical place you usually find a squash program. The game is played with a racquet, like racquetball. But it's often considered a sport for the wealthy. Yet SquashSmarts is among 15 clubs around the country using the game to help low-income students through exercise and educational support.

Interest is growing. The clubs serve about 1,400 city students around the country. That's just a small part of the total number of kids in school. But they get tutoring and travel opportunities that most kids in inner-city neighborhoods just dream about. Supporters hope to start four more programs this year.

"The (basic idea) is inch-wide, mile-deep," said Tim Wyant, executive director of the New York-based National Urban Squash and Education Association.

The popularity of squash has grown dramatically in the U.S. The number of players rose from about 600,000 in 2007 to nearly 1.3 million in 2012.

Internationally, it's seen as a regular game played by millions of people in about 185 countries. But the sport took a different path here. In the U.S., squash is played mostly by wealthy fans in private sports clubs and schools.

Today, many squash lovers like that it's not just a game for the rich anymore, Wyant said.

## Idea Bounces Around

The first inner-city program was began by a former squash teacher in Boston in 1995. The program combined fitness with tutoring to keep at-risk students from dropping out of school. Over the next 10 years, the idea spread to Philadelphia and both the Bronx and Harlem neighborhoods of New York.

Program growth was aided by a lucky accident. The U.S. started to use International squash rules, which required building larger courts. And that left a lot of unused smaller courts, which weren't needed anymore, at many universities, said Kevin Klipstein, president of U.S. Squash, the game's governing body.

Without the new rules, it may have been hard for the programs to get access to the old courts,  Klipstein said.

In 2005, the inner-city groups formed a squash association to organize games and create programs. The association receives some support from U.S. Squash. It later added 11 clubs and now plans to start programs in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Hartford, Conn., and the South American country of Columbia.

In Philadelphia, about 120 students in fifth through 12th grade belong to SquashSmarts. The program provides kids with all their uniforms, equipment and snacks. People and foundations give nearly all the money needed to run the club, executive director Stephen Gregg said. SquashSmarts spends $570,000 each year on its programs.

Students play on courts at Drexel University and at the Lenfest Center. Lenfest is a gleaming building that is located in the tough Hunting Park neighborhood.

## "And Then I Tried It"

SquashSmarts finds its players in public schools. The school district encourages students to participate, because it doesn't have much money to offer such unusual sports, said Robert Coleman, who is in charge of athletics.

SquashSmarts staff members still get a puzzled reaction when they tell kids about the sport. But they gain new players all the same.

Joshua Smith, 13, was one of the doubters when SquashSmarts staff visited his middle school last year. His first thought was, "What is squash? That's stupid."

"And then I tried it," the eighth-grader said, "and I love it now."

SquashSmarts tracks participants' heart health, grade-point averages and college attendance. The district has a big high school dropout rate. But everyone who has stayed in the club for seven years has graduated on time and been accepted to college, Gregg said.

Being able to hire Miller as squash director brings the program full circle, he said. Miller is now 23 and finishing an online degree from Penn State.

When a SquashSmarts student grows up to become the head of the program, said Gregg, "that, to me, is change in a community."
