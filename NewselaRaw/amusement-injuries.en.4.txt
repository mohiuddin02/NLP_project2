Roller coasters may look scary. They may seem dangerous.

But problems on roller coasters are rare. And when they do happen, the most common ones aren't serious. They include fainting, or feeling dizzy. Some people felt like they might throw up.

This comes from a report on amusement parks by the Los Angeles Times. The newspaper looked at 57 theme parks in Southern California. About 2,100 people said they got hurt or sick on the rides. This was from 2007 to 2012.

People complained most about motion sickness. They passed out, felt sick to their stomachs, or felt dizzy from the ride's motion. Back and neck problems ranked second. Head injuries came in third.

The parks reported about 350 injuries each year. Over 40 million people visited the parks yearly.

## Roller Coasters And Water Slides

The newspaper discovered:

—More women reported problems than men. Most of them came from roller coasters and water slides.

—Many of the visitors already had health problems.

—More people got hurt on older rides.

In 2000, California said amusement parks must report when people get hurt or sick. This came after someone was killed at Disneyland.

The ride with the most problems was Space Mountain. It is a roller coaster at Disney. About 120 people said they were hurt on it in six years.

One of the riders was Adrienne Sacks from Maryland. Sacks threw up after riding Disneyland's Space Mountain in 2012. She said she was never so sick in her life.

Disney says its rides are safe.

Space Mountain opened 37 years ago. Its age may be the reason for its number of problems. Older rides seem to cause more injuries. Most of the problem rides are more than 20 years old. Only one was built in the last 10 years.

Dennis Speigel is an expert on ride safety. Rides are safer than they used to be, he said.
