KABUL, Afghanistan -- Mohammad Aziz Ayob is planting a tree. Two helicopters fly over him. He is wearing his Boy Scout uniform. That is very dangerous in Afghanistan. Someone might think he is a soldier. Ayob wears the uniform anyway.

Ayob is 18 and lives with his aunt. His parents died when he was young. He can't afford to go to high school. There are no jobs for him. But he is happy when he puts on his Scout shirt.

"I love my uniform; it makes me feel proud," said Ayob. "Scouts are like my family."

Afghanistan has been a dangerous place for a long time. Scout leaders say young people can help to heal the country. And not just by planting trees. They will also grow up to be leaders.

The Scout saying is "Be Prepared." This means a lot in Afghanistan. Here, Scouts risk death to go to meetings. They learn how to spot bombs in first aid class.

## Keeping Girl Scouts Safe

Afghan Girl Scouts don't go camping or hiking. They stay indoors because of the danger. For example, they volunteer in hospitals.

"It's hard to let the girls do everything," said Mohammad Tamim Hamkar. He runs the scouting program.

Leaders say the Afghan girls make great scouts. That's because the girls don't have many chances to do things in Afghanistan. Women and girls are not allowed to go to many places.

Girls feel strong wearing a Scout uniform, said Keith Blackey. He is American; he is helping the Scouts.

Shy girls change when they put on the uniform. It's like a superhero wearing a cape, he said. Like Wonder Woman.

## A Hard History

Things have been hard for Scouts in Afghanistan. Scouting started there in 1931. It has been banned many times. Sometimes, Scouts were even told to spy on their parents.

A group called Parsa started the Scouts in 2009. It wants to teach kids leadership.

Hamkar said that some of the Scout uniforms are very old. Some of the books are unfinished. There is very little money to go around. Right now, scouting gets donations from other countries.

But there are now 1,062 scouts. It hopes to have 1,500 Scouts signed up by the end of 2013.

## Cleaning Mosques

Terrorists attack people who work with foreigners. This could be dangerous for Afghan scouts. Scouting has links with western countries.

Anyone connected with foreigners could be a target, said Marnie Gustavson. She is the head of Parsa.

Scouts work hard to make Scouting a part of Afghan life. They clean mosques where Afghans pray.

## Scouting Is Important

Scouts had to hide their uniforms during the bad years in Afghanistan. Scout trainer Gul Ahmad Mustafa was afraid to wear his. But he peeked in the drawer to remember better times.

Mike Farrar is American. He helps to train Afghan Scouts. He believes the program is important to the country.

If the terrorists come back, Scouting will go away, he said. But if they don't, Afghanistan will join in on Scouting.
