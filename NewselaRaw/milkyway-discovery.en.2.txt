MILWAUKEE — A team of Wisconsin scientists has stitched together a dramatic new 360-degree view of the Milky Way galaxy. Showing our spiral-shaped galaxy from every direction, the view reveals never-before-seen details.

Galaxies are collections of stars held together by gravity — plus the planets, gasses and space dust in between them. Earth is located halfway between the middle and the outer edge of the Milky Way galaxy. It's just one of many galaxies that make up our universe.

The new galactic view, which was unveiled on Thursday, is known as GLIMPSE360. It is made up of about 2.5 million images collected by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. The Spitzer telescope has been orbiting in space and mapping the galaxy for more than 10 years.

Spitzer is an infrared telescope — that is, it records images that are detectable in infrared light. This allows astronomers to see much that isn't visible in ordinary light: Infrared telescopes can cut through clouds of space dust that had blocked our view.

Thanks to Spitzer, scientists have been able to study much that was previously hidden in the Milky Way. More than 200 million new stars have been identified.

And now thanks to GLIMPSE360, scientists can easily examine the structure of the Milky Way, said astronomer Edward Churchwell. They can see how many spiral arms it has, where they are and how far out they extend.

Viewers can even zero in on particular objects by using a zoom feature.

## Learning About The Creation Of Stars

The infrared images provide indisputable evidence that a large bar structure consisting of millions of stars runs like a straight line through the center of the Milky Way. This structure extends out to about 12,000 to 13,000 light years from the galaxy's center. One light year equals around 6 trillion miles.

"We can see stars being born," Churchwell said. "We don't really understand the details of how stars are born." But by identifying stars "in the process of forming," scientists can start to learn about how stars are created, he said.

Just where stars are churned out also may become better understood now.

"We can see every star-forming region in the plane of the galaxy," said scientist Robert Benjamin.

And the new view gives scientists some idea of the growth rate of the Milky Way, said Barb Whitney, one of the leaders of the GLIMPSE team. "It tells us how many stars are forming each year."

The general location of stars in the galaxy also is now visible.

The 360-degree view will also help astronomers gain a deeper understanding of the dust that lies between the stars and planets and us, Churchwell said.

But the new galactic view also uncovers new puzzles to be solved. The infrared images, for example, revealed that interstellar space is filled with patches of a gas known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

## Spitzer's Mission Accomplished

"They are brightest around regions of star formation but detectable throughout the disk of the Milky Way," Churchwell said. "They're floating out in the middle of interstellar space where they have no business being. It raises the question of how they were formed."

Sent into space in 2003, the Spitzer Space Telescope has far exceeded its planned two-and-a-half-year lifespan. The telescope remains in orbit, sending back infrared images. It can't last forever, however: It will eventually stop working once the liquid helium that cools its cameras runs out.

More than 600 scientific papers already have been published using the information from Spitzer.

Churchwell figures that the information will keep astronomers busy for many years.

"It's still up there," Churchwell said. "It's done what we wanted it to do, which is to provide" astronomers a huge chunk of new information to study.
