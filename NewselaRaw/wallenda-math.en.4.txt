CHICAGO â€” Nik Wallenda is a tightrope walker. He has such good balance that he can walk across a thin wire without falling. The wires, or "tightropes," can be set up almost anywhere.

The tightropes that Wallenda walks across go between buildings, hundreds of feet above the ground. There are no nets to catch him if he falls. Sometimes he walks on wires with his eyes closed.

Last Sunday, Wallenda broke a world record. He walked across a wire between two huge skyscrapers in Chicago. The wire was about 500 feet above the ground. Not only that, the tightrope was not flat. It curved as it went up.

## How Steep Was It?

Mathematicians measure steepness with angles. A 0-degree angle is a flat line. A 90-degree angle is a line that goes straight up. Wallenda said that his tightrope went upward at a 19-degree angle.

A class of 10th- and 11th-grade math students at Hinsdale South High School near Chicago took a look at Wallenda's numbers. Some of the numbers did not add up.

The mystery began on Monday, the day after Wallenda set his record. Math teacher Linda Korbus gave the class a fun project. She asked her students to figure out the angle of Wallenda's tightrope for themselves.

## Checking The Numbers Carefully

The students knew that Marina City was 588 feet tall. The Leo Burnett Building was 671 feet tall. They also knew that Wallenda walked 454 feet across. They just needed to figure out what the angle was. How steep was Wallenda's walk?

Their answer was 10.5 degrees. It was almost 9 degrees less steep than what Wallenda's team said the angle was.

Korbus said that she was surprised. She expected the class to arrive at the same answer as the Wallenda team.

Korbus checked the math herself. She got the same answer as her class. She said the tightrope could not have been 19 degrees.

She and her students were confused. Were their numbers wrong?

As it turned out, Korbus' class and Wallenda were both correct.

## Understanding The Different Angles

Because of gravity, tightrope wires dip in the middle. This means that the steepness of Wallenda's wire changed in different places, because the wire was curved. After sagging in the middle, the wire curved upward, making it more steep.

Korbus' students did the math thinking that they were going to draw a straight line. Instead, tightrope wires are U-shaped.

Smaller wires were also attached to Wallenda's tightrope to keep it from moving. Along with gravity, these wires pulled down on the middle of a tightrope. As a result, they made the second half of the walk steeper.

As a result, Korbus' class project turned out to be tricky. The angle of the wire was different at some points along the way. This is why Korbus and her class got a different answer than Wallenda. She said her class will do more math problems with the high-wire numbers.

In addition to setting a world record for the highest incline tightrope walk, Wallenda also set a world record for the highest blindfolded tightrope walk.
