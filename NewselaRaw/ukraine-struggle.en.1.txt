SLOVYANSK, Ukraine — The farmer walked slowly up the hill toward her barn, as her driver followed behind her in a minivan. She waved her arms at Ukrainian soldiers guarding a nearby television tower. She knew her vehicle might look suspicious and hoped her desperate signals would convince the soldiers she meant no harm.

The soldiers had taken back control of the tower from gunmen two days before. It was a small battle in a conflict that has turned this town — and much of eastern Ukraine — into a battleground between pro-Russia separatists and Ukraine's struggling government.

Ukraine is an unstable country with two fighting sides. Ukraine used to be a part of the Soviet Union, a large country that included Russia. The Soviet Union had a Communist government and broke apart in 1991.

Some Russian-speakers in Ukraine want to be a part of Russia again, but many fear it. The disagreement has caused outbreaks of violent protests throughout the country, causing Ukraine's president to flee. A new government was put in place temporarily while Ukrainians wait for elections.

## Caught In The Middle

Caught between two fighting sides, farmer Inna Zakharova — like so many Ukrainians in the east — is struggling to go on with life amid the chaos and violence.

"My season plans go down the drain with this war," Zakharova, 35, said Sunday. She has almost 50 acres of "local land to plant onions, potatoes, cabbages and carrots, but my seasonal workers are afraid to come to Slovyansk now."

Zakharova's farm has been a success since she started it in the late 1990s. The fertile black soil of eastern Ukraine makes it easy to plant her crops. Now, as the separatists in her area of Slovyansk are surrounded by Ukrainian security forces, her whole farm is at risk of collapse.

"I am not involved in politics, I am an ordinary woman and an ordinary farmer," Zakharova said. "Why do they have to turn this land into a battlefield?"

Vitaly Kolesnik, the supply chief for the Slovyansk electrical district, asked himself a similar question as he drove back down the hill at full speed. He was just trying to reach the television tower when soldiers threatened to shoot him if he came any closer.

Kolesnik wanted to see what was wrong with the power line near the television tower. The tower appeared to have been damaged during the fighting two days earlier, cutting off power supplies to at least three suburbs.

"When I approached their position, they pointed a large-caliber machine gun at me and told me to get the hell out of there," Kolesnik said, breathing heavily from stress and frustration. "I explained to them my mission and the plight of the residents sitting without electricity in such hot weather, but they wouldn't listen!"

He added, "I am giving up on that one." Kolesnik wiped sweat from his balding head before driving away. "I do care about the local people, but I am not ready to risk my life for their want of comfort."

## Fighting At A Television Tower

The fighting in Slovyansk came to a relative lull on Sunday. Meanwhile, other cities in Ukraine saw fighting. A crowd of more than 2,000 pro-Russia separatists seized the military prosecutor's office in Donetsk, one of the last key official sites in the city still in the hands of the country's temporary government.

In Odessa, a violent clash triggered a fire that left 43 people dead Friday. At the same time, a police station was surrounded by several hundred separatists demanding the release of protesters arrested during the earlier fighting. In the end, police released 67 people.

Pro-Russia armed gunmen seized Slovyansk on April 12. They overtook the television tower a week ago, switching off Ukrainian TV channels and turning on Russian ones instead.

Ukrainian troops wrestled the tower back in a gunfight, restoring Ukrainian broadcasts. It was a battle for propaganda fought with gunfire.

For residents of Andreyevka, a Slovyansk suburb, who controls the tower doesn't really matter: With no electricity, they can't watch either Russian or Ukrainian television.

Dozens of fallen trees, along with piles of auto tires and ancient trucks, block the narrow streets of Slovyansk. The few cars trying to make their way through town take to the sidewalks or what's left of the lawns.

A minibus with a Russian flag carrying masked men with automatic rifles and grenade launchers was zigzagging around one barricade as factory worker Yuri Zakharov, 50, spat on the ground and cursed.

"These guys in masks came from nowhere and turned our lives into hell," he said.

## "These Thugs And Bandits"

Fighting in Slovyansk killed more than a dozen people and injured scores more in recent days. With Sunday's lull, a few people appeared in the streets, looking to see which shops were open. Some residents strolled with their children. Some fed pigeons on the main square, which bore the tread marks of armored vehicles.

But outside Slovyansk, troops from the Ukrainian government, army and national guard were tightening a noose around the town, manning checkpoints on every road going in and out of the city, searching vehicles and demanding to see the papers of every driver and passenger.

One soldier showed a collection of seized baseball bats — in a land where most people don't know how to play baseball. "We confiscated a sizable number of firearms too," he said proudly.

The blockade will continue to prevent the rebels from sneaking out of Slovyansk or getting reinforcements and weapons supplies, a Ukrainian troop commander said.

"We are dealing not with an army but with a relatively small number of professional Russian warriors down there," said the officer, who gave his name only as Sergei.

"I understand the residents may experience some discomfort now, but they will be the first to thank us in the end when we are done with these thugs and criminals," he said.
