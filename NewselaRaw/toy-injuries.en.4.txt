More and more American children are hurt by their toys. A new study came out from a children's hospital in Ohio. It said that between 1990 and 2011, the number of kids who got hurt by toys went up.

The study looked at kids who went to a hospital.

Kids are most often hurt by toys when they are 2 years old. More than half of the kids hurt were under 5 years old.

## Playing Safely

Most of the time kids play safely with their toys and do not get hurt.

Not always, though.

Many kids get hurt by falling off scooters. Kids push scooters with their feet. Then they climb on top and ride them. Toy-makers call the scooter a "ride-on" toy. Other ride-on toys are wagons and tricycles. Kids had many accidents with scooters between 1990 to 2011. There were more than with any other toy.

Kids who ride scooters also get hurt worse. They are more likely to break an arm or leg. They break their bones about three times as often. They also get sent to the hospital more often.

## When Accidents Happen

The scientists also found other interesting facts.

For example:

Four out of five accidents with toys happen at home.

More accidents happen to boys.

Accidents from toys were higher in the spring and summer. They were lower during the fall and winter.

Almost every kid brought to the emergency room was sent home quickly. They did not have to stay in the hospital.

There would be less accidents if all toys were made safer, the scientists said.
