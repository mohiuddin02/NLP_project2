WASHINGTON â€” The United States closed embassies in numerous Muslim countries and warned about travel during August. The decision, made late last week, was a reaction to what it said was intelligence showing the threat of an attack.

The action added new fuel to the debate of the National Security Agency's collection of cellphone records and information about what Web sites people look at. The embassies are where the official U.S. representative to a country works. The closings are temporary.

Congressional supporters of the NSA said the latest warnings of unspecified threats showed that the programs were necessary. Opponents said there was no evidence linking the programs to the vague warnings of possible terrorist attacks.

The debate was held across the Sunday television talk shows.

## Al-Qaida Communication Intercepted

"Al-Qaida is on the rise in this part of the world and the NSA program is proving its worth yet again," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN's "State of the Union."

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., took the opposite position. The program that has caused the most concern in Congress -- one that collects a host of information about cellphone use --  was not important for detecting al-Qaida's plans in this case, he said.

 "There's no indication, unless I'm proved wrong later, that that program ... contributed to information about this particular plot," Schiff said.

There were no reports of violence or unusual activity Sunday in any of the countries where U.S. embassies were kept closed.

The embassy closings and travel warning were the result of an intercepted communication between top officials of the terror group al-Qaida, said an official who had been briefed on the matter in Yemen.

Al-Qaida leader Ayman al Zawahiri gave "clear orders" to the head of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula to carry out an attack, the official said. He said he could not give any details about the plot. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is based in Yemen.

## NSA Collects Cellphone, Internet Data

Embassies were temporarily closed in Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq and more than a dozen other countries. Some were set to reopen on Monday.

The last major attack by Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula occurred in Yemen's Sanaa in May 2012. A suicide bomber killed more than 100 military cadets at a rehearsal for a military parade.

"This is a good indication of why they're so important," Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Chambliss is the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He was talking about the NSA programs that gather information.

There are two programs in particular that have come under scrutiny after leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The programs operate under different parts of U.S. law.

The collection of the telephone records was authorized by a secret court. The court was set up under the Patriot Act, which was passed following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

A second program was authorized under a separate law. Under that program, the NSA collects information on Internet traffic on sites like Facebook and Yahoo. The NSA has said that only information about accounts outside the United States is collected.

## U.S. Cellphone Monitoring Under Fire

The difference between the two programs has become an important part of the NSA debate.  More and more lawmakers have proposed legislation to reform the agency's practices in collecting domestic phone information.

"Do we need to collect all of the phone records of all of the people living in America for five years so that if we're going to target one particular person we're ready to jump on it?" Senate Assistant Majority Leader Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

President Barack Obama said he was "open to suggestions" on making the NSA program more transparent in a meeting with nine members of Congress last week, according to Durbin.

But Graham seemed to indicate that the fight to curb the NSA programs is likely to be fierce.

"To the members of the Congress who want to reform the NSA program, great; but if you want to gut it, you make us much less safe and you're putting our nation at risk," he said.

The temporary embassy closings became part of the argument, despite questions about what role either program might have played, or how real the threat was.

## Unknown Role In Intercept

"The good news is that we picked up intelligence. That's what the NSA does," said Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Md. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and was speaking on ABC's "This Week."

Chambliss had a similar view. "If we did not have these programs we wouldn't be able to listen in on the bad guys," he said. The program to collect Internet information helped detect the current threat, he said.

Just what role the programs had in intercepting the communication is unknown.

In Yemen, officials said they were on high alert. But there was little evidence that anything was amiss. Traffic clogged major roads as residents prepared for the end of the fasting month of Ramadan and the coming Eid al-Fitr holiday.

Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has been the most active al-Qaida group in recent years in attempting attacks on U.S. targets. It launched an assault on the U.S. embassy in Yemen in 2008. It was also responsible for the failed 2010 Christmas Day plot to set off a bomb hidden in a passenger's underwear aboard a plane landing in Detroit.
