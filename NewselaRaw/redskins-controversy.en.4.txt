NEW YORK â€” The Oneida Indian Nation does not like the Washington Redskins team nickname. It says the term "redskins" is a terrible insult. The Oneidas have been trying to get the nickname changed.

Oneida leaders met with NFL officials on Wednesday. But they said the meeting was disappointing.

Now they want to meet with all 32 NFL owners. They want NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to be there, too. The meeting would be held during Super Bowl week.

The Oneidas want them to push Redskins owner Daniel Snyder to drop the nickname.

## Change The Mascot Campaign

Ray Halbritter is an Oneida representative. He said the meeting on Wednesday did not go like he wanted it to. "It became somewhat evident they were defending the continued use of the name. Of course, we're disappointed." Halbritter is also leader of the Change the Mascot Campaign.

The Oneida Indian Nation has about 1,000 enrolled members. It is one of 566 federally recognized independent [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) nations, according to the U.S. government.

The Oneidas consider the term "redskins" a racial epithet, or insult. Halbritter says the dictionary defines it that way.

The Oneidas asked Goodell and Snyder to "visit our homelands." They want the league to change its rules. Owners would not be able to name a team with a racial epithet.

Goodell did not attend the Wednesday meeting. The league's lawyer and other officials did.

## Part Of NFL History, Or Insult?

The league issued a statement after the meeting. "We listened and respectfully discussed the views of Mr. Halbritter" and others who came with him, the league said.

They also talked about different views that other Native Americans and fans in general have, the league said. "The meeting was part of an ongoing" discussion, it said.

President Barack Obama recently said he would "think about changing" the name if he owned the team. Since then, many fans have taken up the cause. And many more have rallied around the name. They see the name Redskins as part of league history. Or they see it as a tribute to Native Americans.

Halbritter sees it as an insult.

He referred to the team name as the "R-word" in a letter to Goodell. He said the words has destructive effects "on our people and Native peoples everywhere."

## Another Newspaper Drops Name

Halbritter also said the Oneida Indian Nation pays to support the league of the league. That would make it a sponsor. The Oneidas are concerned that the league's use of the name hurts the NFL.

Brian McCarthy is a spokesman for the NFL. He said the Oneida Indian Nation is not a league sponsor. The Oneida Indian Nation sponsors the Buffalo Bills. The Wisconsin tribe of the Oneida nation has a sponsorship deal with the Packers.

Something else happened with the Redskins name on Wednesday. The San Francisco Chronicle said it will stop using the term "Redskins" when referring to the team.

Managing Editor Audrey Cooper said the newspaper's style committee made the decision. The newspaper has a long-standing rule against using racial insults, she said.

"Not everyone has to be personally offended by a word" for it to be an insult, Cooper said in a statement. It was titled "A name unfit for print. Make no mistake, 'redskin' is a patently racist term."

Several others have made the same decision over the years. Those include the Kansas City Star, Slate.com, and the Portland Oregonian. The Oregonian dropped the term more than twenty years ago.
