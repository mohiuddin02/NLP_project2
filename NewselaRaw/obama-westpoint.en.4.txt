WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama spoke Wednesday about how he wants the U.S. to deal with other countries. He called for less dependence on military action. Obama instead promoted partnerships with other nations. He sees working with other countries as a better approach to tackling terrorism.

"This is American leadership. This is American strength," he said. Obama was speaking of efforts to work with Europe against Russia's actions in Ukraine. Another example was his goal of persuading Iran to stop seeking to build very dangerous weapons. He admitted neither crisis has yet been fixed. Obama argued, however, that there's a chance to solve them peacefully.

Obama's comments came in a speech to graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. The president used the speech to take on critics. Some have said his foreign policy scales back U.S. power. However, Obama declared that the U.S. remains necessary. And if its interests are threatened, it will strike.

"America must always lead on the world stage. If we don't, no one else will," he said. Obama told the cadets that the U.S. military "is and always will be the backbone of that leadership."

## Acting "Without Thinking"

Obama's cautious approach to conflict has been attacked lately. Critics say his approach has strengthened U.S. rivals such as Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier this year, Russia took the Crimea region of Ukraine. It's now part of Russia. The U.S. threatened to block trade with Russia, but it didn't stop Putin.

Obama argued that a military response "cannot be the only" solution to every conflict. It cannot even be just the "primary" solution.

Since World War II, he said, "some of our most costly mistakes" came from "our willingness to rush into military adventures." In those mistakes, the U.S. acted "without thinking."

The speech came a day after Obama announced U.S. forces would leave [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) before 2015. The president told the West Point cadets they would be the first graduating class since Sept. 11, 2001, not to be sent into fighting in [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq) or Afghanistan. Cadets cheered the news.

The president did pledge to work with Congress to give more help to groups opposing Syria's government. However, he has decided not to send U.S. troops to Syria. Obama defended that decision. He said there's "terrible suffering" there. But, "no military solution" can heal Syria "anytime soon."

## U.S. Can't Invade Every Country

A White House official said Obama would consider using military to help Syrian rebels. The official said Obama wanted to discuss the idea with Congress.

Obama said the threats facing the U.S. had changed. The danger now comes from small branches of terrorist networks. Many target countries where they operate – not the U.S. – the president said. But they can strike Americans overseas. He pointed to the 2012 Benghazi attacks on U.S. officials in Libya.

Obama was elected in 2008 partly because he opposed the war in Iraq. He said the U.S. can't invade every country that has terrorists hiding in them. Instead, he believes the U.S. should partner with countries fighting rebels.

To that end, he called on Congress to approve $5 billion to fight terrorism. The money would go to help countries in the Middle East and North Africa that are fighting extremists. For instance, Yemen is battling al-Qaida. It would receive money.

The Republican political party is opposed to some of Obama's policies. Obama is a Democrat. Republicans say U.S. allies are concerned. They said Obama has not followed through on his threats.

"Too often, strong words have been followed by weak actions or no actions," said Rep. Ed Royce, a Republican from California. "Our opponents do not fear U.S. warnings."
