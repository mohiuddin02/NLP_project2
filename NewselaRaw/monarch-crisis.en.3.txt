It may be the world's longest insect migration. But the monarch butterflies' journey is in danger.

Recently, the number of monarch butterflies has been falling. The overuse of weed killer, severe weather, and the destruction of forests are all to blame.

The colonies of butterflies are dense. There are as many as several million butterflies in one acre. But this year, the colonies of butterflies in central Mexico were far smaller than ever before. The orange-and-black monarch butterfly is a popular insect that most school kids can recognize. Scientists say these monarch butterfly colonies may soon disappear.

There are many possible reasons the number of monarch butterflies are falling. But scientists are focusing on one big one: Monarch butterflies can't live without a plant called milkweed. The milkweed is a broadleaf plant that's widely treated as a weed to be killed. It is sprayed with weedkiller in farmlands and along the sides of highways.

## Huge Drop In Milkweed

Female monarchs lay eggs on milkweed. When they hatch, the larvae grow into caterpillars that eat the milkweed's leaves. Those leaves contain a poison that protects the monarchs from their predators. The caterpillars then form chrysalises and soon emerge as butterflies.

U.S. fields containing milkweed have dropped over the past 10 years. Orley Taylor, a monarch expert at the University of Kansas, says the loss is huge.

New types of corn and soybeans are not hurt by the chemicals, called herbicides. So now farmers can use stronger herbicides. Before, milkweed could grow among crops or at the edges of fields. Now it can't.

The crops live "but any weeds, including milkweed, don't," said Craig Wilson, a scientist who studies monarch butterflies.

Most monarchs live only a little more than a month. But one generation each year lives seven or eight months. That is long enough to migrate to central Mexico before winter sets in. There, they often cluster around the same trees as the generations that came before them. Perhaps they are drawn to those trees by chemical signals.

## Warning Of Other Problems?

In the spring, the monarchs fly back north. They lay their eggs on milkweed and then die, giving way to a new generation.

The declining monarch colonies worry scientists. They fear they may be a warning of other problems. They worry what could happen to insects and birds that live in the same area.

The drop in the butterflies also affects people's lives in central Mexico. Tourists travel to Mexico on vacation to see the butterflies. That creates jobs for Mexicans who work in hotels and restaurants, or as tour guides. Those jobs help them provide for their families.

But fewer butterflies mean fewer visitors.

Fernando Guzman Cruz is a member of a group that protects a butterfly park in Mexico. He says only 55,000 tourists came this season, a drop of a half compared to a year earlier.  Cruz blames the drop on U.S. farmers.

"We want you to stop killing the milkweed," he told a U.S. visitor.

## How To Help Monarch Butterflies In Your Area

Scientists think one of the main reasons for the drop in monarch butterflies is the disappearance of milkweed plants. Monarchs lay their eggs on these plants and their larvae eat them. Here are suggestions how people can help:

— Plant native milkweed in your yard. Encourage your government to plant it in parks. There are several places you can find free milkweed seeds. Monarchwatch.org lists providers of milkweed plants and seeds. Be sure to check which type of milkweed is the right one for the area where you live.

— Join programs that watch monarch butterflies in your area. A group counts monarchs in Canada and the U.S. in July. The group's website is naba.org.

— Write to lawmakers to encourage them to plant milkweed along highway roadsides. Roadsides along monarch migratory routes are especially important.
