AUSTIN, Texas â€” Texas began making high school students take a class called algebra II eight years ago. Now, the state has decided the tough math class is optional. That decision makes some education experts nervous.

Texas school districts like the state's decision. It gives them more choices in how they teach students. But education experts are concerned. Nearly 20 states had followed Texas' lead and required algebra II. People worry these states may again follow what Texas does and not make students take the class.

Algebra II is important for students headed to college. But supporters of the change say that not all high school students go to college. Without algebra II, they have more time to train for jobs. There are good jobs in Texas that do not require college degrees.

But others say the state is lowering its standards.

## The Education Equation

Patte Barth said there is a strong link between algebra II and attending college. Barth directs the Center for Public Education. Algebra II is not just for those who want to go to college. It is good for everyone, Barth said.

Students who take algebra II are more likely to get a full-time job after graduation. They are also healthier, Barth said.

Sixteen other states and the District of Columbia now require algebra II for most students. Minnesota and Connecticut will do so soon. But Florida has already dropped algebra II. Texas and Florida are two of the country's largest states.

Education groups are watching closely. What happens in Texas can make a difference at schools across the country. The state's education system is huge. A change made in a Texas textbook affects books sold across the country.

So far, no other state is following Texas by dropping the course, said Jennifer Dounay Zinth. She is an education expert.

Texas lawmakers approved the change in May. The state's Board of Education will approve it next week.

## The Job Equation

Texas' higher education commissioner is Raymond Paredes. He strongly objects. Students will not be prepared for college and technical careers without algebra II, he said.

The change came after strong pressure from a group called Jobs for Texas. The group includes 22 business groups. Jobs for Texas argued that the schools did not train students for the modern workforce.

Mike Meroney is a group spokesman. Schools can better prepare high school students for jobs if they do not have to teach algebra II, he said.

The powerful Texas Association of Business disagreed. The group accused Texas of making classes too simple. The Texas Latino Education Coalition said low-income students might not go to college without algebra II.

But parent and teacher groups supported the change. School districts can still require algebra II. Stephen Waddell is a Texas schools superintendent. He said most students take the class anyway.

Isabel Hutt is 16. Algebra II helped her raise her scores on a college entrance test. But she admits she would not be in the class if it was not required.

"That would have been a dream come true," Hutt said.

## The Graduation Equation

Chris Witte is in charge of a chemical factory. It employs people with job training in high school, he said.

Algebra II is not needed for every job at the factory, Witte said.

Witte said that algebra II is helpful. But he and Texas lawmakers said the class leads some students to drop out.

In Texas, most students graduated on time two years ago. The number was an all-time high. It was also the fifth straight year of improvement.

College test scores also were better.

"There's a fear that if we set higher standards for all students, more students will drop out," Zinth said. That doesn't happen, she said.
