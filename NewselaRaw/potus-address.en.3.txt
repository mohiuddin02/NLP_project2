WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama gave his State of the Union address on Tuesday. It is a speech he uses to tell the nation about his plans and how the country is doing.

In Tuesday's speech, he asked people to "turn the page." He argued that his presidency had brought on a new time. He said the government is smarter and the country is becoming richer. Obama said it was time to put the days of money troubles, terrorism and long wars behind us.

More people have jobs than at any other time during Obama's presidency.

"It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years," Obama said in the speech.

## No Change In Plans

Obama, a Democrat, was speaking to a Congress controlled by Republicans for the first time in his presidency. Republicans won control of Congress in elections last year. The two groups often have different views. Obama made it clear that he would not change his plans to please Republicans.

Instead, Obama pushed for higher taxes on rich Americans. The money from the taxes would be used to help the middle class. Middle class Americans would pay less in taxes. It would also be easier for them to go to college because community college would be free.

Obama is also asking lawmakers to give workers more vacation time or sick days. And he's used his presidential powers to help young adults afford to buy homes.

However, many of the president's ideas for laws are unlikely to pass in Congress. It seemed that he was trying to make a plan for Democrats to use in the next presidential election in 2016.

Iowa Senator Joni Ernst gave the Republican response to the speech. She called for Democrats and Republicans to work together. However, Ernst disagreed with Obama in many ways. She said his plan to give health care to all Americans was a failure.

The president mainly spoke about issues within the United States. But he did mention two of his recent political actions overseas.

## Dealing With Cuba

President Obama spoke about his decision to change how the United States deals with Cuba. The U.S. has not allowed any business with the communist country for more than 50 years.

Communism is a type of government. In the 1950s, the American government was worried communism was going to take over the world. To prevent Cuba from spreading communism, the U.S. made new rules. People from the United States could not visit Cuba. Americans could not buy anything made in Cuba.

Now, Obama wants to change these rules.

He also discussed the need to fight the Islamic State, a violent group fighting in Iraq and Syria. The group has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It wants to set up its own country governed by Islamic law.

Republican Mitch McConnell, a senator from Kentucky, said Obama's plans were not going to pass Congress.

McConnell, the majority leader, said Obama should work with Republicans. They want to fix programs that give older people health care and money when they stop working. Republicans also want to make sure the U.S. doesn't spend money it doesn't have. He said Obama should not just tax people more.

## Going To Idaho And Kansas

Both the White House and Republicans invited guests to Tuesday's speech. The guests were used to support their views.

The Obamas invited Chelsey Davis, a student from Tennessee who plans to graduate from a community college in May. Dr. Pranav Shetty, who has been working on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, was there. They also invited Alan Gross, a Cuban prisoner who was released last month. Obama's plan to change relations with the country led to his release.

Republicans also invited people to support their ideas.

Republican John Boehner of Ohio, the Speaker of the House, brought Jorge Luis García Pérez. The man spent 17 years in a Cuban prison for opposing the country's communist government.

Many people like Pérez do not like Obama's plan to start doing business with Cuba.

The morning after the State of the Union, Obama was headed to Idaho and Kansas. Republicans run the two states. He is visiting the states to talk about his plans for his seventh year in office.
