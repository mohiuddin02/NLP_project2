COMPTON, Calif. — Compton student Edgar Ruelas is in eighth grade. He wants to be the first in his family to go to college.

He has some help. A talent agent from Beverly Hills is coaching him to do well in school. The agents usually work with famous actors, musicians and sports players. They help them find jobs and get paid good money for their work.

Now they're also helping students in Compton.

## Meeting With Mentors

For the past four years, agents from William Morris Endeavor (WME) have been meeting with students at two Compton schools. They talk with students about how to make the most out of their time in school. What they are doing is called mentoring.

Students make regular visits to their mentors at the William Morris offices in Hollywood.

"At first I was pretty nervous about meeting WME. I was scared. I didn't really know any mentors," said Edgar. He goes to Whaley Middle School. "But now I do — we are pretty close now — and they are like my friends."

The program is a special project for the Hollywood agency. Its clients include Ben Affleck, Oprah Winfrey and Justin Timberlake.

## Fixing Up A School

At Stephen C. Foster Elementary School, a lot has changed. The library, music room and computer lab have been improved. The school's bathrooms have been fixed up and its playground has new equipment. Now there are murals on the school's walls.

WME spent more than $1 million on the schools. Most of the money went to Foster. It has also gotten its stars to give their time and money.

But the main part of the program is the one-on-one mentoring. Every other Wednesday, agents have meals and one-on-one meetings with their students.

"They help you with your homework. Once you are done, you can have fun," said Tytis Barnett, a seventh-grader at Whaley.

Agency leaders say the idea is simple: Treat the school like a Hollywood client.

## "We Are Problem Solvers"

"When you have an actor, you say, 'How can we move his career along?' We are problem solvers," said Patrick Whitesell of WME. "We say, 'What are Foster's problems?'"

Before WME started helping, Foster had serious problems.

"The bathrooms were disgusting," said Sarah Adolphson of William Morris. "We found out the kids were holding it because they didn't want to use the bathroom."

Good role models for the students weren't around either. Some of the students didn't have mentors, which is why the program was started.

## Sharing College Dreams

Edgar talked about finishing middle school with good grades. Agent Nancy Josephson encouraged him. Then he shared his college dreams.

Nearby, agent Liesl Copland chatted with 12-year-old Tytis. The shy boy was waiting for his turn to play a game of pool.

She once told Tytis that "whatever it takes, you are going to college."

WME agents say they hope other businesses across Los Angeles will mentor students as well.

Maybe someday the agency could get more agents from Compton. A few Foster and Whaley students have said that they'd like to become talent agents themselves.
