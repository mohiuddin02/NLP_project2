LOS ANGELES — Nieves Garcia came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 6. She spent years labeled as an "English learner" even after she learned the language. Now a mother, she didn't want her own daughter labeled the same way.

So she lied.

When Garcia signed up her daughter for kindergarten, she filled out a four-question survey. She said her family spoke only English at home, even though her husband doesn't speak English at all.

"I just said we spoke English, English, English and English," Garcia said.

## Who Needs Extra Help?

California education officials say it's tough to know how many parents lie on the home language survey. Educators say it's important to identify which kids need extra help in English. If they don't get the help they need, they can be set back in the schoolwork.

Parents like Garcia fear that if they admit the truth, their kids will be separated from native English speakers or labeled negatively. The kids might also miss out on advanced classes later on.

Rosaisela Rodriguez didn't declare that her twin son and daughter knew Spanish when they started school. She said most 5-year-olds are language learners. She doesn't think it matters whether they are bilingual — meaning they can speak two languages.

Increasingly, as more people speak different languages, states are taking another look how they identify English learners.

## Changing The Survey

California plans to roll out a new English language test in 2016. It is also considering changing its home language survey, said Elena Fajardo, who is with the California Department of Education. The survey was developed in 1980 and the state's population and immigration patterns have changed since then.

Nearly 44 percent of Californians age 5 and older speak a language other than English. The most common language is Spanish. A total of 57 percent of Spanish speakers in the state say they speak English very well.

That's a big change from 1990. Then, less than a third of the state's residents age 5 and older spoke another language. And back then less than half of Spanish-speakers claimed to speak English very well.

Most states including California ask parents to fill out the home language survey before their children enter school. Children who speak another language are tested to see how well they know English.

## Hard Test For Preschoolers

In California, nearly a quarter of public school students are considered English learners. In 2012, more than 200,000 incoming kindergarteners were given the test. Only 9 percent were able to speak the language well. The results led some parents to slam the idea of testing preschoolers to determine what kind of classes they will take later on. The test is takes place on a single day, and parents say it is too difficult.

Alison Bailey is a professor who studies bilingualism at the University of California, Los Angeles. She said many states, including California's, don't really consider the possibility that a child might speak two languages well.

Some bilingual children would do fine in an English-only class, she said. Bailey believes too many children probably take the English test.

## "Catching Too Many Kids"

Some parents don't want their children classified as English learners. They fear their kids won't be able to move into more advanced classes in middle and high school. Also, English learners don't perform as well on the California High School Exit Exam, according to the state. Passing the exam is necessary to graduate high school in California.

Cheryl Ortega is the director of bilingual education for United Teachers Los Angeles. She said she's seen Spanish-speaking parents lie on the home language survey. Ortega said educators ought to meet with parents and explain the survey.

Earlier this year, Tesha Sengupta-Irving, an education professor, registered her son for kindergarten. At the time, her parents were visiting. She was speaking to them in their native tongue, Bengali. So she wrote on her survey that Bengali was spoken at home.

Her son knew just a few words in Bengali. Yet, he was tested and classified as an English learner. She was unhappy about it, because she had tirelessly tried to teach him Bengali and he still spoke only English.

Sengupta-Irving said the survey "is catching too many kids."
