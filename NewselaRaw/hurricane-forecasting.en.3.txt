ORLANDO, Fla. â€” Hurricanes may not take so many people by surprise this season. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is using a huge computer and a richer math formula to help it improve how well it predicts storms.

The NHC is the government agency that is responsible for monitoring and predicting hurricanes. It  is a division of the National Weather Service (NWS).

It hopes to improve those forecasts by up to 15 percent this year.

The supercomputer and the program it processes should allow the Hurricane Center to better figure out the shape of the storm. Forecasters need that information. It helps show where a storm is headed and how strong it might get.

## Predicting A Hurricane's Strength

A main goal will be to improve forecasts of a hurricane's strength. The NHC has struggled in this area for many years. Now it has the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model. The model is like a long math problem. It's known as the HWRF.

The model has been used for the past six years. But this year, it can accept a lot more information about the atmosphere.

The change has already paid off. The upgraded model has shown a slight improvement in predicting the four storms that have occurred so far this season, said NHC spokesman Dennis Feltgen. Hurricane season in the Atlantic runs from June 1 to the end of November.

The machines using the model also have improved a great deal. Those machines are called "Tide" and "Gyre." Tide is located in Virginia and Gyre, its backup, is in Orlando. The machines now make 213 trillion calculations per second. They used to make "only" 90 trillion.

## Size Matters With Storms

The combination of HWRF and Tide alone should make the forecasts a lot better, James Franklin said. He is the NHC's top hurricane expert. But there is another tool, too. The HWRF model also has been programmed to take in radar information from airplanes that fly around the storms.

The radar should capture a three-dimensional view of the storm's shape. Then the HWRF should be able to figure out how much thunderstorm activity is around the center of the storm. It should be able to tell whether the storm will get weaker or stronger, Franklin said.

Better forecasts are very important.  Forecasters still cannot tell when a storm system will get bigger in a hurry. If it gets a lot stronger just before hitting land, people who live near the coast could be caught by surprise.

They were in 2004. Hurricane Charley jumped from Category 2 to 4 in the five hours before striking southwest Florida. That's the difference between a hurricane with extremely dangerous winds and a major hurricane that will cause catastrophic damage, according to a widely-used hurricane scale.

The Hurricane Center has also predicted some storms would get more powerful than they really were. Ernesto was expected to hit South Florida as a hurricane in 2006. It arrived as a weak tropical storm.

## Heat Waves And Blizzards Too

The NHC has gotten better at saying where a hurricane will go. Five-day forecasts are as accurate as three-day forecasts were in 2000. But the combination of HWRF and the supercomputer should improve those forecasts this year, Franklin said.

Other types of predictions should also be helped by the better supercomputer and improved model. Forecasts from heat-wave warnings in South Florida to blizzards in North Dakota should be better, government officials said.

 Superstorm Sandy led to the improvement in the forecasting tools. The storm devastated the U.S. East Coast last October. Congress approved $24.3 million after that storm as part of a disaster relief bill. More money is to be spent for another major upgrade by 2015. Then the supercomputers are expected to be able to conduct almost 2,000 trillion calculations per second.

Such improvements will be "historic," said Louis Uccellini. He is director of the NWS. "I believe we will have more accurate forecasts, especially for extreme events," Uccellini said.
