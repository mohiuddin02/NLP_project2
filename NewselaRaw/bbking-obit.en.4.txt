Musician B.B. King has died. The famous blues guitarist and singer was 89 years old.

His family said he died peacefully in his sleep Thursday night.

King won Grammy Awards for his music 15 times. His playing was imitated by many blues and rock guitarists. He was one of the most respected blues musicians ever.

## Music Led Him Off The Plantation

Guitarist Eric Clapton said B.B. King was a "global musician." His music touched the whole world, not just American blues fans.

King was born in Mississippi on Sept. 16, 1925, on a plantation. His first name was really Riley. B.B. was his nickname.

When he was young, King picked cotton. Soon, he realized he could make much more money playing guitar. In 1946, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to work to become a full-time musician.

In Memphis, King became known as "the Blues Boy of Beale Street," then the Beale Street Blues Boy. This nickname was shortened to Bee Bee. Finally, it became simply B.B.

## Many Others Tried B.B.'s Music Style

King developed an unusual way of performing. He had trouble singing and playing lead guitar at the same time. Soon he came up with a new approach. He would sing for a bit, then play a guitar solo, then sing a bit more. Many blues and rock guitarists later began doing the same thing. Everyone from Jimi Hendrix to John Mayer copied King.

King had a funny habit of calling his guitars "Lucille." It went back to something that happened to him in the 1940s.

In 1949, a fight broke out between two men while King was playing at a dance. During the fight a lantern was knocked over. Soon, the barn was in flames. Everyone escaped unharmed. Then King realized he had left his guitar behind. King rushed back into the burning barn, putting himself in danger. When he found out that the men had been fighting over a woman named Lucille, he gave the name to his guitar. He figured the name would remind him "never to do anything that foolish," he said.

From then on, King named every guitar he owned "Lucille."

## So Many Shows To Play

King was a tireless performer. He never stopped giving concerts for more than a few days at a time. In 1956, he played 342 shows. Even as he got much older he played many shows every year. Most musicians half his age would have a hard time traveling and playing as much as he did.

King worked with hundreds of musicians from all kinds of backgrounds. In 1989 he teamed up with the Irish rock band U2. Together, they released the song "When Love Comes to Town." It brought B.B. King to the attention of millions of young rock fans. At the time, he was more than 60 years old.

## His Music Will Live On With Fans

Rock musicians had helped make King better known once before.

Early on, King's fans were mostly African-American. By the 1960s, many blacks were no longer interested in listening to the blues. King became less popular.

Then British rock musicians discovered the blues. The Rolling Stones, Clapton, Van Morrison and others began telling their young fans how great King was.

The attention from British rockers put B.B. King in front of a whole new audience. King really became famous after he released the song "The Thrill Is Gone" in 1969. In 1971, he won his first Grammy Award.

King recorded more than 50 albums. At one time, he said he could not remember how many records he had made. In 1987, he was voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He received many other music awards as well for his long career.
