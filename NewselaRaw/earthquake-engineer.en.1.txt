KATHMANDU, Nepal — Binod Tiwari leaped out of an SUV onto a busy highway and stopped in front of a foot-wide crack in the pavement.

As trucks and motorcycles whizzed by, Tiwari, wearing a fluorescent yellow vest, raised his camera to snap photographs of the crack. Tiwari then checked some nearby homes that were tipping dangerously forward.

At times, he propped a yellow ruler or his cellphone next to the cracks to measure them.

Tiwari, an engineer at California State University, Fullerton, came to Nepal to help lead a Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance team. The U.S. organization inspects the damage after mega-earthquakes such as the magnitude 7.8 one that hit Nepal in April. The team was in Nepal to find out what happened to the rock and soil during the quake, and which buildings, bridges and roads survived — or didn't.

## Coaxing Clues From Disaster

The best way to learn how to build safer structures, Tiwari said, is to head to the disaster zones where they have failed.

"Natural disasters come without telling us," he said. "Science has to chase that disaster."

The team brought along different experts. Tiwari studies soil liquefaction, a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during earthquakes, and causes the soil to move like a liquid, tipping buildings as if pulling the rug out from under them.

## Getting The Story In Nepali

Tiwari was born in Nepal, in the kind of mud-mortar house that proved deadly during the quake. When he was a teen, his family moved to Kathmandu, the capital, where he would look through his window at the Himalayas.

"All around you see snowcapped mountains," he said. "If you feel a little sad, you just look into the mountains."

As members of the team traveled across Nepal, they saw children and elderly Nepalese huddled under tents near flattened and crumbling houses.

It's "devastating," Tiwari said. "You want to cry."

It was cool on this gray spring day, and the overcast sky threatened to rain.

Tiwari's ability to connect with Nepalese people on the ground and in government was essential to the team's mission. Earlier in the day, he chatted in Nepali with Tulasi Prasad Sitaula, a government official in charge of infrastructure and transport. Later, as he traced the damage in the rubble-filled yards of damaged homes, Tiwari asked residents for details on what happened during the quake.

## Racing Ahead Of The Rains

Being able to hit the ground running was key, because the scientists needed to work fast before the evidence was erased by the summer monsoon rains.

Tiwari and the team, which was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, were examining every bit of infrastructure they came across — bridges, roads, houses and power projects.

But they were also looking at how different types of soil reacted to the earthquake, in part to identify slopes in this mountainous country that have a high risk of landslide. Finding those weaknesses quickly would allow them to better predict which slopes are most likely to give way when the monsoon comes.

Soil plays a role in whether a building survives an earthquake — its composition, the grain size, how densely packed and how much water it's holding.

Later in the day, Tiwari climbed under a metal gate to examine a three-story brick-and-concrete school that has sunk into the ground.

School officials built it to withstand a magnitude 8.0 quake, but they didn't check the soil underneath, Tiwari said, shaking his head.

## Rushing Out After The Aftershock

Tiwari and his team were on the road May 12 when a magnitude 7.3 aftershock hit, causing their car to sway as if rocked by ocean waves.

It felt like "some big elephant coming to your car and shaking the car," Tiwari said.

There was no question of turning back, because the aftershock presented an important scientific opportunity. They'd be able to see the damage just hours after a major earthquake hit.

The damage was extensive near the epicenter. Homes made with mud and bricks had fallen apart, and several buildings were flattened.

Before returning to California, Tiwari spent the last few days of his trip giving talks to engineering groups based in Nepal. The country's building codes will need to be rewritten as well, because they don't take the ground beneath into account.

In some ways, Tiwari said, he was surprised by the limits of the damage. In many places the soil seemed to slow down the waves of shaking from the earthquake, though the team is still studying the soil to find out how this happens.

Scientists will have to study the soils in different regions around Nepal to fully understand which areas are safe to build in, he added.

## Building A Quake-Proof House

Years ago, right after graduating from a university near Kathmandu, Tiwari built his own house, designing it so well that it survived the quake.

His mother still lives there, but she and terrified neighbors had refused to return to their homes, living together in a large tent for weeks as aftershocks continued.

Tiwari knew he could not leave them until he had examined the buildings himself.

"I checked everyone's house and told them, 'Don't worry, go back to your house and sleep well there,'" Tiwari said. "And they did, they did."
