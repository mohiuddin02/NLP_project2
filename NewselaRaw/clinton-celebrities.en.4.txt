Americans will vote for a new president this year. There are two political groups in the United States. They are the Republican and Democratic group. They often fight against each other about laws. Each group will choose one person to run for president. Hillary Clinton is a Democrat. Bernie Sanders is another Democrat running against her. Hillary and Clinton both want the vote of the Democratic group.

Hillary is winning more votes in the country. Sanders is winning more votes among young people.

## Young Voters Are Important

Young voters are at least 18 years old. Bernie and Hillary both want young voters to vote for them. Young voters can make a big difference. Hillary and Bernie are in a race to win. The race is close. 

Many young voters like Bernie better. Hillary hopes that her famous friends will help her get young voters on her side. So far, it is not working. 

Alex Bare is a student in Iowa. He is 19 years old. He plans to vote for Bernie. He came out to Hillary's free concert though.

Erin Kelleher is a student in Iowa, too. She is deciding between Clinton and Sanders. Erin said the free concert will not change her vote. She does not care about famous people.

## Both Sides Have Famous Friends

Bernie has some famous friends, too. Actors like Justin Long come to his events. Foster the People is a music band. They support Bernie, too.

Many students like Bernie even without his famous friends. They like that he will help them with their problems. Bernie said he would make college free.

Still, some students like Hillary more. Lauren Ellbogen is a student in Iowa. She said she will work for Clinton. Lauren thinks Sanders' ideas are too big. He will not be able to achieve them, she thinks.
