WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a ruling that preserves health insurance for millions of Americans.

The court upheld a part of President Barack Obama's law that makes insurance more affordable for many people. About 8.7 million people now receive help paying their insurance bills, in the form of money back on their taxes. Otherwise they would spend too much of their paychecks on insurance bills. If the Supreme Court ruled against the law, they would have lost this help.

The justices said in a 6-3 ruling that this financial help does not depend on where people live.

The latest challenge to the health care law relied on four words — "established by the state" — found in the law. In the challengers' view, this meant that people could only get help in states that set up their own insurance marketplaces. These virtual marketplaces let people without insurance buy health coverage. People in states without their own marketplaces use the national system.

## Law "Is Here To Stay," Obama Says

Obama greeted news of the decision by declaring the health care law "is here to stay." He said the law is no longer about politics, but the benefits millions of people are receiving.

Republican Representative John Boehner of Ohio said Republicans will "continue our efforts to repeal the law and replace it with patient-centered solutions." Boehner is the Speaker of the House of Representatives and leads the Republican majority.

Republicans have voted more than 50 times to undo the Affordable Care Act. It is also known as Obamacare.

At the court, Chief Justice John Roberts again voted with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. Roberts, a conservative, also was the key vote to uphold it during a previous challenge in 2012. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who objected to the law during a previous challenge in 2012, was part of the majority on Thursday.

"Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," Roberts declared in the majority opinion. The court often explains its decision in a majority opinion. The justices who do not agree may issue a minority opinion outlining their objections.

Roberts wrote that the financial help should not be limited only to people in states with their own insurance marketplaces. This help is also called subsidies.

## Ruling Protects Aid To 6.4 Million People

Justice Antonin Scalia strongly disagreed.

Scalia had harsh words for his opponents on the court who support the law. He said "the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites."

Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas disagreed with the majority opinion, as they did in 2012.

Nationally, 10.2 million people have signed up for health insurance under the law. About 8.7 million people receive an average of $272 a month to help pay their insurance bills.

Of those receiving subsidies, 6.4 million were at risk of losing that aid. They live in states that did not set up their own health insurance exchanges.

The health insurance industry breathed a big sigh of relief over Thursday's decision. A national organization representing state officials said the court's decision will mean that prices should not rise that much.

Stock shares of hospital companies soared Thursday. For hospital companies, the ruling meant that they would not have to deal with a flood of uninsured people. Experts had worried that many patients would drop their insurance if they no longer had help paying for it.

## Law Requires Almost Everyone To Be Insured

The law's opponents argued that the government should not help pay the insurance bills for most people. That is because about three dozen states decided against creating their own health insurance marketplaces. The opponents claimed the law provides subsidies only to people in states with marketplaces.

Obama, Democrats in Congress and 22 states responded that it would make no sense to interpret the law that way. The idea behind the law was to decrease the number of people without health insurance and increase the number of people with health insurance. The law requires almost everyone to be insured.

The point of the subsidies is to make sure enough people have insurance. If there are too few people who get health insurance through the program, the price would go up for everyone.

Several parts of the law say that people can get the help no matter where they live. Some states told the court that they had no idea they had to set up their own health insurance marketplaces for their residents to get help.
