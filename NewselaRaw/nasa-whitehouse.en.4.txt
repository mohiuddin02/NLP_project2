WASHINGTON â€” The International Space Station might get four more years in orbit.

Its work was supposed to end in 2020. The White House wants to extend the station by four years. Now it may stay in space to 2024.

The space station is the world's most expensive science project. It orbits about 220 miles above Earth.

The decision follows years of pressure by NASA officials. They say the station is necessary. It will help NASA explore space in the future.

But adding four years could cost NASA a lot of money.

## Congress Must Approve Money

And the government's approval doesn't mean that the station will get the extra years. Congress must still say yes to NASA spending the money.

The plan also must get the support of the next president. There will be an election in 2016. However, the backing of President Barack Obama helps. It might make it harder for the next president to go back on the decision.

Other countries use the space station. This decision may help them decide about spending money on their own space programs.

The decision also could send a signal to China.

In 2003, China became the third country to launch an astronaut into space. And China may be planning to build its own space station. But that won't happen for several years.

By keeping the space station going, NASA can fight back against China. This could make it harder for the Chinese to get other countries to be partners for its own space station.

## Help For Struggling NASA

This decision was important for NASA. It has struggled in the past few years.

NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011. That meant the U.S. couldn't send its own astronauts to the station. NASA is paying Russia through 2017 for the service.

In a few years, NASA hopes to hire private "space taxis" to do that job. It will stop paying Russia. Instead, it will use U.S. companies. SpaceX from California is one of them. But it's unlikely those spacecraft will be ready before 2017.

Keeping the station going until 2024 will help U.S. companies. It gives them a chance to fly NASA missions for several years.

NASA officials said they could keep the station in space for years. A report found that it could be kept going through at least 2028.

But, it has had troubles from time to time. Last month, a problem had to be repaired by spacewalking astronauts.

Adding four years to the station also would help NASA. It could get more science work done. In its early years, little science was done aboard the station.

## 50 Hours Of Science Work A Week

In 2008, the crew did only three hours of science work a week. Now, the six-member team is doing at least 50 hours weekly.

Figuring out how space affects humans is one of the things they study. NASA may send people to Mars. A round trip to that planet would likely take years. And it could be dangerous to space explorers.

Astronauts have been doing shifts on board the station for more than 10 years. They often do six months at a time. Over that time, the station has recorded their health history.

Leroy Chiao was once a NASA astronaut. He was commander of the space station in 2004 and 2005. He said the station is priceless. It can help NASA find ways to fight health problems caused by space travel. For instance, bones and muscles can lose mass.

It could also solve other physical problems caused by spaceflight.

For instance, some astronauts develop vision problems after being in orbit for awhile.

Chiao said that four extra years could help solve that problem. He called the announcement "a big important step."
