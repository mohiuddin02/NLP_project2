### PRO: Students should get advance warning about traumatic topics

NEW YORK — The college classroom is the proper place to seriously discuss potentially traumatic topics. "Trigger warnings" don't interfere with that process — in fact, they improve upon it.

Trigger warnings' beginnings lie in the Internet. Originally, they arose as a way to alert readers about content that might be traumatic.

Their premise is that a rape victim, for instance, might rightly prefer to have some warning before encountering a vivid description of sexual assault. Trigger warnings generally don't spark much hostility in online writing. Some writers use them, but most don't.

Earlier this year, though, college students started pushing for the use of trigger warnings in classes. Their demand provoked a massive, angry response.

## Disturbing And Upsetting

Unlike most professors, though, I found the idea fascinating. As a history professor I discuss some very difficult material in class, and I think it's important to give students a clear sense of their rights.

I came up with a trigger warning of my own. In it I warn students that some of them may find some of the material we cover disturbing.

I provide examples when we review material together. I let students know that I'm open to discussing their personal reactions to historical topics during class or privately during my office hours. I tell them that they're free to step outside briefly if they find any content upsetting.

A few weeks ago I wrote a short essay on the subject for the online newspaper Inside Higher Ed. The response to that piece was strongly divided.

Most of the opponents of trigger warnings who replied to my piece didn't object to how I'd written my trigger warning.

Instead, they argued that what I'd written wasn't a trigger warning at all. They called it too reasonable, too simple to fit that description.

## It Isn't A Huge Change

Nearly every person favoring trigger warnings who responded to my piece — in comments, on Facebook and Twitter, on blogs, or by email — supports it.

Several said that they would be adopting a version of it or suggesting it to their professors.

What does this tell us?

Think at least three things: First, that the discussion of trigger warnings in the classroom is still in its early stages. Professors should take calls for change as invitations to dialogue.

Second, that despite the term "trigger warnings" being unfamiliar, it may not be a huge change from what we as professors are already doing.

And third, that even minor adjustments to teaching practice can have a significant positive effect on the classroom environment.

### CON: It sends the wrong message that education is traumatic

MADISON, Wis. — Free-speech debates are gripping higher education. Many institutions have begun formally to institute — or consider instituting — "trigger warnings."

"Trigger warnings" are verbal or written warnings. Instructors provide them about material that might trigger "trauma" in students who have experienced or witnessed traumatic events, leading to mental or emotional problems. Experiencing events like assault and war can make students sensitive about certain topics. Race, gender and sexual preference are but a few. Even reading about a country ruling another country in discussions of colonialism and imperialism could be hurtful.

Being reminded of trauma can emotionally harm the student and interfere with his or her ability to learn. The case for trigger warnings is that they supposedly help protect students from re-experiencing the past trauma.

What could be wrong with that? It's much like the movie industry agreeing to use ratings labels for films. This could even boost freedom to explore ideas in class while protecting emotional well-being.

## What Exactly Merits A Warning?

Alas, many significant problems lurk just beneath the surface.

First, as critics from a range of political views have claimed, it is impossible to determine in advance what material merits a warning. Complaints, threats and lawsuits are possible if instructors fail to warn of some potentially upsetting material. To avoid them, many instructors would likely extend warnings to large amounts of material. Doing so would send the incorrect message that learning is traumatic in itself.

Or they could censor, or cut, the course material in the name of sensitivity. Small cuts could lead to additional ones.

Already, trigger warnings have been applied to such works as "The Great Gatsby," "The Merchant of Venice" and other famous works.

"Gatsby?" Really?! What's next? And what if a student refuses to read the flagged material, however important it is to the class?

Another danger waits: formalizing trigger warnings would further empower higher-ed administrators. They are often as eager to enforce sensitivity as they are ignorant of basic academic freedom principles.

Most important, the reason for formal trigger warnings is contrary to the purposes of education.

## Dealing With "Uncomfortable Truths"

Education should expose students to the depths of the human condition. Doing so unavoidably involves matters of good and evil, life and death — what the German thinker Nietzsche called "uncomfortable truths."

And education must prepare students to be mentally strong enough to handle the clash of ideas that is essential to a free society. As the great education scholar Alexander Meiklejohn remarked, "To be afraid of ideas, any idea, is to be unfit for self-government."

Trigger warnings assume that many students are not capable of handling the responsibilities of adult citizenship.

At the same time, it also puts schools in the role of parents.

To deal with occasional cases of extreme material, leave the matter where it has always resided: to the judgment of instructors.

If a formal trigger warning must be had, place these words atop a university's main webpage: "Education necessarily exposes students to ideas and experiences that are new, challenging, and sometimes painful. To be properly educated, you must learn to handle and welcome such challenges."
