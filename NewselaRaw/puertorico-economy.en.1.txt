SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — People call Puerto Rico the Isla del Encanto, or Enchanted Island. But for Yessenia Puente, the island has lost its charm.

Puente is a resident of Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States in the Caribbean. She became a widow six years ago. Public schools don't provide a safe environment for her three children. Her income as a hotel manager barely covers living expenses, much less private school tuition. And every two days, she must deal with no running water at home due to strict water-saving measures imposed by the government in response to a prolonged drought.

So on the same day that a new 11.5 percent sales tax took effect recently, a moving truck showed up at Puente's apartment in suburban San Juan to load up her belongings for shipment to Orlando, Florida. The boxes were marked with "1465" — that is the number of families this one moving company has packed for Orlando since January.

"I've been thinking about it for a while because I've seen how things are deteriorating," said Puente, 35. "But with everything happening now, I decided it's time to go. The system doesn't work here."

## Mass Migration Mirrors The 1950s

Like Puente, thousands of others are bidding farewell to their lives on the island to start over elsewhere in the United States. Residents of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens and have the right to live and work on the U.S. mainland.

Emigration to the U.S. mainland has accelerated in recent years, with 144,000 fleeing from mid-2010 to 2013, according to a study by the Pew Research Center, making it perhaps the largest group migration since the 1950s. The island's population now stands at 3.6 million, down from its population peak of 4 million residents in 2009.

Several moving companies in San Juan confirmed they are extremely busy these days, packing homes for new clients heading for destinations across the United States, including Miami, Orlando, New York, Boston, Chicago and cities as far as the West Coast.

## Deep In Debt

The departures come as Puerto Rico faces an estimated $72 billion debt that the governor has said cannot be repaid. The island has borrowed massive amounts of money to pay for things like roads, schools and bridges. In a recent televised address, Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla said that at the rate the debt situation is developing, every man, woman and child on the island would owe $40,000 by 2025.

"It's hard to quit and start over but I have no choice," said Puente, who was born in the Puerto Rican town of Bayamon. "My kids are worried and ask many questions but they understand. We don't even have money to go to the movies. The cost of living is too high.

"The government gives money to the people who don't work, to those doing drugs, living on welfare," she said. "I'm not willing to do that anymore."

## High Tax And Heartbreak

The new sales tax — now surpassing that of any U.S. state — is just one of many measures underway to help resolve a financial crisis that has been brewing for nearly a decade.

"This is really negative for the consumer," said Nelson Rodriguez, who runs a family-owned grocery store in San Juan's Barrio Obrero neighborhood. "For every $100, the government takes $11.50. People are going to have to rethink how to stretch their dollars."

"All of the businesses are already seeing a drop in sales," he said. "People can't afford it."

Biancheska Velez said the effects of the bad economy are even more pronounced in small towns in the mountains and countryside such as her native Cabo Rojo on the southwest coast.

"People are really struggling," she said. "It breaks your heart."

## Bankruptcy May Be An Option

On June 29, the governor's team publicly declared that Puerto Rico was in a financial mess too deep to climb out of on its own. Since then, they've been meeting with lawmakers, business people and community leaders in an effort to find ways to fix the economy.

The White House has said it will not bail out Puerto Rico. But some U.S. lawmakers have sponsored bills that could eventually allow Puerto Rico to file for bankruptcy. In this case, a court would decide that Puerto Rico could erase some of its debts and start fresh.

In the meantime, various ideas are part of the chatter among Puerto Ricans. One idea is to make government employees take unpaid days off. Another is a reduction in the $7.25 minimum wage for non-government workers. Both of these ideas would be harmful financially in a place where unemployment is at a staggering 12.4 percent.

"It's sad, really sad," said Blanca Valentine, a Puerto Rico native visiting from New Jersey. "How are people supposed to survive?"
