LAUSANNE, Switzerland â€“ Around the world, people are getting excited about drones, but fear them at the same time.

Drones  are like remote-controlled planes. Drones are also called unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. They are piloted by onboard computers or remotely by a person on the ground. They can be used during war to gather information or shoot at an enemy from the air. They can also be used to deliver packages or take pictures of football games from the sky.

People and drones already use the skies. That will not change. More than 3 million people fly in airplanes each day. Every large city on our planet is connected to another by planes.

## Use Of Devices Will Grow

Drones that fly goods and packages are called cargo drones. They will be used even more around the world in the next few years. These drones do not weigh very much. They are cheap to fly but just as fast and safe as cargo planes.

In rich countries, companies are interested in using cargo drones to deliver packages to a person's home. For instance, a drone could drop a tub of ice cream onto a front lawn. In poorer countries, drones can be used for more important things.

About 800 million people around the world do not live near emergency services, like hospitals. It will not change anytime soon. There will not be enough money to build roads to connect faraway areas. By flying to many of these communities, cargo drones can save lives and create jobs.

## Speeding Up Use Of Cargo Drones

Cargo drones are an example of what World Bank President Jim Yong Kim calls the "science of delivery." The bank gives loans and advice to poor countries around the world. We know what we need to deliver. There are already solutions to many of the world's biggest problems. The question is how to do it.

A group of people in Switzerland want to answer that question. They have joined together to start a new program called Red Line. Companies are just beginning to make emergency cargo drones. The Swiss group wants to speed this up so they can be used faster. It also wants to build the world's first droneports, like airports for drones, in Africa.

Technology often does not bring about real change in the lives of the poor. It is boring stuff like training teachers and health care that makes their lives better.

## Sometimes, Cheaper Is Better

Sometimes, solutions that cost less work better. BRAC is a group in Bangladesh, a country near India. It is the world's largest charity. BRAC has helped put 1.3 million children in schools, where there is hardly a laptop in sight.

So why be hopeful about cargo drones? One reason is that they can work in remote areas of Africa, Asia and Latin America. In these areas, people are very poor and many people are sick. Also, villages are far apart, and roads might never be built.

## In Africa, Drones Can Be Like Phones

Cargo drones are particularly good for reaching them. Companies and groups have trained women in hard-to-reach areas to start tiny businesses. They make sure their villages have what they need. It does not matter if they can even read. BRAC's health workers, for example, sell health supplies and medicines in villages. Drones could deliver packages to these workers.

Cargo drones will never replace ground transportation, like trucks and trains. Yet, they can get important goods to where they are needed. Mobile phones became popular in Africa. The technology was so much cheaper than building landline phone systems. Like the mobile phone, the cargo drone can be a gadget that works for those who need it most.
