LOS ANGELES — By any measure, the Pacific Crest Trail is extremely demanding. It runs up the entire length of California and all the way to Canada, for some 2,650 rugged, often brutal miles.

Along the way, however, there is relief for tired, hungry hikers, along with a helping hand.

Near the southern trail head, Sandy and Barney Mann open their five-bedroom San Diego home to up to 60 hikers a night. They even pick them up from the airport and ferry them to the starting point an hour east.

Up the trail, in Agua Dulce, Donna and Jeff Saufley provide a night's rest to more than 1,000 hikers a season. In addition, they offer food and shelter to the hikers' dogs and horses, along with the occasional llama.

East of the San Francisco Bay Area, Hank Magnuski provides hot coffee and snacks to hikers coming off a particularly grueling 300-mile stretch.

They are all part of a small network of outdoor good Samaritans called "trail angels."

## Sharing Enthusiasm, Hopes And Fears

These volunteers assist long-distance hikers along what is considered to be one of the most difficult trails in the world. They do it with little or no reward, other than the grateful smiles and occasional post-trail postcards.

Estimated at fewer than 100, the trail angels may be America's least-known charitable army. They reach into their own pockets to provide, food, shelter, medicine and hot showers to hikers.

An angel among angels, Saufley is the best-known of the trail volunteers.

Beginning in April, she and her husband set up tents and a trailer to handle the spring crush. Their home, dubbed "Hiker Heaven," is a popular mail drop where backpackers can send and receive packages.

Saufley talks fondly about the payoffs of being a trail angel. She witnesses the hikers' grit and enthusiasm, and shares their hopes and fears.

Traveling the trail "is humbling," she says. "I compare it to the peeling of an onion —you see people for what they are."

She adds, "I have to say, far and away, these are some of the most interesting people on the planet. I always say that it's a river of life that washes up to my shore."

## Everyone Benefits

Almost none of the trail angels consider what they do an act of pure charity. Rather, they think they get as much from the experience as the hikers themselves.

"I am involved on a selfish level because I want to get to know the hikers," says Pea Hicks. A San Diego musician, Hicks helps hikers get started at the Mexican border.

It is also a way to stay involved in hiking, says Hicks, who walked the trail in 2006.

As hiking the trail has become more popular, the trail angels have gotten busier.

Saufley says that during her first year, in 1997, she hosted 50 hikers all season. Last year, she often had that many staying per night, adding up to 1,200 for the summer.

Saufley loves it when her home is filled with hikers.

"The sounds of conversations mingling with music and laughter is divine to my ear," the 58-year-old says.

## What's Around The Corner

Most of the hikers travel significant stretches of the trail, with about 1,000 attempting the entire length. Only about half of those who set out, manage to complete the whole thing.

The number of hikers who do complete the trail has been growing each year by 15 to 25 percent. The trail has become quite popular, drawing people from as far away as Australia.

Part of the trail's difficulty is its unpredictability. Around one S curve lies a rockslide, while around the next sits a fallen ancient cedar, as big as a bus. In the Sierra alone, there are nine passes that force hikers to climb 10,000 feet or more.

Some hikers complete the trail several times. Others add their own unique twist. Two years ago, Oregon native Ron Ulrich hiked the whole thing dressed in a bridal gown.

## Finding The Peace In Nature

About to start their 10th year of taking in hikers, the Manns say those they have helped often stay in touch afterward with notes and cards. Awareness of the help they provide has spread by word of mouth.

"We get the strangest emails: 'I've never written to a total stranger before asking to stay at their house, but I'm told it's OK,'" Sandy says.

Barney confesses that providing airport runs and meals to hundreds of strangers each spring can leave him and Sandy feeling exhausted.

Still, he said, "We are so lucky to be able to do this."

"We do it because we can," adds Sandy.

For Saufley, the transformations she sees in people are a fair trade for the expense and fatigue.

"They go out for the nature," she says of her long-distance guests, "and they end up finding the peace within themselves."
