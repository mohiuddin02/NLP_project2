ANCHORAGE, Alaska — The Inupiat are native people. They were born in Alaska.  They still live there. Alaska is very cold. It is not easy to grow food. Many Inupiat hunt for food. They eat the meat. Hunting is a big part of their life.  

Some Inupiat are old. These elderly people live in a nursing home. They miss eating meat like venison, moose and caribou. Those are their favorite foods.

## Meatloaf Was Cool

One day they ate meatloaf. It was musk ox meatloaf. A musk ox is like a big, hairy sheep. 

The Inupiat loved the meatloaf. They called it "the bomb!"

There is a new law. Hunters can now give meat to nursing homes. The meat is free. People can eat more of their favorite foods. 

## Food Makes Them Happy

Leslie Wheelock works for the government. She makes food rules. The new law is good, she said. Inupiats can keep eating their favorite foods. Native Americans can also eat their special foods.  

A new nursing home will open next year. It will be in Arizona. Many Native Americans live in Arizona. Elk and deer might be on the menu. Squash and beans might be cooked too.  

Thomas Walker is planning the new home. He said people should eat foods they love. It makes them healthy and happy. 

One thing is for sure. Now the people gobble up dinner. They love the food. They are members of the clean plate club.
