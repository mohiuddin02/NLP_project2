If Japanese apparel maker Uniqlo is looking for more space in American malls, there may be sites opening soon. Same for U.K. clothing chain Topshop and Sweden's H&amp;M, both of which have been expanding in North America.

Hundreds of spaces that for years have been clubs for teens looking for preppy clothes, maybe with a flashy logo, could be available for rent. Clothing companies such as American Eagle Outfitters, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Aeropostale are reconsidering how much square footage they need.

The mall-based chains for years ruled the nation's high school wardrobes. Now they are trying to overhaul how and where they sell clothes to serve a smartphone-enabled generation that wanders easily between digital and mall shopping. That means not just helping them shop by phone, but also selling new styles faster and at prices teens are willing to pay.

"We continue to research this customer," said Abercrombie CEO Michael S. Jeffries. "I continue to believe we are taking the brands to a place that is more relevant."

## Sales Are Growing Overseas

No one could accuse the chains of not taking the issue seriously, even if they might have been a little slower than some would like.

Analyst Brian Tunick studies mall trends for JPMorgan, a major U.S.-based bank. He calculated that between 2007 and 2013, lower-priced chains made significant gains. So did "fast-fashion" retailers like Forever 21, H&amp;M, Uniqlo and Zara that offer inexpensive fashions that change quickly with trends.

Meanwhile, the American teen clothing chains were following the example of some of those international players. They opened stores aggressively in countries around the world. They've done well enough that most plan to continue to add stores overseas.

Yet they still were trying to figure out how best to manage the massive chains that they had built across North America. Teen spending slowed during the Great Recession, a time around 2009 when many people lost their jobs and homes. There also haven't been any major fashion trends lately to drive sales.

Now their answer to the real estate question seems clear: More stores aren't always the way to add sales.

## Stores Could Be On The Chopping Block

In mid-May, American Eagle said it had identified 150 stores to close in North America in the next three years. It is closely watching 300 more and must soon decide whether to keep renting their spaces. Roger S. Markfield, a top executive at American Eagle, said foot traffic has been down for all chain stores in the malls.

Tunick noted that Abercrombie had closed 260 locations since 2011. Pacific Sun had closed 230 stores in that period. Aeropostale is expected to close up to 300 locations in the next few years, he said.

The pullback isn't done. Abercrombie recently said it is on track to close 60 to 70 stores this year where their contracts with landlords are almost up. Analyst Thomas A. Filandro, who works for Susquehanna Financial Group, pointed out that more than 500 of Abercrombie's rental contracts are up for renewal through 2016.

Analyst Randal J. Konik of Jeffries said 30 percent of teen market store space could be closed over the next three years.

If teen clothing retailers are finding they need less physical space, the timing might not be bad for the shopping center industry. Things hit a low point in 2010 and 2011 as the recession played out. Now regional malls have an average of 93 percent of their space filled and shopping centers overall are at 92 percent, said Jesse Tron, a spokesman for New York trade group International Council of Shopping Centers.

"We're back to pre-recessionary levels in terms of occupancy," he said.

## Making Stores And Shopping More Welcoming

At the group's annual trade show last month in Las Vegas, Tron said activity had picked up since the recession when people seemed to be hiding out in their booths. He noted 94 percent of sales in the United States are still through physical stores. The remaining 6 percent are made online or through mobile devices.

Shopping centers want to focus now on seamlessly integrating online and offline stores. That may bring store closures, but Tron noted there are other chains, like Uniqlo and H&amp;M, adding locations. Also, some online-only merchants are finding they want physical spaces to raise their profile and give customers a different shopping experience.

"Experience" is likely to be a popular buzzword going forward. Companies hope to keep brick-and-mortar stores contributing to sales results by making stores welcoming and the visits worth the effort.

In the past, Abercrombie's stores had windows covered by blinds. Meanwhile, the company's Hollister chain stores were distinctive for their beach shack entrances that made it hard to see inside.

Now the company is testing a remodeled version of the Hollister stores, with 75 to 100 expected to be done by year's end. Jonathan E. Ramsden, chief operating officer at Abercrombie, said that it's evident why the new storefronts are effective.

"I mean it's very fresh and new," he said. "You can see into the store. You can see the merchandise â€¦ We're certainly pulling more customers into the store, which is clearly one of our core objectives over the next few years to drive greater traffic."
