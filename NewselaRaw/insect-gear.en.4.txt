LOS ANGELESâ€” Gears make all kinds of machines work. They keep grandfather clocks ticking. They help steer cars. But the interlocking systems of cogs are not just man-made inventions. Scientists have just discovered gears in nature. They have turned up in the legs of a certain kind of insect.

The discovery was published in the journal Science. It is the first known example of working gears to develop in a living species.

"It's a wonderful example of the clever solutions that nature comes up with," said Robert Full. He's a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the study. "It was brilliant."

The discovery happened while scientist Malcolm Burrows was examining planthoppers. The insects are part of the genus Issus. They cannot fly, so they move around by jumping. Burrows found that younger planthoppers had gear teeth on the inside of their legs. These teeth locked into place while the insects jumped.

## Gear Teeth On Legs Seen On Film

The scientists weren't looking to find gears in nature. "Why would we?" said Burrows. He ran the study with engineer Gregory Sutton. "There's been no description of gear wheels functioning in animals before."

These planthoppers make fleas and other jumping insects look lazy in comparison. The adult bugs can leap with an acceleration of roughly 500 Gs in a millisecond, Burrows said. Gs, or G-force, are a way of measuring how fast something speeds up. An average human can withstand about 5 Gs. After that, humans pass out.

To figure out what made these insects so springy, the researchers went outdoors to gather a few bugs. They received a little help from Burrows' young grandson. Some of the planthoppers they found were adults. Others were younger.

The pair used a very fast camera to photograph the planthoppers while they jumped. That's when they saw the gear teeth on the insides of the insects' legs. Each gear strip was about 350 to 400 micrometers long. A credit card is about twice as thick. Each had about 10 to 12 teeth in each.

The discovery was shocking. Burrows had been studying jumping insects for a long time, and he'd never seen anything like it.

## Jumping Faster Than A Bug Thought

Other insects, like grasshoppers, use their legs to push their bodies straight up. But the planthoppers' legs move more like a breaststroke in swimming. They spread out to the sides while moving the body upward.

That can be a tricky movement. If one leg moves first, the planthopper will end up spinning, like someone swimming with one arm.

But sending a signal from the brain to get both legs to work together takes time. It also requires extra brainpower. So the planthopper's body has a fix that keeps the legs in step without thinking. When one leg starts to jump, the gear teeth on that leg work with the gear teeth on the other. That lets them both push off at the same time.

Using the gears, the insects' legs can match their moves within 30 microseconds. There are 1 million microseconds in a second. If the insect had to think about this it would take longer. It might take one or two milliseconds to send a message from its brain to its muscles.

Using the gears is tens of times faster than a bug's thought.

## Getting New Gears Until Adulthood

Oddly, only the young ones have these gears, Burrows and Sutton discovered. The adults lose the gears when they're fully grown. It seems their legs are strong enough without the gears.

But why not keep using the gears into adulthood? Perhaps it's because they might wear out, Burrows said.

If you break a tooth on a gear in your car or your bike, you have to get it fixed. The young ones don't have repair shops. They shed their bodies and move into larger and larger exoskeletons as they grow. Exoskeletons are shells that some animals grow around their bodies.

Because they're constantly getting new exoskeletons they don't have to worry about repairs. Once they're adults, their bodies are set, so they don't have that chance to get new exoskeletons, and new gears.
