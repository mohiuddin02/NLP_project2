WASHINGTON, D.C. — Bicyclists need to pay attention while they are riding. For this reason, some cities and states are telling riders to stay off of their smartphones and music devices. Cities are trying to make it easier for bicycles to get around. 

At the same time, more people are using smartphones and music players. Officials are worried that bicycle riders do not pay attention when they are using the devices. Officials think that riders are putting themselves and other people in danger.

Steven Howitt is a lawmaker in the state of Massachusetts. He introduced a bill that says riders cannot wear headphones while on their bikes. A bill is an idea that lawmakers would like to become a law.

Howitt says car drivers cannot wear headphones. He thinks it should be the same for bicyclists. He says, "A biker could be cutting across an intersection, and an ambulance is coming through and he's not hearing it if he's playing music."

## Just A Few States Have Laws

Most states do not include bicyclists in cellphone or texting laws. The states that do are California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia. An automobile group says that the state of Pennsylvania even considers bicycles to be vehicles. People driving vehicles cannot use headphones in that state, so bicyclists cannot either.

The state of Delaware does not allow bikers to wear headphones over both ears. Maryland does not either, except on bike paths. Rhode Island does not even allow bikers or drivers to wear earpieces in one ear.

Jeffrey Dinowitz, a lawmaker from New York state, says he has tried for years to get a bill passed there. His bill would stop bicyclists from using cellphones or texting. 

Dinowitz says, "I've seen people bicycling and talking on their cellphones at the same time. I've seen people texting. That's crazy." New York already does not allow drivers to use cellphones on the road. 

The problem of bicyclists using cellphones and texting is new, so most states do not yet have laws about it.

## Big Cities Worry About Bike Riders

Several big cities, such as Chicago, have local laws about bicycles and electronic devices. Chicago is in the state of Illinois. Bike riders there cannot hold cellphones in their hands. They also pay more money if they are in an accident.

New York City is thinking about a bill, too. Police would ticket bikers who are caught with devices. The first time, bikers could avoid paying money by going to a bike safety class. They could do this only if they did not hurt anyone or damage property. 

Mark Treyger is a lawmaker who created the bill. He says he noticed the problem after he saw a biker go into oncoming traffic and almost cause an accident. The biker was texting.

People who support bicyclists say there is no need for new laws. They think common sense should be enough. They also say there is no proof that headphone and smartphone use has hurt or killed anyone.

Peter Wilborn is a lawyer. He belongs to a group that works with bicyclists. He says, "I don't think we need laws specifically for this."

## One Bike Group Agrees: No Texting

Ken McLeod belongs to a group of bicyclists. He says his group thinks bikers should choose whether to wear headphones. McLeod's group is not likely to support bicycle laws against headphones. However, the group does think that a law against texting is a good idea.

McLeod warned there could be problems with how cities or states put together the new biking laws. Many bicyclists attach cellphones to their handlebars and use them to train for sports. Those people should not get into trouble. he says.

McLeod also worries that bicyclists using cellphones or headphones are more likely to be noticed by police. They are easier to see than drivers. He says, "If they're going to be doing more enforcement of distracted biking than distracted driving, that's not the answer."
