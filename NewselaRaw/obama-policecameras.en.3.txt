WASHINGTON â€” In August, an 18-year-old African-American was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. People in the community held protests. They called for a change in how police treat the people of their town.

They held up signs, marched and shouted because they felt Michael Brown's death was not right.

To keep the protests calm, police departments sent officers with armored cars, large guns and body armor to the marches. They looked more like soldiers than police. Their weapons made some people more upset.

Now, President Barack Obama is ordering new rules. He wants to help fix the relationship between police forces and the communities they protect. To do this, he wants to control how local police forces get military weapons. He also wants police officers to wear cameras while on duty.

## Military Weapons

Obama wants to spend $263 million over three years to train police officers. It will also pay for body cameras. These cameras record when the police deal with the public. The money could help buy as many as 50,000 cameras.

Cameras like these might have given more information about Brown's death. Last week, a grand jury in Missouri decided that the officer who shot Brown would not be brought to trial. The officer said Brown was attacking him, while witnesses said different things. Video could have shown what happened.

The president wants to create new rules. He wants the rules to fix the relationship between police and the communities.

The White House is also looking at how police get the military weapons. They get them through "surplus" programs. The programs give local police departments weapons and armored cars used by the military. The programs are run by the Department of Defense and other government agencies.

## New Rules Set

The White House looked into the programs and found they did not have clear rules. For example, the police did not have to be trained to use the equipment.

It was an especially interesting discovery because police in Ferguson have been using the military equipment since summer.

Now, Obama's staff has to come up with a list of allowed military gear. They will list equipment that police have a real use for. This will make sure it can be used safely by local police forces.

Under the new rules, officials of the communities will have to approve the military equipment that police get. The police will also have to be specially trained to use it.

Obama is also setting up a new task force. It will come up with ideas for fighting crime while still building public trust.
