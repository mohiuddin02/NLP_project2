LOS ANGELES – Doctors usually cannot determine if a child has an autism spectrum disorder until age 2 at least. But, a new study finds that signs of it can be seen as early as two months after birth.

Autism is usually thought of as a serious developmental problem. People with autism often have trouble communicating with others. They may have a habit of doing things over and over, or to focus on one interest to the exclusion of everything else. Autism spectrum disorder is a group of several brain disorders. Some people may have different levels of skills, or problems, within the spectrum.

The study's researchers focused on babies' ability to make eye contact with caregivers. A lack of eye contact is one of the signs of autism. Among typical children, interest in the eyes increased steadily with age. But for children with autism, interest in the eyes declined starting between 2 and 6 months of age.

By their second birthdays, levels of eye contact among children with autism were only half as high as typically developing children.  The new study was published Wednesday by the journal Nature.

## Opportunity For Early Treatment

Researchers expected to see a difference between the two groups of kids. But, they were surprised that the infants who were later diagnosed with autism started out just like their peers. That suggests that some of the skills that help people get along in the world and be social may be there at first in babies' brains. If true, that would "offer a remarkable opportunity for treatment," the researchers wrote.

Warren Jones and Ami Klin of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta recruited 110 infants for their study. Among them, 59 had a sibling with some form of autism. That group was considered at high risk of developing the condition themselves. An additional 51 infants who had no close relatives with autism were considered at low risk. That group were the controls. In an experiment, it's typical to have a control group to make sure there aren't other reasons for a study's conclusions.

The infants were shown scenes of typical caregiving. At the same time, the researchers tracked their eyes to see where the babies looked. They measured the amount of time spent paying attention to the woman's eyes, mouth, body and nearby objects. The subjects were tested 10 times over the course of the study between the time they were 2 months and 20 months old.

By age 3, 13 were diagnosed with a form of autism — 10 boys and two girls from the high-risk group and one boy from the control group. To make things simple, the researchers focused their study on boys: 11 with autism and 25 without.

## Eye Contact Decline Detected Early

The results showed that differences in eye interest became apparent when the babies were between 2 and 6 months old. During those months, the boys in the control group spent more time focused on the caregiver's eyes than the mouth, body or other places. But for the boys with autism, interest in the caregiver's eyes dropped after the 2-month test.

The researchers also found that steeper declines in eye interest mattered. They were linked to more severe cases.

Other differences came out as well. Boys in both groups showed increasing interest in the caregiver's mouth up through the age of 18 months. However, the boys who were developing normally lost interest in the body much more quickly than the boys with autism.

 Jones and Klin said that the study was small in "sample size," since it looked at just a few babies. But it showed the "derailment of skills" in some kids.

If the results are confirmed and doctors are able to identify children with autism as early as 2 months of age, therapists could get involved earlier. And they might get better results.

If doctors can spot the signs of autism earlier, "the more effective our treatment interventions can be," said Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.

NIMH paid for the study.
