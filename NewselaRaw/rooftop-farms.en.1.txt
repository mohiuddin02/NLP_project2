CHICAGO, Ill. — For more than a decade, Chicago has been at the forefront of the green-roof movement, with its hundreds of rooftop gardens. Now the city is ready to take an active role in the next environmental push — using roofs to grow food. It is a movement that is sparking interest in cities nationwide.

Rooftop farms are popping up all around the city. The McCormick Place convention center has grown tens of thousands of pounds of produce since 2013. Likewise, a historic factory in the Pullman neighborhood is expected to have the world's largest rooftop farming operation when it is completed this summer. Even small businesses and educational programs have them in Chicago.

## It's Just The Beginning

Steven Peck is president of Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, a business group from Toronto, Canada, that promotes green roofs. He said cities are only just beginning to understand green roofs and rooftop farms.

Across the country, there has been a call for new food-producing spaces, Peck said.

"There's a demand for high-quality food in our cities," he said. "There's a longing for people living in densely developed cities to reconnect to farming and to nature, to rooftop agriculture."

It's too early to tell what kind of impact rooftop farming could have on food production, because the industry is still so young.

Peter Strazzabosco works for the city of Chicago planning and development division. He believes there are at least 13 rooftop farms in Chicago, although he said there could be more.

There are other cities known for being green too. Washington, D.C., has three rooftop farms and Toronto has two, according to officials in those cities.

## The Greening Of Chicago

Michael Bryson, a professor at Roosevelt University in Chicago, said the discussion of sustainability is important. He believes city-based agriculture can help us to improve how we grow and distribute food.

Rooftop farms make sense in Chicago, a city already known for its rooftop gardens and green development, Bryson said.

"Chicago has really embraced the ethos and practice of city farming," he said.

Former mayor of Chicago, Richard M. Daley, got the idea after seeing rooftop gardens during a trip to Germany. He returned with a mission to turn Chicago into a green-movement leader and installed the city's first green roof atop city hall in 2000.

In the years since, green roofs have garnered a lot of attention. Chicago has been recognized as one of the leaders in North America and now has more than 5.5 million square feet of gardens on more than 500 rooftops, Chicago city official Strazzabosco said.

Even that is still a small number. Those 500 green roofs represent a little less than one-tenth of 1 percent of Chicago's more than half a million buildings. By comparison, experts in Germany said that in 2010, 15 to 20 percent of the flat roofs in that country were green.

## View From The Roof

Green Roofs for Healthy Cities does not keep figures on the total number of green roofs in North America, just for the cities adding the most from year to year. Washington has been adding green roofs the fastest of any city over the past four years, Peck said.

Washington officials said the city has 2.3 million square feet of green roofs, while Philadelphia reported more than 1 million square feet.

To better promote city farming, Chicago in 2011 passed a zoning law specifically allowing rooftop farms to be built in the city.

Now Gotham Greens, a company from New York, is set to open a rooftop farm in August in the Pullman neighborhood on Chicago's far South Side. They claim it will be the world's largest.

The farm will be built on a factory owned by Method, the eco-friendly soap company. It began a partnership with Gotham Greens last spring. When the farm opens, it will span 75,000 square feet, or nearly 2 acres. It will yield produce equal to a 40-acre farm, Gotham Greens CEO Viraj Puri said.

## Location, Location, Location

Chicago's green approach, as well as good timing, helped bring the company to the city, according to Puri. Gotham Greens was looking for a place in Chicago to expand its brand and Method reached out and suggested a partnership.

"For a lot of reasons, Chicago checked a lot of boxes for us," Puri said.

Like New York, Puri said, Chicago provides an opportunity to build upward.

New York officials said they did not have a tally of green roofs. However, Gotham Greens already has three commercial rooftop farms in New York: 15,000- and 20,000-square-foot operations in Brooklyn, and a 60,000-square-foot rooftop in Queens that will begin crop production this year.

## Local Leafy Greens

An improvement in technology has also contributed to the growth of rooftop farms.

At Method, a greenhouse will include sensors that track temperature, humidity, light, carbon dioxide and oxygen. This eliminates the seasonal limitations of cities like Chicago with harsh winters, Puri said. A computer system will be used to adjust those levels as necessary.

Puri said Gotham Greens chose leafy greens to produce locally because they are highly perishable, and can spoil quickly if shipped in from far away. They do not store as well as other vegetables that have to be shipped long distances either. The greens will be sold to local retailers, food distributors, restaurants and farmers markets.
