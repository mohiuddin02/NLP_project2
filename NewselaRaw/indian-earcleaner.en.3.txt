MUMBAI, India â€” Sayed Mehboob has an unusual job. He cleans ears for a living.

Today Mehboob is squatting on a low wooden stool on a patch of sidewalk. Crowds rush by him as he waits for customers.

Mehboob has set up near Mumbai's Grant Road train station. Around him young workers set off on lunch break. Packs of students race by. Rich housewives step out of air-conditioned cars with leather seats.

## Clean Your Ear?

Mehboob is undisturbed by the noise and rush all around him. He slides a smaller stool toward a visitor.

"Would you like me to clean your ear?" he asks with a smile.

It may seem like an unusual idea, particularly on Mumbai's crowded and dirty streets. Who in this city has time to stop and get his ears cleaned? Who would think of having it done on the street?

Yet cleaning people's ears has been Mehboob's business for more than 20 years.

## A Fading Profession

Mehboob's line of work is gradually disappearing. Only a few ear cleaners can still be found on the sidewalks of Mumbai. All wear red handkerchiefs tied around their heads.

A young man approaches Mehboob, who points toward the empty stool.

Mehboob opens his bag of tools. He pulls out a steel pin the length of a pencil and wraps the tip in a wad of cotton. Then, he carefully puts the tip inside Gaurav's ear.

Many of Mumbai's last remaining street ear cleaners come from southern India. Some say the job goes back to the 1700s.

Mehboob learned to clean ears when he came to look for work in Mumbai 25 years ago. A fellow southerner taught him the trade.

## "Just Something To Do"

"It was just something to do," he says. The crowded city's air was filled with smoke and dust. Getting one's ears cleaned on the street was common, he said.

Mehboob charges 30 cents for a simple cleaning of both ears. The whole thing takes less time than a good shoeshine. A fancier cleaning costs 80 cents. For them he adds a bit of cream and some coconut oil.

"That's if the ear is inflamed, or if it's really red," he says. The cream and oil are soothing, he said.

Most days Mehboob has around a dozen customers, he says. For long stretches he sits alone. In the late afternoon, he moves farther down the road to be closer to the arriving trains. Many people coming home from work get off the trains during that time of day.

## Most Customers Are Older

A lot of the young people who pass Mehboob on the street probably do not know what he does. Most of his regular customers are elderly, he says. They are good, steady customers, though. In some cases he even goes to their home to clean their ears.

"Rich people," he says proudly.

Still, Mehboob's trade will probably die out sometime soon. Most people clean their own ears now that Q-tips are common. Doctors tell people not to get their ears cleaned on the street. They could end up with an infection, doctors say. People with an earache or clogged ears should visit a doctor, they say.

## Teaching His Nephew

Mehboob shares a room nearby with 15 men. In a good month he saves around $80.

Mehboob carries his savings back to his hometown every few months. His family has a small farm there.

Ear cleaning will probably hold out a little longer on the streets of Mumbai. Mehboob has taught his nephew the trade.

Mehboob says people should not listen to doctors who tell them not to visit men like him.

"Of course the doctors say that," he says. "It's good for their business."
