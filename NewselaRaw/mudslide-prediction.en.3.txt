SEATTLE â€” On Saturday, a hillside about an hour north of Seattle was buried in 40 feet of mud. At least 24 people were killed and dozens of homes were destroyed.

When Lynne Rodgers Miller saw the news of the mudslide, she knew exactly where the land had given way. Her husband, Daniel Miller, knew, too.

In 1999, the Millers wrote a report filed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a government agency that tries to prevent disasters. It warned of a possible disaster on the hill.

"We've known it would happen at some point," he said. Daniel Miller studies how hills and rivers are made and change. "We just didn't know when."

## The Hill's History

Daniel Miller knows the hill's history. He has collected reports and information since the 1950s. He has a half-dozen folders stuffed with maps, slides, models and drawings. They all tell the story of an unstable hillside that has repeatedly collapsed.

That is why he could not believe what he saw in 2006 when he visited the hill weeks after a landslide. Instead of people leaving their homes on Steelhead Drive, carpenters were building new ones.

"Frankly, I was shocked that the county permitted any building across from the river," he said.

"We've known that it's been failing," he said of the hill.

Based on the area's history, he thinks officials should have known the danger of a slide. John Pennington, head of Snohomish County's Department of Emergency Management, disagrees. "It was considered very safe," Pennington said. "This was a completely unforeseen slide. This came out of nowhere."

John Lovick is in charge of running Snohomish County. He and Public Works Director Steve Thomsen said Monday night they were not aware of the 1999 report. A slide of this size "is very difficult to predict," Thomsen said. "There was no indication, no indication at all."

Even after a mudslide in 2006, at least five homes were built that year on Steelhead Drive. Another home was built in the neighborhood in 2009.

"They didn't even stop pounding nails," said Tracy Drury, an environmental engineer who studied the area with Miller soon after the 2006 slide. "We were surprised."

## Millions Of Tons Of Dirt

Irvin Wood and his wife, Judith, of Bothell, owned the last home allowed in the slide zone.

The Woods were not there on Saturday when the mudslide wiped out their home.

Wood said nobody was warned that a huge mudslide could happen. But he said it was unrealistic for people to think the government could prevent the disaster.

"If the hillsides were going to (slide) away, they were going to (slide) away," Wood said. "That's kind of what happens around here."

There have been at least five slides on the site.

A 1949 report found that a main cause of the slides is the river slowly washing away the "toe" of an older slide. The "toe" supports the millions of tons of dirt behind it, like someone with their back against a bulging door. Eventually, the toe fails and gravity pulls the hillside down again.

Nearly 600 feet of the cliff face broke away in Saturday's monster slide. This is about nine times taller than the 1949 slide and four times taller than a slide in 1967.

"We always thought there was a possibility that a catastrophic event could come," said Pat Stevenson, who is in charge of environmental issues for the Stillaguamish Tribe. "We were hoping that wouldn't happen."

## "They're In Shock"

Over the years, there was talk about whether to buy out the property owners in the area. But nothing came of it. No one really wanted to sell their property and move, Drury said.

Stevenson said county officials were more concerned with possible flooding in the area. They were not really thinking about the risk of a mudslide.

Ron and Gail Thompson moved into a cabin on Steelhead Drive in 2003, said their daughter, Jennifer Johnson.

The Army Corps of Engineers showed her a map. They promised "mom and dad's house would be safe," she said.

"When we moved them in there, I never in a million years, never in a billion years, thought about (a mudslide) ... Dad was like, 'We're going to be fine,' and I just believed him," she said.

Johnson's parents and 85-year-old grandmother left their house eight minutes before the slide hit for a shopping trip, Johnson said. The couple lost everything.

"They are in mourning. They're in shock," she said. "They're heartbroken for their neighbors."
