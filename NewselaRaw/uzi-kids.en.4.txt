TUCSON, Ariz. — Last week, a girl accidentally shot a gun teacher at a shooting range.

Many people are asking why a child was allowed to fire a powerful gun.

But gun teachers and supporters have a different question. What's the proper way to teach children about firearms?

Charles Vacca was 39 years old. He was killed at the Last Stop range in Arizona on Aug. 25. He was showing the 9-year-old how to fire an Uzi. The gun is made for soldiers to use. The girl lost control of the weapon and accidentally shot Vacca. Officials are not letting the public know the names of the girl or her parents.

No one will be charged with a crime, police said.

## Training Is Important

Butch Jensen is a firearms teacher at Southeast Regional Park Shooting Range. The range is also in Arizona. A shooting range is a place where people practice firing guns. Jensen said that parents should be the ones to decide if their child can shoot.

The important thing is training, he said. A gun is a tool. Like any tool — be it a hammer or a kitchen knife — a gun requires proper instruction.

Jensen said the girl was clearly a beginner. "You don't start a beginner in that type of firearm," he said.

Jensen's shooting range does not allow full automatic fire. A gun on full automatic shoots bullets in a steady stream. The Uzi was on full automatic fire at the time of the accident. It did not fire one bullet at a time, but would keep firing if the girl held the trigger down.

At Jensen's range, children are allowed to shoot guns. Children under 16 must be watched by a parent, Jensen said.

## "That's The Thing About Guns"

There were no children Thursday morning at Jensen's range. Blake Carrington took aim at a paper target against a dirt ridge. Above him was a sign. It read: "Safety is no accident."

Carrington has taught his 10-year-old daughter to shoot.

"I personally would never give my child a fully automatic weapon," he said. "I feel terrible for that little girl having to live with that."

Carrington said he was not sure whether gun laws should be stricter for children. "That's the thing about guns," he said. "They will do exactly what the human tells them to do. Poor decision making is what gets us."

Federal law does not allow children under 18 to own a gun. However, it doesn't stop children from firing them at a gun range.

Arizona is one of 21 states that allows children under 18 to fire guns. Adults have to watch them at all times, said Lindsey Zwicker. She is a lawyer with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

"When things like this happen, we do draw our attention to the law," Zwicker said. "There is discussion on what can be done to prevent this in the future."

## Uzis Are Not For Kids

Standing near Carrington at the gun range was another man, Tom. He did not want his last name used in the article. He worried the accident will lead to guns being outlawed.

Tom said he shoots for sport. He also wants to practice his Second Amendment rights. The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to have guns. "I don't think you should keep kids away from firearms," he said. "This shouldn't keep people from taking their kids to the range."

Still, Tom said he could not understand why the girl was allowed to shoot an Uzi. "I don't know what they were thinking," he said. Allowing anyone under 15 shooting an Uzi "is not a good idea."

Sean Yeandle is a firearms teacher. He works at another Arizona shooting range. He has never seen anyone under 21 years old fire an Uzi there.

Children have to be at least 10 to shoot a gun. A parent has to be watching at all times. A teacher must stand behind the child for safety and to keep control of the gun.

Teaching a child to shoot an Uzi is not worth the risk, he said.
