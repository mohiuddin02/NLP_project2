HOMS, Syria â€” Talal Barazi is governor of Homs province, a large region of Syria. He is seated in a hotel restaurant in the province's main city, also called Homs.

The hotel is heavily guarded. As for the city, there is not a lot of it left. Much of it has been destroyed by Syria's savage civil war. For the past five years, forces loyal to the government of President Bashar Assad have been fighting various rebel groups that are seeking to gain control of the country.

Much of the city of Homs is now in ruins. It is like "Berlin after World War II," Barazi says.

"Some of Homs will be rebuilt, but some will have to be torn down completely," Barazi says. "We can't just look at all the ruins and feel sad."

## A Sea Of Refugees And Rubble

Much of the province's prewar population of 2 million has fled, either to safer parts of Syria or to other countries. For those still here by choice or necessity, life has taken on a strange and ghostly air.

Syria as a whole is full bombed-out buildings, rubble-strewn streets and refugees on the move.

The great majority of Syrians still live in zones controlled by the government. In those parts of the country something somewhat resembling normal life still continues. Various rebel groups now control big sections of the country, but much of those areas is desert with few people.

More than 4 million people have left Syria since the civil war began. Another 8 million were pushed out of their homes and forced to move elsewhere in the country.

Still, Syrians are trying hard to maintain ties with family and friends.

## Friends, Families Scatter Around World

Daily conversations on Skype or WhatsApp help people stay in touch with those scattered around the world.

"Every night we spend at least an hour on WhatsApp trying to catch up," Elia Samman says. He now lives in Damascus, Syria's capital city, but Samman grew up in Homs.

Of nine Homs families his family was close to, he says, only three remain in Syria. The rest have left for Sweden, Germany, Egypt, Persian Gulf nations or other destinations.

One of his close friends had built his family dream house in Homs. He completed it just before the war broke out.

"He was only able to live there for about 20 days; then the conflict came," Samman says. The house is now in the hands of a rebel group, he says.

Syria today is full of contradictions. In Damascus, the Hamidiya covered market is still full of seemingly carefree shoppers. The famous ice cream store Bakdash does a brisk business, selling fresh, Arabic-style ice cream topped with pistachio flakes.

Just a few miles away things are very different, however. Here one sees block after block of bullet-riddled apartment buildings and blown-open shops. The echo of gunfire can be heard in the distance. Motorists passing through are advised not to stop.

## City Split Into Army, Rebel Zones

Aleppo, Syria's largest city, is now divided into government-controlled and rebel-held zones. Rebels continually launch shells and rockets across a no man's land into the government zone. The army, in turn, pounds the rebel side with heavy gunfire and bombs. The fighting kills mostly ordinary citizens, while adding to the rubble piles.

At first glance, the University of Aleppo seems as if it could be a school anywhere in the world. Students on benches read books and scribble notes, while others scurry to and from classrooms.

Look closer, though, and one notices craters and fenced-off areas marking sites where shells and rockets have fallen. Scores of students, teachers and passersby have been killed.

Aleppo's Old City is full of charred storefronts, bombed-out buildings, and hidden rebel gunmen. Nonetheless, Mahmoud Badawi still keeps his small shop open. Almost all his customers are Syrian soldiers who line up to purchase snacks, cigarettes and soft drinks.

Gone are the days when tourists and window-shoppers strolled along the winding alleys. Back then the Old City was lively and bustling, and full of small businesses. Today only a few holdouts remain, including Badawi, who cannot imagine living anywhere else.

"Why would I leave?" Badawi asks. "Aleppo is my home."
