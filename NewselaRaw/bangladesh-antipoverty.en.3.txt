DES MOINES, Iowa â€” The winner of the 2015 World Food Prize has just been announced. It has been given to a man who created a special company. His company has helped more than 150 million poor people.

Fazle Hasan Abed created the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) to help the poor. He first created BRAC in the early 1970s. In 1971 the Bangladesh Liberation War started. Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan. The end of the war made Bangladesh its own country. Abed's company helped many people in this new country.

## Poverty Is Not A Simple Problem

BRAC is one of the world's largest companies devoted to helping people. BRAC is a very special type of company. It is called an NGO, which means nongovernmental organization. NGOs are not part of the government. They only focus on helping people. They are not trying to make money for themselves.

Abed believes that being poor has to do with many things. It is not a simple problem. Being poor does not just happen because of too little money or jobs, he says. Abel thinks poverty also has to do with lack of education and heath care.

## Why Abed Won The Award

The World Food Prize was created in 1986. It was created to be given to those who help people get clean food. Abed did this, and many other great things.

The president of the World Food Prize Foundation is Kenneth Quinn. He likes how Abed carried out change in Bangladesh. Abed was able to reach many people in desperate need of help. His ability to help so many people is what won him the award.

## Helping Many People In Many Ways

Abed first wanted to lower the child death rates in Bangladesh. He also wanted to give women power. He wanted women to see that they could work just as well as men in the business world. He taught them how to farm well. He also taught them how to grow extra crops so they could sell them.

More than a billion people in the world live on less than $1.25 a day. They are the people who really need BRAC's help.

BRAC has also created an experimental program. It wants to help those who make less than $1.25 a day. It will be used in more countries if the experiment works. People who join will get a check once a week. The money will help them not have to beg on the streets. They will also learn how to manage money. BRAC even provides families with animals like a cow, goats or chickens to help them make money on their own.

## Teaching Skills To The Poor

"In many countries, poor people are not seen as a solution to the problem," Abed said. He thinks the poor can solve the problem of poverty. Abed says the poor need to be taught the skills to help themselves. This is what BRAC is trying to do.

"The hard work is done by the poor themselves to defeat poverty," he said.

In 1992, 6 out of every 10 people were poor in Bangladesh. Thanks in part to BRAC, only 3 out of every 10 people were poor in 2010.

Abed will be awarded the World Food Prize at a ceremony in October in Des Moines, Iowa.
