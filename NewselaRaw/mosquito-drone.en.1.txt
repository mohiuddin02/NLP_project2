MIAMI — The remote-controlled aircraft known as a drone has been a powerful but controversial weapon against terror. Now, it is about to take on a new and seemingly inexhaustible enemy: the black salt marsh mosquito.

On Sept. 2, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District began testing the next-generation drone. The hope is that it will provide a high-tech edge in the daily battle to beat back the swarms.

The new [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) is about half the size of ospreys, the large sea hawks commonly seen in the Keys. It won't be equipped to spray or blast bugs. Instead, it will be rigged with an infrared thermal camera that detects temperature variations.

The goal is to survey the area's difficult-to-access mangrove swamps. These are breeding grounds for the marsh mosquito, the biggest biter in the island chain.

## Seeking Pools In Mangrove Thickets

Mosquitoes thrive in shallow pools of water, where they grow from tiny larval worms to buzzing blood-suckers in just days. If the bird-size eye in the sky can accurately detect such pools, it could save mosquito-fighters time, effort and money.

"Our people on the ground have to walk an hour to a marsh and find out what's there,'' said Michael Doyle, the district's executive director. "It's hard to cover all those places at once. If something like this could allow them to map where the water is, we could move a lot more quickly.''

Whether the drone proves an effective mosquito hunter or not, the test shows how unmanned aerial vehicles are quickly changing. Drones have revolutionized warfare and been adopted by law enforcement, raising muddy political and privacy questions not yet sorted out. But they also are being employed for an increasing number of commercial and research uses.

They've helped track poachers in Africa, monitor wildfires in California and capture gases spewing from a volcano in Costa Rica. In coming years, researchers at the University of Florida hope to be able to use drones for a variety of new purposes. Squadrons of drones no bigger than paper airplanes may soon be dispatched to gather data from extreme locations where manned aircraft can be at risk, such as hurricanes or ice shelves.

## Fast And Furious Breeders

The new anti-mosquito drone was developed by Prioria Robotics, a small Gainesville company founded by University of Florida engineering and business students. It has been dubbed the Maveric.

"I would have laughed two years ago if you would have told me this could help with mosquito control," said Derek Lyons, the company's vice president of sales. "You put it in people's hands and it becomes like the iPhone. You have no idea what the applications are going to be once you get it there.''

In the Keys, the potential application is to help the largest and most challenging mosquito control operation in the state.

Marsh mosquitoes aren't public health threats like Aedes aegypti, which spreads dengue fever, but they are the most common annoyance. Fast and furious breeders, they erupt with every rainstorm or tide change that floods mangrove thickets. The key to controlling them, Doyle said, is directing the district's helicopters to hit breeding areas with bacteria granules. These kill developing larvae before they take wing.

## Drone Launched By Hand

Doyle estimated the tactic eliminates about 80 percent of marsh mosquitoes. Those that escape can be controlled by spraying. However, spraying is increasingly restricted, due to efforts to protect vanishing tropical butterflies.

"The noose is kind of tightening in terms of our ability to spray for adults," he said. "We have to improve the accuracy of killing them at the larval stage."

The battery-powered drone weighs 2.6 pounds and has a wing span of just over 2-½ feet. It can easily be launched by hand like a paper airplane. Or, thanks to wings made of flexible metal fabric, it can be shot from a 6-inch-diameter carrying tube. The drone can fly for up to 70 minutes in a six-mile radius, cruising at about 30 miles per hour. As it flies, its rotating camera streams live video to a laptop computer.

The drone costs $65,000.

Doyle stressed that the district hasn't yet decided whether to buy a drone. He questions whether the cameras will be able to pick out pools that are only a few inches deep. They simply may not stand out enough from surrounding soggy soils.

Fred Culbertson acknowledged that mosquito hunting will be "a learning experience" for everyone involved. He's piloting the test flights. "But we feel that once we get down and work with them for a couple of days, we can probably tweak things to make it work."
