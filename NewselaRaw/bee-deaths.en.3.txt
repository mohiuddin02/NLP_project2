ST. LOUIS — Honeybees are in trouble. They are dying in great numbers, and no one knows why.

One-third of the food we eat depends on pollination by honeybees. The bees transport the pollen from one part of a plant to another. Plants then grow and produce fruit, grains or vegetables. Our food system would break down without the work done by bees.

Beekeeping groups have held meetings. Scientists have studied the problem. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a report suggesting there may be many causes, from stress to chemicals.

Now agricultural and chemical companies are jumping in. Seed producer Monsanto Co. bought an Israeli bee research company two years ago. Bayer CropScience, another large company, is building a 5,500-square-foot "bee health center." Chemical giant Syngenta joined Bayer in developing what it called an "action plan for bee health."

The agricultural businesses are very interested in finding a solution. American crops are worth $20 billion, and the crops depend on bees.

## Bee Population Drop

But some scientists argue it might be the fault of the companies for using many pesticides.

In 2006, beekeepers started noticing that bees were abandoning their hives. The American bee population has been dropping by about one-third every year since then. Researchers, beekeepers and farmers are  trying to figure out why.

Scientists believe there are two main causes. The first is the use of chemicals used to keep insects off crops. The second is a farming system that relies too much on one type of crop. Planting single crops such as corn or soybeans crowds out other plants and flowers. This practice is common in the Midwest. The bees lose all variety in their diet and become less healthy.

Marla Spivak, a University of Minnesota entomologist, said she's worried about the lack of flowers that bees need to survive. She says chemicals called insecticides used to kill crop pests are deadly to bees at high doses.

The worst for bees, some say, is the class of insect-killing chemicals is called neonicotinoids. They are considered less harmful to humans and animals, so they are widely used. Neonicotinoids are sprayed on most of the corn and soybean seeds planted in the U.S.

## A Pesticide To Blame?

Huge numbers of bees died in the spring when planters were spraying their corn crops. Researcher Christian Krupke found high levels of neonicotinoid in the dead bees.

"I know, definitively, that there's a relationship between treated seed and spring die-offs," said Krupke. He said the chemical lands on dandelions and even on the bees themselves.

Neonicotinoids are made by Bayer and Syngenta. Their scientists dispute the connection between the pesticide and the health of bees.

There's no scientific evidence linking neonics with bee health — period," said Dave Fischer. He works for Bayer CropScience and explained that Bayer relies heavily on bees for pollination. He said it would make no business sense for Bayer to poison bees since it depends on them.

But some researchers question whether neonicotinoids are even necessary. The industry claims it increases the amount of crops produced per acre.

Krupke has done studies to see if that's true. "We have not found any difference in yield or root damage — nothing," he said. "It doesn't mean it never works. But it means we certainly don't need to be putting it on every kernel of corn."

## Time Running Short

Union of Concerned Scientists president Doug Gurian-Sherman calls the problem very serious. He would like to see insect-killing chemical use stopped as soon as possible. Missouri's beekeepers would seem to agree.

Neal Bergman runs the state's largest bee operation. He remembers a time in the 2000s when crop planes sprayed cotton fields with the chemical malathion.

"They sprayed 400,000 acres of cotton every week," he said. "It didn't matter how the wind was blowing or what time of day it was. They sprayed over people, over animals, over beehives — everything."

Bergman says his bee population dropped sharply, costing him $1 million. He almost went out of business. Since then he doesn't trust the chemicals. He would like farmers to make sure they don't spray chemicals when the bees are around.

Bergman and other beekeepers are working to keep their bees healthy, by giving them medicine and protein.

Still, some say time is running short to solve this mystery of honeybee deaths.
