Players must travel through time and talk to animals to save the Wisconsin lake. In doing so, lessons are learned about lake ecosystems.

The game is only one example of a video game that is educational enough to be used in classrooms. The video games teach students things that they may not learn from a textbook. Teachers are exploring their potential. Everyone agrees they are a great new tool.

"Citizen Science" is one example of these video games. It is one of the many games made by Games + Learning + Society (GLS). The company makes many different types of video games that it hopes will change the way science is taught. The creators of these video games do not want to replace teachers. Their hope is that these games can be used by teachers in their lesson plans.

## The Idea Behind "Citizen Science"

Kurt Squire grew up playing and learning from video games. He now works at GLS. Squire tries to come up with games that make learning science fun. The game "Citizen Science" was his idea.

The game started because of the lakes in downtown Madison, Wisconsin. People are not allowed to swim in many of the lakes because of pollution. This really surprised Squire and inspired him to make "Citizen Science."

In the game, players look for reasons why Lake Mendota is so polluted. They must travel through time to figure it out. The point of the game is to clean up the lake. Players also learn how pollution from the past still hurts our planet today. These lessons can be hard to teach in classrooms. Video games sometimes work better when teaching these types of lessons.

## Teachers Warming Up To Video Games

A few years ago, teachers were not sure about video games. They did not think they could use video games in a classroom. This viewpoint is changing. Teachers are now starting to like the idea and are using video games in their classrooms.

Mike Lawton is a high school science teacher. He told GLS what he thought about "Citizen Science." He feels that the games are very smart.

"They're going through the scientific method in a game," he said.
