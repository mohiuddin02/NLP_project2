PHILADELPHIA, Pa. — "Hope" was a skinny German shepherd dog rescued this summer. Her ribs stuck out, and her fur was patchy. She didn't look great, but she had spirit. Carol Skaziak believed she might make an outstanding police dog.

Police dogs, also called K-9 dogs, have an excellent sense of smell. They can sniff out bombs and other dangerous things. They also use their sense of smell and hearing to catch a person who is hiding from police. Sometimes a person who the police think has broken a law tries to run away. A police officer will send a dog to catch the suspect. 

Skaziak started the Throw Away Dogs Project. It is a group that rescues shelter dogs and gives them to the police. Jason Walters is a police officer who works with K-9 dogs. He helped Skaziak start the group. 

It feels great to save a dog's life and give them a job, Skaziak said. 

## Spirited Dog Gets A Fighter's Name

Police departments across the country use working dogs. The dogs cost $6,000 to $30,000. Many police departments cannot afford to buy them.

Throw Away Dogs wants to help. They rescue dogs from shelters. They give the dogs a safe, warm place to live and plenty of food. They train the dogs to do special things. Then they give the dogs to police departments and other groups.

Skaziak first met Hope at a rescue. Hope fetched balls and sniffed out hidden objects. She bravely walked by a large cage filled with mean barking dogs. 

Skaziak brought Hope home. She gave her a new name, Rousey. The dog is named after Ronda Rousey, a popular martial arts fighter.

## Rousey Passes A Crucial Test

Rousey trained for nine weeks. Then came an important test.

Trainer Steve Primavera took Rousey to an empty field. He wore a padded bite sleeve. He swatted the sleeve with a stick.

Rousey reared up on her hind legs. She barked loudly. Then, she bit the padded sleeve and refused to let go.

Primavera smiled. It was just what he wanted to see.

Then he raised the stick and pretended to hit Rousey. 

Rousey would not back down.

Skaziak was excited. Rousey was very brave. She could catch bad guys. She could bite them and hold them until her owner showed up.

## Ready To Beat The Bad Guys

Rousey was tested several more times. She was tied to a tree. A stranger wearing a gray hoodie jumped out and tried to scare her. He raised his arm. He pretended to hit her.

Sergeant Brian King is head of the department's K-9 unit. He told Skaziak that was a "courage test" to see how Rousey would act. 

Rousey stared at the stranger. Her ears perked, then she started barking.

A few moments later, the stranger took off his hoodie. He was police detective Steven Spaid, a K-9 trainer.

Rousey was not scared at all, Spaid said.

Spaid then tested Rousey on a bite sleeve. Rousey barked excitedly and bit hard.

The testing was done.

"She'll work," Spaid said. 

It was time for Skaziak and Walters to say goodbye to Rousey.

Skaziak would miss Rousey. She started to cry.

"Please take care of her," she said.
