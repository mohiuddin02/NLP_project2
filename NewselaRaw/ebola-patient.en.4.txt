DALLAS, Texas â€” A man in Texas has a deadly disease called Ebola. He is the first person outside of Africa to come down with the disease, health officials said.

The man was in Liberia, a country in Africa. He flew to the United States on Sept. 20 to visit family. When he left Africa, he looked healthy. Four days after he arrived, he began to feel sick and went to the hospital. The hospital gave him some medicine and sent him home.

Now, the man is very sick. Since Sunday, he has been in a special unit at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, said Dr. Edward Goodman. The unit keeps him away from people to prevent Ebola from spreading.

Dr. Tom Frieden is the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He said has "no doubt" that Ebola won't spread widely in the United States.

"We will stop it here," he said.

## "Disease Detectives" Go To Texas

Ebola is very difficult to get. An Ebola patient can only spread the disease after he or she begins feeling really sick. Freiden said the man had been near very few people while he was beginning to feel sick.

A special team of government "disease detectives" and other experts have been sent to Texas. They will look for everyone the man came near. Once the people are found, they will be checked for 21 days. That is how long people take to show signs of Ebola if they have it.

If the people have a fever, they will be tested for Ebola.

Some people fear for the airplane passengers. However, Frieden said none of the airplane passengers could get Ebola. The man did not feel sick while on the plane. Ebola only can spread if the person with it is very sick.

Dr. David Lakey is the head of the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said the man is probably the only person with Ebola in Texas.

## No Cure For Ebola Yet

Liberia and two other African countries are fighting the worst Ebola outbreak in history. Thousands have died from the disease and thousands more have gotten sick. Out of every 10 people who get Ebola, five to eight of them will die from it. There is no cure yet.

Health experts say Ebola spread so quickly that African countries did not recognize the danger. They did not have  medical supplies and health centers. Also, the rest of the world was also slow to care for the sick.

Health experts say the situation in the United States is very different. Good health care here makes a large outbreak unlikely, said Dr. Anne Rimoin. She is a doctor at UCLA.

The U.S. can find people who come into contact with a sick person. It can care for them immediately if they get sick, she said. If other countries did that, "there wouldn't be this huge outbreak in the first place."

Ebola outbreaks in two African countries are now under control. The CDC gave credit to doctors and nurses there.

People in the Dallas area are also worried that Ebola is here.

Stanley Gaye is the president of a Liberian community group in Texas. He said Liberians are scared to be near people who were recently in Africa. "This disease is a horrible disease," Gaye said.
