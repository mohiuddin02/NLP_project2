WASHINGTON — On July 3, 1863, Alonzo Cushing died holding off a Confederate attack during the Civil War. Like so many others, his actions helped the North win the war and end slavery.

On Thursday, President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor to Cushing's family. The medal is America's highest medal for bravery. The award came 151 years after Cushing's death.

"This medal is a reminder that no matter how long it takes, it is never too late to do the right thing," Obama said.

Cushing fought for the North. He was just 22 when he died during the historic Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. Cushing was shot twice, but refused to leave his cannon. It was the last gun left in his unit which was helping to hold off an attack by soldiers of the Confederate South.

## Never Gave Up

Cushing was awarded the medal because of Margaret Zerwekh. She is an amateur historian. Zerwekh studied the Cushing family after moving to the Cushing family home in Delafield, Wisconsin, in the 1960s. As she read of Cushing's heroism, she felt he deserved the Medal of Honor.

Through more than 30 years Zerwekh never gave up. Zerwekh, now 94, was at the White House to witness the ceremony she spent so much time and effort to make happen.

"This is the classic example of how two individuals can make a difference — Alonzo Cushing and Margaret Zerwekh," said Congressman Ron Kind of Wisconsin. He attended the ceremony. Kind is the descendant of two brothers who fought during the Civil War.

Receiving the Medal of Honor was Helen Loring Ensign, age 85, of Palm Springs, California. She is distant cousin of Cushing.

## Died Next To His Cannon

Ensign has visited Gettysburg many times and stood at the spot where Cushing died next to his gun. The spot is now marked with a stone monument.

"I remember being very, very proud to see a stone in his name. Gettysburg was a part of our family history," Ensign said.

Cushing, from Wisconsin, was encouraged by his mother to attend West Point, a school for military officers. There was no other way he could afford a college education. He graduated in 1861.

Kent Masterson Brown read Cushing's letters and journals. He wrote a book about Cushing's life. Brown learned that Cushing was a patriot who acted as a father figure to his younger brothers.

On July 3, 1863, Cushing commanded an artillery unit stationed on Cemetery Ridge on the Gettysburg battlefield. Confederate guns fired at Union troops on Cemetery Ridge. Cushing's unit was practically wiped out. Many soldiers were killed. The cannons of his unit were destroyed except for one.

## "I'll Fight It Out"

During the Confederate attack, named Pickett's Charge, Cushing was hit twice. He continued to whisper commands to his soldiers.

Although Cushing was urged to get medical aid, he refused to leave the battlefield.

"He said 'No, I'll fight it out or die in the attempt,'" said Brown.

Paul C. Jussel is a military studies professor at the U.S. Army War College. He said the battle was the last great fight Confederate General Robert E. Lee made for the South. "Ultimately, it doesn't work and Cushing had a lot to do with that."

Cushing was among the 8,000 soldiers killed during the three-day battle. More than 26,000 were wounded.

Cushing was buried at West Point. He was laid to rest underneath a tombstone carved with the words "Faithful until death."
