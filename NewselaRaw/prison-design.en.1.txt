SAN BRUNO, Calif. — The workshop leaders came loaded with markers in colors other than red and blue, which are gang colors, drafting rulers crafted from museum boards, and kiddie scissors.

All the students wore orange. And on this final day, their paper models were taking shape.

Architect Deanna VanBuren adjusted a piece of tracing paper over Anthony Pratt's design, showing him how to mark the entire area of the drawing to show walls and windows. She then urged him to use dots to indicate open spaces.

A tall, broad-chested man with tattoos on both arms, Pratt was among those sketching out new building plans. His vision included an airy room with a skylight to provide lots of sunlight, and a fountain with a cascading waterfall. It had privacy barriers for the shower and toilet. It also included a healing center with many windows and a talking circle.

The spaces they were planning could be at a New Age retreat. But these building plans were made by inmates at San Francisco's County Jail No. 5.

## "A New Way Of Thinking"

Most men in there are awaiting trial on charges of violent crimes. All of them must agree to join in "Resolve to Stop the Violence," a program based on the concepts of restorative justice.

The program includes classes and discussions about a new way of thinking about justice. "Resolve to Stop the Violence" tries to heal crime victims and offenders alike.

The 18 men who enrolled in the four-day workshop this summer were contemplating restorative justice through design.

As Pratt concentrated on his drawing, Keith Wilkins cut the waterfall for the 3-D model. Both are facing murder charges. Another participant, Lamar Paschall, helped with the trees. He has been charged with kidnapping, rape and robbery.

Some of their models were not very realistic. They included individual cells with Internet connections, and even outdoor decks.

Some prisons like that exist in Norway. But they are not likely to become part of U.S. prison design any time soon.

Other ideas, such as centers where agreement on punishment is reached without entering a courtroom, are already becoming a reality.

"I feel an extra sense of purpose today," Paschall told his fellow classmates during the workshop. "Hopefully this can become fruitful and turn into something real down the line."

## Not Everyone Is Supportive

As more people now believe that traditional criminal justice models are failing to prevent offenders from committing crimes, VanBuren and fellow instructor Barb Toews, an academic, have joined a small chorus of designers, researchers and even judges and wardens calling for new spaces to match the beliefs of "restorative justice."

Restorative justice ideas were first promoted in the 1970s by global practitioner and theorist Howard Zehr, now a professor at Eastern Mennonite University's Center for Justice and Peacebuilding. The goal was to make the needs of victims central, and by doing so have an effect on broader healing for all.

Critics of restorative justice say the process is subjective and could lead to proposed remedies that are wildly different. As a result, some victim organizations and strict prosecutors reject it.

But the practice has spread throughout the United States as well as globally. Evidence is growing that it helps reduce school expulsions, keeps youths out of prisons and prevents youths and adults who have already been sentenced from re-offending.

## Step Number 1: Reaching Out

VanBuren, an Oakland-based architect, was working for a big firm when she heard of a grieving father on a podcast who has turned into a restorative justice supporter. VanBuren was deeply moved.

After his son was murdered by a teenage gang member, Azim Khamisa reached out to the boy's grandfather, as well as the assailant, so they could all heal. The two men launched the San Diego-based Tariq Khamisa Foundation to address the roots of youth violence.

Soon after, she heard the founder of Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth speak at a West Oakland school, where the number of African-American students being suspended and expelled had dropped sharply.

They teamed up and VanBuren designed her first stand-alone restorative justice room — in a portable trailer at an Oakland school. She had found her calling.

## Looking At It Differently

Toews, meanwhile, got her start as a restorative justice practitioner in the 1990s while doing her voluntary service and was hooked. In 2000, she conducted a workshop in a Pennsylvania prison with 13 inmates serving life sentences, most of whom had committed murder.

The men were reluctant to share their feelings. So she told them: The traditional system is like a boxing ring, with a winner and loser and outsiders determining the outcome.

"What would a room look like," she then asked, "where you could face anything you've done and be accountable for it?"

Together, they created a vision and called it the "Do No Harm" room. A picture window with a mountain view. A door that locks from the inside. Plants and rugs.

Later, Toews wondered, "If we treated it as a potential for something literal, if the environment were different, how might that change how we do justice?"

She was exploring the question as a graduate student a few years ago when VanBuren tracked her down. "I could not believe that someone had similar interests to me," Toews said. "It was the craziest, luckiest thing."

## Lofty Dream Models

On the final workshop day, the inmates scrambled to piece together their models with glue sticks and tape.

Deandre Hill, convicted of a felony for being in possession of a firearm, and Christopher Gillis, facing murder and commercial burglary charges, sat side by side. They envisioned a cell with a computer that allowed for communication with family. Natural light, as in all the models, was key.

"The most important thing is to be accountable, but in order to work on yourself you have to be comfortable," said Gillis, who is planning a restorative justice circle to "make up for the harm" he had inflicted on his 16-year-old son through his absence and violent tendencies.

Then it was time to present their models to the larger pod and a panel of outside reviewers.

As his teammates stood beside him, Dante Hayes, facing charges of burglary and burglary to commit rape, showed a design with a tree in the atrium representing growth and "the ability for us to grow." A kitchen would feed all visitors.

## New Prison Designs Encouraged

In a closing circle after the presentation, Pratt, who recently participated in a restorative justice-style circle with his girlfriend, said his whole outlook had changed: "Instead of being barbarians and just beating each other upside the head, we can be like family."

VanBuren said she is encouraging big architecture firms that design prisons to hold similar workshops with inmates and guards.

"The goal is to empower those inside the institutions and prod architects to actually talk to the people they are designing for," she said. "That's how an architect would practice in any other setting."
