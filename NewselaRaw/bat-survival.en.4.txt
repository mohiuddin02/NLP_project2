HACKENSACK, N.J. â€” Little brown bats in New Jersey have been dying from an illness. It is called "white nose." The illness gets its name because a white powder grows on bats' noses, ears and wings.

White nose is caused by a fungus. It grows in bat caves.

The bats become infected while sleeping for the winter. Bats sleep all winter long and wake up in the spring. It is known as hibernation. They do not eat the whole time. They eat as much as they can before they hibernate. It helps them store fat for the winter.

White nose causes the bats to move around during hibernation. Moving around makes them lose weight. Because they don't eat in hibernation, many little brown bats die of hunger before spring arrives.

They are dying very fast.

## One Baby Bat A Year Is Not Enough

Nine out of every 10 little brown bats have died since 2008. Back then, about 30,000 in New Jersey hibernated each year. Now there are only a few hundred. Scientists say there are so few left, that all little brown bats might die out.

Little brown bat mothers only give birth to one baby a year. It is not enough. They are dying faster than they are being born.

Not all bats are dying. Big brown bats are another type, or species, of bat. Their numbers are actually going up.

Big brown bats get white nose too, but it does not kill them.

Their bodies are bigger and hold more food for the winter. They still move around but do not go hungry. They also hibernate for less time than little brown bats. While hibernating, they sleep far apart, so the disease does not spread from bat to bat easily. And big brown bat mothers have two babies a year.

## Bats Help Humans In Many Ways

But other types of bats are dying. Scientists say white nose is killing bats across the country. It is now found in 25 states. Millions have died.

It is not just a problem for bats. People need bats. They eat insects that eat vegetables and fruit that people grow. If there aren't enough bats to eat bugs, then farmers might grow less food. Bats also eat mosquitoes, which carry diseases that can make people sick.

Scientists across the country are trying to find a way to save little brown bats. Some are looking at bacteria. They are the simplest of creatures that are considered alive. Bacteria are everywhere, even inside of you. Some bacteria causes disease, but some is good for us. They help humans digest food in our guts. Bacteria could fight the fungus that's hurting the bats.

## Looking For A Cure

Other scientists are studying another fungus. It might be stronger than the white nose fungus. It also would not kill any bats.

Jeremy Coleman works for the government. He is in charge of trying to stop white nose. He says no scientists have given the treatments to bats yet. Spraying caves with the treatments could help the bats. Yet other animals in the caves might get hurt.

Coleman says even if the treatments work there will be fewer bats for a long time. It could take hundreds of years for the numbers of little brown bats to come back as before.
