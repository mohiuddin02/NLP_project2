GENEVA, N.Y. — The trees at Cornell University's research orchard this fall are heavy with all kinds of apples: waxy apples, deep-red apples, round apples, oblong apples and aromatic apples that smell like autumn.

The thousands of trees here are tended with one goal in mind: to grow apples with just the right mix of sweetness, tartness and crunch.

The orchards, part of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, are essentially a 50-acre lab devoted to developing apples that are tasty for consumers and hardy for farmers. The station has released 66 apple varieties over more than a century, including Cortland, Macoun and two new entries at farm markets this fall: SnapDragon and RubyFrost.

"I could never be a medical doctor; I don't like blood. But I can create," breeder Susan Brown said. "I can manipulate things and create stuff that no one else has seen or tasted, and sometimes it's a home run and sometimes it's a spitter."

## Sniffing Around The Apple Trees

Brown is a Cornell professor of agriculture who has been breeding apples since 1990. On a sunny day this week, she walked through the apple-dappled rows offering test chomps. One apple was juicy but mushy, another exceptionally firm and crisp.

"You would not want to eat this with dentures," she said with a laugh.

Brown's team is looking for crisp apples with a good balance of sugar and acid. They also pay close attention to the fragrances, like a hint of cherry or grassiness, that contribute so much to an apple's flavor. But researchers also want farmer-friendly apples that hold up well against insects, fire blight and apple scab, and during shipping.

One promising variety was rejected because its leaves were prone to spotting and falling off the tree. A green apple that might have been able to compete with the Granny Smith was discarded because it tended to develop blister spots.

"It's only skin deep," Brown said of the blistered apple, "but consumers are still going to find it objectionable."

## Most Seedlings Don't Make The Cut

The researchers here have access to cutting-edge technology, but the mechanics of their breeding work is similar to what others before them have done for generations. Pollen is collected from unopened blossoms and then applied to female parts of another tree's flower. It can take four years before a seedling produces fruit ready for tasting.

Researchers try to combine desirable traits from two different apples — like the snappy sweetness of one and the resistance to insects of another. But just like a mom and dad can have children who aren't much like either of them, new apples can turn out quite differently than expected.

Research assistant Kevin Maloney says about 95 percent of the seedlings they plant are discarded. The neat rows of trellised trees have gaps where apples that didn't make the cut had grown.

"It's a numbers game. We plant out thousands and thousands of seedling trees," Maloney said. "If they're not exceptional quality or something we can use in the breeding program, they're removed."

Brown has high hopes for their two new apples, developed in partnership with the members of New York Apple Growers, which will initially be sold at dozens of farm markets in New York this fall.

## SnapDragon And RubyFrost

SnapDragon crosses a Honeycrisp with a Jonagold-like apple that's easier for farmers to manage. RubyFrost, which ripens later in the fall, has high vitamin C content and resists browning, which is important now that apple slices are such a large part of the retail market.

As picking season for SnapDragon dawns, Brown is already thinking of the next-generation apple. She believes she can breed an apple that is resistant to browning. And she thinks she can increase an apple's vitamin C content to the level of an orange.

"I've already made the next generation, crossing SnapDragon and RubyFrost," she said.
