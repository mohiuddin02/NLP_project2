Vladimir Putin wrote to the American people in the New York Times on Thursday. He had some tough things to say about President Barack Obama's speech about Syria. He also basically called the United States an international bully.

The article was published in the newspaper's opinion section. The Russian president mentioned God, the pope and the rule of law. He also recalled a time when the United States and Russia were allies. That was when they defeated Nazi Germany in World War II.

But Putin blasted American exceptionalism. That is the idea that there is something different and special about America. He also said he studied what Obama said Tuesday night about Syria. He disagrees with the president.

But Putin also said trust is growing between him and Obama. He welcomed Obama's willingness to work with Russia. The two countries are working on a plan to place Syria's supply of poison gas under international control.

## Trying To Influence U.S. Public Opinion

"If we can avoid force against Syria," it will strengthen the trust between Russia and the United States, he wrote. "It will be our shared success and open the door to cooperation on other critical issues."

It is unusual for a foreign leader to write in an American newspaper to influence U.S. public opinion. But it is not unheard of. Putin said that the anger over Syrian chemical weapons "prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders."

He added, "It is important to do so" because the two countries were not talking with each other enough.

Putin warned the United States against attacking Syria on its own. Obama has threatened to do so in response to the Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons in its civil war. Few countries support an attack. Such a military strike would make the United Nations seem less important, Putin wrote. It would also be against international law, he said.

"The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not," he wrote. Human rights campaigners in Russia will take a close look at those words. They have accused Putin's government of bending the law to its own purposes.

## Criticizes Idea Of American Exceptionalism

Putin said it "has become commonplace for the United States" to get involved in other countries and their fights. He did not see this as a good thing, saying "millions around the world increasingly see America not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force."

The Russian president ended with a critical discussion of Obama's speech. The American president laid out the reasons for attacking Syria. He also said he wanted to explore Russia's idea for a peaceful end to the crisis.

He explained why the United States was uniquely equipped to act. The American president talked about its history of leadership in international crises.

"That's what makes America different," Obama said. "That's what makes us exceptional."

Putin wrote: "I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism. ... It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation." He concluded that "... we must not forget that God created us equal."
