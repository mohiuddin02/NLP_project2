Klaus-Jurgen Warnick is one of those people. In November 1989, he was here in Kleinmachnow, outside Berlin, as East German guards decided that letting people go to the West was a better idea than opening fire on them.

Since 1961, the Berlin Wall had split Berlin — and Germany — in half. On the West side were the Americans, British and French. On the East side was the Soviet Union (now Russia). Life was very different on the different sides of the wall.

West Berlin, at first run by the Americans, was capitalist, focusing on free trade and free speech. East Berlin was communist, run by the Soviets, who wanted to build a completely equal society where the government owned everything and controlled most things.

## Ossies, Former East Germans

East Germans had little freedom during this time: they couldn't travel freely, criticize their government, or buy many goods.

Still, Warnick says that East Germans like him who crowded around the Berlin Wall in 1989 weren't trying to change the world. They just had dreams that life could be a little better.

In many ways, life is better today for Ossies, the name given to former residents of East Germany. They have free speech and elections. They can travel and they are free from government spying.

Still, Germany remains divided in many ways: Ossies are paid less, have a harder time finding jobs, have less money saved, and receive less money from the government when they retire than West Germans.

East and West Germany are still seen as unequal, even though the country is united again. East Germans make less than west Germans. Employees at one shopping mall in East Berlin make $1,400 less each year than workers at a mall across the street in West Berlin.

In Kleinmachnow, the problems of splitting, then reunifying a country, are on display, even 25 years later. In this town it's the Ossies who have often suffered from the changes.

## "I Planted Trees"

The problem in Kleinmachnow comes down to owning a home.

In East Germany under communism, personal property was not important because the government owned everything. In West Germany, under capitalism, owning things — and buying and selling them — was a foundation of society.

During the 1950s, as communism took over East Germany, many people left for the West, abandoning their houses. The East German government took the houses and gave them to people, trying to find places for everyone to live.

Warnick received a piece of land in 1969 and began to build a house on it. He met the love of his life, and they had four children.

"I planted trees, so that my grandchildren's grandchildren would know their grandfather's grandfather had put down these roots," he said.

When the Berlin Wall fell 20 years later, Germany began to reunite. West Germans could now return to the East.

## His Dream For The Future

In 1990, Warnick began to have trouble. The former owner of the house returned from West Germany. The man was nice at first. He said Warnick didn't have to leave right away, he could have six months to find a new place.

Eventually, Warnick won the right to stay in the house he built. He had to pay $180,000 to the former owner and to lawyers. Still, it was worth it to him to keep his house and the trees he'd planted — his dream for the future.

Warnick is not alone. In Kleinmachnow, almost every property was in a similar situation. Eight thousand of Kleinmachnow's 11,000 residents were forced to leave their homes after Germany was reunited. Nationwide, about 4 million of East Germany's 17 million people were forced to move.

Looking back, Warnick says they lived in a nation with no idea about land ownership.

"Who believes that their nation, their way of life, will collapse?" he asked.
