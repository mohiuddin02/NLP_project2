MUMBAI, India â€” A crowd of patients gathered in a hallway at Mumbai's Hinduja Hospital. They were waiting to see Dr. Zarir Udwadia, an expert on lung diseases.

Nineteen-year-old Nisha was one of the patients. Like many of the others, she has the disease tuberculosis (TB).

Tuberculosis usually attacks the lungs. It can be passed from person to person through coughing. Someone with TB usually has fever, night sweats and a bad cough.

## When Doctors Make Mistakes

Nisha had already been treated elsewhere for more than a year. Then she learned that her doctors had made the disease worse rather than curing it.

Doctors treat tuberculosis with drugs known as antibiotics. Nisha's doctors had not used the medicine they gave her in the best way.

"My doctors kept on changing the drugs," Nisha says.

People become sick with TB when certain bacteria enter their bodies. These bacteria are alive and can produce more bacteria. The medicines that fight TB are supposed to kill the bacteria.

Antibiotics do not always wipe out all the TB bacteria in a person's body. Sometimes this happens when doctors stop using a drug too soon. Other times a particular drug may not be strong enough.

## Bacteria Versus Antibiotics

The bacteria that manage to survive become stronger. Next time the same antibiotic is used, they have an easier time fighting it off. The ability to fight off an antibiotic is known as resistance. The bacteria that live pass on their resistance to the new bacteria they produce. In a way, those new bacteria are like their children.

By quickly switching drugs, Nisha's original doctors made the TB in her body grow stronger. The bacteria became more resistant to several different drugs.

The problem is not limited only to Nisha. Drug-resistant TB can spread from person to person. As it spreads, more TB bacteria become drug resistant and the disease becomes harder to cure.

## A Doctor Sees Danger

Udwadia was the first doctor to notice that drug-resistant TB is spreading quickly in India. He has had four patients who were resistant to all 12 drugs he uses to treat TB. Udwadia is very worried that more and more people will start to die of drug-resistant TB. No drug will be able to help them.

More than 2 million Indians get TB every year. Around 62,000 of them have a kind of TB that is resistant to at least four types of drugs. As many as 15,000 have an even more dangerous type of TB that can fight off almost every known drug.

If a patient's TB is already somewhat resistant to a drug, then using that drug can make it even more resistant. For that reason, it is very useful for doctors to know what drugs a patient's TB is already resistant to. Knowing that lets them pick a drug that the TB has no resistance to. Such a drug would kill off all the bacteria.

## Some Machines Can Help

There are machines that can tell doctors if a patient's TB is resistant. The problem is such machines are very expensive. India is still a poor country, so it has only a few of them. In any case, those machines can tell doctors about TB resistance to only one particular drug. If doctors avoid that drug, they may still end up using a drug that the TB can resist.

Unfortunately, this means drug-resistant TB has been able to spread quickly around India.

Soon it may spread elsewhere as well. After all, millions of Indians travel to the United States and other countries every year.

Doctors in the United States say they would be able to deal with the problem because they have the equipment they need. Poorer countries would not be as lucky.

## Reasons For Hope

In India, there are signs of hope. Udwadia says some new drugs seem promising.

Even patients with the worst type of TB have a chance of beating the disease, Udwadia said.
