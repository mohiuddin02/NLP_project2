BAGHDAD — Earlier this month, members of the Islamic State group invaded Mosul's Central Library. Their goal was simple: to destroy other people's ideas.

Residents say the men smashed the locks that had protected the biggest library in the northern Iraq city. They then loaded about 2,000 books — including children's stories, poetry and works on sports, health, culture and science — into six pickup trucks. Only Islamic texts were left behind.

The books they took are scheduled for destruction.

"These books promote" the rejection of religion "and call for disobeying Allah. So they will be burned," a bearded Islamic State official declared, according to a witness. The books were stuffed into empty flour bags and hauled off.

## Nowhere To Hide

The Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has been fighting government forces in both Iraq and neighboring Syria. So far, it has managed to take over one-third of Iraq and about as much of Syria. Since assuming control, it has sought to rid society of everything that does not fit its violent interpretation of Islam. The group already has destroyed many pre-Islamic archaeological artifacts, along with Islamic religious sites it does not approve of. Increasingly, books are on the firing line.

Mosul is the biggest of the cities the Islamic State group now controls. The city has an educated population. Many here have sought to preserve its historical sites and libraries. When forces led by the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, creating widespread chaos, residents near the Central Library became concerned about looting. Many people hid some of the library's centuries-old manuscripts in their own homes to prevent theft or destruction.

However, the Islamic State group has made such actions punishable by death, so there may not be much residents can do this time. The Central Library's collection of Iraqi newspapers dating to the early 20th century are presumed to have been destroyed. So too are maps and books dating from the Ottoman Empire. Book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul's most prominent families are probably lost as well.

## Erasing History

Days after the Central Library's ransacking, Islamic State members broke into the University of Mosul's library. They lit a bonfire using hundreds of books on science and culture, destroying them in front of students.

A University of Mosul history professor said the extremists started wrecking the collections of other libraries last month. He reported particularly heavy damage to three libraries: a Sunni Muslim library, the library of the 265-year-old Latin Church of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. The museum library contained works dating back to 5000 BC.

The professor said that the Islamic State group appears determined to "change the face of this city." It has set out to erase the city's history and to destroy many of its best-known buildings, he said.

Since seizing Mosul last summer, the Islamic State group has destroyed dozens of historic sites. Among them are several ancient Islamic mosque shrines. All are linked to forms of Islam that the Islamic State group is hostile toward.

## What Is The Real Enemy?

Hakim al-Zamili is an Iraqi lawmaker. The Islamic State group, he said, "considers culture, civilization and science as their fierce enemies."

Al-Zamili compared the Islamic State group to the raiding Mongols who in 1258 ransacked Baghdad. Back then, ancient collections of works on history, medicine and astronomy were dumped into the Tigris River by the Mongols. Reportedly, the waters turned black from running ink.

"The only difference is that the Mongols threw the books in the Tigris River, while now" the Islamic State group "is burning them," he said. "Different method, but same mentality."
