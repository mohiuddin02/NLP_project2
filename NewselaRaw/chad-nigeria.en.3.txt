WASHINGTON â€” U.S. troops have been sent to Africa to help search for the kidnapped [Nigerian schoolgirls](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian+schoolgirls).

President Barack Obama informed Congress on Wednesday that the 80 soldiers will stay there until their help is no longer needed. The soldiers will provide support for information-gathering aircraft flying over northern Nigeria looking for the girls. They will also examine the information they gather.

The decision marks a big increase in the U.S. involvement in the search for the girls. The schoolgirls were kidnapped from their school April 14. They were taken by Nigeria's most feared and powerful extremist group, Boko Haram. The group's leader has threatened to sell them into slavery. More than 270 of the girls remain missing.

Two weeks ago, the U.S. sent about two dozen experts to help with the hunt. The experts included intelligence and law enforcement officers. Fewer than 10 were from the military.

Under U.S. law, the president must tell Congress when American soldiers are sent to a foreign country.

## Drone Searching From Air

U.S. military officials say the soldiers will operate an unarmed Predator [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone). The drone is equipped with a camera. The Predator has been searching for the girls from the air.

U.S. officials think Boko Haram divided the girls into smaller groups. They are believed to be hidden in the deep forests of northeastern Nigeria. The area is about the size of West Virginia.

Navy Admiral John Kirby is the spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense. The Defense Department is in charge of the U.S. military. Kirby compared the hunt for the girls to searching for "a needle in the jungle." So far, the search hasn't turned up much information.

"We've not seen anything that indicates their location at this point," Kirby said. The U.S. is sharing information with the Nigerian government. But so far, it hasn't discovered much.

For the last five years, Boko Haram has increased its grip on Nigeria. The terror group has been especially active in the north where kidnappings and attacks have become common. On Wednesday, Boko Haram members attacked three villages with car bombs. At least 40 people were killed near the site where the girls were taken. A day earlier, Boko Haram supporters carried out another bombing in the central city of Jos.

U.S. officials are in a difficult position working with Nigeria. The African country's army has been accused of human rights abuses. Also, some members of Boko Haram are part of the army. By law, the U.S. government can't give help to people who carry out human rights violations.

Alice Friend is in charge of African affairs for the Defense Department. She said the U.S. is being "very, very careful" to give information only to Nigerians who won't use it to hurt people.

## "Western Education Is Forbidden"

Since 2010, Boko Haram is believed to have killed at least 300 students. Boko Haram can be translated as "Western education is forbidden." It said it kidnapped the girls because they should be married rather than go to school.

The girls' kidnapping sparked international outrage and a Twitter hashtag campaign, #bringbackourgirls. Among those participating in the campaign was first lady Michelle Obama. But in the last week, the campaign has lost some of its popularity.

The troops will be stationed in the neighboring country of Chad. They will not be in Nigeria. But their presence is still likely to stir up anger in NIgeria. Some Nigerians are suspicious about why the U.S. military is getting involved in Africa.

U.S. officials have said the Nigerians must be the ones to rescue the girls. The U.S. will just help with trying to spot the girls.

"We're not talking about U.S. military operations in Nigeria to go find these girls," Kirby said. "That's not the focus here."

The last time the United States sent troops to Africa was in 2011. The Obama administration sent a small group of soldiers to central Africa to help hunt down Joseph Kony. He was the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, a terror group that operated in Uganda.

The U.S. troops hunting for Kony are still looking for him. Kony remains on the run.
