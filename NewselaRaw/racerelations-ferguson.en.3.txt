ST. LOUIS — Leaders told people at Michael Brown's funeral to remember his life by seeking change.

More than 2,500 people came from all over the country to attend Brown's funeral. The unarmed black teen was killed by a white police officer on Aug. 9.

The Reverend Al Sharpton is a religious and civil rights leader. He told the crowd that Brown's death must mark the beginning of change. They must join together to change not just the justice system, he said. They also must change the African-American community.

"Nobody is going to help us if we don't help ourselves," said Sharpton.

The funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church Monday was emotional and uplifting. There were Hollywood celebrities, including director Spike Lee, actor Wesley Snipes and rapper MC Hammer. There were also the relatives of other young people who were killed.

## Perhaps A Turning Point

Many people at the funeral never met the 18-year-old teen. They came because they felt that the funeral was a historic moment. They wanted to take part in a day that many believed would become a turning point in the history of blacks and whites in America.

During the funeral, Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood as if in shock, staring at her son's casket. She shook her head back and forth. A tear rolled down her cheek. Brown's cousin, Bernard Ewing, choked back tears as he spoke.

"I love you Mike. That's all I've got to say," Ewing said. He stood on a stage behind Brown's casket. The casket was piled with red roses and a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap.

Sharpton told listeners to join together to create a new movement for change.

"We can't have a fit. We've got to have a movement," he said. Sharpton had strong words for protesters who stole from stores. For nearly two weeks after Brown's death, protesters — both peaceful and violent — took to the streets of Ferguson in anger over Brown's death. They felt that if Brown was white he wouldn't have been killed.

"A fit — you get mad and run out for a couple of nights," Sharpton said. "A movement means we've got to be here for the long haul and turn our chance into change, our demonstration into legislation."

## People Told To Vote

Other speakers talked especially about the need for black people to vote. At the heart of anger in Ferguson is the amount of power held by whites.  About 14,000 of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are black, but the City Council and Police Department are almost all white. In the last election, only about one out of eight people who live in Ferguson came out to vote.

DeeNa Adair came to the funeral with her husband and 10-month-old grandson. The 41-year-old said she took part in the protests in Ferguson.

"If we don't stand up now, what is his future?" said Adair of her grandson. She said her 20-year-old son had been shot and killed in St. Louis.

"Hopefully ... this is what sparks the nation to change, to deal with the racial divide" between black and white, Adair said.

"A lot of people feel they could be next," said Chris Gray, 29. He came to the funeral from Minnesota. "There's a historic possibility here for young people to take ownership of a new civil rights movement."

In the church, a choir sang and women pounded tambourines and shook maracas. Men, women and children wore their best suits and dresses. They swayed, danced and held their hands toward the sky.

## How Blacks And Whites See Police

There were only a handful of white faces in the crowd. A survey found that whites are far more likely than blacks to feel that police will treat people of both races equally. The survey was done after Brown's death.

Police "think because they wear a badge, they hold life in their hands," said Demond Wright. The 23-year-old is a dishwasher from Ferguson.

Nate Parker is a 34-year-old actor and producer from California. Parker said his 17-year-old nephew had asked him what he should do if stopped by police. He said he decided to go to the funeral after he realized he did not know the answer.

"The real question is how many days will pass before another unarmed black man is killed?" Parker said.

No charges have been filed in Brown's death. Officials say the officer, Darren Wilson, fired in self-defense after Brown attacked him. Some witnesses say Wilson shot Brown after ordering him to stop walking down the middle of his street.

Eighteen-year-old Eric Harris, who lives in St. Louis, identified with the dead teen. "But you don't have to be acting up to be targeted" by police, Harris said. "You can just be walking home from the store and bang, you're a target."
