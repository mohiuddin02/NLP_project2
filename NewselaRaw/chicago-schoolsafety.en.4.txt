CHICAGO â€” Guards protected Chicago children returning to school Tuesday.

More than 1,300 guards lined the routes that children walk to get to school. The schools are in dangerous city neighborhoods. The guards are called "Safe Passage" workers. The purpose of the program is to make sure children get to school safely.

The Safe Passage program began last year. It started with 1,200 guards. This year, thanks to $1 million from the city, another 100 Safe Passage guards are on the streets. Over the next several weeks, 600 more guards will be hired. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn promised $10 million to pay for the extra protection.

## More Schools Have Safe Routes

Jadine Chou is the chief safety officer for the Chicago Public Schools. Last year, 93 schools had Safe Passage guards. Another 27 schools have been added to the program to total 120 schools. The extra money will let them add more guards to existing routes. Some guards will be placed farther from schools. They will protect kids walking longer distances.

"It was good last year, but I don't think it stopped the violence none," said Tiffany Davis. She was walking her 7-year-old son to Dulles School of Excellence on the city's South Side. "Maybe it calmed things down a little."

## First Day Was Safe And Quiet

This year, the first day of school did not get much attention. Last year, it was a different story. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel had ordered nearly 50 schools to be closed. Many children had to go to different schools in bad neighborhoods. Parents and others were very upset. They worried that children could get hurt in gang fights while walking to their new schools.

Thankfully, the children stayed safe.

"It didn't happen, to the glory of God," said Bishop Larry Trotter. He is the minister of Sweet Holy Spirit Church. The church is on the city's South Side. Last year, Trotter and several other ministers had urged Emanuel to keep the schools open. In the end, very little, if anything, happened to children on their way to and from school, Trotter said.

"The mayor and his team did a wonderful job," Trotter said.

There were no big problems on Safe Passage routes, Chou said.

## Other Times Remain Dangerous

Over the summer, the city experienced bursts of violence. Many people were hurt.

Some people worry that the city is not doing enough to keep students safe. High school students may be at special risk. Many of them belong to clubs or sports teams. These groups meet before or after school. Students have to walk to and from school early in the morning or later in the afternoon. There may not be guards out then.

Last December, a 15-year-old girl left her home before dawn to get to school. She was attacked almost a half block from a Safe Passage route.

"She had to get to school earlier than the Safe Passage (workers) were on duty," said LaShawn Ford. He is an Illinois lawmaker. Guards are out there less than an hour before classes begin. They leave about an hour after school ends. Ford wants the guards to be on the streets for a longer time.

Emanuel may have another problem. The mayor is running for office again next year. Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis may run for mayor against Emanuel. Lewis does not think Emanuel should have closed the schools. She calls him the "murder mayor" because of the city's violence.

If a child on a Safe Passage route is hurt, Emanuel could lose the election, some say.
