WASHINGTON â€” On Wednesday the Obama administration called on the nation's schools to make an important change. It asked them to abandon harsh discipline policies that send students to court instead of the principal's office.

Attorney General Eric Holder said problems often stem from well-intentioned "zero-tolerance" policies. These can bring the criminal justice system into school matters.

Routine misbehavior "should land a student in the principal's office, not in a police" station, Holder said.

But it's about race, too, the government claimed.

African-American students are "disciplined more harshly and more frequently because of their race" than white students, the administration said. "In short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem."

## Greater Police Presence In Schools

The government encouraged schools to train all school employees in how to manage a classroom and solve conflicts. Employees, not the police, should take care of routine student disciplinary problems, the government said.

Zero-tolerance policies became popular in the 1990s. The policies have led to a greater police presence in schools. The rules often spell out uniform and swift punishment for offenses such as truancy, smoking or carrying a weapon. Violators can end up with a criminal record.

In Akron, Ohio, Superintendent David W. James said a recent study found higher percentages of black students being disciplined. He said he's been criticized for not suspending African-American kids in cases where he didn't think action was warranted.

"If we're supposed to be here for these kids, what we want to try to do is work with them to find alternatives," he said. Educators need "to really drill down and find out what it is we're doing that's not meeting their needs."

But Kansas City superintendent Jim Hinson sees things differently. He said his school system already does most of the things the Obama administration recommends. Hinson said the district doesn't have a zero-tolerance policy, except for students caught carrying weapons to schools.

"For carrying a weapon to school, yeah, you should probably be in serious trouble," Hinson said. "We have a zero-tolerance policy for weapons coming in."

Overall, he described the recommendations as "highly offensive."

Saying "that educators are discriminating against kids across the country and law enforcement officers are discriminating as well is inappropriate," Hinson said. "If there are problem areas that need to be addressed, you address those areas."

## "Numbers Don't Lie"

Nonetheless, in many parts of the country, there already has been a shift toward recognizing that school discipline polices can be discriminatory. Many teachers, principals, school superintendents and school board members agree that race-based differences do exist.

"Numbers don't lie. They are there," said former high school principal Beverly Hutton.

A recent government study offers support for her position. It showed that black students were more than three times as likely as whites to be expelled or suspended. Black students made up 15 percent of the students studied. But they made up more than a third of students suspended once and 44 percent of those suspended more than once.

More than a third of students who were kicked out of school were black. And more than half of students involved in school-related arrests or police visits were Hispanic or black.

Hutton said an earlier study of 1 million Texas students had been a turning point in the debate. It suggested that too many students were being severely punished. In Texas, nearly six of 10 public school students had been suspended or expelled at least once during middle school or high school.

In response to these findings there have been changes in individual districts around the country.

The Buffalo, N.Y., school district adopted a new code of conduct to reduce suspensions after an African-American 15-year-old died in a drive-by shooting in 2010. He had just left school to begin serving a suspension for wandering the halls.

In Fairfax County, Va., the school board voted in 2012 to soften punishments for possession of marijuana. The changes were partly in response to the suicides of two students who had faced discipline.

And in Miami, Broward County Public Schools last November agreed to create an alternative to zero-tolerance policies. The goal was to shut off what some see as a school-to-prison pipeline.

"Superintendents recognize that out-of-school suspension is outdated and not in line with 21st-century education," said David A. Domenech. He is head of the School Superintendents Association. But, he said, federal funding for programs that address school discipline issues has been scarce.
