ST. LOUIS â€” The McCluer Pommies are a dance team. At a basketball game, the girls linked their arms. They held their shiny silver and black pom-poms. They said a prayer.

The Pommies go to McCluer High School. They dance at basketball games. Sierra McKenzie is the leader of the Pommies. She told her team, "Remember your stuff. You all know what to do."

Lately, it has not been easy for the Pommies.

## Protests And Violence

The school is in Florissant, Missouri. Over the summer, a teenager was killed in nearby Ferguson. People were angry. They protested in the streets. Some of the protests became violent. Protesters blocked streets. They smashed stores.

The Pommies were affected by what happened. The Pommies live in an area without much money. Many of the parents are poor. The girls have to pay for their uniforms and training camps themselves. They even have to pay for their pom-poms.

Because of the protests, they had trouble raising money. The girls planned a fundraiser. They could not sell many tickets. People were scared to go to the area.

Also, school was canceled because of the protests. Practices were also canceled. The Pommies missed practice two weeks before an important contest in St. Louis.

## Pommies Work Hard

The Pommies also have had victories.

The team won first place at a St. Louis dance contest. It competed against 40 teams from other schools.

Students say being a Pommie is an honor. It is also a lot of work. Pommies must be committed to the team. They also must get good grades.

"There are good kids out there," said Rega Wesley-Stewart, the Pommie coach. She said there are also good parents.

Being a Pommie is important for the girls. The girls say they work harder every year. They also grow more confident. Some get better grades.

"I just want it to keep going," said Jerianna Harden. She is a Pommie.
