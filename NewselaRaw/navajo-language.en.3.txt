WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. â€” When Jay Tsosie was a skinny, rowdy schoolboy, teachers tried to force out a very important part of him. They tried to make him forget his Navajo language and culture.

When caught whispering Navajo to classmates, teachers washed his mouth with soap. They forced him to kneel on pencils while holding two heavy bottles in his arms. Government teachers tried to force Indian children to forget their language and traditions. They did not think the language was important.

"Some days," said Tsosie, who is 77, "I had to write on the blackboard 100 times: 'I will not speak Navajo.'"

## Is The Rule Protection Or Punishment?

Now, the Navajo language has become an issue in the upcoming election for president of the Navajo Nation. With 300,000 members, the Navajos are the country's largest American Indian group.

Last week, the tribe's high court said Christopher Deschene could not run for president. His opponents claimed he could not speak Navajo well enough. Under tribal law, the president of the Navajo nation must be able to speak the language.

"Our sacred language defines us as individuals and as a Nation," the court said.

Some support the judges' decision. They say that speaking Navajo is extremely important. The rule was created because the government tried to destroy the Navajo language.

A 94-year-old woman who said she was Deschene's grandmother says he speaks Navajo well enough. "I understand him," she said in the Navajo language.

Others say the rule punishes younger Navajos, who are doing just what their own tribe encourages them to do. They are getting an education in the outside world.

## Protest In Window Rock

Along the state road to Gallup, New Mexico, is a route called the Code Talker Highway. It is named for Navajo soldiers. During World War II, the soldiers used Navajo as a code for secret messages. Billboards along the route show young Navajos in graduation gowns. The billboards say, "Climb the Ladder," "Go Out Into the World" and "Learn English."

Deschene, 43, was born in Los Angeles but grew up in Indian Country. He earned advanced degrees in engineering and law, and also served in the U.S. Marine Corps.

As a result, many here call Deschene a role model, not an embarrassment.

"We teach our kids to get that education and then to come back to the reservation and help their people, just like Chris did," said Art Huskey, 71. "Part of the sacrifice might be forgetting some of their Navajo."

Many years ago ago, nearly every Navajo first-grader spoke the language. Now only about three children in 10 can speak it. Huskey said only one of his four children can speak Navajo, and none of his grandchildren.

Huskey was among the many people who protested Thursday in Window Rock, Arizona. Window Rock is the capital of the Navajo Nation.

## "Why Make This An Issue Now?"

One of the protesters, Mattie Christensen, said she feels completely Navajo, no matter what she speaks.

But Sarah White says the tribal president needs to speak Navajo. "That's the only way you're going to feel and taste the experience of everyday Navajo life," she said.

Although Tsosie still speaks Navajo, he will not teach his grandchildren the difficult language. Navajo has no good way to say some English words. For example, "computer" becomes "thinking metal."

"What's the use?" Tsosie said. "We've been discouraged from using our language all our lives. Why make this an issue now when we have a bright young lawyer who wants to return to lead our tribe? Speaking the language is not going to do him any good, other than talking to the old folks. There are translators for that."

The protest became uneasy after a tribal officer ordered people to remove their signs. "It doesn't look good" for the outside world, said Tribal Police Sergeant Stanley Ashley.

In the end, the signs stayed, but there were moments of doubt. Three elders read a sign, but couldn't translate it. Finally, one spoke up, "Somebody here wrote this sign. We should be able to figure this out."
