CHAMELA, Mexico â€” Hurricane Patricia was one of the strongest storms in history. It was expected to cause large amounts of damage to Mexico. It surprised everyone by causing very little damage on Saturday. Mexican officials do not think anyone was killed or hurt.

Patricia began suddenly as a storm on Oct. 20. It quickly grew into a hurricane. Within 30 hours it zoomed to a Category 5 storm. On a scale of 1 to 5, a Category 5 is the worst.

By Friday, winds blew up to 200 miles an hour. It became the most powerful hurricane ever in North America or South America.

## Not Many People Live Where Patricia Landed

The hurricane landed on the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Few people live where the hurricane came ashore. There are just small villages and a few fancy hotels there. Patricia then crashed into the mountains and ended.

Enrique Pena Nieto is the president of Mexico. He reported that 3,000 to 3,500 homes were damaged. About 235,000 people lost electricity. The hurricane also damaged farmland.

People said they were terrified.

Sergio Reyna Ruiz lives in the village of La Fortuna. It is about 2 miles from the ocean. He said it was the worst five hours of his life. It felt like riding a monster.

He and family members tried to clean up the damage. They sawed through a fallen tree. They also put wet mattresses and books into the sun to dry.

Reyna Ruiz and his family were thankful that no one died. He said he will tell his grandchildren about the hurricane.

## Villagers Return To Find Homes Gone

Chamela is a nearby village. People looked for anything that could be saved. Forty families live there. They all went to another town for safety.

Arturo Morfin Garcia lives in Chamela. The hurricane destroyed his house. A bathroom was the only part still standing.

Morfin Garcia said he felt sad to come back and see his house. He said it took so much work to build it.

## Rain Hit City But No Damage Reported

About 200,000 people live in Puerto Vallarta. Thousands of Americans also live there. The hurricane hardly touched the city. After the hurricane passed, people snapped selfies. Business owners swept sidewalks. It was like any other morning.

Hurricane experts said Mexico was well prepared for the storm. They also said the country was lucky. If the hurricane landed on Puerto Vallarta, people could have been hurt.

Gerardo Ruiz Esparza is a top Mexican official. "Nature was good to us," he said.
