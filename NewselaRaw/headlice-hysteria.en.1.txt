LOVELOCK, Nev. — For years, checking for lice eggs was part of school nurse Deborah Pontius' job description. On some days in this isolated central Nevada town, she'd actually sift through the hair of students found with live head lice.

But something bigger bugged her: the district's policy of sending children home when they were infested with head lice — grayish-white insects that suck blood from the scalp and cause severe itching.

Pontius saw students with head lice miss weeks of school. A re-entry ticket involved painstaking inspections, with parents required to prove that not a single hitchhiker resided on a child's head. Aside from the "ick" factor, she wondered, was there a reason to seclude the youngsters?

As chief nurse for the Pershing County School District's 600 students, Pontius consulted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics. She interviewed families of lice-infested students.

## Letting Students Stay In School

In the vast majority of cases, it turned out students did not contract the bugs in the classroom. Furthermore, the stubby-legged louse does not fly or jump, and needs close bodily contact to spread. So it seemed reasonable that students under care for the infestation could remain in class without risk to others.

Pontius persuaded the district to change its policy. A growing number of school districts have followed suit.

With Pontius co-writing the new policy paper, the National Association of School Nurses changed its recommendations to allow students with head lice — known as pediculosis — to stay in class. But Pontius, 55, knows the battle isn't over.

Parents complain that school officials' failure to issue warning letters when a student is found with head lice leaves them without tools to fight infestation. One New Jersey district has signaled it may reintroduce the lice ban due to objections by school board members. And the National Pediculosis Association (NPA) objects to the changes: It has warned that easing school restrictions could harm efforts to halt the spread of head lice.

The NPA has voiced its opposition to the new Los Angeles Unified School District policy that permits children to attend school even if they show signs of lice eggs, or nits. "L.A. County and other communities are trading in their nit-free standard for children in the classroom in favor of chasing lice with pesticides."

It's unclear how many districts nationwide have opted for less-restrictive lice policies, but Nevada offers a hint: Of 14 counties with chief school district nurses, four have eased their rules on head lice since 2011. Others are cautiously considering the move.

## A Contentious Issue

"We know people will overreact," said Sheila Story, chief nurse for the Carson City School District. "Head lice just gets everyone overexcited."

Even in Lovelock, the new rules have caused tension among parents, teachers and the school board.

"This is one of the most contentious issues school boards nationwide have to deal with," Pontius said. "The best I can hope is that people accept that this condition isn't worth taking a child from school. What people really want is for the lice to go away, and that's not going to happen."

The CDC estimates that 6 million to 12 million U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 11 are infested each year by lice. The bugs crawl among children during sustained contact at sleepovers, play groups and other such activities. The wingless insects live their entire lives on human scalps, feeding on blood and attaching their eggs to hair follicles. Fortunately, they do not carry disease.

CDC officials support the policies of the American Academy of Pediatrics, whose 2010 report said, "No healthy child should be excluded from or allowed to miss school time because of head lice."

Under Lovelock's guidelines, Pontius calls the parents of students with lice and recommends chemical treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. She does not send a general notification letter to other parents for fear of causing panic.

## "Nit-Pickers" And "Lice Ladies"

Pontius also gives out a fact sheet she calls "Lice 101: Everything You Really Didn't Want to Know About Lice." She and other National Nursing Association board members who worked on the group's new policy jokingly called themselves "nit-pickers" and "lice ladies" to take the edge off what they say is an overblown health scare.

But Pontius hasn't been able to banish the idea that head lice are a sign of bad parenting. "With even the mention of head lice, people itch — they scratch their heads," she said. "Many mistakenly see the bugs as signs of a dirty home."

Shea Murphy, principal at Lovelock Elementary School, at first opposed Pontius' plan, but has changed her mind. "We've taken the hysteria out of head lice," she said.

Pockets of resistance remain, however. Lovelock teacher Dana Montes calls lice a classroom nightmare. "One girl, all she did was sit there picking out the lice and putting them on the desk." She believes the bugs move among hats and coats on racks or among students working in close quarters.

That's how she got a case of head lice from a student six years ago: "I leaned over her at the reading table and saw lice in her hair. Then one dropped onto the desk. By then it was too late."

The bugs are gone, but not forgotten. "When I die and go to heaven," Montes said, "the first question I'm going to ask God is: 'Why did you create lice? What was that all about?'"
