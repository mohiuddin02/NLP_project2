### PRO: Would bring in tax revenues

LAS VEGAS — Prohibition doesn't work. The government tried it before when it banned alcohol in the 1920s. Now some people want to ban online gambling. As our history books show, the Volstead Act, which prohibited the sale of alcohol in the 1920s, closed the doors of legal, regulated businesses. And it opened a can of worms that led to severe effects that hadn't been intended.

These effects — criminal activity, illegal making and selling of booze, and more — took years to battle. The cost to society was significant. All for nothing, as the act was later reversed.

Let's not let history repeat itself. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is woven into American history, having existed in some form since our nation's establishment.

Let's rely on common-sense safeguards and protections. We can extend well-established and effective regulations from casinos to online gaming.

## U.S. Could Profit From It

It's silly to assume a ban would end Americans' interest and participation in online gaming. All it would do is set up local, state and federal law enforcement with tremendous expenses. And it would turn millions of average American citizens into criminals.

The black market exists. Today's unregulated gambling websites operate at will. They aren't regulated and pay no taxes. They get away with it because they're based in other countries.

Estimates show growth in unregulated online gaming is explosive: an estimated 1 million Americans or more spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming sites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to participate in the newest form of gaming — online.

The U.S. should profit from online gambling, not condemn or ignore it. Moreover, some of the billions of dollars gaming technology generates can be put to good use. The money can be put toward covering the costs associated with regulation and enforcement.

Modern technologies used on gaming websites protect consumers, including minors, problem gamblers and others. And these safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow online gaming within its state borders. These technologies, while not perfect, will continue to improve.

Moreover, when properly put into action, the taxes generated through online gaming can cover the expenses of protecting Americans. Money left over can help local communities pay for public services such as education.

As with previous legislation, states and casino operators should have the right to say whether they support online gaming at all. For those that do, many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.

## A Slippery Slope

It's no secret that many state and local governments desperately need new sources of money. Governments can't pay for all the services they provide to people right now. Online gaming can assist with the shortfalls in money that states and cities are facing.

State lotteries are a perfect example of using entertainment to help pay for the needs of state and local governments. Large numbers of states that have kept up with 21st-century technologies are offering online lotteries. They could also be put at risk by federal prohibition.

The slippery slope of a proposed ban doesn't stop at the state level. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was recently warned that popular sports fantasy leagues could end up banned by this possible law as well.

It wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming were investigated under federal prohibition, too. Facebook and other social media feature games that might be looked at by the government.

Americans are well-known for starting businesses from scratch. Innovators like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents and policymakers.

Let not federal government stop inventions and new technologies. Set the rules to let Americans innovate —and play — so we can compete with the rest of the world.

Pretending that new ideas and the Internet don't or shouldn't exist is pointless. America should instead look back to both our historical mistakes and our historical innovations for inspiration. They will show us how to best navigate the issues and opportunities associated with Internet gaming today.

### CON: Would prove too costly for communities

WASHINGTON — Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos are newly licensed to operate online gambling sites. It's good news for them. Casinos have had seven straight years of sinking profits. The Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada predicts that if profits continue to shrink at the same rate as this year, casinos will have to double their online gambling to make up for lost money.

It's no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey are taking the opportunity to expand gambling online. Both states rely on the money gambling brings in to pay for services to residents, like education.

What made the move into online gambling possible was when the Department of Justice (DOJ) gutted the Wire Act in 2011. The act had once banned internet gambling. But, in its ruling the DOJ decided that only gambling on sports should now be banned.

Be careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.

## Leads To Social Harms

The National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) was set up by Congress to look into the effects of gambling on Americans. In 1999, it recommended there be no new casinos. And it asked for a complete ban of Internet gambling. It said more research needed to be done on gambling's harms and benefits. Unfortunately this research has not happened.

And online gambling supporters are asking Congress to approve regulations that would help them spread online gambling nationwide. Allowing this would give Americans the false impression that online gambling is somehow safe.

The spread of online gambling will increase its availability. But where there is an increase in availability, there's also a documented increase in happenings of problem gambling. These lead to the social harms of bankruptcy, divorce, prison, and suicide.

Supporters of online gambling say problem gamblers make up only a small percentage of overall players. But, the numbers don't take into account ripple effects. Studies estimate that a compulsive gambler will affect an average of five to 10 other people.

Even recovering problem gamblers may not be able to undo the damage done. Gamblers can lose enormous amounts of money. Their problem can ruin their relationships — particularly their marriages.

The NGISC received plenty of evidence that problem gambling introduces a heightened level of anxiety into marriages and families. Those worries often led to divorce or other family problems. In a survey it found that people blamed their ex-husband's or wife's gambling for their divorce.

## Damage To Communities

The total costs to society cannot be calculated. The increase in crime, money problems, lost work and family break-up damage our society. Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols estimates that the cost of gambling outweighs its benefits by 3-to-1.

Internet gambling is particularly worrisome. Evidence overwhelmingly shows that problem gambling is three to four times more common among online gamblers than non-Internet gamblers.

Online gambling is clearly more dangerous than other forms of gambling. The 24/7 availability, speed of the game, solitary nature of play and ability to play several games at once make it so. It's also possible to lose more money than you have on hand.

Online gambling companies claim they will be able to screen out minors. The companies say they can ensure that players are who they say they are, and can validate that players are physically located where they say they are.

However, the FBI has countered this claim. In a 2009 letter to Congress it stated that online gambling sites claim that they can validate age and location. However, "they are more than likely relying on credit card information and geo-location to gather this information. Both can be spoofed."

Legalizing online gambling may seem like an attractive solution to a state's money shortfalls. Evidence, however, suggests the contrary. Gambling hurts the poor more than the rich. It takes money away from local businesses, while damaging communities.

Both sides of this debate agree that each state can't set its own online gambling rules. Congress needs to act in the interest of families and communities. It should update the Wire Act to prohibit Internet gambling.
