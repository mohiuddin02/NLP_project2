BALTIMORE â€” A video came out Monday of football player Ray Rice hitting Janay Palmer, his wife. They were engaged to be married at the time of the incident.

Rice was a running back for the Baltimore Ravens football team. After the video came out, the Ravens ended Rice's football contract while the NFL indefinitely suspended him.

Rice hit Palmer in February but the video just came out Monday. There was an older video that showed Rice dragging a knocked-out Palmer out of a casino elevator.

When the first video was shown, the NFL suspended Rice for two games. Many people thought the punishment was too light for such a serious crime.

## Tougher Penalties For Domestic Violence

Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, was in charge of punishing Rice.

After people said a two-game suspension was not enough, Goodell apologized. He wrote a letter to the owners of all of the NFL teams. He said that he was sorry for not making the punishment harsher.

Changes were made in the NFL and now if a player hits a family member or girlfriend, he will automatically get suspended for six games.

The 27-year-old Rice was sent to court, but in May he was accepted into a program that allowed him to avoid jail time.

The new video has changed things. It shows Rice and Palmer in an elevator at a casino in New Jersey. They both hit each other. Then, Rice knocked Palmer off her feet and as she fell, her head hit a handrail in the elevator.

The Ravens said earlier Monday that they had never seen the new video. Hours later, the team said it had ended Rice's contract.

The NFL also acted on Monday. Goodell, who leads the NFL, announced that Rice would not be allowed to play in the NFL until further notice.

## Rice Called His Own Actions "Inexcusable"

NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday that the league asked police for any and all information about the incident, including the video from inside the elevator. "That video was not made available to us and no one in our office has seen it until today," he said.

Goodell said something similar in August during the Pro Football Hall of Fame induction weekend. He said they were waiting for more information from police. before giving Rice a harsh punishment.

Rice had begun his two-game suspension Sunday, when the Ravens opened their season with a 23-16 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. He was scheduled to return after Thursday night's game against Pittsburgh Steelers. According to the terms of his two-game suspension, Rice could not be with the team and must work out alone.

Rice hasn't spent a lot of time talking to the media since his arrest. But on July 31, he called his actions "inexcusable" and said this was "something I have to live with the rest of my life."

He added, "I know that's not who I am as a man. That's not who my mom raised me to be. If anybody knows me, they know I was raised by a single parent, and that was my mother. I let her down, I let my wife down, I let my daughter down. I let my wife's parents down. I let the whole Baltimore community down. I let my teammates down. I let so many people down because of 30 seconds of my life that I know I can't take back."
