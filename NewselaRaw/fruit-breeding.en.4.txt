LOS ANGELES â€” It is not easy selling fruit to a country of junk food lovers. But a fruit that tastes like cotton candy could be very popular.

David Cain has come up with just such a grape in California.

Cain is a fruit breeder. He and other breeders take qualities from different types of grapes. They mix them up to grow new types of grapes. The new grapes can be registered with the government, or patented.

Breeders have developed grapes with extra sugar. Some say they as well be Skittles on the vine. But health scientists don't seem all that bothered about the extra sugar in some of the grapes. It takes about a hundred grapes to get the same calories as you get in a candy bar, said David Heber of UCLA.
## Thin Grapes And Fat Grapes

Cain's latest invention is called the Cotton Candy grape. It tastes like a pink ball of spun sugar. "We're competing against candy bars and cookies," he said.

The marketplace for fruit is very competitive. So farmers make money by coming up with new types of fruit that they can put a name on. They hope to come up with the next Cuties Clementine orange. They want to design the next Honeycrisp apple. Those products stand out in the crowded fruit aisle.

"People are looking for more flavor," said Mark Carroll at Gelson's Markets. The store will carry the Cotton Candy grape. "Once they get hooked, they want more no matter what."

California companies sell $1.1 billion in grapes for eating each year. Cain's company is in the heart of that business. It specializes in bold flavors and unusual shapes. Purple Funny Fingers are long and thin like chili peppers. A grape named Sweet Sapphire comes as round and fat as D batteries. Like the Cotton Candy, the special grapes are patented. Farmers pay to grow them.

Ordinary grapes can cost as little as 88 cents per pound. The Cotton Candy could cost around $6 a pound. Prices would come down if enough farmers grow the grape.
## A Fruit Called Pluot

A fruit called the pluot came out in the 1980s. It was part plum and part apricot. The pluot helped launch designer fruits in the United States. It is a crispy stone fruit that took 20 years to develop. It was a big hit. So farmers started spending money on  breeding.

California is now putting out other sweet inventions. Try a peacharine. It's a peach and nectarine combination. How about cherums? Those are made by mixing cherries and plums.

Fruit breeders use methods that are hundreds of years old. It involves a lot of waiting. Then replanting. Then repeating the process. It can take years to get the fruit right.

"It's a bit like fishing. You never know when you're going to get the big one," said Cain.

Cain started his company, International Fruit Genetics, in 2001. A few months later, he tasted a grape that grabbed his attention. Researchers from the University of Arkansas were showing off a purple Concord grape. The fruit didn't look like much. But the cotton candy flavor made Cain think of a county fair.
## "A Lot Of Spitting"

On a recent weekday, Cain showed why he spends half his time outdoors. Rows and rows of vines needed to be inspected in search of the next big thing. Cain methodically tasted his berries. He decides what to keep and what to toss.

There are 300 kinds of grapes to taste on each row. So swallowing the fruit is out of the question. "I've learned to do a lot of spitting," Cain said.

The Cotton Candy was patented in 2010. A Bakersfield grower is set to harvest the first large crop in August. Cain doesn't like to fuss over such things. But the Cotton Candy has him excited. He thinks its flavor has a chance to hook shoppers like nothing before.

"It's going to be introduced slowly," Cain said. "What we're hoping is it will do for grapes what all these new varieties have done for fruit like apples."
