CHICAGO — Kelsey Pearsall-Brandon, 20, wants to be a police officer. But one thing is standing in her way.

Math.

Pearsall-Brandon is a student at Elgin Community College in Illinois. She must take a make-up math class to learn the skills she should have learned in high school. And she must pass the class in order to get her college degree. The class costs $400.

Does she think she'll ever use advanced math as a police officer? "Not really," she said. As a police officer, she says she will have to catch criminals, not use algebra.

## A Huge Problem

More than half of college students must take special make-up classes, called remedial classes. Students are forced to take them because they score very low on subjects like reading and math. These classes are designed to help them get caught up. More than $3 billion is spent each year on the classes. But few of the students who take them will finish college anyway.

It is a huge problem. And experts are starting to take it seriously. Math is the subject that most often holds students back.

Some experts say these classes should be changed. The type of math in them often has nothing to do with what students will do when they get jobs. In the meantime, students never learn the problem solving skills they will need one day.

This causes many students to feel trapped. Remedial classes can be expensive and frustrating. Many students quit school as a result. About one out of every seven Illinois community college students who take remedial classes finish in three years. Community colleges are supposed to take two years to complete.

But students need to pass these remedial classes to finish college and get a job, said Anthony Bryk. He is an education expert.

## A New Approach

Some Illinois colleges are trying a new way to get students caught up.

It is called math literacy. Teachers spend more time on math skills students actually need. Less time is spent on types of math they'll likely never use.

Kathy Almy teaches at a college in Illinois. She wrote a math literacy book. She also helped design a class that uses real-life problems. Teachers in this type of class show students how to use math to find the answers.

Almy said it's easier for students to solve problems taken from life. Consider a math problem her class had to answer: You go to a restaurant's 25-cent chicken wing night with $20. First, you buy a $5 pitcher of soda pop. How many wings can you get?

The class had no trouble finding the answer — 60 wings. But then Almy asked them about side dishes, tax and tip. The problem got more complicated.

Verenice Sandoval is 18. She is a student in Almy's class. She wants to open her own photography business.

"What's different about this course is that it applies more to real life. So we're doing a lot more with something we'll actually use," she said. Sandoval also said the math is easier to understand.

## Problem Solved?

Almy says students can get caught up in math quicker. Her math literacy class is one semester. At other colleges, students must take three or more remedial classes.

But some experts doubt math literacy will solve the problem. Many students come to college knowing little math. Others have weak reading skills. Also, students who study science or technology need to learn more advanced math.

Still, math literacy appears bound to catch on. "Eventually we'll have most if not all colleges doing this," said Brian Durham. He is with the Illinois Community College Board.

Almy hopes it will make college math more like real life.

She says regular math education "treats all students like they want to become doctors. Well, not everyone's going to be a doctor."
