Astronauts are not the only life forms on the International Space Station.

The station is also home to trillions of microscopic fungus and bacteria. The tiny life forms live in the air and on the surfaces of the floating space laboratory.

## Studying Space Microbes

A new study of the life forms, or organisms, living on the space station found that there are more types of life living there than there are in the carefully controlled rooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Earth. JPL is a government-funded space research center. The researchers also detected on the station some tiny types of life, or microbes, that could be harmful to human health.

The results of the study were published in the journal Microbiome.

NASA and other space agencies have been monitoring the collection of microbes that live on the space station for 15 years. They have been gathering dust from air vents and surfaces. Then they grow those samples in labs both in space and on Earth. They were trying to see what strains of bacteria and fungus could be detected.

## Will Microbes Go To Mars?

However, that method has some flaws. For example, there are some types of microbes that are more difficult to grow in the lab. Previous studies may not have shown as many of those microbes as there are on the Space Station. NASA is considering long-term manned missions like sending people to Mars. The agency wants to learn as much as possible about the microscopic community that might tag along.

The new study relied on a special technology. It looks at the DNA of the microbes. DNA technologies contains the instructions for how each microbe works. This method takes into account all the organisms on the space station, not just those that can grow well in a lab.

The research team looked at two samples. One was taken from an air-filter screen that had been in place for 40 months. This sample helped scientists determine what organisms were living in the recycled air of the space station. A second sample came from a vacuum cleaner bag. The bag's contents represented the microbes living on the space station's surfaces.

## Will Astronauts Get Sick?

The DNA study revealed that the majority of the bacteria found on the station is associated with human skin. Very little of that bacteria was found in clean rooms on Earth. The researchers also detected some strains that could make people sick. People whose immune systems are less able to fight disease are especially at risk.

Astronauts in space often have immune systems that may not be working as well as they should, said Kasthuri Venkateswaran, a microbiologist at JPL who led the study. The reason is that their bodies are going through so many changes. "Some of these bacteria could lead to disease" if a person is less able to fight the illness, Venkateswaran said.

## Scientists Have Questions

But just because some of these microbes could lead to disease, it does not mean they will. More work needs to be done to see exactly how many of these disease-causing microbes are aboard the space station and if they are making poisons.

One or two dangerous cells might be aboard the space station, but not necessarily enough to cause disease, Venkateswaran said.

The next step is to see whether any of these organisms are abundant and if they might pose problems for astronauts in the future.

"We are stepping in the right direction, and NASA is aware that these are the things required for tomorrow's human mission to Mars," he said.
