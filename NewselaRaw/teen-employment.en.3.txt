Experts say this could mean young people will face a future of fewer opportunities and lower pay.

The weak teen job market comes even as the overall jobs picture is getting better. The unemployment rate has steadily dropped. Businesses have been adding hundreds of thousands of jobs. So there was hope that this would be the summer when teen employment improved.

But it didn't happen.

In 1999, slightly more than half of teenagers 16 to 19 worked a summer job. But by this year, that number had plunged to less than a third. There are about 16.8 million teens in the U.S.

## "Great Depression For Teens"

"We have never had anything this low in our lives. This is a Great Depression for teens," said Andrew Sum. He runs the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. "That's why it's such an important story."

Summer is traditionally the time when the most teens have jobs. They are off from school. They get the chance to have their first brush with employment. They learn the responsibilities that come with a job.

The picture looks even worse when broken down by race. Sum and his coworkers did just that. They compared June and July 2000 and the same two months of 2013. In 2000, 61.28 percent of white teens 16 to 19 held a job. That number that fell to 39.25 percent this summer.

For African-Americans, 33.91 percent of 16- to 19-year-olds held a job in 2000. That fell to a staggering low of 19.25 percent this June and July. It wasn't much better for Hispanics. They saw the percentage of employed teens fall from 40.31 percent in the two-month period of 2000 to 26.7 percent in June and July 2013.

There was a big surprise in the research, too. Teens whose parents were wealthy were more likely to have a job than those whose parents made less money.

## It's Worse For Lower-Income Teens

Some 46 percent of white male teens whose parents earned between $100,000 and $149,000 held a job this summer. Only 9.1 percent of black male teens whose family made less than $20,000 had a job. And 15.2 percent of Hispanic male teenagers with that same low family income held a job.

That finding is important. Studies show that teens who work do better in life and make more money. The plunging teen employment rate could mean trouble for this generation of young workers of all races.

"Kids that get work experience when they are 17 or 18 end up graduating from college at a higher rate," said Michael Gritton. He runs the Workforce Investment Board. The group works to create jobs and for teen employment in Louisville, Ky., and six surrounding counties.

"Almost every person you ask remembers their first job because they started to learn things from the world of work that they can't learn in the classroom," he said.

The teen employment numbers are calculated by the U.S. government.

## Youth See Much Less Opportunity

Workers aged 16 to 19 made up less of the workforce even before the job market got really bad in 2008. Part of the reason was that more teens were going to college. This had been happening for many years. Also, colleges now care less about after-school jobs. They want students who have volunteered or had interesting life experiences.

But things got a lot worse for teenagers when businesses got hit bad in 2008. Older workers started taking more of the jobs that teens used to hold.

As a result, people who want to get jobs in their 20s won't have any work experience, said Keith Hall. He worked for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2008 to 2012.

One problem is that business has not grown much since the Great Recession of 2008. That means older workers aren't moving up.

"I think that means that a lot of workers aren't advancing through their careers," he said. "Younger workers aren't going to be progressing through their careers as they did before."
