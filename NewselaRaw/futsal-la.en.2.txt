LOS ANGELES — The lights flicker on above the tennis courts at DeForest Park in Long Beach, Calif., but the nets have disappeared.

Tennis balls are nowhere in sight. This evening, people are playing with a different kind of ball.

Spray paint marks the goals on the fence that surrounds the court. Shots whiz by like cars on a freeway.

English and Spanish blend as players chant "Corre! Corre!" ("Run!") and "Mira! Mira!" ("Look!"). The murmurs from onlookers — "nice" and "wow" — swell after each dazzling play.

The matches on this concrete court are quick. The first team to score wins. Losers retreat to wooden benches as the next challenger goes to play.

This squeezed-down version of soccer is known as futsal.

## Futsal Anyone?

Arturo Sanchez, 20, is in his element. When Sanchez moved to a side of town where more Latinos lived, he fell in love with soccer.

During the day, the soccer field down the road at DeForest Park was overrun with youth leagues. When night fell, the unlighted field was dark. The tennis courts, though, were bathed in light.

So, several years ago, Sanchez and a group of friends began to turn the tennis courts into miniaturized, rock-hard soccer courts. They did what Brazilians and other Latin Americans started doing nearly a century ago: they turned any flat, open space, from basketball gyms to rooftops, into a soccer field.

Existing soccer fields are beaten down from constant use. There is not any open space in city neighborhoods to build more. So futsal has rolled into parks across the nation to meet the growing demand of soccer-loving millennials.

Nearly every player prefers to play on grass, but futsal courts have come to be viewed as the best available choice. Also, building a futsal court costs about $25,000. A normal soccer field would cost 10 times as much.

Parks officials say that some areas meant for tennis, basketball or volleyball have seen more soccer balls bounced on them than anything else in recent years. This is another sign of how the nation's growing Latino population is reshaping how cities and other areas look.

The number of places to play in the region is expected to grow from about 15 to 45 during the next two years.

## Pass Fast, Shoot Fast

The rhythm of futsal is noticeably different from a full-fledged soccer game. The boom-run, bam-run, tap-strike of soccer is replaced by zap-zap, zap-tap-strike in futsal's tighter quarters.

Futsal is normally played with teams of five rather than 11 as in soccer. This increases the amount of times each player kicks the ball. The ball is also smaller and heavier. It rolls faster and requires harder kicks.

"You have to know how to pass really fast, how to attack in small spaces and how to defend all at once," Sanchez said.

Soccer players may let the ball soar a long distance and rely on their own speed to attack the goal. In futsal, players rely on footwork as they weave past one another.

Tap the ball too hard and it will sail out of bounds; fail to give it enough zip and a defender is there to steal it away. There's not enough space to outrace another player for a misplaced ball.

"Here, I can experiment and see if I can do these new tricks quickly in a small space," Sanchez said. If he can make opponents look bad in futsal, "it's easier on the big field."

## Toddlers To Teens To Adults

Soccer experts say that children improve at soccer more quickly if they play futsal. That draws some high school soccer players to DeForest during the off-season as they try to play like international soccer legends such as Brazil's Ronaldinho and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo. Last year, the U.S. Soccer Federation began requiring some of its academy teams to play futsal during the off-season.

When played with official rules, futsal is also distinct from indoor soccer. Indoor soccer fields typically resemble a hockey rink, and kicks that bounce off surrounding walls are legal. In comparison, futsal has an out-of-bounds line just like soccer and sneakers or running shoes are worn instead of cleats.

Los Angeles County opened its first futsal fields last summer. Parents play with toddlers during the day. Teenagers come through in the afternoon. Adults, many of them Spanish-speaking immigrants, play pickup games in the evenings.

County officials said it was necessary to add futsal courts. They make community parks work for today's demand for soccer-like activities.

Three months ago, the city of Los Angeles resurfaced the popular futsal court in Glassell Park with artificial turf. The grass field had worn out from daily use. Constructed five years ago, it's the only one maintained by the city, and people come from far away to play.

Thousands more play futsal each week at a handful of private courts in a mix of outdoor lots and indoor warehouses. The entrance cost is usually $5.

In Long Beach, Sanchez no longer needs to tear down tennis nets; the city has done it for him. Three of the four tennis courts at DeForest Park were made into futsal courts last summer.
