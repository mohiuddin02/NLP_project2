NAIROBI, Kenya — In one of Vietnam's most expensive restaurants a group of Vietnamese businessmen are celebrating with their new American partners. "A toast!" someone exclaims. They raise their glasses, which are full of the finest scotch, sprinkled with a fine powder. 

The powder is not gold, as less important businessmen might offer. No, this is something far rarer and costlier: it is crushed white rhino horn.

## Slaughter For $20 Billion A Year

A half-century ago, white rhinos were plentiful in Africa. Today, only around 25,000 still roam the continent, mostly in South Africa, with a handful in Namibia and Kenya. 

The population of elephants is also dwindling fast. It has fallen from 10-20 million a half-century ago to just 470,000 today. The animals are hunted for their tusks, which are carved into a wide range of ivory goods.

The immediate cause of these steep declines is poaching — the unlawful killing of protected animals. However, the real reason is those businesspeople in Asia, and others like them. Thanks to high demand in Asia, elephant tusk now sells for around $1,500 per pound. Rhino horn fetches $45,000 or more. With prices like these, it is no surprise that poaching is a $20 billion a year business.

Around 400 tons of ivory — taken from about 50,000 elephants — was trafficked in 2013. There are now only about 50,000 elephants left in all of Central Africa. Farther east, Tanzania's elephant population declined by two-thirds, or more than 25,000 animals, from 2009 to 2014. Mozambique's elephant population fell by 40 percent during the same time period. All of its white rhinos have already been wiped out.

## Automatic Rifles, Helicopters And Profits

Conservationists have been sounding the alarm for years. Nonetheless, poaching has steadily grown. It has almost become like warfare, featuring gangs equipped with AK-47 rifles, electronic tracking gear, and sometimes even helicopters. This large-scale destruction of animal species is often helped along by national park authorities and government officials, who profit from the trade too.

In South Africa, poachers killed 1,215 rhinoceroses last year compared to just 13 in all of 2007. If that continues, by next year more rhinos could be killed there than are born. For South African rhinos, extinction is not far off.

It has become increasingly difficult to protect endangered African animals. This is true even within wildlife sanctuaries, where the animals are sheltered and supposedly safe from hunters. For example, guards must patrol Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy 24 hours a day to protect the 133 rhinos living there. The herd is the largest in East Africa. It includes the world's last three northern white rhinos.

## Some Signs Of Hope

There is reason for hope, however. Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Barack Obama both agreed to outlaw the sale of ivory in their countries. The move is significant because China is the world's largest buyer of ivory. 

There is also progress in Africa itself. In Kenya, rhino poaching fell by nearly half last year, claiming only 34 of 1,024 rhinos. In the first nine months of this year, poachers killed only six rhinos. 

Fewer of the country's elephants are being killed as well. In 2013, roughly 60 percent of the country's elephants died at the hands of poachers. This year, about one-third did. While that is still way too many elephants, it is a significant improvement.

## "Embarrassed" Into Action

The progress in Kenya may partly be due to growing global attention to its poaching problem. The country's government "got embarrassed," said Richard Vigne, who heads Ol Pejeta.

There has also been a shift at the local level. Kenya's animal sanctuaries used to try to keep people out entirely. Now some are trying a new community approach. For example, Ol Pejeta allows herders to graze their cattle within its borders during the dry season. In exchange, the herders must report poachers in the area.

This new approach to policing has already produced results. Ol Pejeta has not lost an elephant in many years, and only a very few rhinos have been killed.

## Go After Ivory Buyers Too

All of this is good news, of course. However, something else has to happen for poaching to decline enough to save Africa's rhinos and elephants. The demand for rhino horns and ivory must decrease.

Individual people have an important part to play in that change. First, they must refuse to buy products that rely on poaching. Second, they must also turn them down when they are offered. Only then will the pointless habits that fuel poaching begin to die out. With elephant and rhino populations declining quickly, there is no time to waste.
