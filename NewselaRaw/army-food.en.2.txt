RALEIGH, N.C. — A ready-to-eat Army meal can survive a 1,200-foot parachute drop and stay fresh for up to three years. But if a soldier doesn't like the taste, it's going to go straight into the trash.

That's a problem researchers at North Carolina State University hope to solve by taking extracts from fruits and vegetables and putting them into snack bars.

"The Army goes to such an expense to make rations, then watches time and time again as soldiers throw out anything that doesn't look and taste good," said Mary Ann Lila, director of N.C. State's Plants for Human Health Institute. "If it's nutty and good tasting, the guys will eat it — especially if they know it has high protein and will help with energy and muscle mass. Here, we are making an ingredient that not only will taste good but will be good for your body and your health."

Lila and her colleagues received a $60,000 grant from major food companies. The money will allow them to chose one fruit and one vegetable to test their new method of transplanting vital nutrients.

"Because of our North Carolina connection, we decided on kale greens and muscadine grapes," she said.

## More Than Just Good Taste

These and other vegetables and fruits naturally contain phytochemicals. Also known as antioxidants, phytochemicals help the body in many ways. They enhance the immune system, repair cellular damage and improve brain functions.

It's no small job to feed an army. The Combat Feeding Directorate in Natick, Massachusetts, is the military's own food research and development laboratory.

Delivering fresh fruits and vegetables to troops is often difficult if not downright impossible, especially in parts of the world where they are not grown, said Tom Yang, an army food scientist at the lab.

"There are logistics problems as well as the fact that these foods are highly perishable," Yang said. "Many times there is no refrigeration. We have to use food that is shelf-stable." Shelf-stable foods, according to the Army, must be able to remain fresh for 3.5 years when stored at 80 degrees, or nine months at 100 degrees.

And they must be something soldiers are willing to eat.

"It has to taste good and look good to soldiers who are 20 or 21 years old," Yang said. "They can be pretty picky. They'd really rather be eating fried chicken or pizza or hamburgers."

## Eating A Lot Of Snack Bars

Soldiers on duty  in harsh climates such as Iraq or Africa have the fewest options. They tend to rely heavily on snack bars. While rich in protein and carbohydrates, the bars lack nutrients such as the cancer-fighting glucosinates found in kale or the heart-healthy flavonoids in grapes.

To make their products, the researchers have found a way to extract the fruit and vegetable phytochemicals and bind them with flour made from soybeans or hemp. The flour is used to prepare the snack and meal bars soldiers receive. Their process also filters out excess sugars, fats and waters from the fruits and vegetables. The resulting concentrate can provide four or more servings of fruits and vegetables in a single tablespoon and remain safe to eat for several months, Lila said.

"We hired an external company to see how consumers would react, and they really loved it," Lila said. "It has a pleasant fruity aroma and texture."

Yang said he is eager to run his own tests on samples from the project. He wants to determine how the products will work as part of the Army's ready-to-eat (MRE) program. "The work sounds impressive so far," he said.

Meanwhile, researchers at the Plants for Human Health Institute are experimenting with various foods that could be made with the healthier flour. They test the new products for shelf-life, nutrition and taste.

## Civilians, Too, Can Benefit

Soldiers aren't the only ones who stand to gain from easier access to phytochemicals, Lila said. Athletes, hikers and people trying to control their weight could also benefit.

In a recent experiment, some students from Appalachian State University drank a beverage containing blueberry and green tea phytochemical extracts for 17 days. Other students had a drink with no phytochemicals. During the final three days of the project, they all worked out intensely for 2.5 hours each day.

The students who did not drink the phystochemicals returned to their normal metabolism shortly after exercising, Lila said. "But those given the phytochemicals were still burning fat in their sleep."
