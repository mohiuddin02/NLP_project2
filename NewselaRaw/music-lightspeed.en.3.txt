SAN JOSE, Calif. — When you email someone, your message travels across the Internet with amazing speed. Suppose you were in San Francisco, and the other person was in New York City. Your message would take only around a second to travel across the country.

However, such speeds aren't quite fast enough for musicians. Sounds too can travel from computer to computer, but not fast enough for musicians to play together from very far away.

Musicians dream of a day when notes will be able to travel across the Internet at super-fast speeds. People all over the world would then be able to play music together just as if they were in the same room.

## Smoother, Faster Internet

Right now, there are big problems when musicians in far-apart places try to perform together online. Musicians in one place have to wait to hear the notes musicians in another place have played. Playing together naturally is very difficult.

So musicians are excited by a new effort to make computers much faster. The plan is to make them so fast that they approach light speed. Light travels at about 186,000 miles a second, the fastest anything in the universe can go.

The new effort was launched in October. It is led by scientist Brighten Godfrey.

The goal is a smoother, faster Internet. Godfrey's team imagines instant-messaging chats that don't slow down. They imagine videos that don't slow down or freeze.

They also imagine musicians in Hawaii and Antarctica performing together perfectly.

The problem right now is the time delay that happens when a signal travels across a computer network. A computer network is simply a group of computers linked together. A computer signal contains coded information. The information is seen or heard on the other end as words, pictures or sound.

## Trying A Long-Distance Concert

Signals travel the Internet about 10 times slower than the speed of light. Often, they are 100 times slower.

Right now, a signal takes a second or even longer to travel from San Francisco to New York. If it were traveling at the speed of light, it would take just 27 milliseconds. A millisecond is one-thousandth of a second.

Right now, musicians in the same town can jam together online. However, it's far tougher if great distances separate them.

A concert last month at California's Stanford University suggests what might be possible. It made use of the university's high-speed Internet connection. Thirteen musicians took part, performing in different places. The players were at Stanford, and in Santa Barbara, California; Virginia and Mexico. All were linked together by Stanford scientist-musician Chris Chafe.

Microphones sent music into a computer. The sounds then zipped through the network to distant computers. From there, they went into loudspeakers and were heard almost immediately far from where they were played. When musicians in one place heard sounds from far away, they answered with their own sounds.

## The Music Was Slow Enough

It took 46 milliseconds for the bass and piano notes from Virginia to reach Stanford. It took another 46 milliseconds for Chafe's cello to be heard back in Virginia. Speeds were around the same for the flute sounds coming from Mexico.

Santa Barbara is much closer to Stanford than the other two places. It took only 7 milliseconds for sounds from there to reach Stanford.

The show seemed like a miracle.

Chafe said the concert was possible for two reasons: because Stanford's Internet connection is fast enough — and the music was slow enough. Other kinds of music might be very difficult to play.

Godfrey's team will try to figure out what is slowing down computer signals. They will look closely at everything that happens when a signal travels across a network.

"We couldn't have dreamed, 30 years ago, that we'd be where we are," said Godfrey. "Now we are trying go beyond where we are, to truly bring the whole world together."
