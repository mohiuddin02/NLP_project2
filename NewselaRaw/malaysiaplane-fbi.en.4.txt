WASHINGTON â€” A plane disappeared Saturday after leaving Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysia Airlines plane was heading to Beijing, the capital of China. There were 239 people aboard.

Three of the passengers are American citizens. The FBI is sending agents to help look into the disappearance. A top U.S. law enforcement official said that because Americans were on board, the FBI can help investigate.

There also might have been a fourth American, a baby.

The official spoke secretly. He couldn't speak openly because the FBI has just started to investigate. "But so far what happened is a mystery," he said.

## Stolen Passports Get Attention

U.S. officials are looking at whether this could be terrorism. In any plane crash they look for signs of terrorism. Two passengers on board used stolen passports.

Passports are travel papers. People need a passport when traveling between countries. An official working to fight terrorism said stolen passports are not a sure sign of terrorism.

The official said there was no proof of terrorism so far.

FBI agents will review video of the airport in Kuala Lumpur. They'll look for pictures of passengers at the ticket counter and other areas. They'll also check video taken in the area where people board the plane. Pictures can be used with the FBI's technology. Videos can be matched with photos of members of terrorist groups.

But the official said no terrorist link has been discovered. So far, no group has claimed that it made the plane crash. Air traffic control lost contact with the plane during the flight.

## Two Oil Slicks Spotted

Vietnamese military planes helped in the search for the plane. They spotted two oil slicks off the coast of Vietnam. The slicks could be signs of a plane crash. But, it hasn't been proven that they were from the missing jet.

The Department of Homeland Security protects the U.S. from terrorist attacks. An official with the group said no plane has ever been attacked by terrorists who boarded a jet carrying stolen passports. "We've never seen that," he said.

## Early In The Investigation

He said in the U.S. passports and plane tickets are immediately run through computer systems. The systems show whether passports have been stolen or lost. He said security in Malaysia is not as good. Stolen passports could have gotten two passengers through security, he said.

He cautioned that it is early in the investigation. "We can't say what it means yet," he said. But he said that the two stolen passports have caused investigators to look for holes in security.

The Homeland Security official said that one passport was stolen from an Italian man. It was taken from a car he rented. The passport was stolen when he returned the car in August in Malaysia. A second passport was stolen from an Austrian man two years ago, he said.

"Just because they were stolen doesn't mean the travelers were terrorists," the Homeland Security official said. "They could have been nothing more than thieves. Or they could have simply bought the passports on the black market."

Another official said there is a list of lost and stolen passports. It is kept by Interpol. Interpol is a global police group. It works with the police in many countries. Large international airlines usually check Interpol's list before passengers get on a plane. Passengers on a major airline shouldn't be able to board using a stolen passport, the official said.
