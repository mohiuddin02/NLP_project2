WASHINGTON — Tens of thousands of people from across the United States assembled at the National Mall on Aug. 24 for the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. The gathered crowd both paid tribute to the past and rallied for what they believe is the unfinished business of the civil rights battle.

Under picture-perfect blue skies, the throng assembled around the base of the Lincoln Memorial. It was the same spot where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his historic "I Have a Dream" speech. Speaker after speaker implored the attendees to become active participants, not bystanders, in the quest for racial equality and harmony.

Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., was the only speaker from the 1963 march. He fired up Saturday's crowd by exhorting them to fight against the recent Supreme Court decision to strike down a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

"I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala.," he told the crowd, referring to the 1965 "Bloody Sunday" march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. Protesters were brutally beaten back then on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. "I got arrested 40 times during the '60s, beaten and left bloodied and unconscious. But I'm not tired. I am ready to fight and continue to fight, and you must fight."

## Festive Yet Reflective Mood

Attorney General Eric Holder echoed his sentiments, saying Saturday's event was "about far more than reflecting on our past."

He said, "This morning, we must affirm that this struggle must, and will, go on in the cause of our quest for justice — until every eligible American has the chance to exercise his or her right to vote." He added that it must continue until "all are treated equally and fairly in the eyes of the law."

District of Columbia officials said they were expecting at least 700 55-passenger charter buses from out of town. The director of the NAACP's Washington bureau estimated that more than 100,000 people were on the Mall by noon on Saturday.

The mood around the Lincoln Memorial was festive yet reflective. People sat on blankets or on lawn chairs and cheered as speakers made their points.

Many young people and adults wore T-shirts or buttons. Some carried signs protesting the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Martin's mother was cheered loudly when she appeared.

## "We're Moving Forward"

Emma Daniels, 70, wore a cap adorned with buttons from the 1963 march. Daniels pointed to where she and other members of Augusta, Ga.'s Tabernacle Baptist Church stood 50 years ago when they made the bus journey to Washington.

"I wanted my children to have the same feeling that I had — change," said Daniels, who now lives in Lorton, Va. "We came out here to march for change, we can't stay home. We've seen a lot of change, we're going forward, it's slow, but we're moving forward."

Daniels said she noticed a different atmosphere Saturday than what she experienced in the Aug. 28, 1963, march. She said she remembers there being an air of tension then. Many of the 250,000 people who were there that day had traveled through a segregated South and feared being stopped by inhospitable law enforcement officers along the way.

"This is so much more relaxed than when we came up — like a family reunion," she said. Melanie Marshall, 34, Daniels' daughter, said Saturday's event gave her a greater appreciation for the right to assemble.

"In Egypt, people are fighting and killing each other in the street," she said. "We're lucky to be able to come together like this, in a peaceful way."

## A Prelude To Aug. 28

Amber Brown, 43, made the five-hour drive from Raleigh, N.C., to Washington with her two children to witness Saturday's events. She said she wanted her children to learn about "American history and the fact that there are people who fought and died to give them the opportunity to do whatever they want to do, and be whatever they want to be."

Darryl Simmons, 21, made the bus journey to Washington with fellow students from Orangeburg, S.C.'s Claflin University because "I just wanted to relive history."

Said Simmons, president of Claflin's Young Democrats, "We're not exactly dealing with what happened 50 years ago, but there's stuff going on and we're here for justice."

Saturday's commemoration was a prelude to Wednesday, Aug. 28, the March on Washington's official anniversary. Another large crowd is expected at the Lincoln Memorial that day as President Barack Obama will speak at the spot where King made history 50 years ago.

The nation's first African-American president is expected to discuss the progress and problems the nation has faced as it tries to live up to [his dream](http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf). A dream in which, King said 50 years ago, his children "will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."
