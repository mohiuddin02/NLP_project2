JOHANNESBURG, South Africa â€” The deadly Ebola virus is spreading throughout Africa. One country that is trying to stop the spread is Sierra Leone. It is a country in West Africa. Ebola has killed more than 550 people in the country. To stop the dangerous and painful disease, Sierra Leone set up a curfew.

The curfew meant that the entire nation has to stay indoors for three days. It was to try to stop the spread of the Ebola disease. The virus is very contagious.

Some people were very angry to be forced to stay at home. People in Sierra Leone don't trust the government or health care workers. Rumors are being spread. Some think the disease is a plot by outsiders to kill people.

## Treatment Scares Many People

About 30,000 volunteers are supposed to visit every house in the country by Sunday. They work in teams of four. Each team is expected to visit 20 houses a day. After visiting a house, a team makes a chalk mark on the outside. That shows that people living there had been seen.

The aim of the project is to find people with Ebola who are hiding. Some sick people do not want others to know. They do not want to go for treatment and be isolated. They will not be able to see family or friends because the disease is too contagious.

The visits are also supposed to make people less afraid of the government. The volunteers plan to share information. They will talk about the disease with the country's 6 million citizens. They hope to help people learn about Ebola. They want to get rid of the rumors.

Some people have said the program's goal will not be met. Aid workers have said it could do more harm than good. They worry that it could hurt the trust between the population and health officials.

Forcing people to stay inside and away from others does not help stop Ebola, the aid group Doctors Without Borders said. This damages the trust between people and health workers. Families just hide people who might have Ebola. It ends up spreading the disease even more.

## Health Center Says Curfew Was Successful

Most people stayed at home Saturday. But news agencies reported some people ran off to avoid the curfew.

The government's emergency Ebola center got 102 calls. Each call meant they found a new suspected Ebola case.

"On the whole we came out successful," the head of the center said.

Sierra Leone is not the only nation with a tough plan for Ebola. Liberia is a country next to Sierra Leone. The government there sealed off an entire neighborhood. It forced more than 50,000 people to stay inside for more than a week.

## Five West African Countries Have Ebola

Governments in five West African countries have counted more than 5,300 cases of Ebola. There have been 2,600 deaths. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have the most people with Ebola.

People are going door to door in Sierra Leone. Some of them are volunteers who have only recently been trained. They will likely have a difficult job. They will have to figure out which families are hiding sick people.

Some people living in Sierra Leone support the effort. They hope that it will stop the disease from spreading so fast.

"It will protect our country from this dangerous virus. Many of our people have died, nurses and doctors too," said Ishmail Bangura. "So if they ask us to stay home for three days, for me it is not bad."
