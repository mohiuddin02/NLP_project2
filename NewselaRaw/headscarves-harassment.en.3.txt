HOUSTON, Texas — Leilah Abdennabi met her friend for lunch at a cafe in Austin, Texas, recently. When she got inside, her friend was crying.

Her friend, Sirat Al-Nahi, said that an elderly white man had harassed her. He had watched Abdennabi park and suggested that she did not know how to drive. He said she "should go back to Saudi Arabia." 

Shocked, Al-Nahi, a senior at the University of Texas at Austin, asked the man to repeat what he had said. He did, this time adding, "Do you have a gun? You should just shoot me."

The restaurant staff seated the man and his friend, and Al-Nahi started crying.

Both women are Muslim and both wear headscarves, also called hijabs. Al-Nahi had not expected to be harassed at the cafe. People in Austin are usually tolerant, and they accept people of different religions. The restaurant even serves Middle Eastern food.

## Women Seek Help, Find None

Abdennabi asked to speak to the manager of the cafe. The manager said there was nothing she could do. Abdennabi asked the elderly white man to repeat what he had said, but he told her to go away.

She surveyed the restaurant.

Abdennabi told the Los Angeles Times, "No one was doing or saying anything. I was like, 'Just so you guys know, we were told some very racist things at this restaurant and no one did anything because who cares about us?' And someone shouted 'Nobody.'"

The attacks in Paris, France, and San Bernardino, California, changed things for Muslim women. They wear headscarves, so it is apparent that they are Muslim. Muslim women wearing headscarves are harassed, often by men.

## Headscarves Make Easy Targets

The Council on American-Islamic Relations has recorded many cases of Islamophobia in the last month. Many women wearing headscarves have been harassed.

In Cincinnati, Ohio, a driver tried to run down a young Muslim woman. In New York City, a customer called a Muslim pharmacist a terrorist. The customer said to "get out of this country." In San Diego, California, a man pushed a pregnant Muslim mother's stroller into her belly. A student in San Diego said that a man pulled at her headscarf and yelled at her in a parking lot.

Sahar Aziz is a professor at Texas A&M School of Law. She said that because Muslim women wear headscarves, it is easy to see who they are. They cannot hide or look like non-Muslims. This makes them easier targets for harassment.

Some Muslim women are afraid of being harassed. Some women in the United States have stopped wearing headscarves. 

## Some Decide To Stop Wearing Headscarves

Aziz has worn a headscarf for four years. She said that wearing a headscarf or not is a woman's choice. Aziz said that different women have different beliefs and may make different choices.

Abdennabi is Palestinian-American. She has worn a headscarf for six years. She knows some women who are choosing not to wear a headscarf. Abdennabi chooses to keep wearing her headscarf.

Abdennabi said that she does not want to hide her religion. She wants people to know that she is a Muslim. She said that if she is harassed, she will share her story on the Internet because harassment is wrong. 

Al-Nahi and Abdennabi posted about the harassment at the cafe on Facebook. Lots of people were very kind. Some non-Muslims offered to protect them. The CEO of the Kerbey Lane restaurant said he was sorry in a public apology on Facebook. 

He said that harassment and racism are not okay. He said that the restaurant should have asked the elderly white man who harassed the women to leave.
