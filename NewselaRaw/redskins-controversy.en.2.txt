NEW YORK â€” The Oneida Indian Nation says the Washington Redskins team nickname is offensive. It wants to meet with all 32 NFL owners to talk about it during the week of the Super Bowl.

The request for the meeting comes after what Oneida representatives said was a disappointing conversation with league officials on Wednesday.

The Oneida Nation hopes to persuade the other team owners and Commissioner Roger Goodell to pressure Redskins owner Daniel Snyder to drop the nickname.

Ray Halbritter, an Oneida representative, said of Wednesday's meeting, "it became somewhat evident they were defending the continued use of the name. Of course, we're disappointed." Halbritter is also leader of the Change the Mascot Campaign.

## Disappointing Meeting For Oneidas

The Oneidas asked Goodell and Snyder to "visit our homelands." They also sought a change to league rules to prohibit naming a team with any term that is a racial epithet, or offensive name. Halbritter says the dictionary defines the word "redskins" precisely that way.

Halbritter's group asked Goodell to "use his power" to make Snyder come before the league executive committee if the team keeps using the name. The purpose would be to consider possible penalties against Snyder.

Goodell did not attend the Wednesday meeting. The league was represented by senior vice president Adolpho Birch, and executive vice presidents Jeff Pash and Paul Hicks. Pash is the league's general counsel.

"We met at the request of Ray Halbritter of the Oneida Nation," the league said in a statement. "We listened and respectfully discussed the views of Mr. Halbritter" and others who came with him.

They also discussed "the sharply differing views of many other Native Americans and fans in general," the league said. "The meeting was part of an ongoing dialogue" to help with listening and learning, which Goodell earlier this year said the league would do.

## Oneidas Sponsor Buffalo Bills

Many of the Oneidas' requests were contained in a letter handed to the NFL representatives at the meeting.

President Barack Obama recently said he would "think about changing" the name if he owned the team. Since then, many fans have taken up the cause. And many more have rallied around a name they see as a tradition or a tribute.

Halbritter sees it as offensive and demeaning.

In a letter to Goodell, he referred to the team name as the "R-word." He said the Change the Mascot Campaign wanted to halt the destructive effects of the word "on our people and Native peoples everywhere."

He also said the Oneida Indian Nation is a sponsor of the league. "We are concerned that the league's marketing of a racially derogatory term undermines the NFL's ability to be a unifying force in America."

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the Oneida Indian Nation is not a league sponsor. The Oneida Indian Nation sponsors the football team Buffalo Bills. The Wisconsin tribe of the Oneida Nation has a sponsorship deal with the Green Bay Packers.

## "A Name Unfit For Print"

The Oneida Indian Nation has approximately 1,000 enrolled members. It is one of 566 federally recognized sovereign [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) nations, according to the U.S. government.

Also Wednesday, the San Francisco Chronicle said it will no longer use the term "Redskins" when referring to the team.

Managing Editor Audrey Cooper said the newspaper's style committee made the decision. The reason was to eliminate the term because of a long-standing policy against using racial insults.

"Not everyone has to be personally offended by a word" for it to be an insult, Cooper said in a statement. It was titled "A name unfit for print. Make no mistake, 'redskin' is a patently racist term."

The Chronicle joins several other publications that have made the same decision over the years. Those include the Kansas City Star, Slate.com, and the Portland Oregonian which dropped the term more than two decades ago.
