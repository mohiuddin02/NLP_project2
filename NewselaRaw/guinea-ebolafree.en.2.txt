CONAKRY, Guinea — The West African country of Guinea was declared free of the deadly Ebola virus on Tuesday. The announcement marked a huge step in the fight against the world's largest Ebola outbreak.

Guinea is where Ebola emerged two years ago, before spreading to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. No new known cases have been reported anywhere in the world in at least 21 days, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 

Liberia is on a countdown to be declared Ebola-free on Jan. 14, which could mark a final end to the outbreak. Sierra Leone, the third West African country to be hammered by the virus, was declared free of Ebola on Nov. 7.

Dr. Matshidiso Moeti is WHO's Regional Director for Africa. For the first time, he said, all three countries have stopped the disease from spreading further.

## Experts Still Fear New Cases

However, experts warn that cases may still emerge. So far, the virus has killed more than 11,300 people worldwide.

"We definitely cannot let our guard down," said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "It's certainly possible we will have more cases and more clusters in the coming months."

On Tuesday, about 50 people who survived the disease, together with journalists and relatives of Ebola victims, gathered at WHO's Ebola headquarters in Conakry. The mood was one of celebration, mixed with sadness.

## Survivors, Victims' Families Speak

"Guinea is a blessed country. We hope that all the dead, and the victims of this disease, will be sacrifices to the Guinean nation," so that no other terrible disease outbreak will strike the country, said survivor Ibrahima Sow.

Mariam Camara, with tears in her eyes, said the country had lost some of its best to Ebola, including her mother and brother. The two were among the more than 2,500 people who died in Guinea.

"That cursed disease separated me from that which is most beautiful to me in my life," she said. "But it's over. We are turning a page on Ebola, definitively."

Guinea will hold a big celebration Wednesday, overseen by President Alpha Conde and including testimony by Ebola survivors. Later, popular West African artists such as Youssou N'Dour and Tiken Jah Fakoly are scheduled to perform at a concert in the capital.

## Nation Must Watch For 90 Days

Dr. Mohamed Belhocine is WHO's representative in Guinea. On Tuesday he said the nation will now enter a 90-day period of heightened watchfulness.

WHO declares an Ebola outbreak has ended when a country goes through two incubation periods without a new case emerging. Each incubation period — the time it takes for symptoms to appear once a person has acquired the disease — lasts 21 days. Ebola is contagious only when symptoms have appeared.

Guinea had the fewest Ebola cases of the three countries. However, its bigger size, extensive remote areas and widespread distrust of health workers allowed the outbreak to persist longer here.

Frieden also warned that the virus could persist or re-emerge in animals. If either of those things happens, the disease could still be passed on to humans.

"That's why it's so important these countries be ready for additional cases," he said.

## Testing, Emergency Response Boosted

Frieden said the CDC is working on a set of protection measures, including laboratories that can test for Ebola. Trained investigators within the three West African countries will help stop and prevent threats. They will make sure rapid tests are available and emergency operation centers are in place to oversee a strong and quick response.

"The world needs to be ready to surge in more rapidly when a country's abilities are overwhelmed," he said.

The outbreak claimed the first lives in December 2013. However, it did not make headlines until March 2014 in Guinea, before quickly spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. 

By early June 2014, the Ebola outbreak was the deadliest ever recorded. Nevertheless, the WHO resisted sounding the international alarm until August. Some have said that delay may have cost lives.
