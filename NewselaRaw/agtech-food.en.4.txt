TRACY, Calif. — Technology companies are very new. The people working in technology want to help the world's oldest business — farming. The people in the technology business want to put their money and talents into farming.

They have big goals. They want to make sure there is enough food for people in 100 years. By then, the planet will have 10 billion people. Also, these businesspeople hope to make a lot of money.

## Ag-Tech Is Growing Fast

The companies working in agriculture and technology are known as "ag-tech." They are growing very fast. Paul Matteucci said ag-tech is going to be big because "everybody eats." He created Feeding 10 Billion. It helps ag-tech businesspeople who want to start new companies.

Many ag-tech companies are creating technology to make farming easier. They have built robots to cut lettuce. They have made computer software that can figure out how much grass to grow for cows to eat. Others companies are using technology to make products that taste like meat, cheese and eggs. Yet they are made from plants.

The plant products can be good for the planet. It might mean less land is used to raise animals. Fewer trucks will be needed to transport the animals. So less gas will be used. It will mean less pollution. One new company called Hampton Creek sells mayonnaise and cookies that use plant products instead of eggs.

## Farmers Using iPads

Many farmers like the technology. The farmers are running their fields using iPads. They measure the water in soil using computers. Farmers want more technology to help them grow more food, and to save money.

Ryan Jacobsen is a farmer. He is also in charge of the Fresno County Farm Bureau in California. "It's an exciting time to be a farmer right now," he said.

Farms and technology companies seem very different from each other. But recent events made them start working together.

In the past five years, many businesses in California did badly. Money and jobs were lost. But farming did well. Businesspeople noticed that farmland went up in price. The prices of farms increased while housing prices fell. People in technology and business now wanted to buy farms.

Also, there were worries that there might not be enough food in the future. California has had little rain for three years now. There are also fears that the climate is changing. The world's population is growing too. People will need much more food in the future. The people working in technology hope to prevent a food shortage.

It became clear that technology and farming could help each other. For example, the company Blue River Technology has created a machine for farmers. The machine can cut lettuce 100 times faster than people.

## Jobs Will Be Lost

These machines can take over the work of humans. Some workers will have to find new jobs. It is one of the problems of technology. As more technology is used in farming, jobs will be lost.

Jorge Heraud started the Blue River Technology company. Technology does the jobs that humans do, he said. There will be jobs lost, but "society generally benefits."
