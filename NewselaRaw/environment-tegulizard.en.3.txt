MIAMI — A tegu can't gobble down a deer or alligator like an 18-foot Burmese python can.

But the four-foot lizard can do a lot more damage to South Florida's wildlife. And now, scientists say, it's too late to wipe the tegu out.

"When we first found out about them in 2008, we thought we had a chance to nip this population in the bud," said Tony Pernas. He works for the National Parks Service. He also co-chairs the Everglades Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area group.

Now, all they can hope for is to limit the tegus' spread.

## Containment Is Urgent, Experts Say

The tegus found in the wild most likely were abandoned by their owners. Although wild reptiles, the lizards have become popular pets. They also may have escaped from breeding centers in south Miami-Dade County.

Wildlife experts are trying to round up as many tegus as possible before October, when the lizards go into hibernation. After that, it will be difficult to find them.

And they're especially worried that the black-and-white tegus will spread to nearby Everglades National Park. A handful of them already have been caught there. The lizards eat just about anything. Their menu includes small animals, birds, insects, plants, and their all-time favorite — eggs. And that means goodbye to the baby American crocodiles that hatch in the refuge and other [endangered animals](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) like the wood rat.

It's hard to keep them from spreading, said Jenny Eckles. She is a wildlife biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Tegus thrive in temperatures as low as 35 degrees and enjoy South Florida's steamy heat, she said. Burmese pythons can't handle the cold, and their numbers were reduced during a cold snap in 2010 which made them less of a problem for the local wildlife.

The lizards hibernate from October until about January or February. They then emerge once again to search for food and lay their eggs. Females can lay 35 eggs a year.

## Tegus Growing In Number

Eckles and other scientists don't know the exact size of the tegu population. But the numbers definitely are on the rise. Pernas said trappers caught 13 tegus in 2009. This summer, researchers captured more than 140 of them. These were found mainly on public lands, according to Eckles. Citizen trappers have taken more than 300 from private lands.

Tegus are easiest to trap using eggs as bait, according to Jake Edwards. He is a wildlife expert hired by the FWC to capture the lizards. Edwards said they are not easy to catch. He may have 10 seconds to catch one before it runs away.

But neither Edwards nor Jeff Fobb recommends grabbing a tegu by hand. Fobb is a trapper who also heads Miami-Dade Fire Rescue's Venom One unit. The tegu has needle-sharp teeth and claws.

"I'd rather get bit by a 10-foot snake than that guy right there," Fobb said. He pointed to a two-footer he recently caught in someone's garage.

South Florida's growing tegu population has spawned a new industry: trappers who sell them as pets.

Rodney Irwin, of Homestead, began trapping tegus for fun and profit about two years ago. He estimates he's taken between 800 and 1,000 tegus. He sells most of them directly to customers on his website www.tegusonly.com. They sell for about $100 each.

## Their Days As Pets Not Numbered

"This is a chance for me to make a difference," he said. "I can't do anything about the apes in Borneo, but I can do something about the natives in my hometown."

Irwin was asked whether he was concerned that the tegus may end up right back in the Everglades abandoned by their owners. Irwin responded that none of his customers are local. In any case, they could buy a tegu in a pet store. He said he shares his information about the captured lizards with scientists.

So far, there are no plans to stop letting people keep tegus as pets, according to Kristen Sommers. She works for the FWC.

Sommers said the FWC is trying to determine whether the tegus might expand farther. It also wants to understand what would happen if they do. Within the next year, the FWC will have enough information to decide its next steps.

"We need to figure out what's going on with this," Sommers said.
