The tallest bird in North America is the whooping crane, but it has one of the smallest populations, with only about 600 left alive. In recent months, their numbers have fallen further still. Three were killed by gunfire, "senselessly" undercutting plans to breed a thriving population of the radiant white bird, wildlife authorities say.

Government and private organizations have spent years of research and millions of dollars to revive the species, whose population shrank to 23 in 1954, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The three cranes died in Kentucky and Louisiana. Their deaths brought the number of intentional killings of the [endangered birds](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) to at least 19 since 2001. That is more than the 13 cranes released into the wild each year on average by conservationists, according to Operation Migration.

"It's a huge loss" of money, of safety for the species, for possible breeding, and emotionally for the teams who have been working with the birds, said Joe Duff. He is Operation Migration's co-founder and chief executive.

## "A Devastating Setback"

On Friday, two cranes were found shot in southwestern Louisiana, state officials said. The 3-year-old female crane died. A 4-year-old male was scheduled to have an operation Sunday morning at Louisiana State University. According to X-rays, he suffered two bone fractures on a wing.

"There is a high risk of infection because the fractures are open, but the bird recovered well," said Ginger Suttner. She's the spokeswoman for the school of animal medicine.

The two were the oldest pair among 33 whooping cranes in Louisiana. The birds had been tagged and were being watched by Louisiana officials. They were expected to produce a chick in a few years.

"It's a devastating setback and such a senseless act," said Robert Love, Department of Wildlife and Fisheries administrator. "Don't shoot big white birds. It's that simple."

The 5-foot-tall birds, who typically live for at least 20 years, almost all died out in the early 20th century. Today's 600 whooping cranes are spread among three main flocks in North America.

In 2011, Louisiana joined programs to revive its native whooping crane population. It was once the nation's largest. Officials said they would offer a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in Friday's shootings.

Three other Louisiana cranes have been killed in the last two years. Two minors were arrested in one case, but whether they were prosecuted is unclear because the juvenile records are sealed.

## Shooters Face Fines, Prison Time

In January, federal wildlife officials in Kentucky announced a $7,200 reward for information about a whooping crane pair believed to be shot together in November. They later increased the sum to  $15,520. One was about 6 years old, the other 4.

The GPS-tracked lifelong mates were found five miles apart, and one was recovered alive. It was put down after efforts to help it heal failed.

Hunters may have confused them for sandhill cranes. Those can be legally killed in Kentucky during certain months.

Whooping cranes are a radiant white, except for black wingtips and a red scalp. The birds were named for their "whooping" threat alarm siren. Their wings would span from former basketball player Yao Ming's head to his toe.

The birds, also known for their dance-like movements, are protected under the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Shooting a whooping crane could lead to a $100,000 fine and a year in federal prison.

A year ago, a 26-year-old South Dakota man pleaded guilty to killing a whooping crane and was sentenced to two years probation and an $85,000 fine.

But experts have said bringing federal charges isn't easy.

In one case, a minor who admitted shooting a whooping crane was charged in Indiana state court and eventually fined $1, a punishment that angered animal rights groups.

## Species On Fragile Legs

Operation Migration's Duff said breeding the birds and teaching them to migrate costs on average $100,000 for each. The instructors wear white suits, so the cranes don't become comfortable around humans. And a small plane leads the birds through the correct flight path. His group relies on private donations.

"These shooters, they are not real hunters," he said. They "just want to destroy something or take their anger out. It's unbelievably selfish."

Whooping cranes face huge challenges because they are big targets, similar to the critically endangered California condor, whose 10-foot wingspan makes it the largest North American bird. Whooping cranes don't reach sexual maturity until they are 4 or 5 years old. They usually have only one chick at a time, and just one in four survives the first year.

"The protection of adults is critical," said Love, the Wildlife and Fisheries administrator. The species is on such fragile legs, "human harm" can really put it at risk of disappearing.

More than half of whooping cranes live in the wild. Most migrate 2,500 miles each winter from their breeding grounds in northern Canada to Aransas National Wildlife Refuge along the Texas coast. A festival is scheduled there for Feb. 20 to celebrate the cranes' arrival.

A few birds die each year during the journey, killed by predators or from crashing into power lines. But the steady number of unnatural deaths angers environmental activists.
