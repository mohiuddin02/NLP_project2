SHANGHAI — Zhang Mei Lian is worried about her 16-year-old son. She is worried that he's falling behind his female classmates in school, and that he isn't athletic enough. She is concerned that he doesn't know how to repair things, such as a broken light. Basically, she fears he doesn't know how to be a man.

"Our current education system is really bad for boys," Zhang said. "Boys should be strong. Otherwise, they are all turning into some kind of feminized boys."

Zhang isn't the only one who's concerned about young Chinese men. Many in China are worried about whether change is leaving boys behind. This is not just a concern here. Boys' falling scores in school have been the subject of several studies in the United States.

"We tend to describe it as the feminization of men or lack of manliness," said Li Wendao who co-wrote a book titled "Save the Boys."

## Structured Studying, No Free Time

Just as in the United States, a big concern is that girls are outperforming boys in school. According to "Save the Boys," Chinese girls outscore boys on college entrance exams. They're also more likely to go to college and are winning more scholarships.

Experts blame the country's education system. It emphasizes memorization. Parents and teachers force even young children to memorize subjects geared toward helping them pass a number of national exams for high school and college.

Outside the classroom, they're forced to take private lessons in different subjects. They study at night, on the weekends and during holidays. Girls, these experts say, are better able to handle such studying. Boys, they argue, need more free time to be wild.

The structured studying leads to behavioral problems.

"There is no question boys here do not know how to act like men," said Mark Kurban, a teacher at a private high school in Shanghai. "Boys tend to be lazier than the girls. They just really want to play basketball the whole time in school, maybe because they did not have a chance to play like boys."

## Boxing And Military Boot Camp

One high school in Shanghai is trying to fix the problem. Last fall, the public Shanghai No. 8 Senior High School began offering experimental classes for boys only. They include wilderness training, using tools, boxing and repairing things. During the summer, students were required to take part in a military boot camp, in which they had to scale walls and jump out of windows.

Lu Qisheng is the headmaster of the school. He said another challenge facing Chinese boys is the country's rule of allowing families to have only one child. It was put in place more than 30 years ago to control the population.

People wanted boy babies more than girls. Families that had male children were often overprotective. They spoiled their single male children so much that these children are called "little emperors." Most boys are raised only by their mothers because their fathers are out working and rarely home. All this results in males who expect special treatment.

"This has weakened their ability to live independently," Lu said.

Some people here blame the popularity of television shows and movies from South Korea. These programs show men as skinny with beautifully delicate features. Some say that is changing notions of masculinity.

"I think Chinese women, especially young women in cities, some of them share this kind of preference," said Song Geng who teaches at the University of Hong Kong.

## Cultural Cross Currents

More men in China are buying beauty products, even makeup.

There are roots for this. In old Chinese plays gentle male scholars — instead of warriors — were the ones who won women's hearts. "The sword-wielding guy never does," said Kam Louie, who wrote a book on the subject.

This idea disappeared in the early part of the 20th century, however. Men were forced to cut their long hair. And then the communists came to power in 1949. Soldiers — or strong men — who could defend their country became the Communist Party's idea of what it means to be male.

But now, Louis said, things are moving back toward a broader idea of what makes a man a man. "There is a traditional background in the Chinese case, which makes the revival easier," he said.

But it still creates problems.

"In the family, women's role is to assist men," said Li Yinhe, one of China's most famous scholars on the differences between men and women. "The Chinese saying is that the man leads and the woman follows."
