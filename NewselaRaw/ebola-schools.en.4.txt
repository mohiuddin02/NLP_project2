FORTH WORTH, Texas â€” Parents in Dallas-area schools are worried. They are concerned that their children could get a deadly disease.

Two weeks ago, Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person in the United States to be diagnosed with Ebola.

The disease has been spreading in West Africa, killing thousands of people. Duncan was from the African country of Liberia. He came to the United States last month.

Duncan infected two nurses who were caring for him. He died in Dallas on Oct. 8.

## A Deadly Disease

Ebola can spread quickly. Some parents are worried about students who came into contact with people who had contact with Duncan.

Some of their worries make sense, but others are not based on truth.

The school districts continued their battle against the virus Friday. Workers cleaned schools and made sure everything was disinfected. They made sure they knew why students were absent. They didn't want sick students coming to school.

They also tried to stop rumors about Ebola.

Parents at Lake Pointe Elementary were told on Wednesday that a student was placed in voluntary isolation. The student was separated from other people to keep others safe. Doctors want to make sure that the student does not have Ebola.

The student's father was on a plane with an infected health care worker.

## School District Does Extra Cleaning

The number of students coming to school has dropped since Wednesday.

"It is the first time it really got real for our community," said Kristin Courtney. She works for the school district. "And our community needed some time to process the information."

Almost half of the school's students were absent on Thursday, Courtney said. Thirty out of 100 students were absent again on Friday. On a normal day, Courtney said that four out of 100 students are absent.

The district did not close any schools. It did do extra cleaning Wednesday night. It cleaned again Thursday morning. The school district already does regular cleanings with products used in hospitals, Courtney said.

Roland Kennedy is the father of a 7-year-old at Lake Pointe Elementary. He said it was difficult to send his son to school. Lake Pointe's communication with parents and cleaning efforts played a role in his decision.

"It reassured me that it is OK," Kennedy said.

## Some Children Treated Unfairly

Chelsea Salas is the mother of a first-grader at Lake Pointe. She and her husband decided to send their daughter to school.

"I just got real nervous. I couldn't sleep. I kept worrying about if we should keep her home," Salas said.

Clay Jenkins is a judge in Dallas County. He has been working to educate the public about Ebola. On Friday, he urged North Texans not to overreact to the threat of Ebola. He said this was especially necessary in the case of children.

He said some hospital workers were being treated unfairly. They told him that their children were being told to stay away from day care.

Jenkins called the hospital workers "hometown heroes." He said that the way they and their children were being treated was not right.

## "Help With Rumor Control"

The head of the Highland Park school district, Dawson Orr, posted a message on the district website. He explained that all schools wouldl be cleaned over the weekend. Cleaning will also be increased during the school day.

The district also said its nursing staff has been specially trained. They know how to find signs of Ebola.

The district also has a section on its website called "Help with rumor control." It talks about what is true about Ebola and what is false.

The Fort Worth school district is also trying to answer rumors, said spokesman Clint Bond. The district had not even had any reported contact with Ebola.

Officials have reinforced rules for their school nurses on how to deal with diseases that can spread quickly, Bond said. They did this just to be safe, he said.
