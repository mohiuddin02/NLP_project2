SOMA, Turkey â€” Over the freshly dug graves of victims of Turkey's worst mining disaster, women sang ballads about their loved ones.

Meanwhile, backhoes dug row upon row of graves and hearses lined up outside the cemetery with even more dead miners.

Rescue teams recovered another eight victims, raising the death toll to 283, with at least 141 people still unaccounted for, according to government figures. Tuesday's disaster has set off protests around Turkey, many of them aimed at Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Blackening his reputation further, one of Erdogan's aides was accused of kicking a protester on the ground.

At a graveyard in the western town of Soma, where coal mining has been the main industry for decades, women wailed loudly in mourning. They swayed and sang songs about their relatives as the bodies were taken from coffins and lowered into their graves. Pictures of the lost relatives were pinned onto the women's clothing.

"The love of my life is gone," some sang, chanting the names of dead miners.

## Prime Minister's Car Attacked

No miner has been brought out alive since dawn on Wednesday from the Soma coal mine where the underground explosion and fire took place. Many mourners said they spent their whole lives fearing something like this would happen.

"The wives of the miners kiss their husbands in the morning. When they come back, even if they are five minutes late, everyone starts calling. You never know what is going to happen," said Gulizar Donmez, the daughter and wife of miners and the neighbor of one of the victims.

Energy Minister Taner Yildiz on Thursday announced that a fire inside the mine was dying down. He offered hope that rescuers would soon be able to speed up their search for those missing.

Erdogan was not welcome during his visit to the area Wednesday. Hundreds of people attacked his car, and he was forced to take refuge at a supermarket after angry crowds called him a murderer and a thief.

Turkish newspapers Cumhuriyet, Milliyet and others on Thursday printed photographs they said were of an Erdogan aide, identified as Yusuf Yerkel, kicking a protester. They show the protester on the ground being held down by special forces police.

An official in the prime minister's office, who would not give his name, said the issue was private. He confirmed there was a scuffle as Erdogan entered a building, but he denied he had thrown a punch.

## Angered By Slow Rescue

Turkish President Abdullah Gul described the events in Soma as "a huge disaster."

During a visit to Soma, he said, "The pain is felt by us all." Angry at what they saw as the slow rescue operation, local residents shouted insulting comments at him, demanding that more should be done to reach possible survivors.

Erdogan appeared tone-deaf to residents' grief, calling the mining accidents "ordinary things" that occur in many other countries. Erdogan gave examples of 19th-century mine accidents in Great Britain.

Erdogan has made no secret of his desire to become Turkey's first popularly elected president. His party swept local elections in March despite a corruption scandal that forced him to fire four government ministers in December and later also implicated him and family members. Erdogan denies corruption, calling the allegations part of a plot to bring his government down.

Protests broke out in Istanbul, Ankara and other cities Wednesday over the deaths and poor safety conditions at mines around the country. In Istanbul, a group chanted anti-government slogans and carried a large banner that read: "It's not an accident, it's murder."

In Istanbul and Izmir, authorities used water cannons and tear gas to break up the protests. Turkey's largest trade union group, representing 800,000 workers, joined a one-day strike to demand better conditions for workers. Miners in Zonguldak, the site of Turkey's worst mining disaster before now, gathered in front of a pit Thursday but did not enter it.

Yildiz, the energy minister, said the search for survivors had been slowed down by a mine fire that engulfed a 650-foot stretch of underground passages. But he said progress had been made on extinguishing it. Rescue operations have been suspended several times as burning coal inside created dangerous toxic fumes for the rescue teams.

## Mines Plagued By Poor Safety

Authorities said Tuesday's disaster was caused by an explosion and a fire at a power distribution unit in the mine. Most deaths were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning.

Yildiz said emergency crews had detected a drop in carbon monoxide levels, which means the fire has gotten smaller.

"God willing, in two or three hours if we are able to extinguish this fire, we will be able to hasten our (rescue) work," he said.

The government has said 787 people were inside the coal mine at the time of Tuesday's explosion, and that 383 were rescued, many with injuries. The explosion tore through the mine Tuesday as workers were preparing for a shift change, which likely raised the casualty toll.

The death toll made it Turkey's worst mining accident.

Mining accidents are common in Turkey, which is plagued by poor safety conditions. Erdogan promised that Tuesday's tragedy would be investigated to its "smallest detail" and that "no negligence will be ignored."

Turkey's Labor and Social Security Ministry said the mine had been inspected five times since 2012. The most recent inspection was in March, when no safety violations were detected. But the country's main opposition party said Erdogan's ruling party had recently voted down a proposal to investigate a series of small-scale accidents at the mines around Soma.
