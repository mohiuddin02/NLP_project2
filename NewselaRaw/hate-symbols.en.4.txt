BERLIN, Germany â€” The Nazis ruled Germany from 1933 until 1945. World War II began after they invaded several countries. Many countries then joined together to fight against the Nazis. Among them were Britain, Russia and the United States. These countries and others were known as the Allies. The Allies finally won the war in 1945. The Nazis lost power.

Right away Nazi flags were taken down all over Germany. Other Nazi symbols were also removed. A symbol is something that stands for something else. For example, the American flag is a symbol of the United States. The most famous Nazi symbol is the swastika.

The Nazis did many terrible things. They killed 6 million Jews. They started a war in which 60 million people died. Most Germans think the Nazis were awful. They do not like to see Nazi symbols. The symbols remind them of the terrible things that happened.

## Children Learn About Nazi Crimes

In Germany most Nazi symbols were destroyed after 1945. In 1949, a law against Nazi symbols was passed. People were no longer allowed to wear or show Nazi symbols.

German schoolchildren learn about the terrible things Nazis did. Germans hope such things will never happen again.

Germany is not the only country where bad things have happened, of course. They have happened in the United States, too.

Slavery is an awful part of U.S. history. Millions of black Americans were kept as slaves. They were owned just like you would own a horse or cow. They were forced to do whatever their master wanted.

## Confederacy Wanted To Keep Slaves

Slavery came to an end after the Civil War. It was fought from 1860 to 1865. The war was between the Northern and Southern states. The Southern states were known as the Confederacy.

The Confederacy was formed by Southern states that broke away from the United States. They separated from the North after the United States outlawed slavery. They wanted to be able to keep on owning slaves.

The Confederate flag was the symbol of the Confederacy.

The difference between the Confederate and the Nazi flag is how citizens treated them. Right after the Nazis lost the war, Germany got rid of its Nazi symbols. The Confederate flag was treated very differently. It can still be seen all over the South. Many people feel the time has come to stop flying the Confederate flag. For them, the Confederate flag is a symbol of hate. In that way, it is just like the Nazi flag.
