WASHINGTON — South Florida's coral reefs are a natural wonder. They are huge and beautiful underwater ecosystems. Thousands of kinds of fish call the reefs home. So do thousands of other kinds of animals and plants.

And the reefs are popular with divers, boaters and fishermen. So they bring in a lot of money to the area — as much as $6 billion. They also help give jobs to a lot of people.

The reefs were formed over thousands of years. They took shape as coral attached themselves to ridges in warm, shallow waters.

But for many years South Florida's reefs have been doing very badly. They have suffered serious damage and disease.

Now, at last, things seem to be getting better.

## No Storms, No Ships Have Hit

Recently, there have been no big storms. And no big ships have run into the reefs. This has allowed reefs to hang on and even grow larger.

And this month, a new study brought more good news: Coral reefs may be able to adjust to warmer sea temperatures. This is important because global warming is making sea temperatures go up.

But, scientists said, reefs can only take so much warming. This means we have to keep water temperatures from getting too high. To do this, greenhouse gases must be kept under control.

Greenhouse gases are causing global temperatures to rise.

Still, the study is raising hopes: Perhaps Florida's reefs won't disappear after all.

Florida is a low-lying state. It sits just above sea level. And it is home to 84 percent of the nation's reefs. This makes it especially threatened by rising sea levels and [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming). It also makes it a perfect place to check on the progress of conservation. Conservation is the protection of animals, plants and natural resources such as water.

There hasn't been a big drop in the coral population, said conservationist Richard Dodge. Staghorn coral is the type most in danger. And, it may actually be increasing in numbers in some places. "So that's the good news."

## Growing, And Transplanting, Coral

"The bad news is: There are still some coral diseases out there. We still worry about bleaching, which appears to be caused by warmer water temperatures," Dodge said. Bleached coral turns white.

"But we are lucky in South Florida to avoid a lot of hurricanes and tropical storms lately," he added. Such storms, Dodge said, can cause terrible damage to reefs.

Reefs have also been helped by improved sewage systems. These prevent polluted water from getting into the ocean. Also, boaters now avoid dropping anchors on the reefs. And they are dropping anchor farther offshore. This has prevented boats from hitting reefs by accident.

Scientists are also trying to help save damaged reefs in another way: They are growing baby corals in indoor nurseries. Once they're grown, these are moved offshore.

The struggle to save reefs is not only about conservation. It is also about jobs and money. This is because they are important for fishing, boating, diving and tourism.

"Without reefs, you don't have fish," said diving shop owner Jeff Torode. "Without fish, you don't have divers, you don't have snorkelers." As a businessman, he added, "it's in my best interest to protect the coral reefs."

"Those beautiful reefs," tourism expert Abraham Pizam said, "should be preserved for generations to come."
