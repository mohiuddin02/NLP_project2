MIAMI — Ernest Williams had stopped asking his family to come see him in prison. The visits left him too sad and hurt, reminding him of his lost freedom.

On a recent Tuesday, though, Williams traded his prison uniform for a gray suit, lavender tie and black shoes. For a few moments, he danced with his three daughters.

For the first time, the government prison system hosted a Daddy-Daughter Dance for prisoners and their daughters. The theme was There's Still Time at the Ball. It reminded prisoners that there is still time to be better fathers.

## There's Still Time

"I haven't seen my girls in months, I could not believe how much they have grown," said Williams. He is serving a 41-month prison sentence for drugs. "I was so happy to see them but so sad that I will not be able to leave with them. I am here instead of being outside with my family because of the choices I made."

The Daddy-Daughter Dance reaches out to families of prisoners. A strong relationship with family helps prisoners when they leave prison. It gives them their best shot at staying out of prison.

The prison system plans to hold dances at other prisons around the country.

"You are a key to the success of your father," Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Charles E. Samuels Jr. told the 20 girls. They were 4 to 18 years old.

## A Fairy-Tale Ballroom

In a prison meeting room transformed into a fairy-tale ballroom, the 13 fathers spent two hours with their girls. The room was decorated with purple ribbons, glitter paper, and a big cardboard cutout carriage — all made by female prisoners. The fathers and their daughters danced and hugged, laughed and cried.

Some of the girls were so young, they only know a father in prison. Others were old enough to remember what life was like when their father was home.

"I haven't been there for so many special moments," said prisoner Michael Rangel. His eyes began tearing up. Rangel has three daughters and has been in prison almost three years for theft. "I talk to them and email them all the time, but it's not the same as being there."

All the men had been convicted of something. For an afternoon, though, they were just fathers spending time with their girls.

## Hoping For Change

"I wanted to dress up to look pretty for my daddy," said Rangel's 15-year-old daughter. Her 13-year-old sister said, "I wanted to make him feel special."

Still, no one could forget that the dance was held in a prison.

Each of the girls walked through metal doors to get into the prison. They had to remove their shoes, jewelry and belts to go through a body scanner.

Walter T. Richardson, a minister with the Miami-Dade Police Department, hoped the dance will change the prisoners. "We want the focus not so much on what happened, what brought them here, but what kind of future they can have. Their daughters are their future."

## "You Want To Do The Right Thing"

After the dance, Anthony Martin, a father of two young girls, sat quietly. One of his daughters was crying, head in her hands.

"She misses me and I love her so much," he said, comforting the 8-year-old. "I was so glad to be able to interact with my girls in a different way."

Martin is serving a 70-month sentence for drug dealing.

"I missed my youngest daughter learning to talk. I missed the 'terrible twos.' I missed the first day of school," he said. "And then something like this happens where you see them all dressed up and looking so pretty. It just makes you want to do the right thing."
