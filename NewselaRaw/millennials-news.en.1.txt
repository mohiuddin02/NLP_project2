NEW YORK — In a world filled with free information, some young people are still willing to pay for the news they read.

A recent poll was taken of U.S. adults ages 18-34, the so-called "millennials." It found that 40 percent of them pay for at least some of the news they read, whether online or in a print newspaper. Another 13 percent do not pay themselves but rely on someone else's subscription.

The new poll was produced by the Media Insight Project. It surveyed 1,045 young adults and was conducted from January 5 through February 2, 2015. The participants were randomly selected and were given online interviews in either English or Spanish.

People worried about the financial health of the news industry found some encouragement in the new poll, but also reasons for concern.

"Forty percent is a strong number but that means the majority are not willing to pay," said journalism professor Keith Herndon. "We have to think of ways of making the content compelling enough that someone would be willing to pay for it."

## New Online Sources Of Income Are Skimpy

Publishers of newspapers and magazines have had to compete with a proliferation of free news online. They also have been hit hard by the development of many new ways for advertisers to reach consumers. In the past, companies relied heavily on paid print ads in newspapers and magazines. Now, advertisers often look to online sites and social media instead. Newspapers' print ad revenue, their primary source of cash, dropped 63 percent between 2003 and 2014.

Paid newspaper circulation has also been steadily declining. In 1984, when paid circulation reached its peak, 63.3 million people bought a newspaper daily. At the time, that number represented one-quarter of the country's total population. Daily paid circulation has now shrunk to 40.4 million, even as the U.S. population has grown by about one-third.

There have been attempts to find new sources of income online, such as digital advertising. In recent years newspaper websites have seen the money they receive — their revenue — from digital ads more than double. However, the total amount earned from digital advertising is still nowhere near enough to make up for lost print ad revenue.

## Advertising Is Still The Source Of Most Newspaper Revenue

Some major news organizations have switched to no longer posting content for free online. They now charge for access to their websites and sell digital-only subscriptions. For example, The New York Times and The Washington Post let non-subscribers click only on a certain number of articles per month before blocking content.

In 2012, The Times' circulation revenue passed its ad revenue for the first time because of this practice. However, newspapers overall still get the majority of their revenue from advertising. Furthermore, other popular news sites, particularly online-only outlets like Huffington Post and BuzzFeed, remain free to all.

The new poll certainly did find some willingness to pay for news, however. A quarter of those surveyed paid for some type of digital news, while 29 percent paid for a print paper or magazine. The poll found that people in their 30s and late 20s are more likely than younger people to pay for print news products. However, there was no difference when it came to online news: People in their 30s are just as likely as those in their late teens and early 20s to pay for online news.

The poll found that many young people are more than willing to spend money on entertainment. Fifty-five percent pay for downloading or streaming movies or TV. Four in 10 pay for cable, which contains channels that show news. Nearly half pay for music, and 46 percent pay for video games or gaming apps. Altogether, nearly 8 in 10 pay for at least one service.

## A Struggle To Connect With Younger Audiences

Young people "have shown they are willing to engage in content that interests them," Herndon said. However, "a lot of traditional news organizations haven't been able to make a connection with younger audiences." Younger people spend more time on their phones than older people do and often find links to individual, free bits of news through Facebook and other social media.

For example, Molly Vazquez, 26, pays $10 a month for music service Spotify but draws the line at paying for news.

"News is pretty readily come by for free. I don't think I should have to pay for it," said Vazquez, who gets her fill from clicking links while combing through Facebook on her phone and from BuzzFeed's app and website. She has also been using Apple's recently launched news app, which contains stories from numerous media outlets, on her iPhone.

Adam Saltz, 27, also uses social media to find news. He clicks on links from Twitter but also follows blogs and reads The New York Times and The Washington Post online. He has access to The New York Times through a parent's subscription. Like half the people of his generation who say they value keeping up with news, he does not pay for it.

However, Saltz said he is not necessarily unwilling to spend money on a subscription to a news source.

"If I didn't have a family member who had one who was willing to share," he said, "I would probably be paying for mine."
