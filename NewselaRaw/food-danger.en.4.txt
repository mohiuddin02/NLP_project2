PHILADELPHIA â€” For the poor, food isn't just hard to find. Often, it's also rotten and full of germs.

A new scientific study looked at the corner stores that feed many poor people in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The study found that such stores offer bacteria-filled foods that are close to spoiling. Eating such foods can cause food poisoning.

When asked about the food, the customers said they agreed with the study.

"Potatoes and baby food are moldy, lettuce is rotten," said 47-year-old Rodney Jenkins. "I ate bad fruit from a corner store and got sick."

Jenkins said he worries about feeding his children such bad food.

"It's horrible," he said. "When we get food up here, it's like we get" the very last leftovers.

For years, people have been trying to get stores in poor neighborhoods to offer healthier food. The goal has been to get more fruits and vegetables.

Now it turns out that may not be enough. In some stores, even fruits and vegetables can be dangerous.

## Study Results Shocked Many People

There is a new study being led by food scientist Jennifer Quinlan.

Quinlan and her team visited nearly 400 corner stores between 2008 and 2010. They were on the lookout for high levels of bacteria, or germs. The scientists tested a range of foods: milk, eggs, lunch meat, sandwiches, fresh fruits and salad greens.

The results of the study were scary.

A lot of the milk they checked had high levels of bacteria, Quinlan said. Fresh vegetables were not easy to find. When they did find vegetables, they found a lot of bacteria on them.

Getting sick from bad food doesn't kill people very often. Still, it can be very unpleasant. Food poisoning usually causes diarrhea and vomiting.

## Eat More, But Eat Safely

Even if spoiled foods don't make a person sick, they still cause problems: They are a waste of money. If a customer buys something spoiled or almost spoiled, they end up having to throw it out.

For example, many corner-store owners don't refrigerate milk quickly enough.

Customers then find that the milk they buy goes bad very quickly. Luckily, the smell of spoiled milk is very strong. One whiff is enough to keep anyone from drinking it, so no one gets sick. Instead, the milk gets thrown away and money is wasted.

In corner stores, Quinlan found a lot of bacteria in such things as bagged salad, strawberries and cucumbers. Quinlan said it showed that the food was close to spoiling. Some or all of it would have to be thrown out. Once again, money is wasted.

Quinlan agrees poor people need to eat more fruits and vegetables. However, she said, if the food is not stored safely, eating it isn't a good idea. "You're not doing them any favors getting them that food," she said.

She added that if fruits and vegetable don't seem fresh, there is a safer choice. She recommends "good frozen, canned and dried food."

But sometimes people do not have a choice. They are forced to eat whatever they can get, safe or not.

Benjamin Chapman is an expert on food safety. For many people, he said, "just getting food" comes first.

"The biggest risk is not eating at all."
