ST. LOUIS — As the game clock counted down to halftime, the McCluer Pommies linked their arms.

Holding their shiny silver and black pom-poms, they said a short prayer. Then Sierra McKenzie, a fourth-year student, told her team, "Remember your stuff. You all know what to do."

The music starts, and their smiles widen. Once they start dancing, everything else is blocked out.

## Seriously Spreading Spirit

The McCluer Pommies take their job of spreading team spirit seriously. The 12 teens go to McCluer High School in Florissant, Missouri. Their town is near Ferguson, where an unarmed African-American teenager named Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer over the summer. Brown's death caused many protests all across Ferguson.

Practices were canceled because of the protests. What happened also hurt their ability to raise money to pay for uniforms, dance camps and other expenses.

But in middle of all of the challenges, there have been victories.

The team has done well. They have won two first places at a recent dance competition against 40 teams from other schools.

"That's a team to watch out for — that's the reputation we want," said longtime coach Rega Wesley-Stewart. "We just keep pushing."

## They Learn Once They Join

Unlike other dance teams, most of the Pommies have never had any formal training, or taken dance classes before. They learn the dance routines once they join the team.

"In many ways, we start from scratch every year," said Wesley-Stewart. She also teaches math at McCluer.

The girls have to try out to earn a spot on the team. They go through interviews and parent meetings. The cost of being a Pommie is not cheap, although the area is far from rich. A new Pommie this year paid nearly $1,000.

## The Mission Is Important

Students say being a Pommie is an honor and a lot of work. The Pommies' other coach, Jackie Allen, says that the girls must be committed to the team and their studies.

"A McCluer Pommie shall provide a spirit-promoting service, be loyal, have high morals and standards," said the team's website. She must "be a good example in and out of school, and develop self-discipline and confidence," it added.

That mission is important, Wesley-Stewart said, especially because of what happened in Ferguson. In November, a grand jury decided that there would be no charges against the police officer in the Brown case. A grand jury is a group of people who listen to a case. They hear from witnesses and look at evidence, or proof, of what happened.

"There are good kids out there and good parents," Wesley-Stewart said.

## Canceled Practices, Fundraisers

In the summer after Brown's death and again after the grand jury decision, protests broke out in Ferguson. Some of the protests were violent. People blocked streets and broke windows.

Because of the violence, the school canceled classes and after-school activities and practices. The girls had to miss practice less than two weeks before a major competition in St. Louis.

A planned fundraiser in December had to be canceled. The girls had trouble selling tickets. People did not feel comfortable going to the area at night because of the violence.

The girls have sold pizza, cups and spirit wear. The team is trying other ideas, such as selling ads on its website, but it has not been easy.

"A lot of people don't have the money," said Victoria Mantia, a high school junior.

## "I Just Want It To Keep Going"

At the basketball game was a former Pommie, Aaries Wadsworth. She goes to the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Wadsworth came to see the team and her former coaches before heading back to school.

"This was everything for me in high school," Wadsworth said. "These are a bunch of really intelligent woman doing something good for themselves and the school."

The girls say they work harder every year and become more confident. Some said Wesley-Stewart helped them get their grades up. Others said the experience also will stay with them after high school.

"I just want it to keep going," said Pommie Jerianna Harden.
