ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. â€” Students at Windsor Elementary School near Chicago do not have to sit still in class. There are exercise machines in their classrooms.

Adam Boesen is 10 years old. One morning, he got on one of the machines. It was not during gym class. Adam got his exercise during silent reading time.

Using the machine helps him pay attention, Adam said. He chose an elliptical machine. The machine lets people move their arms and legs for exercise. Adam moved fast. He read a book at the same time.

Joshua Grzesiak, age 10, is one of Adam's classmates. He said the exercise machines help him concentrate. Joshua said he even finished his homework early one day.

## Trying Out Different Machines

Principal Shelley Fabrizio came up with the idea of bringing in the machines. She looked at different ways to help students get involved with learning. Now, children in kindergarten through fifth grade can bounce and pedal while learning. The machines become "fit workstations."

Fabrizio said kids love to move. "We didn't want to have our students sitting all day long," said Fabrizio. The principal worked with Assistant Principal Virginia Hiltz. They created a program with desks where students stand. There are also bikes that stay still while children pedal. Some desks have the elliptical machines. There is also a rainbow-colored stool. It is called an Ergo chair.

The fit workstations cost about $3,635 each. The school got the money from its Parent Teacher Association (PTA). The students were able to try the machines last spring. They were then asked about the machines so the teachers could see which work stations were most popular.

"Some of the pieces were a huge hit, and others weren't as popular," Hiltz said. The students loved the chance to test them, she said. Many students said they could concentrate more on school while they used the machines, she said. That is exactly what the school wanted to hear.

## And The Most Popular Is ...

Most of the students said the Ergo chairs were a favorite, so the school bought six more chairs. All seemed to be used by happy students during a visit to several classrooms.

Many students need help paying attention in school, Hiltz said. Kids all have different ways to learn, she said. Students can choose whether to use a fit workstation or stay seated at a regular table or desk.

Each classroom started with one desk where students could stand, and the kids and teachers "loved them," Hiltz said. Some teachers even wanted a standing desk. The program grew from there, she said.

Teacher Christina Philo said she was not surprised that her students liked the fit workstations.

They all ran to the elliptical machine, so she made a schedule. Everyone gets a turn before the schedule starts over again.

Standing while learning is important for some students who like to be active, Philo said. The extra active students used to walk around the room and not pay attention, she said. The new fit workstations let the students work where they want, she said.
