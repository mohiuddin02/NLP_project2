Where there's water, there could be life â€” even on Mars.

NASA's Curiosity rover has discovered evidence of a huge lake in Gale Crater on the Red Planet. The lake could have lasted for millions of years. These findings may counter the idea that much of the planet's water reserves were held only in ice or underground, and made only brief appearances on the surface.

The new results come from studying rocks at the base of Mount Sharp. This mountain is 3 miles high and stands in the middle of Gale Crater. The results suggest that there was a lake that filled and drained over tens of millions of years. It could have spanned the 96-mile-wide crater. And the mud deposited in this lake could be what helped form Mount Sharp in the first place.

## Martian Microbes?

"The puzzle pieces are coming together," Michael Meyer said. Meyer is the lead scientist for the U.S. space agency's Mars Exploration Program.

The findings are from the Curiosity rover. The rover is officially known as the Mars Science Laboratory. The findings show that water could have lasted long enough for tiny forms of life called microbes potentially to emerge, the scientists said.

The results could also change other theories of how Mars evolved. After all, if these lakes were able to survive for so long, then Mars must have had a much thicker atmosphere. It would have to, in order to protect that water from escaping into space.

"The climate system must have been loaded with water," Ashwin Vasavada said. "To sustain a lake at Gale Crater for millions of years, Mars would need a vigorous hydrological cycle to keep the atmosphere humid." A hydrological cycle is the way that water moves through a planet's land and sky. Vasavada is Curiosity's deputy project scientist.

The problem is that it's very difficult to generate a realistic model of Martian atmospheric change. It would have to explain how the atmosphere could have been warm enough, not just thick enough, Vasavada said.

## "A Complex Collage"

The researchers looked at rocks that seemed to be forming at strange angles. Those are the kind of rocks you get when fast-moving river water suddenly hits a lake. When it does, it has to slow down. Curiosity spotted these rocks at many different spots on the mountain. That means this cycle probably happened many times through the crater's history, said Curiosity scientist Sanjeev Gupta.

"We believe what we're seeing is multiple cycles of delta migration," Gupta said. They are spread "between river deposits and probably desert dune deposits, creating quite a complex collage of ancient environments."

Curiosity is in its third year on the Red Planet. It was originally sent to study Mount Sharp. The $2.5 billion laboratory-on-wheels landed in August 2012. But it soon took a side route from its target to study a spot called Yellowknife Bay. There, the rover drilled up rocks that revealed signs of a fascinating past. It found that there was once a water-rich environment on Mars that might have been able to sustain life.

Now, the rover is finally studying the base of Mount Sharp. Its layers of rock could hold the key to whether Mars was a much more livable planet than it appears today.
