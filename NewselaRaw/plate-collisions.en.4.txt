LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. â€” Major League Baseball wants to make the game safer. The league wants to stop runners from crashing into catchers. It is planning a new rule against such crashes. The rule could start as soon as next season.

New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson made the announcement Wednesday. Alderson is in charge of the league's rules committee. The main reasons behind the decision was player health and safety. There is more concern over injuries to the brain called [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions). Doctors have learned that concussions can hurt the brain more than people thought before.

The league wants people to stop thinking that such crashes just part of the game. Just because something is a tradition, doesn't mean it's worth doing if it puts players at risk, Alderson said.

Baseball is built upon its traditions.  A ban will be a big step.

## An All-Star Collision

Not everybody liked the change.

"You're not allowed to pitch inside. The hitters wear more armor than the Humvees in Afghanistan," Pete Rose said in a telephone interview. "Now you're not allowed to be safe at home plate? What's the game coming to?"

It seems "the guys making all these rules never played the game of baseball," Rose added. He was banned from baseball for life following a gambling investigation.

Rose famously knocked over catcher Ray Fosse in the 1970 All-Star game. Rose insists Fosse was breaking the rules. He says Fosse was blocking the plate without the ball.

Alderson said team owners will get the chance to approve the rules next month.

## Broken Bones And Concussions

The players' union will also need to approve the rule before it can start. The union is the group that represents the players. If the union approves, the rule will go into effect next year. If the union doesn't, it will become effective the next year.

The union did not want to comment while the rule is being reviewed.

Talk about banning home plate crashes has gotten more serious lately. In May 2011, San Francisco Giant Buster Posey was injured by Florida Marlin Scott Cousins. Posey broke a bone in his lower left leg and badly injured his ankle. The crash ended his season.

Besides broken bones, there's also worry about concussions. Alderson said it's a problem not just in professional baseball.

The National Football League agreed to pay $765 million to former players last summer. The players took the league to court. They claimed the concussions they got while playing caused them serious, long-lasting health problems. Last month, a group of hockey players sued the NHL.

## Runner Could Be Called Out

Former catchers Joe Girardi, Bruce Bochy and Mike Matheny attended Wednesday's meeting. All three of them now manage major league teams.

"I lost time as a catcher being run over a couple different times, but I thought it was part of my job and I enjoyed the contact," said Girardi, the New York Yankees manager. "Now I'm not so sure that everyone enjoys contact. But I love football, so I liked it."

MLB plans to have different levels of punishment for breaking the rule.

Runners could be called out if they run over a catcher on purpose, Alderson said. Some punishments may happen off the field, he added. Some players may be forced to pay a fine. They may also be suspended from play.

But writing out the rules will likely be complicated.

"Does it include at every base or just home plate?" Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter asked. "What's considered blocking the plate?" he asked. How do you define all of it?"
