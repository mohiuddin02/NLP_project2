BOSTON, Mass. — There used to be no friendly words between the governments of the United States and Cuba. But as the relationship improves, colleges in both countries are forming partnerships. Doing so was once heavily restricted.

Americans for many years were not allowed to travel to Cuba. In the few months since the United States has moved toward getting rid of strict travel restrictions, several colleges have made agreements with Cuban schools. They have created exchange programs for students and teachers. More American colleges are planning study trips to Cuba. Both sides are exploring research projects.

Many people from both countries will begin to work together, said Mauro Guillen. He works at the University of Pennsylvania's business school.

Auburn University in Alabama agreed to partner with a university in Havana, Cuba's capital. They will have a new five-year exchange program. The University of the District of Columbia and the University of California at Fullerton also made deals with Cuban schools.

Leaders at Florida International University are making plans to open at least one school in Cuba.

## Changes Are Encouraging

Under previous travel rules — since the 1960s — some colleges had been granted permission to launch academic trips to Cuba. However, college officials said the process was difficult. Even those who applied often were denied.

Yet President Obama eased those rules this year. Tourism is still forbidden, but the new rules make it easier to travel for educational purposes.

The changes have encouraged many people to rush to form new academic ties, said Bruce Magid. He is the dean, or leader, of the Brandeis International Business School in Massachusetts.

"I think it's going to be significantly easier to plan trips," Magid said. He has led several visits to Cuba in recent years.

## Exploring Education And Business

People in many different fields are interested in Cuba. However, business schools in particular have been quick to build relationships with Cuba. They want to study how business is growing there and what its jobs are like. They also want to explore it as a possible place to do business if U.S. trade restrictions are lifted. Right now, Cuba is still not allowed to trade with the United States.

Guillen said that a lot of his students want to go to Cuba. They see themselves doing business there in the future. Guillen has led student trips to Cuba.

For many U.S. colleges, Cuba is also a place to look for new students.

There are still difficulties in the process. However, admissions offices already are drafting plans to attract Cuban students, just like they do from Europe or South America.

## High Educational Standards

The Educational Testing Service gives the graduate record exam. It is a standardized test that students take when they apply to postgraduate courses in the United States. The Educational Testing Service recently announced that it will begin testing in Cuba. This could allow Cuban college graduates to apply for graduate school in the United States.

"Cuba has probably the highest educational standards in all of Latin America," Guillen said. "They have a relatively well-educated population and it would be wonderful to attract those students to the United States in big numbers."

Restrictions on money in Cuba would cause most students to rely on financial aid from U.S. schools. Still, Cuban students are interested.

"Here we take two years of English, so in terms of the language I think we are well-prepared," said Omar Concepcion, a student at the University of Havana.

Colleges acknowledged that they would have to provide financial aid to Cuban students that they accept.

## Lots Of Catching Up To Do

Even though there has been progress, some experts do not want to begin having academic exchange between the two countries. In many ways, there is still a wide gap between them, said Jorge Duany, an expert on Cuba at Florida International University.

The U.S. trade restriction prohibits most activity, Duany said, and could block professors from presenting or selling their scholarly works. He added that in Cuba, the government keeps a tight grip on universities and their scholars.

"U.S. academics are used to speaking their minds on any topic that they can think of, and usually nothing happens," Duany said. "Cuba's a different society."

Cuba is a bit behind in some ways, and this may be a difficulty, Guillen said. It is still rare to have Internet service there. Still, Guillen is confident that new relationships between colleges will play a part in helping the countries become closer.

"Educational collaboration and exchange" will happen because of the opening, Guillen said, "but it will also contribute to deepening and accelerating the opening."
