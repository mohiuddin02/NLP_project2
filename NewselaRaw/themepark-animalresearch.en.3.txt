Zoos let people see animals from far away places. Animals come there from the plains of Africa and the jungles of the Amazon. Housing so many wild animals in one place is not easy, though. The scientists and zoologists that work at animal theme parks are always busy. Now visitors can see the work they do behind the scenes.

Rafiki's Planet Watch is a wildlife education center at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida. Visitors can watch scientists working in labs.

At SeaWorld in Florida, scientists studied how dolphins and whales swim. They wanted to learn more about how to make robots work underwater. The sea creatures can help humans understand how to do different things underwater.

## Helping Animals Stay Healthy, Happy

Most people go to theme parks to see the animals. They want to have a good time. They do not know about the important work going on. In fact, many of the workers at Disney's Animal Kingdom are trained scientists.

The work they do is important for learning about how to care for animals in theme parks as well as in the wild, says Jackie Ogden. She works for Disney.

Scientists working at theme parks try to make sure the animals are healthy and happy. Many of them care about animals. In their time off from work, some Disney workers help with animal protection.

Disney scientist Shana Lavin also works with the Jane Goodall Institute. It is a wildlife protection group. Lavin is studying a colorful type of African monkey called the mandrill. For the first time, these monkeys are being released back into the wild. Lavin is interested in learning how the animals feel when this happens. Such an experience could be very hard for an animal. Many are used to living in a zoo.

## Disney Is Well Respected

Anne Savage works for Disney, too. She leads their animal protection group. Right now she is trying to protect another endangered monkey called the cotton-top tamarin. These small monkeys are difficult to count. At Disney, Savage worked on a new way to count them in the wild.

Disney has also done studies on sea turtles. It has even done work on purple martin birds. The martins nest at Disney World.

Alan Bolten is the head of a group that studies sea turtles in Florida. He says Disney is "really respected." Scientists and animal rights groups support what they do.

## Critics Say Some Theme Parks Only Care About Money

Not everyone agrees that animal theme parks protect animals. Some animal rights groups argue that some animal theme parks only care about money. Kathy Guillermo works with an animal protection group. She thinks it is not fair to keep animals caged up for profit.

Not all animal theme parks are the same, though. Animal rights groups think SeaWorld does more harm to animals than some other companies. Animal rights groups like Disney. They say Disney's programs help animals in the wild.

SeaWorld thinks the animal rights groups are wrong. The company says its work helps its animals and those in the wild. SeaWorld says it studies the needs of its animals.
