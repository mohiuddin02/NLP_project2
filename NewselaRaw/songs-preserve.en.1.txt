WASHINGTON — One of the most widely broadcast songs of the 20th century, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me," has been selected for preservation at the Library of Congress. Also selected were recordings from Joan Baez, The Righteous Brothers, Steve Martin and Radiohead.

Twenty-five sound recordings spanning the years 1890 to 1999 were added Wednesday to the library's National Recording Registry. Each year the library chooses recordings that are "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."

## Comedy Is Archive-Worthy Too

Among the unforgettable tunes being archived are Johnny Mercer's "Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive" from 1944 and The Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'." Also picked were folksinger Joan Baez's first solo album and Steve Martin's "A Wild and Crazy Guy" comedy album. Martin's record broke new ground in the 1970s by leaving formulaic jokes and punchlines behind in favor of less predictable humor.

Upon hearing that his record has been declared archive-worthy, Martin deadpanned: "I could not be more proud of this honor — this means the record was probably funny."

The Library of Congress has been seeking to preserve important sound recordings for 15 years under terms of a preservation law passed by Congress.

In the 1960s, King originally intended his song "Stand by Me" for his former group, the Drifters, but he ended up recording it himself. The song is anchored by one of the best-known bass lines in history, curators said. A few years later, The Righteous Brothers recorded "Lovin' Feelin'." They thought the song was wrong for them at first, but ended up with a hit.

## Sounds Of The 1890s To Today

The oldest recordings being saved are a group of 600 wax cylinders stored at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Wax cylinders were played on phonographs, which came before record players. The wax cylinders to be preserved were recorded by average Americans in the 1890s, 1900s and 1910s as snapshots of everyday life. Wax cylinders are among the most endangered audio formats because their grooves are fragile and the wax decomposes over time. Another set of wax-cylinder recordings from the 1893 Chicago World's Fair captured sounds of musicians from around the world performing at the fair, giving Americans their first exposure to "world music."

Other historic recordings chosen for preservation include radio coverage of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's funeral in 1945 and the 1953 theatrical recording of "John Brown's Body." Based on a Civil War poem, "John Brown's Body" proved to be commercially successful as a non-musical play.

Curators also decided that some more recent recordings were worthy of preservation, including tunes from TV's "Sesame Street." The children's show used music as a core part of its educational program and drew stars ranging from B.B. King to R.E.M. and the Dixie Chicks. The library chose the 1995 recording "Sesame Street: All-Time Platinum Favorites" for the registry.

## "OK Computer" Has The Last Word

Public nominations over several years brought Radiohead's 1997 album "OK Computer" to the curators' attention. The album centers on our modern technological age and portrays it as characterized by corrupt politicians, psychopaths, consumerism and airline disasters.

"I sort of see it as part of a certain ongoing phenomenon in rock music that maybe begins with the Velvet Underground but also The Doors, who are on the registry this year. Pop music is not entirely positive in its outlook, shall we say," curator Matt Barton said. "I think we can say that 'OK Computer' really sums a lot of that up."
