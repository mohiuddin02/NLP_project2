PARIS, France â€” Bacon, hot dogs and bologna taste good. Unfortunately, they can be very bad for your health. The World Health Organization (WHO) said eating such meats can cause cancer. That is what scientists who work for WHO said in a report, based on their study of processed meat like bacon and the link to cancer.

The WHO is part of the United Nations. It is a group whose members are countries that work to solve the world's problems.

Cancer is a terrible disease that kills millions every year. It causes cells to grow wildly inside the body. Those cells can create lumps. Such lumps can spread throughout the body.

## From Bacon To Beef Jerky
The WHO scientists looked at two kinds of meat. One is known as processed meat. The other is called red meat.

Processed meat is meat that is preserved to keep it from going bad. It also has flavors or colors added to it. Meat makers often use chemicals to preserve and flavor processed meats. Such chemicals are not natural. They are made by food scientists.

Bacon, hot dogs and bologna are all processed meats. Sausages and beef jerky are, too. Anything smoked is as well.

Red meat is meat that has not been processed. It includes beef, pork and lamb.

Chicken and fish are not red meats. Many doctors say chicken and fish are healthier.

## Processed Meat And Colon Cancer
The new WHO report says processed meat is definitely linked to cancer. In particular, it can cause cancer of the colon. The colon is also called the large intestine. The colon helps the body digest or break down food.

The WHO said red meat probably can cause cancer, too. So far, there is not enough proof of that, however.

Doctors have thought for years that eating certain types of meat could cause cancer. The new WHO report proves they were right. It is the biggest study yet on the link between meat and cancer.

## Danger In One Hot Dog A Day
The report puts processed meat in the same danger group as smoking. However, that does not mean that processed meats are as bad as cigarettes. It only means there is a proven link to cancer.

Eating one hot dog a day is enough to raise your chances of getting cancer. Eating several pieces of bologna a day is also enough to increase your risk of getting cancer. The more processed meat a person eats, the greater the danger of getting the disease.

Still, processed meats are much less dangerous than cigarettes. Smoking three cigarettes a day is far worse than eating three pieces of bologna a day. It is around 27 times more likely to give you cancer.

Even so, the dangers of processed meat are real. Every year around 34,000 people die of cancers linked to eating a lot of processed meat.

## Chemicals Are The Culprits
The most dangerous thing about processed meat may be the added chemicals. Doctors have worried about such chemicals for years.

Dr. Kurt Straif worked on the WHO report. The chance of getting cancer from eating processed meat is small, he said. However, the more of it you eat, the greater the danger.

Most doctors are happy about the new WHO report.

## Meat Companies Are Mad
Meat companies are not happy. Many are very angry about the WHO report.

The North American Meat Institute represents U.S. meat companies. It has begun to fight back.

Cancer has many causes, the North American Meat Institute said.

Cancer is "not caused by single foods," the meat institute said.

## A Food Scientist's Point Of View
Food scientist Gunter Kuhnle accepts the WHO's findings. However, he thinks people should not become overly worried.

Processed meats are nowhere near as bad as some other things, like cigarettes, he said. Eating a little bit is probably not too dangerous.

Kuhnle thinks the new findings are very important. However, they should not be used to alarm or frighten people, he said.
