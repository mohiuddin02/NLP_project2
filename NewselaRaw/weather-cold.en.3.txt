CHICAGO â€” A weather condition called a "polar vortex" was forecast to bring below-zero temperatures to much of the nation. It was expected to be colder than it has been in years.

Snow-covered roads, high winds and ice already made driving dangerous Sunday from the Dakotas to Missouri to Delaware.

School was called off Monday for the entire state of Minnesota. Cities in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana also canceled classes.

A polar vortex is a pool of cold, dense air. It will affect more than half of the country Sunday through Tuesday. Warnings about the cold stretched from Montana to Alabama. The forecast was startling: 25 degrees Fahrenheit below zero in Fargo, N.D., minus 31 in International Falls, Minn., and 15 below in Indianapolis and Chicago. Some places could see record-breaking low temperatures.

## Frostbite And Hypothermia

"It's just a dangerous cold," said Butch Dye of the National Weather Service.

Several states in the Midwest were getting up to a foot of new snow. People shoveled out and stocked up on groceries before bitterly cold temperatures set in overnight.

In Chicago, temperatures were expected to hit around minus 15, Ed Fenelon of the National Weather Service said. Temperatures were likely to set a daily record, he said. Earlier Sunday, the National Weather Service reported temperatures in the 20-below range in Minnesota and North Dakota.

It hasn't been this cold for almost 20 years in many parts of the country. Because of that, medical experts were reminding people that frostbite and hypothermia can happen quickly at 15 to 30 below zero. They warned people to dress in layers, hats and gloves. Hypothermia is a dangerous medical condition. It happens when your body looses heat faster than it can replace the heat, according to the Mayo Clinic.

In St. Louis, grocery stores sold out of the essentials before Sunday's bad weather.

"The problem is the bread is sold out. We're out of milk. We sold out of chips, chicken wings, some meats," Issa Arar of Salama Supermarket said.

People in Michigan also jammed stores to stock up on supplies.

"I made my husband go grocery shopping last night," said Kim Tarnopol of the Detroit suburb of Huntington Woods. Tarnopol was picking up cold medicine Sunday for her daughter Emma.

## Deep Freeze In Deep South

Travel problems started early Sunday. In New York City, a plane slid into snow on a taxiway. No one was hurt. But the airport temporarily suspended operations because of icy runways.

About 1,200 flights had been canceled Sunday in Chicago, officials said. Flights were also canceled in Boston and Tennessee.

Roads in the Midwest were particularly dangerous. Indiana State Police said Interstate 70 in the western part of the state was snow-covered. Officials in Missouri warned it was too cold for rock salt to work very well.

Southern states were bracing for possible record temperatures, too. Single-digit highs were expected Tuesday in Georgia and Alabama.

In western Kentucky,  farmer David Nickell moved extra hay to the field. He also moved his animals out of the wind. The instructor at West Kentucky Community and Technical College had also stocked up on batteries and gas and loaded up the pantry and freezer. The 2009 ice storm that paralyzed the state was fresh in his mind.

He compared the ice storm with living in the 1800s. "Personally, I thought the ice storm should become an annual event. It definitely taught people to be prepared and appreciate normalcy.

## Cold Kickoff In Green Bay

The cold wasn't threatening the citrus at Stella Plantation in Louisiana. But manager Hugh French had hoped to harvest navel oranges through January.

"We pick our A-1 fruit first," he said. What's left is not the best looking fruit. "But it still tastes good," he said.

The season for satsumas, a sweet mandarin orange and a big part of Louisiana's citrus crop, was already over. And the plantation only has a few grapefruit trees.

"We're toward the end of the season now," he said. Any losses will not be that bad, he said.

In Green Bay, Wis., it was 5 degrees at kickoff Sunday afternoon inside Lambeau Field. The Green Bay Packers played the San Francisco 49ers in a sold-out playoff game. It was one of the coldest ever played.

"We suited up, we brought all the snowboarding gear we use ... and added to it," said 49ers fan Jeff Giardinelli of Fresno, Calif. "Without the wind, which isn't here yet, we're good. When it gets windy, we'll be ready for it."

The 49ers beat the Packers 23-20.
