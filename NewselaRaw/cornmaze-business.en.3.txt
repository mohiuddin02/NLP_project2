SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Dave Vierra started small. He planted his first corn maze 12 years ago. It was meant to be a sideshow to his popular pumpkin patch in West Sacramento. The maze covered just half an acre.

But just like field corn, it quickly grew — and grew. Now, Dave's Pumpkin Patch and Cornival has two corn mazes. The larger one is 10 acres and the other 2-acre maze is "haunted" for weekend tours. Zombies and other characters provide fright-filled fun.

There's more to do at Vierra Farms than just navigate through mazes. Kids can jump on a 40-by-60-foot air-filled pillow, and climb hay bales. They can play in a giant "corn box." It's the same idea as a sandbox, only this one's filled with dried corn. The Cornival also offers a "Pumpkin Princess Castle," pig races, pony and hay rides. Pumpkin chuckin' cannons shoot gourds 1,500 feet into the air throughout the day.

"It's all the stuff we used to do as kids," said Vierra, a lifelong farmer. "As a kid, you walked into the cornfield at night and a friend would jump out to try and scare you. You'd jump into a pile of straw or climb on top of haystacks; who doesn't like that? It's all about fun activities involving farming."

## Big Bucks In Mazes

Agritainment — turning agriculture into entertainment for non-farming folks — has taken over small family farms in a big way. Few activities are more popular than corn mazes. The attraction also brings in big money.

Family farms are struggling right now, says Kamille Combs. She works for The MAiZE Inc., which creates hundreds of mazes nationwide each Halloween season. The company built the mazes at Dave's Pumpkin Patch, too.

Combs says most of the people she works with are family farmers. They have lived on their land for years. They're trying to make money, so they don't lose the land. Still, putting time and money into building a corn maze can be risky. They are a lot of work to build. Plus, there's no guarantee of profit.

Still, the corn-maze craze has produced businesses whose sole purpose is to build and operate mazes. Utah-based MAiZE leads that list. The company has built more than 2,000 mazes. MAiZE negotiates prices with each farm. Vierra Farms paid "under $2,000" for its two mazes. The total includes $595 for cutting.

"We'll do more than 250 (mazes) this year," Combs said. "Every year, we've seen more and more mazes springing up."

## Designed On Computers

Corn mazes may seem like old-fashioned entertainment, but they've gone decidedly high-tech. Mazes are designed on a computer, using the corn rows like straight lines on a graph. A GPS is used to map out the trails. The paths are mowed when the corn is ankle high.

Vierra expects about 30,000 visitors to his farm by Halloween night. But over the years, competition has grown more fierce. Farm owners have had to up the "wow factor" with their maze designs.

"When I started, we were the only corn maze around here," said Vierra. He opened his pumpkin patch business 23 years ago. "Now, there are corn mazes all over the place."

The Halloween corn maze is an all-American experience. It first surfaced in the early 1990s, according to Corn Mazes America, a business that helps farms make mazes. By 2008, more than 800 mazes nationwide had become yearly traditions. This year's count will top 1,000. Many are found in the Northeast and Great Lakes states.

Most mazes are between 4 and 10 acres. A football field measures about 1.3 acres. The world's largest maze is located in Dixon, Calif. Cool Patch Pumpkins' corn maze is 53-acres. The Guinness Book of World Records officially crowned it the king of all mazes in 2007.

"Thousands have braved the maze over the past few years," said co-owner Mark Cooley. "We continue to try and outdo ourselves each season to keep it challenging for our guests."

## A Zip-Line Over The Corn

At Dave's Pumpkin Patch, customers expect more every year, Vierra said. This season, he installed a new zip-line attraction over the corn. There's also a free photo booth. Visitors can snap photos and immediately post them to Facebook.

"People always want something new," Vierra said. "You've got to keep it fresh. It's like Disneyland always adding rides and attractions. If you stay the same, it can get stale and there's no reason to come back."

Maze builders use slow-maturing field corn. This way the stalks stay green as long as possible. After Halloween, the crop becomes cattle feed. MAiZE experts estimate farms can make $5,000 to $50,000 from an average maze, depending on location. By comparison, an acre of field corn sells for less than $1,000. The corn costs about $500 to plant.

Mazes come with extra costs. Farmers must buy insurance just in case someone gets hurt. They hire security guards to ensure their visitors' safety. These measures can add thousands to the final price. But farmers view the corn maze as another crop with an added interest: fun.

"I plant my corn Aug. 13," said Vierra, who also grows tons of Halloween pumpkins found in local supermarkets and several other crops. "In 60 days, it's 8 feet tall. That's perfect for a maze."
