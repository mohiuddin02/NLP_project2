ORLANDO, Fla. —  A snake rested on the back of Valerie Lantigua's neck. She sat, quietly working on her laptop. It did not bother her. Valerie was in class at Colonial High School.

Timothy App teaches Valerie's class. The class is part of a Veterinary Animal Science and Services program. The students learn about all kinds of animals and how to take care of them.

Other schools in the Orange County school district in Florida have programs like this, too. Danny Garner works for the schools. His job is to set up agriscience classes. The classes teach the science of agriculture, such as how to run a farm and take care of animals.

## Few Folks Become Farmers Now

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is part of the government. It studies farming. It said that the number of Americans who work in agriculture has shrunk greatly. In 1900, almost half of all people worked in agriculture. Today, it is less than 2 out of every 100 people. 

Not many kids today want to be farmers. Still, these classes can be helpful to students. They learn public speaking, debating and critical thinking. They are skills students will need for any job.

Garner said that every student can learn something from the agriscience program. Teachers in the Orange County school district say that studying agriscience can help students prepare for many different jobs. They can become veterinarians, scientists or experts in food nutrition. 

## Learning About Jobs In High School

App believes that students should learn about different jobs in high school. "I want them to find out what they want to do before they go to college," App said.

Many students come to the schools in Orange County because of the agriscience program. Some of them live far away, but want to learn to be veterinarians. 

App said he teaches about all kinds of animals, but the kids really like snakes. He keeps snakes in glass tanks in the classroom. 

His classroom used to have chinchillas, but the noise from students was not good for the animals. Snakes are a better fit for a busy school.

The class has larger animals outside. Behind the school, a couple of large tortoises are in a pen. Dozens of chickens are kept in a coop. Three sheep waited to be fed in a covered area.

## Kids Arrive Early To Feed Animals

Most of App's students live in homes with small yards and apartments. They do not have room for farm animals. App lets his most serious students keep farm animals near the school. Families have to buy the animals with their own money. 

Students get to school before the first class starts to feed the goats. Students also have to take care of the animals on weekends and over school breaks.

One of the sheep that lives at Colonial High belongs to Valerie. She is raising the animal for a school project.

It takes Valerie 45 minutes to get to school. The extra time in the car is worth it, she said, because it's good preparation for veterinary school.

"There would be no means for me to raise these animals if it weren't for this program," she said.
