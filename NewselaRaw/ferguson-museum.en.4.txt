ST. LOUIS â€” A museum in Missouri is trying to gather pictures and objects from protests in Ferguson.

The Missouri History Museum wants to show what happened after the shooting death of Michael Brown in August. The 18-year-old Brown was an African-American. He was shot by a white officer of the Ferguson police.

Some images are famous. They are already part of Missouri history. They include street-artist paintings on boards protecting store windows and signs that say "Hands Up. Don't Shoot."

The St. Louis museum is not just gathering objects. It is also collecting messages sent on Facebook and Twitter. It is even collecting cellphone videos. The museum is also asking for protesters, people who live in the area and the police to tell their stories. These are called oral histories.

## Collecting For The Future

The shooting was followed by protests and fighting. Buildings were damaged. Groups of people stole from businesses. Police and minority groups did not trust each other. The museum wants to show people in the future what was seen during the protests. It wants future generations to understand what people thought as everything happened.

The items will be kept so people can study them. The goal is to collect history as it happens.

"This is a rare example of being at a point where history is made all around you," said Chris Gordon. He works for the museum.

The museum has regular exhibits. It also has a public library. The library holds documents, objects and writings from events more than 200 years ago.

## Protests Grew Larger

On Aug. 9, Brown had a run-in with a police Officer Darren Wilson. Brown was unarmed. Wilson fatally shot him. Some witnesses said Brown was trying to surrender. Wilson said Brown was threatening his life.

A day after the shooting, protesters flooded the streets near where it happened. Several businesses were damaged.

Anger grew in the community for months. It got worse on Nov. 24. That is when a grand jury decided not to indict, or charge, Wilson with a crime. Furious protesters gathered in the streets. It led to people across the country demonstrating against police hurting people. Some protests became violent. A dozen businesses around Ferguson were burned down.

TV news crews brought cameras to report on the protests. The videos they took of police going up against angry protesters were seen around the world.

## Save Them For Later

Gordon said the museum has already collected T-shirts, protest signs and buttons. Photos have been taken of a memorial for Brown. The museum is trying to get street art before it is painted over.

On a chilly morning, Carol Snyder of Pennsylvania walked along South Florissant Road. She was snapping photos of the street art.

"I do hope for a brighter future," she said. "I do hope for peace for the people here in Ferguson and throughout the United States."

Some objects have been hard for Gordon to collect. He cannot find a used tear gas can or rubber bullet. Police used them when the protests became violent. Gordon also wants buttons, T-shirts and signs showing support for Wilson. They are hard to find because there were not many demonstrations in the officer's favor.

It is unknown if what is being collected will ever be put on display at the museum. The real goal is save them so people can study them later.

"Our hope is to preserve this for future generations so they can get a clearer picture of what actually happened," Gordon said.
