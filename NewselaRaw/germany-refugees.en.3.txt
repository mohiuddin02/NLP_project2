TROEGLITZ, Germany â€” Some people in the town of Troeglitz, Germany, do not want people fleeing from wars in other countries, or refugees, coming there to live. These people are called "neo-Nazis," because they are said to be acting like the Germans who ran the country in World War II. Neo-Nazis scared the mayor into quitting his job this year. They also burned down a shelter for refugees. The events happened 70 years after Allied bombers reduced much of the thousand-year-old village to rubble.

Local historians and refugee supporters think this is a strange twist. They note that in 1944, bombers fighting on the side of the United States and Russia bombed the village. The people who crawled from the rubble 70 years ago received an enormous amount of help to put their lives back together. That help came from the United States and Russia. People in those countries had every right to see the people living in Nazi Germany as the worst people ever.

But the aid came. It helped locals rebuild their lives.

## Anti-Refugee Marches And A Fire

Now, thousands of would-be refugees, fleeing wars in the Middle East and Africa, are boarding boats to reach Europe. But many Europeans aren't welcoming them, even as hundreds die trying to get here.

Like many smaller German communities, Troeglitz was under instructions to prepare to host a few dozen war refugees. But the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), a political party, started protesting. The NPD are seen as neo-Nazis and are trying to influence the German government. They began organizing anti-refugee marches in several places, and the crowds grew.

In March, the mayor of Troeglitz, Markus Nierth, quit. He said he'd been receiving threats that made continuing in his job impossible.

Then on April 4, the building being fixed up to house the refugees was destroyed by fire. Police quickly decided that the fire was set on purpose and blamed supporters of the NPD.

## Pro-Refugee Supporters Outnumbered

Matthias Keilholz started a group to support refugees. He found the problems in the town saddening.

At the end of that World War II, one in five people who lived in Troeglitz were considered to be refugees, he said. "And yet now, when others need this same help, many here not only turn their backs, but threaten others who offer help."

Of course, it's not just in Troeglitz where there's opposition to incoming refugees.

Political parties in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom are against the refugees. This opposition has attracted supporters to the political parties.

"We have a pro-refugee community here," Keilholz said. "But the truth is right now the NPD has more supporters."

The anger comes in spite of the fact that local businesses have been very positive about the benefits of a group of new workers coming to the area. Many young people have left the town for jobs in big cities, so businesses there need new workers. At meetings, a few locals note the risks and costs of the journey to Europe. They say this shows that the refugees are both courageous and come from families that had money, and therefore education.

## Too Many "Want To Forget" WWII

Lothar Czossek is a local historian. He fears that the burning of the shelter and the threats that frightened the mayor from office show a dangerous problem.

"Too many Germans are saying enough is enough, and they want to forget our shared history," he said. "The ignorance of this history is alarming" given that the area had a labor camp where people were killed by Nazis during World War II.
