WASHINGTON — This year marks the 100th anniversary of the massacre of more than 1 million Armenians at the hands of Ottoman Turks. On Friday, President Barack Obama will give a speech memorializing those who died. However, he will not use the word "genocide" to describe the killings, the White House has announced. The word implies the deliberate and planned killing of a large group of people primarily because of their ethnicity or nationality.

The decision not to use the word backs down from a previous Obama pledge and sparked anger from activists.

"The president's surrender represents a national disgrace," said Aram S. Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America, located in Washington, D.C. "It is a betrayal of the truth, and it is a betrayal of trust."

White House officials defended the decision, saying it was necessary to preserve the chance of cooperation with Turkey on Middle Eastern conflicts.

## The Foreign Policy Stance

The Turkish government has said that the mass killings do not meet the legal definition of genocide. Some members of Congress have also warned that an official shift toward using the word could hurt American foreign policy.

California has the country's largest population of people of Armenian descent, with more than 200,000 living in Los Angeles County alone.

California Representative Adam B. Schiff has led efforts in Congress to recognize the genocide. Schiff said he was "deeply disappointed" by the decision.

"How long must the victims and their families wait before our nation has the courage to confront Turkey with the truth about the murderous past of the Ottoman Empire? If not this president, who spoke so eloquently and passionately about recognition in the past, whom? If not after 100 years, when?" he said in a statement.

## No Offense

National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan released a statement saying the United States would use the anniversary of the onset of the massacres to "urge a full, frank and just acknowledgment of the facts that we believe is in the interest of all parties." The statement did not use the word "genocide."

A senior U.S. administration official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, said Obama will mark "the historical significance" of the "Meds Yeghern," as the massacres are known in Armenian.

"We know and respect that there are some who are hoping to hear different language this year. We understand" their point of view, the official said.

However, the official added, "the approach we have taken in previous years remains the right one — both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present." The United States hopes for cooperation from Turkey, particularly in confronting the civil war in Syria, and thus seeks to avoid offending its government.

## Ottoman Empire's Collapse

White House national security adviser Susan Rice met Tuesday afternoon with Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. She urged him "to take concrete steps to improve relations with Armenia" and to encourage "an open and frank dialogue in Turkey about the atrocities of 1915."

The United States will send a delegation to Armenia this week, led by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.

The delegation will also include California Representative Jackie Speier, who said in a statement, "I intend to call it what it was — I will call it a genocide everywhere I go."

Roughly 1.5 million Armenians were killed starting in 1915 amid the chaotic collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

Whether to use the word "genocide" to describe those killings has been a tricky and emotional political issue for years. Turkish officials base their argument that the killings do not meet the definition of genocide on the claim that no intentional plan to eliminate Armenian populations was involved. Most historians, however, have concluded that the use of the word is appropriate.

U.S. administrations in the past have resisted using the word so as not to offend Turkey.

## Obama's 2008 View

Activists had hoped Obama would break with the past this year, particularly after Pope Francis referred to genocide in a statement just over a week ago.

The pope and various European leaders have been "encouraging Turkey to come to terms with its past," said Bryan Ardouny, executive director of Armenian Assembly of America. "We had hoped and expected that President Obama would have done the same."

In the past, Obama has supported using the term to describe the killings. When he was a senator and a presidential candidate, he criticized the George W. Bush administration for not doing so.

"Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence," Obama said in 2008. "The facts are undeniable. An official policy that calls on diplomats to distort the historical facts is an untenable policy."
