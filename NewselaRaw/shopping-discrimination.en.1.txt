The usual scenario in expensive stores involves suspicious glances, inattentive clerks or rude service. It doesn't usually involve handcuffs and police officers.

Yet when a black teenager said he was wrongly jailed after buying a $350 belt at a luxury shop in Manhattan, it struck a nerve with African-Americans. Many are accustomed to finding that their money is not necessarily as good as everyone else's. Shopping while black, they say, can be an upsetting experience.

Much attention has been paid to this issue over the years. Oprah Winfrey once complained that a Swiss clerk did not think she could afford a $38,000 handbag, and even President Barack Obama has said he was once followed in stores.

But according to shoppers interviewed on Monday, many people don't recognize how common retail discrimination is. People also don't realize how the consistent stream of small insults adds up to a large problem.

## Ignored, Or Interrogated

Natasha Eubanks explained that it's one thing if people don't understand the issue, but said "Don't ever tell me it doesn't happen to me." Eubanks runs a gossip website and often shops at high-end stores in New York City. "You can't assume it doesn't happen just because it doesn't happen to you," she said.

Sometimes, Eubanks said, it takes clerks more than five minutes to simply acknowledge her presence. At other times, the store assistants ask her question after question. Eubanks explained that if you're a black girl looking at luxury goods, the clerks want to know what you're doing in the store and what you do for a living. Eubanks said she has dealt with this at least 20 times in New York.

Trayon Christian's problem was not how he was treated when he went into Barneys New York â€” it was what happened afterwards. In a lawsuit filed last week, the 19-year-old said that he bought a Ferragamo belt at the store, but when he left he was stopped by undercover city police officers.

According to the lawsuit, police said Christian "could not afford to make such an expensive purchase." He was arrested and detained, though he showed police the receipt, the bank card he used and identification, the lawsuit said.

After Christian's lawsuit was filed, another black Barneys shopper said she was accused of fraud after purchasing a $2,500 handbag. Then black actor Robert Brown told how he was paraded through Macy's in handcuffs and detained for an hour. He was also accused of credit card fraud.

## Bias Affects Arrests, Some Say

For Yvonne Chan, the reports were a painful reminder of when she worked in a liquor store in a mostly white Massachusetts town. Every few months someone would be caught stealing, and about half the time it was a black person.

Chan said she always tried not to judge people on the color of their skin, but admitted that she found herself watching black people more carefully.

The graduate student added that she wanted to consider everybody equally, but did end up thinking about groups of people differently due to her experiences. Chan said that this changed her view of people as individuals.

Those biased views can affect who gets arrested for theft, said Jerome Williams, a business professor at Rutgers University.

Many people justify racial profiling by saying that black customers are more likely to steal. But Williams said that one study showed that white women in their 40s did more shoplifting than other groups.

Williams explained that these white women don't show up in crime figures because people aren't watching them as closely as they watch black customers.

The figures that show that black customers steal more "are not really an indication of who's shoplifting," Williams said. Instead this just shows that more black people are getting caught because more black people are being watched in stores.

## Discrimination Hits All Colors

New York City college student Dido Kanyandekwe knows he is being watched. But the 18-year-old said that when he sees staff looking at him he jokes with them. Kanyandekwe says "Hello, I see you" to security guards or waves at them. The student was in Barneys on Monday buying a $600 pair of Italian designer sneakers.

"Most black people don't have the money to buy stuff at Barneys," said Kanyandekwe, the son of wealthy parents. "But that does not mean all black people are not able to buy these things,"

Black people are not the only ones who can face unequal treatment in stores. Hispanic shoppers have made the same complaints. And Sher Graham, a white woman who lives in Alabama, says black servers in the fast-food restaurants she visits often wait on black customers first.

Graham said a few months ago a black cashier started talking to black women standing in line behind her about their order. "When I brought this to her attention, she just shrugged her shoulders and completely ignored me. This action happens more times than not here in the Gulf Coast region," Graham complained. But the experience is most common for African-Americans.

Candace Witherspoon is a wardrobe stylist in Los Angeles. She went to a store in Century City last April to buy a purse. Witherspoon said the sales associate barely greeted her, then ignored her. Witherspoon saw that white customers in the store were treated very differently.

Witherspoon said that as the other customers left, the assistant said 'Thanks ladies for shopping. Have a good day.' But Witherspoon said that when she left, the same staff member gave her a nasty look and didn't say anything.

Toni Duclottni, who runs a fashion web site in Los Angeles, recently went to a department store intending to spend about $4,000 on shoes. But she took her business elsewhere after being ignored.

Duclottni said that the solution to this discrimination problem is simple. "They rush to judgment, they jump into it assuming something without speaking to a person," she said. "They'd be surprised if they just walked up and said, "Hello, can I help you find something?'"
