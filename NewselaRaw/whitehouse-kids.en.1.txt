WASHINGTON â€” It was a White House gala with the razzle-dazzle of a real state dinner. Amid the strains of a harp, guests promenaded into the Executive Mansion, pausing before a clutch of media before making their way to a receiving line and into the East Room.

But unlike at other White House feasts, the guests were encouraged to eat with their fingers.

Usually held in honor of kings, queens and presidents from other countries, this state dinner celebrated kids. Once the guests were seated, waiters in tuxedos served them an eight-course meal on gold-rimmed china.

First lady Michelle Obama hosted the meal, officially called Kids' State Dinner, on Tuesday. The second annual event honored the young winners of the Healthy Lunchtime Challenge, a healthy recipe contest that drew more than 1,300 entrants between the ages of 8 and 12.

## President's Surprise Appearance

Just like last year, President Barack Obama somehow was snubbed ("Usually at a state dinner, I get invited," he joked), but made a surprise appearance anyway.

"I'm not a great cook, and I'm not bad, but I don't do it that much," he confessed. "It's hard to find the time."

He went on to say he did not like vegetables during childhood. That's because his family boiled them down until they would get "all soft and mushy, and nobody wanted to eat a pea or a Brussels sprout because they tasted horrible because they were all mush. And now I actually like vegetables, because they're prepared right."

After she invited the kids to eat with their fingers, the president quipped: "Michelle never said to me I can just pick up something with my fingers at a state dinner. So that's not fair."

"And you can't," the first lady told him.

Michelle Obama put the event on the White House calendar as part of her Let's Move initiative to fight childhood [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity). Being obese, or very overweight, puts a person's health at risk.

## Winning Entrees On The Menu

About 140 people attended. Fifty-four of them were contest winners. They represented every state, the District of Columbia, and three territories, with recipes for culinary concoctions like "Wisconsin Solar Oven-Simmered Chili."

Some of the kids got help, which was encouraged under the contest rules. Such as Taddy Pettit, 10, from Illinois. Pettit's stepfather, Ryan Rogiers, graduated from the California Culinary Academy and worked as a waiter at the Chicago restaurant Alinea, which rates three stars from Michelin travel guide.

Pettit's winning entree? "Black Bean Wrap with Jicama-Grilled Corn Salsa." Jicama is a sweet tasting vegetable. He made his first-ever trip to Washington from Oakwood, Illinois, with Rogiers, who is a culinary arts instructor at a community college.

Tieless in a pin-striped suit and white shirt, Pettit was impressed with White House, which he called "amazing" and he described the first lady as "really nice." As for the balloon artist brought in before the noon meal, Pettit was particularly impressed by a balloon creation featuring an alien on a motorcycle. "It was crazy," he said.

Each of the winners brought along a parent, many of them mothers, or a grandparent. Nine honorees saw their creations listed on the menu, immortalized on cards scripted in calligraphy.

Selections included "Fun Mini Pizzas With Veggies" (from Kansas), "Taste of the Tropics Fruit Bowl" (Hawaii), "Kickin' Colorful Bell Peppers Stuffed With Quinoa" (Ohio) and "Bodacious Banana Muffins" (Tennessee). Quinoa is a grain-like food high in protein. For dessert, there were two smoothies, one concocted with passion fruit and banana (U.S. Virgin Islands).

## A Garden Tour Afterward

Tanya Steel, editor-in-chief of Epicurious, an online food publication, conceived of the contest a few years ago and presented the idea to the first lady's office. According to Steel, the contest drew the most entries from California, whose winner, Rose Scott, 12, from Menlo Park, cooked up "Pork and Tofu Lettuce Cups."

The state dinner, which featured the George W. Bush china, had fun and frivolous touches, including tablecloths featuring awning stripes in summery colors and centerpieces crafted with brightly colored peppers.

As for attire, girls favored summery floral dresses and boys mostly went for preppy styles such as slacks and shirts, sometimes with blazers and bow ties.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack was among the administration officials who turned out. Singer Rachel Crow was the featured performer.

After the meal, the children worked off some of the calories with a hands-on tour of Michelle Obama's garden on the South Lawn.

This year, Epicurious sought corporate sponsors, said Juliet Horn, an Epicurious spokeswoman. Delta Air Lines provided air transportation for the young chefs and their adult companions. Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts contributed hotel accommodations, and Scotts Miracle-Gro put on a pizza party for the youngsters on Monday.
