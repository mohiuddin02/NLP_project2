NORTHAMPTON, Mass. â€” Audrey Olmos-Govea remembers sitting in class at Smith College. She could not believe what she had just heard. The teacher turned to the students and said, "You've all been to Europe, right?"

Most of her classmates said they had. It made Olmos-Govea feel as if she did not belong there. She is the first one in her family to go to college. Her family lives on just the $15,000 a year her mother earns. Olmos-Govea, who is Mexican-American, had flown only once in her life. Her family could not afford to go to Europe.

"I haven't been to Europe," she told the class. "My family didn't take vacations. I worked every summer."

The teacher turned red and apologized. "But after the fact, I knew it was the right thing to do," she said.

## Many Colleges Help And Encourage Poorer Students

Smith is a very good college in Northampton, Massachusetts. It costs $63,950 each year, not including books. Many of Omos-Govea's classmates are rich. Omos-Govea gets a scholarship, which is money for school. It is the only way she can afford to go.

Olmos-Govea is in her third year at Smith. She came from a town in California where nearly 4 out of 10 people over age 25 did not finish high school. Most of them do not speak English at home.

In the last few years, more and more small colleges are trying to help first-generation Americans such as Olmos-Govea. Her parents are poor and were born in Mexico. Just 3 out of 10 first-generation students will finish college within six years, a group known as the Pell Institute found. The group does studies and encourages first-generation students to go to college. Usually, it takes four years to graduate. The poorest students, like Olmos-Govea, have only a 1 in 10 chance of graduating by age 24.

Many of these colleges know what keeps first-generation students from graduating. The schools are expensive. Students may not be prepared for the difficult classes. They might also be afraid of asking for help.

## "Hanging With My People"

At Smith, 1 out of every 5 new students is both a first-generation American and first-generation college student. Five years ago, the school created a program to help them. It encourages them to connect with other students. It also gives those young people a chance to learn about Smith before classes begin. The purpose of the program is to help them be more confident and feel that they belong.

"Last year I was talking to a student who was homesick. I started talking to her like I would any other homesick student," said Marge Litchford. She started the program for first-generation students at Smith. "But then I realized she wasn't going to see her parents for the whole year because she couldn't afford to fly home."

Not long ago, 12 new Smith students listened to college President Kathleen McCartney. She was the first in her family to go to college. McCartney told the students that a high school instructor talked her out of applying to go to a very good college. She applied to a top university near her home anyway and got in.

McCartney described how hard it was to work part time and go to class. After her talk, she tweeted a photo of the group. The students called it "Hanging with my people @smithcollege #FirstGenSmithies"

## The Efforts Are Working

There are few first-generation students at the best colleges, a University of Michigan study said.

However, some small colleges are trying to change that. They are making an effort to get more first-generation students. They are succeeding at it.

At Smith, about 9 out of 10 first-generation students will graduate in four years.

As a new student, Olmos-Govea did not feel very comfortable. Now she is full of confidence.

"Being here," Olmos-Govea said, "has taught me how to handle myself in those situations. It hasn't made me any less scared. But Smith has taught me to question."
