ST. LOUIS — A museum in Missouri is trying to gather images and items from the protests in Ferguson.

The Missouri History Museum is collecting items that show the unrest that followed the August shooting death of Michael Brown. The 18-year-old Brown was an African-American. He was shot by a white officer of the Ferguson police.

Some images are already a part of Missouri history. They include street-artist paintings on boards protecting store windows and signs saying, "Hands Up. Don't Shoot."

The St. Louis museum is not just gathering physical objects. It is also collecting Facebook and Twitter posts and even cellphone videos. The museum is also asking for protesters, residents and police to tell their stories. These are called oral histories.

## A Piece Of Local History

The shooting was followed by protests and violence. Police and minority communities did not trust each other. The museum wants to show people in the future what was seen and thought while it all happened.

The items are not being collected for one exhibition at the museum. They will mostly be saved so they can be studied. The goal is to collect history as it happens.

"This is a rare example of being at a point where history is made all around you," said Chris Gordon of the museum, which is in St. Louis.

The museum has regular exhibits. It also has a public library that holds documents, objects and written words from events going back more than 200 years.

## Protests Resulted In Violence

Brown was fatally shot on Aug. 9 after a confrontation with a police Officer Darren Wilson. Brown was unarmed. Some witnesses said he was trying to surrender. Wilson said Brown was threatening his life.

A day after the shooting, protesters flooded the streets near the site. Several businesses were damaged.

Anger grew in the community for months. It got worse on Nov. 24 after a grand jury decided not to indict, or charge, Wilson with a crime. Furious protesters swarmed streets across the St. Louis area. It led to a nationwide movement protesting how the police treat some people, particularly minorities. Some protests became violent. A dozen businesses around Ferguson were burned down and others were damaged.

TV news media traveled to the protests because of the shootings and unrest. The videos and pictures they took of armored police facing off with angry protesters were seen around the world.

## Items Of Protest And Support

Gordon said the museum has already collected T-shirts, protest signs and buttons. Photos have been taken of a memorial for Brown in the street where he was killed. The museum is trying to save street art before it is painted over. Wood boards covering store windows still show messages like, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to Justice everywhere."

On one chilly morning, 60-year-old Carol Snyder of Pennsylvania walked along South Florissant Road. She snapped photos of the street art with her phone.

Snyder stood in front of a piece of wood painted with the words "Hands Up Let's Pray." She felt a mixture of sadness and hope.

"I do hope for a brighter future," she said. "I do hope for peace for the people here in Ferguson and throughout the United States."

Some objects have been hard for Gordon to collect. He has not found an empty tear gas canister or rubber bullet. Both were used by police when the protests turned angry. He is also searching for buttons, T-shirts and signs showing support for Wilson, but they are hard to find because there were not many demonstrations in the officer's favor.

It is unclear if any of the items will ever be shown in the museum — but the goal is really to save history.

"Our hope is to preserve this for future generations so they can get a clearer picture of what actually happened," Gordon said.
