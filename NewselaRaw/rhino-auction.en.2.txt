HOUSTON, Texas â€” Organizers of an auction expect to raise more than $1 million to help protect the endangered black rhino.

The item to be sold? A permit that will allow a hunter to kill a rhino, one of the last in the African country of Namibia.

Some animal preservation groups are bashing the idea.

"More than ridiculous," said Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States. "It's absurd. You're going to help an endangered animal by killing an endangered member of that population?"

## "The Conservation Hunt"

Animal conservationists around the world are joining together to protect the elephant and rhino from people with high-powered weapons, he said.

"This auction sends exactly the wrong signal," Pacelle said.

In October, the Dallas Safari Club announced it would sell the hunting permit to the highest bidder. A safari is an trip to hunt or watch animals in the wild, often in eastern Africa.

In many countries, government permits are needed to kill endangered species. The permit is one of only five offered each year by Namibia, and the first being sold outside of that country. The money raised from the auction will pay for conservation efforts that will help protect the black rhino in Namibia.

"This is advanced, state-of-the-art wildlife conservation and management," said John J. Jackson III. He is a member of the safari club and a Louisiana-based international wildlife lawyer. The rhino permit auction "is not something the (regular person) understands, but they should," Jackson said.

He called it the best way to preserve the endangered species. "The conservation hunt is a hero in the hunting community."

## Drop From 70,000 To 4,000 Black Rhinos

An estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild, down from 70,000 in the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 of the rhinos are in Namibia, located in southwestern Africa, said the safari club.

Poachers long have targeted the rhino, primarily for its horn. A poacher illegally captures or kills animals.  The rhino horn, although illegal to own, is highly valuable. Made of the protein keratin, the horn is carved into sculptures and also used as medicine, mostly in Asia. Fingernails and hooves are also mainly made out of keratin.

The destruction of their environment is another reason rhinos are nearly [extinct](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species).

The safari club auction is scheduled for January.

According to Jackson, the hunt will involve one of five black rhinos selected by a committee and approved by the Namibian government. The five will all be older males, unable to reproduce. Also, they will likely be "troublemakers ... bad guys that are killing other rhinos," he said.

Jackson said the rhino hunt is actually a good thing. Killing an older, violent rhino means that more rhino calves will be born, he said.

The money from the auction would all go into a bank account, Jackson said. There, the money will be held until the hunting permit is approved by Namibia. At that point, it will be sent to the government of Namibia for the sole purpose of protecting rhinos and their environment, he said.

Safari Club President Ben Carter said the money will be important to Namibia's fight to ensure the future of the rhino.

## Their Future Is In Doubt

Jeffrey Flocken disagrees wholeheartedly. Flocken is the North American regional director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. He doesn't believe the club's argument that it is just trying to save the rhino.

Flocken says the club is trying to create a bidding frenzy for the opportunity to shoot one of the last rhinos in existence. Flocken called the auction "totally irresponsible." Rhino poaching, the illegal killing or capture of wild animals, is out of control and the club is trying to take advantage of "a horrific situation," he said.

They are trying to create "excitement around being able to kill an animal whose future existence" is already in doubt, Flocken said.

Rick Barongi is the director of the Houston Zoo and vice president of the International Rhino Foundation. He said the hunt was not illegal. But it "sends a mixed message."

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said it will let the safari club know whether it will allow the winning hunter to bring back the dead rhino to the U.S. as a trophy. Under federal law, the government department must determine whether the rhino was killed as part of a well-managed conservation program. The program must help the species survive in the long run.

Earlier this year, the Fish and Wildlife Service granted a permit for a black rhino taken in Namibia in 2009.

Pacelle said the Humane Society would work to oppose the permit.

An administrator at the Namibian Embassy in Washington referred questions about the hunt and auction to the Namibian government. There was no response to an email from The Associated Press.

"The two hot issues here are the fact it's an endangered species, and ... it's a trophy," said Barongi. If the money raised from the rhino auction will save hundreds of rhinos, Barongi said this may be the best option.

"Because the alternative is you can lose them all," he said.
