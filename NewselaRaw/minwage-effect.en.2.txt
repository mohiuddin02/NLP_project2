What would the U.S. look like with a $15-an-hour minimum wage?

There may be a real answer to this question soon.

## Will It Help Or Hurt?
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150608_MIN_WAGE.png" /> Some politicians and people who fight for workers' rights see a $15 minimum wage as a way to cure the problems faced by poor people. They expect the higher wage will reduce poverty and spur the economy â€” the level of wealth and number of jobs a country has. Business owners warn it will hurt them during times when the economy slumps and people stop buying the things they sell. They say it will drive small employers out of business and lead to millions of people being let go from jobs.

It may not be quite that simple. An increase to $15 an hour would ripple through the U.S. economy in some unexpected ways. Its effects may not be as bad nor as good as each side claims.

The push for a higher minimum wage has gained strength over the past few years. Seattle, San Francisco and now Los Angeles have decided on a wage of $15 an hour. The change will take effect over the next few years. That's more than double the national minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. No employer anywhere in the country is allowed to pay less than that.

## Pay Rising In Many Places

Other cities such as Chicago, Oakland, California, and Washington, D.C., have raised the minimum wage, but not as much. At least a dozen other cities and states, including New York and Oregon, may soon follow those cities.

The economy started to decline in 2007, as the stock market fell and people lost jobs. It was known as the Great Recession. It officially ended in 2009 but wages have remained flat for years and the economy has improved very slowly. The recent movement is a result of general unhappiness with this state of affairs. The last 25 years has seen fabulous income gains for companies and individuals at the top. Everyone else, however, has gained very little.

Higher minimum wages would address some of that inequality, lifting many Americans from poverty.

Government figures show that almost 60 percent of workers are paid by the hour, instead of an annual salary. Out of those, another 60 percent, or some 44 million people, make less than $15 an hour. If the minimum went up to $15 tomorrow, nearly half of those workers would get at least a 50 percent increase.

## More Pay, Less Government Aid

It's not just teenagers and young adults who work low-paying jobs. More than 8.4 million people earning less than $10 an hour today are between ages 25 and 54. About 62 percent of these workers are women, many with children.

Yet higher wages could lead to many low-wage workers getting less in government benefits. Once they make more money, they may not qualify for as much government money for child-care or aid for food, housing and medicines.

Millions of workers would have more money in their pockets to spend, boosting demand for goods and services. However, they would also likely face increased prices. Shops, restaurants, and other businesses that employ low-wage workers could charge their customers more to make up for their higher labor costs.

When Oakland's minimum wage jumped from $9 an hour to $12.25 in March, shoppers noticed many stores added a dime or a quarter to different items. Food caterer David Smith raised the price of his dishes by $2 to $3 a plate. "I had to," says Smith, 35, who has three employees.

## Fears Of Job Losses

Longer term, many low-paid workers could lose their jobs or find fewer openings as employers cut back to deal with the higher wage rules.

The Congressional Budget Office did a study last year. It found that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would lead to a half-million jobs lost. At $15 an hour, millions of jobs could be lost.

"Fifteen dollars still scares me," says Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University economist. He said raising minimum wages could be possible in high-priced cities like Seattle and San Francisco, but might be more difficult in other areas.

No doubt higher wages will cause some struggling companies to fail.

## Some Businesses May Thrive

Yet other businesses will do just fine, maybe even thrive. They could see greater sales as weaker rivals fold and shoppers spend more money from their higher wages.

Businesses may adapt by trying to reduce costs. Some will hire workers on short-term contracts instead of full time. Others will use machines to do work once done by humans. Lower-wage jobs may be lost in the process but also some higher-paying jobs could be added to handle new technologies.

No one really knows how the effects of higher wages will play out. As the push for higher minimum wages spreads, however, workers and employers are already beginning to imagine life in a $15-an-hour world.
