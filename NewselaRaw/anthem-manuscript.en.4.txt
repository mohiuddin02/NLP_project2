WASHINGTON â€” The American national anthem is "The Star-Spangled Banner."

The song is played all over the country before games and events. Many Americans love it. The song makes them very emotional.

A man named Francis Scott Key wrote the song in 1814. The song tells the story of a giant flag. The flag was flying over a fort in Baltimore. Americans were fighting with England. It was the War of 1812.

England had control of America before, and the United States was still a young country on its own.

Key was in a ship. He saw the huge flag far away. The day was rising and he thought the moment was beautiful. He described the flag as "The Star-Spangled Banner" which became the name of the song. Banner is another word for flag.

Key wrote the words for the song on a single sheet of paper. It became popular very soon after. People always felt good when they heard the song. In 1931, it became the country's national song.

This year is special for the song. This year, it is turning 200 years old.

## Let's Celebrate The Song's Birthday

There will be parties all over the country. Best of all, for the first time the giant flag and Key's piece of paper with the hand-written words to the song will be together. They can be found at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The huge flag has been kept all these years.

People sing the song all the time, but they don't know a lot about it. The museum is hoping that more people would be curious to learn about the history of "The Star- Spangled Banner."

Though the song is very popular, most people can't sing it. It is very hard to sing. Some people forget the melody. Others can't remember the words.

Mistakes with the song happen all the time. Even famous singers get confused.

The museum wants visitors to remember the song, the words and the flag. They hope people will want to learn more about the song on its 200th birthday.
