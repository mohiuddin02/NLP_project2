WASHINGTON â€” U.S. President Barack Obama said it may be possible to stop Syria from using poison gas without the U.S. using missiles. But the U.S. military will keep the pressure on President Bashar Assad. It will "be ready to respond" if other measures fail, he said.

The president went on national television from the White House to talk about Syria. He has been asking Congress to give him permission to fire missiles against Syria. But he said on Tuesday he asked Congressional leaders to delay a vote on that request to give peaceful negotiations a chance to work.

Obama said the country was tired after 10 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. "America is not the world's policeman," he said.

But he also talked about stopping "children from being gassed to death" and "making our own children safe." If the U.S. can do that with a little bit of effort or risk, "I believe we should act. That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional," he said.

## Syria May Hand Over Chemical Weapons

A lot has been happening around Syria over the past 10 days. First Obama surprised people. He stepped back from a threatened military strike. He said he would first ask Congress to pass a law letting him use force against Assad.

Most people do not want the American military to get involved in Syria. Polls show as much. Lawmakers in both parties also have offered little support. They are worried about getting involved in another war in the Middle East. Obama also had trouble getting other countries to support a military attack.

But things changed again this week. First Russia reacted positively to a remark from Secretary of State John Kerry. He suggested a way out of the crisis. Syria could agree hand over its poison gas. Syria seemed to agree once Russia did.

Kerry will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday. Meanwhile, Obama said he will keep talking with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The United States and its allies will also work with Russia and China on another front. They would ask the United Nations to make Assad give up his poison gas weapons. They would eventually be destroyed.

## U.S. Says Assad Used Poison Gas

The United States blames an Aug. 21 poison gas attack on Assad.

The president said the attack was against international law. But it was also a danger for the United States, he said.

If peaceful negotiations fail and the United States does not act, Assad could keep using poison gas. So could other tyrants. U.S. troops could be gassed, he said.

Obama said he would not put U.S. troops in Syria. The military action would not be like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The military strike would have a clear goal, Obama said. It would be meant to stop Assad from using poison gas.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke to a Congressional hearing before the speech. He said the threat of military action needed to be there for the peaceful negotiations to work.

## Syria's Bloody Civil War

U.S. officials say more than 1,400 people died in the Aug. 21 attack. At least 400 were children, they said. Other death counts are lower. Assad has said the attack was launched by rebels. They have been fighting to drive him from power in a civil war. So far, more than 100,000 Syrians have died in the two-year war, not including soldiers.

Russia supports Assad. It has blocked U.S. attempts to rally the U.N. Security Council behind a military strike. But on Monday it spoke favorably about requiring Syria to surrender control of its poison gas. The Syrian foreign minister did likewise.

The response in Congress for a military strike has not been great.

Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is the Senate Republican leader. On Tuesday, he became the first congressional leader to come out against giving the president permission to attack Syria. "There are just too many unanswered questions" about the long-term U.S. plan in Syria, he said.

Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia have supported Obama's request. They are the top two Republicans in the House.
