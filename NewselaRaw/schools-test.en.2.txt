LOS ANGELES — Alex Wong, a junior at Mark Keppel High School in Alhambra, Calif., is working hard to get into a top college. He has nearly straight A's in tough courses. He did a summer program at Stanford University, plays club soccer, sings in the school choir and has an Eagle Scout project on his resume.

But Wong hit an unexpected roadblock this year. The school switched to a computer-based lottery to distribute spaces in Advanced Placement (AP) courses. It wanted to let more students have a chance to get into the classes. Alex initially got shut out of all three courses he requested.

Families whose children failed to get into AP courses were angry. Many consider the classes critical to develop advanced skills. They help a student's high school transcript. Passing an Advanced Placement exam allows students to earn college credit and save on tuition dollars. They complained to administrators, circulated a petition and launched a Facebook group to swap classes.

"IM DESPERATE ILL GIVE YOU FREE FOOD," student Kirk Hum posted on the AP Flea Market Facebook group. The group has 210 members.

## "I'm Struggling To Adjust"

AP classes have long been considered an elite track for the most talented and ambitious students. Now they are seen as beneficial for any students willing to push themselves. Schools increasingly see access to them as a basic educational right. But that has come with challenges and controversy.

Downtown Magnets High School in Los Angeles has nearly doubled participation in AP classes over the last five years.

Miracle Vitangcol is a Downtown Magnets junior with average grades and test scores. She is failing her AP U.S. history class; she said she is overwhelmed by the rapid pace and volume of material she needs to memorize. But she said she intends to stick it out because the class is teaching her to manage her time, take good notes and keep trying.

"I'm struggling to adjust," Vitangcol said. "But I keep telling myself, 'It's OK. You can do it. Just push yourself.' "

Some critics worry that the open-access movement is pushing too many unprepared students into AP classes. They also fear that teachers are weakening courses and giving higher grades too easily.

"While expanding access is generally a good thing, we need to make sure we're not watering down the experience for the high achievers," said Michael Petrilli. He writes about education at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute in Washington.

## Access To AP Classes Remains Uneven

The College Board runs the AP program and is encouraging open access. It said the effort has generally been successful. Even though national participation has doubled in the last decade to 2.1 million students last year, exam failure rates have increased only slightly, officials said.

At the same time, access to AP courses remains uneven. Low-income students are twice as likely as others to attend schools without a full array of AP courses, according to one study.

Downtown Magnets, whose students are overwhelmingly low-income, offers 15 different AP courses. The school's 61 percent exam pass rate far outpaces L.A. Unified's average of 40 percent.

Teachers are one reason behind the school's success, said Lynda McGee, the school's college counselor and AP coordinator. In Daniel Jocz's AP U.S. history class, for instance, about 90 percent of students pass the exam. The national rate is about 54 percent.

Jocz was recently teaching a lesson on Henry Clay's "American System" national economic plan. It could have been dry, but Jocz included music clips from Bruce Springsteen and Queen and amusing factoids about the Erie Canal. He pointed out content likely to appear on the AP exam and directed students to work in groups on an AP-type essay question about the contributions of Thomas Jefferson.

Jocz sees both pros and cons of open access. "The good thing is giving people the chance to challenge themselves … but some kids are not ready, and are we setting them up for failure?" he said.

## Advanced Placement Participation Rising

At Jordan High School in Watts, Evan Dvorak  allowed any student to take his AP physics class last year. But he found that those who had not acquired the necessary calculus skills could not handle the work; all 20 students failed the exam.

"As a teacher, you want to think you can reach every student and perform miracles to get them where they need to be," he said. "But it proved to be too much for everyone."

This year, Dvorak made sure that students knew how difficult the course was; only six have enrolled and are doing much better, he said.

Los Angeles adopted a districtwide policy to let any student take an AP course in 2009. Since then, AP participation has risen to 17.7 percent of high school students this year from 12.5 percent. The exam pass rate has stayed about the same, at 40 percent, although it varies from 62.4 percent for whites to 25.7 percent for African-Americans.

## "A Delicate Balancing Act"

Long Beach, Calif. schools opened its AP classes a decade ago; the district has boosted the percentage of students taking the spring exams to 21 percent of its sophomores, juniors and seniors this year. Only 10 percent took the tests in 2003. The exam pass rate has remained steady at 54 percent.

"We're preparing more students for college and helping parents in the pocketbook when it comes time for college tuition," said Long Beach Unified spokesman Chris Eftychiou.

At Keppel, some parents whose children were shut out of AP classes say they support the goal of open access. But they do not like the random selection for limited spaces.

"It's a delicate balancing act," said Shelly Tan. Her son, Douglas, failed to get into an AP biology class after doing the summer work during a family vacation. "Yes, you want to give all kids opportunity — but not at the expense of kids who can do the honors work."
