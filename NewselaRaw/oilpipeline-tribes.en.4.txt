WASHINGTON — The U.S. government is deciding whether to allow a 1,700-mile oil pipeline that would stretch from Canada to the Gulf Coast of the United States. Many people are worried that it could cause pollution.

[Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native american) in South Dakota don't want it near tribal lands. They say they'll fight the Keystone XL pipeline.

Faith Spotted Eagle figures that building a pipeline would only bring crime and dirty water. But, she doubts that Native Americans will get the U.S. government to block the project.

"There is no way for Native people to say no — there never has been," said Spotted Eagle, 65. She's a Yankton Sioux tribal elder.

## Peaceful Protests

South Dakota is home to some of the nation's poorest American Indians. And people and companies, both with a lot of money, are pushing for the pipeline.

Tribes may be down after a government study came out Jan. 31. It found that if the pipeline were built it would not add to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global warming). The study said that the warming of the Earth caused by burning oil wouldn't increase because of the pipeline.

But, tribes are still preparing to protest against TransCanada. That's the company that plans to develop the pipeline.

Tribal leaders may try to block construction equipment from moving.

"We're going to do everything we possibly can," said Greg Grey Cloud of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. Tribes might camp out nearby to follow the construction. He said that any actions would be peaceful. "We're not going to damage anything."

Much of the country is divided over the pipeline. Tribal members also have different opinions about it. In South Dakota, some fear the effects of pollution. Yet, other people want the money and jobs the pipeline will bring.

## Money Vs. Risks

In Winner, S.D., Mayor Jess Keesis is eager to welcome construction workers. A camp for workers would open near his town of 3,000 people. About 600 workers would be in this "man camp."

"We deal with drought and 8-foot blizzards," said Keesis. Besides being mayor, he's also a member of the Potawatomi Nation. "So anytime we can get something like this to give us a shot, it's a good thing."

Tribes say the risks are too great.

Two weeks ago, Native American tribes wrote a statement against the pipeline. It says they stand ready to protect their "sacred water."

Tribes also fear attacks on Native women. Thousands of construction workers would live in work camps near Indian reservations. The government says that one of every three Indian women are assaulted during their lifetimes. Most attacks are by non-Native men.

Keesis said the project would help the region. It would bring money to the town of Winner. Construction workers would spend money at its restaurants, bars and movie theater.

He spent 20 years working in oilfields. Keesis says much has changed. Construction workers are better behaved.

## A Bloody History

President Obama has not said when he'll decide what to do about the pipeline. But, he is under pressure to say yes to the project. Last week, 45 lawmakers sent a letter to the president. It said thousands of jobs are at stake. The letter reminded Obama of his promise to make a decision by the end of 2013.

In South Dakota, the line would not go through any of the state's reservations. But, tribes say it's close enough to be a risk.

Native Americans have a painful history in South Dakota. Some of the bloodiest battles between Indians and the government happened there. In 1890, U.S. troops killed nearly 300 Sioux at Wounded Knee Creek.

Spotted Eagle said it's her duty to try to stop the pipeline. She wants to keep her land and water clean for her grandchildren.

She said that "these man camps" bring up bad moments in history. It is a reminder of "when they put us in forts and they wanted our land."
