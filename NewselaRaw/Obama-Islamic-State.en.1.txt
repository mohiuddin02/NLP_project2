WASHINGTON â€” Opening a new military front in the Middle East, President Barack Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time Wednesday night. He called it part of "a steady, relentless effort" to root out Islamic State (ISIL) extremists and their spreading reign of terror.

"We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are," Obama declared in a prime-time address to the nation from the White House. "This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven."

Obama also announced that he was expanding air strikes in Iraq and dispatching nearly 500 more U.S. troops to the country. The U.S. forces will assist that country's overwhelmed military. The new addition of troops brings the total number of American forces sent there this summer to more than 1,500.

The militant group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

Obama also urged Congress to authorize a program to train and arm Syrian rebels. The rebels are fighting both ISIL and Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Obama's plans amounted to a striking shift for the president. He first rose to political popularity in part because of his early opposition to the Iraq war. While in office, he has steadfastly sought to wind down American military campaigns in the Middle East and avoid new wars. He's particularly avoided involvement in Syria. The chaos gripping that country from its continuing civil war has given ISIL space to thrive and move freely across the border with Iraq.

Speaking on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the U.S., Obama's plans were also an admission that years of American-led war in the Middle East have not silenced the terror threats in the region.

## No Troops Fighting On Foreign Soil

Obama insisted that his plan to "degrade and ultimately destroy" ISIL would not involve returning U.S. combat troops to the Middle East. Even so, he acknowledged that "any time we take military action, there are risks involved, especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions."

"But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil," he added.

The president's announcements follow a summer of debate at the White House over how to respond to the violent ISIL militants. Administration officials have said they are not aware of a true threat of a potential attack by the militants in the U.S. All the same, they say the group poses risks to Americans and interests across the Middle East. Officials are also concerned that Westerners, including Americans, who have joined the militant group could return to their home countries to launch attacks.

In recent weeks, the militants have released videos showing the grisly murder of two American journalists in Syria. The violent images appear to have shifted public opinion, which was formerly weary of war. In recent days multiple polls have showed that the majority of Americans support airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria.

The U.S. began launching limited airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq earlier this summer at the request of Iraq's former prime minister.

Officials said Obama plans to proceed with both the broader airstrikes in Iraq and the strikes in Syria. He'll do so without seeking new authorization from Congress. Instead, he is to act under authorization Congress passed after 9/11 to give President George W. Bush the ability to go after those responsible for the terror attacks. Obama has previously used the authorization to strike against terror targets in Yemen and Somalia.

## Too Little Too Late?

Obama said his approach in Syria is modeled after those long-running U.S. counterterrorism efforts. But it is different in important ways, starting with the fact that it marks the first time since 9/11 that a U.S. president has authorized the bombing of terror targets in another nation without seeking permission or at least notifying it in advance.

House Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, praised Obama for acknowledging the "grave and growing threat" that Islamic extremists pose. However, he said Obama was coming to that conclusion far too late.

"He has finally begun to make the case the nation has needed him to make for quite some time: that destroying this terrorist threat requires decisive action and must be the highest priority for the United States and other nations of the free world," Boehner said.

As if to answer the criticism that he has been too cautious, Obama declared of his plan: "This is American leadership at its best."

Obama is pushing for funding to train and arm more members of the Syrian opposition. Even before his remarks, congressional leaders were grappling with whether to support that request and how to get such a measure through a fiercely divided Congress.

While the CIA currently runs a small program to arm the rebels, the new version would be more robust.

## More Countries Getting Involved

Some of Obama's own advisers pressed him to arm the rebels early in their fight against Assad. But Obama resisted, arguing that there was too much uncertainty about the composition of the rebel forces. He also expressed concern about adding more firepower to an already bloody civil war.

The White House announced Wednesday that it was also providing $25 million in military assistance to the Iraqi government to combat ISIL.

The Treasury Department will also step up efforts to undermine the extremist group's finances. It will seek to cut off the group's outside funding and its access to the global financial system.

The U.S. has been pressing allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere to help with efforts to weaken the terror group.

France's foreign minister said Wednesday that his country was ready to take part in airstrikes against extremist fighters in Iraq if needed. And the German government announced that it was sending weapons and armored vehicles to Kurdish forces in Iraq.
