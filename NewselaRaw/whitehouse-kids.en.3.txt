WASHINGTON â€” It was a White House celebration with the razzle-dazzle of a real state dinner. The music of a harp greeted guests when they walked into the Executive Mansion on Tuesday. They were there for the Kids' State Dinner.

After getting some photographs, taken, the guests entered the largest room in the White House, called the East Room. There they were seated for an eight-course meal. Waiters dressed in tuxedos served the food on gold-rimmed plates. But this was not a normal White House fancy feast. These guests were told to eat with their fingers.

First lady Michelle Obama hosted the meal. The 140 guests were invited to the White House because they won a healthy recipe contest. It's called the Healthy Lunchtime Challenge.

More than 1,300 children between the ages of 8 and 12 applied. There were 54 winners from across the United States, along with the District of Colombia and three territories.

## The President Shows Up

Although President Barack Obama was not invited to come to the event, he made a surprise visit. "Usually at a state dinner, I get invited," he joked.

The president went on to admit that he's "not a great cook." He said, "I'm not bad, but I don't cook that much. It's hard to find the time."

As a child, the president did not like vegetables. That's because they were cooked until they were all soft. "Nobody wanted to eat a pea or a Brussels sprout because they tasted horrible because they were all mush. Now I actually like vegetables, because they're prepared right."

The event was part of Michelle Obama's Let's Move program. The program fights childhood [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) in America. People become obese when they gain so much weight that it hurts their health.

The 54 winning recipes included culinary concoctions such as "Wisconsin Solar Oven-Simmered Chili." A winner was selected from every state, plus three territories and the District of Columbia.

## "Black Bean Wrap With Jicama-Grilled Corn Salsa"

The young chefs were encouraged to get help from adults. Taddy Pettit, 10, from Illinois, asked his stepfather, Ryan Rogiers. Rogiers graduated from the California Culinary Academy. He was a waiter at a Chicago restaurant that got high marks from the Michelin travel guide. Rogiers is a culinary arts instructor at a community college.

Pettit's winning entree? "Black Bean Wrap with Jicama-Grilled Corn Salsa." Jicama is a sweet tasting vegetable.

The trip to Washington, D.C., was Pettit's first to the nation's capital. Pettit, who wore a pin-striped suit and white shirt without a tie, said the White House was "amazing." He thought the first lady was "really nice." Pettit also really liked a balloon artist.

Brought in before the noon meal, the balloon artist created an alien on a motorcycle, which caught Pettit's eye. "It was crazy," he said.

Each of the winners brought along a parent. Nine winners had the privilege of seeing their recipes written in beautiful script on the menu.

## Some Of The Winning Selections

Selections included "Fun Mini Pizzas With Veggies" from Kansas, "Taste of the Tropics Fruit Bowl" from Hawaii and"Kickin' Colorful Bell Peppers Stuffed With Quinoa" from Ohio. Quinoa is a grain-like food high in protein.

For dessert, there were two smoothies. One was made with passion fruit and banana from the U.S. Virgin Islands, and "Bodacious Banana Muffins" came from Tennessee.

Tanya Steel, who works at an online food publication, came up with the idea for the contest. Then she told the first lady about it. According to Steel, most entries came from California. That state's winner was Rose Scott, 12, for "Pork and Tofu Lettuce Cups." Tofu is a smooth food that is considered very healthy.

The dinner was served on George W. Bush china. The tables were covered in summery colored striped tablecloths. Brightly colored peppers served as table centerpieces.

As for clothing, girls favored summery floral dresses and boys mostly went for preppy styles such as slacks and shirts. Some boys wore blazers and bow ties.

## Singer Rachel Crow Performed

Politician Tom Vilsack was among the government officials who came to the event. Teen singer Rachel Crow performed.

After the meal, the children worked off some calories. They took a tour of Michelle Obama's garden on the South Lawn at the White House.

This year,  Delta Air Lines provided air transportation for the young chefs and their adult companions. Westin Hotels  Resorts contributed hotel accommodations, and Scotts Miracle-Gro put on a pizza party for the kids on Monday.
