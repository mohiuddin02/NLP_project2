RIO DE JANEIRO â€” Pope Francis waded into the heart of Brazil's troubles Thursday, telling residents of an often-violent slum that their leaders must do a better job of helping them.

The [pope's](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) comments could be seen as provocative, but they were not out of character. The newly appointed spiritual leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics has two causes he holds dear: social justice and reaching out to the poor.

"I would like to make an appeal to those in possession of greater resources, to public authorities and to all people of good will who are working for social justice," the pope told a rain-soaked crowd in the Varginha favela, or slum.

"Never tire of working for a more just world, marked by greater solidarity," he said to enthusiastic applause. "No one can remain insensitive to the inequalities that persist in the world."
## Brazil's Gaza Strip

Varginha is a slum so poor and violent it is sometimes called the Gaza Strip, nicknamed after the conflict-prone region in the Middle East. The government has made small improvements in an effort to slow protests and riots. But the pope seemed to be saying that such efforts did not go far enough.

"Here, as in the whole of Brazil, there are many young people. You have a particular sensitivity towards injustice, but you are often disappointed by facts that speak of corruption on the part of people who put their own interests before the common good," the pope said at a recently renovated soccer field.

"To you and to all, I repeat: Never yield to discouragement, do not lose trust, do not allow your hope to be extinguished. Situations can change, people can change."

It was the most political message yet in the pope's pilgrimage to Brazil. Enormous protests erupted in the country last month among people angered by government corruption, excessive state spending on sports events and the lack of basic services such as education and health care.

Venturing into the slum was probably the trickiest event in the pope's week in Brazil. The trip was his first overseas journey since his election in March, and one that has brought him to his native continent.
## Favela Spruced Up For Visit

Security and transportation planning were complicated. The recently paved streets inside the favela are narrow; large parts of the slum are essentially in ruins, and the crowds, though perhaps admiring of the pope, are unpredictable. But the visit seemed to go off without any major problems.

"I'm so excited, I'm going to cry," Rosa dos Santos, one of the residents greeting the pope, told reporters.

"This is really important for us," said Milena de Souza, an office worker. "He's a representative of humility and caring and most importantly, true peace, which is something we need here. Because of all the violence we've had here, hopefully, the pope can bless us."

Less than 24 hours before the Argentine-born pope's scheduled arrival, the neighborhood of about 36,000 people was still getting cleaned up. Cement walls were being poured, and state workers were laying electrical cables. For days, military police have been out in full force, but drug traffickers' graffiti has kept reappearing.

"I am absolutely sure the only reason" for the improvements "is that the pope is coming," said Rita de Cassia.

Francis traveled to Varginha on Rio de Janeiro's northern edge in a modest silver car, not a limo, seated in the back and with the window rolled down. He then transferred to an open-sided "popemobile" from which he waved at followers who swarmed the vehicle. He kissed the occasional baby hoisted in his direction.

Government sharpshooters lined the route.
## "To Take A Cafezinho"

Hundreds of residents and visiting pilgrims waited in cold, steady rain for the pope to arrive. Earlier in the day, he received the keys to the city and blessed some of Brazil's potential Olympic athletes.

Varginha, built on old swampland, is one of several favelas that have been "pacified." The drug lords who once ran the place have been ejected or subdued by authorities. The government has set aside money for community centers, libraries and a train station.

But residents say they have received more broken promises than actual help, and basic services like sanitation remain woefully unavailable. They also complain that police are heavy-handed and abusive, treating everyone like a criminal.

After praying at the chapel, Francis entered a small, freshly painted home festooned with balloons in the Vatican colors of yellow and white. The Vatican, in Rome, is the papal headquarters.

The folksiness that has characterized the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires was on display.

"From the start," the pope said, "my wish in planning this visit to Brazil was to be able to visit every district throughout the nation. I would have liked to knock on every door, to say 'good morning,' to ask for a glass of cold water, to take a cafezinho, to speak as one would to family friends." Cafezinho is a strong Brazilian coffee traditionally served in a small cup.

He added, "But Brazil is so vast! It is impossible to knock on every door."

And so, he said, the favela would represent "every district of Brazil."
