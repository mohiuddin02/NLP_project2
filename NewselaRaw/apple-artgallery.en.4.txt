NEW YORK â€” Apple Stores are not just a place to buy the latest phone or computer anymore. Now they are also a place to see art.

The art in Apple Stores is not the old-fashioned kind of art, though. It is all made on cellphones, tablets or computers.

Apple invited 12 artists to make new artworks. The artists were asked to do their art on iPads, iPhones or Mac computers.

The photos and other artworks the artists made can now be seen in Apple Stores. They can also be seen online.

## Photos Of A Glacier

Austin Mann is one of the 12 artists Apple invited. He used an iPhone 6 to take photos of a glacier in Iceland.

Mann takes many of his pictures with his iPhone. He likes the way taking pictures with an iPhone is so cheap and easy.

Technology is not just saving artists money. It also changes how they work.

Roz Hall is another of Apple's 12 featured artists. New technology has certainly meant big changes for him.

Hall once did his paintings the old way, with real paint brushes. Then, he began using an app called Brushes. The app let him paint on his iPhone.

## No More Mixing Paint

Hall's earlier paintings were life-size. The new ones were done on a 3.5-inch screen.

Hall said he likes painting on an iPhone or iPad. He enjoys not having to prepare before he starts working. He no longer needs to mix paints. He can get right to work as soon as he has an idea.

Hall has not painted the old way for many years, he says. Instead, he uses the app Procreate. The app lets him paint with his fingers on his iPad.

Some artists say that painting on a phone or computer is cheating. They say it is too easy to erase mistakes.

Hall does not agree. He thinks being able to erase mistakes easily is a good thing. He says it makes artists more daring. Artists no longer have to worry about expensive mistakes.

Suppose a painting starts to go wrong, he says. An artist who spent $75 on paint might not want to stop working. "You don't want to waste what you spent." Artists are more willing to start over if it does not cost them anything.

## The Eye Of The iPhone

Hall painted pictures of people for the Apple project. One picture shows a young, bearded man with bright yellow glasses. Another shows a thoughtful-looking woman in a floppy black hat. All the paintings were done with the Procreate app.

Alistair Taylor-Young is another of Apple's featured artists. He used his iPhone 6 to take take photos of rainy city streets.

Taylor-Young liked that it was very simple to take pictures. "You just saw something and took a photo."

In the past, most people only took photos to record special events, like birthdays. Now, people carry their phones everywhere. They are always there when you want them. Today, many of us use our cameras constantly.

Photography is now something everyone can do.
