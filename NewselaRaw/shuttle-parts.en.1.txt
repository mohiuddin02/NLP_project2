KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — It was the type of weather that would have canceled a space shuttle launch.

The rain was relentless. Water streamed down Dennis Jenkins' glasses, dripping off the tip of his nose, as he surveyed the scrap yard not far from where the shuttles once blasted into orbit.

A small mountain of cardboard boxes was falling apart in the downpour. Each box bore a sticker emblazoned with the blue NASA logo. "Critical space item," the stickers read. "Handle with extreme care."

Jenkins directed his team to a pair of 7-foot-tall contraptions next to a chain-link fence — escape baskets that once sat near the top of the shuttle, ready to slide astronauts to safety should something go wrong before launch.

## Crisscrossing The Country

It took all four men to carefully move the baskets, using a forklift to raise each up and set it into a trailer. Once they were settled, Jenkins circled the trailer, pausing to tuck a cloth flap back into place.

He turned and gave his crew a thumbs-up. "Perfect," he said.

Jenkins spent 30-plus years — his entire career — sending the shuttles into space. Now, with the shuttle program over, the 57-year-old works for the California Science Center, helping officials figure out how to display their own orbiter, Endeavour.

The Exposition Park museum wants to showcase its crown jewel as if it's on the launch pad, a display that will take thousands of pieces to pull off — parts that are scattered at NASA facilities, museums and other places across the U.S. Most are one of a kind and impossible to replicate.

So for the past year, Jenkins has crisscrossed the country, scouring NASA scrap yards and asking old co-workers if they have what he needs to rebuild the shuttle launch stack, piece by piece.

## A Million Parts

Even before the shuttles flew their final missions in 2011, institutions across the country began trying to get one of the four orbiters NASA would give away. Dozens of museums and aerospace centers submitted proposals to the agency in what became a fierce competition.

But it wasn't just the orbiters that NASA no longer needed. With no space shuttle program, there would be no need for more than a million space shuttle parts — the massive engines that powered the orbiters above Earth, the machinery used to safely move them, the specialized nuts and bolts that attached them to the external fuel tank.

NASA stashed about half the parts for use on future programs. But with the federal government facing money problems, the agency didn't want to have to pay to store the rest.

"As we're trying to minimize costs to the agency, we're trying to give up facilities, we're trying to empty out facilities," said Bob Sherouse, who is overseeing the distribution of NASA's shuttle leftovers. "We would rather find someone that wanted something than sell it off for scrap."

When the California Science Center finalized plans to display its shuttle upright, officials there realized they would need many of those same parts. The problem: There were few records of where the pieces were.

## Creating A Shuttle Display

Jenkins was only 24 when he helped launch America's first shuttle into space. When Columbia soared into orbit on April 12, 1981, he watched from a 9-inch black-and-white TV in the firing room.

By 26, Jenkins was a senior lead engineer on the project, troubleshooting and finding ways to improve the shuttle system. He spent years developing a launch site in California — scrapped after Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986. It was the first launch Jenkins had missed.

The loss of Columbia 17 years later was the beginning of the end of the shuttle program. After the orbiter disintegrated while re-entering Earth's atmosphere, federal officials decided it was time for a new approach to space exploration. The shuttles were retired in 2011.

When it came time to transfer the orbiters from Kennedy Space Center to the museums that would become their permanent homes, Jenkins took what he thought would be his final job before retiring. One by one, he helped move the orbiters across the country — including Endeavour's 12-mile journey through the streets of Los Angeles.

But then the California Science Center hired Jenkins for one more gig: overseeing the creation of its shuttle display.

## Buried In Boxes

At the top of Jenkins' to-do list is tracking down the pieces he needs for Endeavour's display. Many are the last ones that exist — only six space shuttles were ever built, meaning there weren't many spare parts.

Sometimes, he said, he has to resort to finding the people who personally packed the parts away.

"Fortunately, these guys have great memories," he said. "They packed millions of parts, probably, but frequently they could tell you what box they put something in."

He's found pieces in Utah, New Orleans, Alabama and Washington, D.C. A few ended up at other museums, which required some negotiating by Jenkins and the California Science Center.

Some are so massive — like the 60-foot steel sides of the sling that will ultimately lift the shuttle — they had to be trucked across the country on the back of a flatbed semi. Others were smaller — like an arrowhead-shaped piece of metal used to attach the shuttle to the external tank — and buried in the bottom of a box.

"It's always hard for me personally to come out here to do this because I'd much rather be coming out here to launch space shuttles. But we don't do that anymore," Jenkins said. "I'm one of the few fortunate ones who gets to still play with the space shuttles, so I'm happy about that."
