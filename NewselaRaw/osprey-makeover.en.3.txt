The Osprey aircraft arrived in Afghanistan almost four years ago with a bad reputation. It was said to be dangerous and hard to maintain.

But now that the U.S. Marine Corps has had a chance to test it in real combat conditions, the reviews are surprisingly good.

"This is an ugly duckling that turned into a swan," said Richard Whittle, the author of  _"The Dream Machine: The Untold History of the Notorious V-22 Osprey."_  The aircraft still probably cost more than it should. But "it now has probably the best safety record of any rotorcraft that the military flies."

The odd aircraft takes off and lands like a helicopter but flies like an airplane. It took  more than two decades to develop and cost a huge amount more than planned. Osprey crashes have claimed 30 lives.

The U.S. military used it in Iraq from 2007 to 2009. There it mainly flew people and cargo since fighting was winding down. Government Accountability Office criticized the use of the Osprey. The GAO is an agency that keeps tabs of how much Washington spends.

In Afghanistan, however, the Marines have been able to use it more widely. They have been flying it for everything from freight to hundreds of assaults. It has carried loads of Marines into or out of landing zones under enemy fire. It is twice as fast as the helicopter it replaces. It can fly a lot farther.

## Winning Fans

Whittle once had his doubts about the Osprey. Now he's become a fan. "The Osprey has proven itself in Afghanistan in a way it did not in Iraq," he said. "Partly that was because it didn't get the chance in Iraq." He added that the military is usually very cautious with new equipment. But if it can help in the fighting, the military will be quick to use it, Whittle explained.

The Ospreys here now are dusty, stained and smudged, and at least five have returned to base with bullet holes.

Maj. Matthew McSorley, a pilot for a Marine squadron, was hit by a different kind of fire while flying an Osprey for a mission on Valentine's Day: a massive bolt of lightning.

"It bounced right back, and I flew it all the way back, and within a week I was flying the same plane again," he said.

## Quick Treatment

The Osprey showed its strengths in one recent mission.  A Marine with a head wound needed to be moved for quick treatment.

The crew dashed for the Osprey and zoomed some 40 miles. They picked up the wounded man and flew another 75 miles or so to the massive military base in Kandahar. This all took less than one hour from the moment they got the call.

A conventional helicopter would have had a hard time making the trip as fast, even without the 40-mile run, Sanders said.

A more typical use is taking advantage of the aircraft's speed and range to come from behind a target for an attack, from an unexpected direction. This avoids the Taliban's crude air-warning system.  That system often is just a line of watchers with cellphones.

Marines favor the Osprey for special operations strikes for that very reason.

The latest model of the Osprey also is far safer than earlier ones. It is now among the safest rotary-wing aircraft in the military.

Still, the Osprey is expensive. They cost $122.5 million each, according to Sen. John McCain, a longtime critic of the aircraft. It also is not cheap to keep in good repair, especially in a place like southern Afghanistan, known for its dusty winds.

McCain said Osprey engines had been lasting just over 200 hours each. That is well below the 500 to 600 hours the Marines had expected. That, McCain said, more than doubled the cost per hour of flight, compared with about $4,600 for the CH-46, a model of helicopter.

Osprey fans say the aircraft can do a lot more so it is worth the extra cost. They note that it can carry 24 passengers. The CH-46 can carry 10. Oh, and the Osprey flies twice as fast. Plus it can perform missions plain old helicopters cannot.
