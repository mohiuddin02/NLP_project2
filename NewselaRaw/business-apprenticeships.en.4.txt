A lot of high school seniors take it easy as summer nears. Maceo Rucker-Shivers cannot afford to join them.

He attends Olympic High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. The special school prepares students for a future career. As part of his schoolwork, he has an after-school job at Bosch Rexroth Corporation, preparing him to work with machines. His bosses are keeping a close eye on his skills and work habits. If they are good enough, the company will pay for him to go to community college.

"You have to bring your A-game every day," Rucker-Shivers said.

Olympic High helped Rucker-Shivers discover his interest in high-tech factory machines. "Machines excite me. They really do," he said, beaming.

Rucker-Shivers is doing what a lot of other students soon may be doing.

## Employers Helping You Grow Up

The K-12 schools, community colleges and companies will work closely in the future. More students may learn how to do a job that takes special skill. They will not need a four-year college degree. And they will make money right away. There will not be any student loans to pay.

Right now, almost half the students who go to a four-year college leave without a diploma, a Harvard report said.

To fix this, students need different choices and companies need to help. In Europe, companies and teachers do not just create the next generation of workers. They also help young people become adults. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Superintendent Heath Morrison wants to do this in his schools.

Charlotte is starting new schools focused on internships and job skills. Olympic High got a head start. The high school does career exploration and real-life projects.

The tests and memorizing that most students do will not help them in the real world, said Michael Realon. He used to work for business groups. Now he works for Olympic High.

Realon says Olympic High helps students explore career ideas. It starts with an online look at their skills and interests. That gives them a list of career "matches."

Rucker-Shivers knew he enjoyed working with his hands. He volunteered to help build houses for the poor. He also took classes in drawing, carpentry, wood shop and principles of engineering.

Business people help Olympic create classes to prepare students for jobs. At the math/science school that Rucker-Shivers attends, the focus is energy and engineering.

## Paid To Learn

Last summer, Rucker-Shivers got a paid internship with Siemens, a German company. He followed machinists and engineers three days a week and spent two days studying at a community college.

Siemens has long paid young people for a combination of classroom work and on-the-job training. Most are high school graduates. Now, a few high school students also get a chance.

Realon says students who get apprenticeships earn $9 to $10 an hour. They even get paid for finishing high school and attending community college.

Five out of 10 summer interns were offered apprenticeships, but not Rucker-Shivers. This taught him another lesson. "You're not a kid anymore." You have to work without being told what to do and solve problems, he said.

## Recruiting Workers

In January, Bosch Rexroth started hiring high school interns in its factory that makes machines. Rucker-Shivers was chosen.

Companies do not offer the apprenticeships just to be nice. They are trying to help themselves. It is tough to find workers who can do the job right away. Textbook knowledge alone will not cut it. In Germany, apprenticeships are a way to get talented workers.

Rucker-Shivers hoped he could earn an apprenticeship. That would pay for college and let him keep training on the job. Instead of having to borrow money for college, he would get a free education. Plus, there would be a job waiting for him at the end.

There is another good thing about the partnerships. Schools may not be able to afford their own machine shops. But students can go to the real workplaces instead.

Rucker-Shivers got good news. His hard work paid off: He got an apprenticeship with Bosch.
