WASHINGTON, D.C. — Millions of tons of old electronic items are thrown out or recycled every year. 

Some are televisions. Even old iPhones end up in the trash or recycling. 

States have been trying to get the companies that make the devices pay for recycling. They have been trying this for more than 10 years. Still, half of states do not have recycling programs across their whole states. Those that do are considering how to make their programs work as the size, amount and value of recycled electronics changes.

## States Have Different Programs

Many electronic devices should not be thrown away with regular trash. They contain dangerous materials, such as mercury and lead. Those materials can poison soil and water. Much of the metal, plastic and glass in devices can be recycled.

California became the first state to pass a law requiring electronic recycling, or "e-cycling." The law passed in 2003. In California, people pay extra money when they buy a product. The money pays for e-cycling. Another 24 states and the District of Columbia have the companies that make the products pay for e-cycling programs. Many states make these manufacturers pay for the collection and processing of a certain amount of e-waste. How much they pay is based on how much they sell in the state.

Five states force electronics makers to help pay for drop-off centers. People bring their old electronics to them. Drop-off centers are supposed to make it more convenient to recycle. The states are Connecticut, Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

## Manufacturers Struggle To Keep Up

It is hard for manufacturers to follow all the different laws and rules, said Walter Alcorn. He works at the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA). The group includes electronics stores and manufacturers.

The CEA wants the laws in different states to work the same. It is also trying to get laws passed that are better for electronics companies.

Some states make manufacturers pay for a certain weight of e-cycling each year. Manufacturers can stop paying once they have met their weight goal, said Resa Dimino. She works for the Product Stewardship Institute (PSI). The group looks at how products people use affect the environment and people's health.

When companies stop paying, towns, cities or groups have to pay for recycling efforts themselves. If not, the recycling stops, she said.

Dimino said programs could be changed. Manufacturers could be forced to keep paying for recycling after they meet their weight goal. 

Manufacturers in Washington and Oregon pay for cities and towns to have collection places, Dimino said. Having recycling centers close by makes it easy for people to recycle. Since the states do not have weight goals, the states do not have to worry that companies will suddenly get to stop paying. That makes e-cycling in those states is more reliable.

## Working Together On Recycling

Electronic devices are becoming smaller. People keep them longer, too. This can lead to a different problem. It may be difficult for electronics companies to collect enough recycled materials to meet recycling weight goals, said Allison Schumacher at the CEA.

She points to a new change in an e-cycling law in South Carolina. The change lets electronics makers work together on recycling. She hopes other states will be able to use it as a model.

Manufacturers might also have trouble meeting weight goals because there are fewer heavy cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to be recycled. CRTs are part of big older televisions and computer screens. They usually contain leaded glass. Manufacturers have mostly stopped using CRTs. Now most TVs have flat screens. Without CRTs, it is hard for manufacturers to meet goals based on weight, Schumacher said. 

When electronics are recycled they can be fixed up and sold again. Otherwise, they are broken down. Then plastic and metal pieces from electronics are sold by manufacturers or recycling companies.
