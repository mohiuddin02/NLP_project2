CLEVELAND, Ohio â€” The U.S. Department of Justice made an important announcement on Tuesday. After months of planning, the city of Cleveland, Ohio, agreed to make big changes in its police department.

As in many cities across the nation, Cleveland's black community and its police officers are not getting along very well. The police department there has had problems with some officers being too violent. Some police officers have even killed people who might not have done anything wrong.

New rules for police officers will help put a stop to these problems. The Department of Justice will also send an official to stay in Cleveland and make sure police officers do not ignore the new rules.

Cleveland's police officers were already on everyone's mind when the Justice Department announced the new plan. A white officer named Michael Brelo had shot two black people in 2012. The court that heard his case had just decided that Officer Brelo had not killed them on purpose.

Many people in Cleveland did not agree with the court. Brelo and the other police officers with him had fired 137 shots at two people who did not have any weapons. The news about Officer Brelo led to protests. Most of the protests were peaceful, but not all of them. More than 70 people were arrested.

## Deaths Last Year Bring Bad Memories

People in Cleveland still have bad memories of two other people killed by police last year. A 12-year-old black boy named Tamir Rice was shot by a white officer because he was carrying a toy gun on a playground. Tanisha Anderson was a 37-year-old mentally ill woman. She stopped breathing while officers held her down on the ground.

The Justice Department has been studying Cleveland's police department for a while. They learned that Cleveland police officers shot at suspects and cars when it was not necessary. Officers also hit people over the head with guns. They even used stun guns to shock suspects who were wearing handcuffs.

The Justice Department found that police chiefs often acted like they did not know about the bad things officers were doing. Some police chiefs encouraged their officers to be rough on suspects. Others even tried to make officers look good when they wrote reports about what had happened. In three years, only six officers got in trouble.

One of the stories that bothered the Department of Justice most was about a mentally ill man named Edward Henderson. The police chased Henderson down in 2011. He was hurt very badly. A video taken from a helicopter shows four police officers standing around Henderson. It looks like the officers are kicking Henderson while he is on the ground, but the video is blurry.

## City Paid $600,000 To Man Who Got Hurt

The four officers would not say anything about how Henderson got hurt. None of them got in trouble. Henderson spent three years in prison. Later, he won a lawsuit against the city of Cleveland. The city had to pay him $600,000.

This is not the first time the Justice Department has asked Cleveland to do something about its police officers being too rough. In 2004, the Justice Department gave Cleveland a warning. The police had a chance to make changes on their own. This time is different. Now the Justice Department is sending someone to make sure the Cleveland police do not ignore the new rules.

Problems with police violence are happening all over the country. In the last five years, the Justice Department has studied police in more than 20 different cities. They have had to send someone to keep an eye on eight cities like Cleveland.

When people in Cleveland heard the Justice Department's announcement, they had lots of ideas. They sent their suggestions to the city's leaders. Some people said the police should put their new rules on the Internet, where everyone could see them. Other people asked the police to re-open small police stations in the city's community centers. People in Cleveland are ready for things to change.
