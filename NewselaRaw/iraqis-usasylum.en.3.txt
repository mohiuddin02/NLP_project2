WASHINGTON — Ahmed Abdulateef has a gift and a passion for music. In his hometown of Baghdad, Iraq, though, he is not free to play music. He has been threatened by men who feel his music does not fit with their strict version of Islam. His father smashed his guitar and kicked him out of the house.

For a while, Ahmed played in secret. Then he got a opportunity to join a cultural exchange program that allowed him to perform in the United States for one month.

In the United States, Abdullateef was free to walk down the street with his oud slung over his shoulder. The oud is a guitar-like Middle Eastern instrument.

## Free To Play

"Here, for the first time, I'm Ahmed," he said.

Abdulateef experienced freedom, and he loved it. He wanted to stay in the United States longer, to continue playing the music he loved. To do this, he applied for asylum on Nov. 24.

Asylum is a system for people who are not safe in their own country for political, religious or artistic reasons. These people ask another country for permission to stay there, and if that country agrees, they can live there in safety.

Along with Abdulateef, many other Iraqis have applied for asylum in the United States. They are finding it to be a slow process that can take months or years for a decision.

## It Will Be A Long Wait

The pipeline to deal with asylum-seekers has become clogged, immigration lawyers say. More conflicts in the Middle East have brought more refugees — people escaping violence — to the United States.

The U.S. government is deciding slowly, too. Government officials are worried that violent extremists may use the asylum system to sneak into the United States.

"I don't have a plan B," Abdulateef said. "This is a new life, a whole new life, and it's worth fighting to stay here."

The point of the asylum system is to provide a safe place for foreigners who are threatened at home. It seems then, that Abdulateef's case should be an obvious "yes."

Before he was allowed to visit the United States, Abdulateef went through many security checks. He was already fluent in English.

Abdulateef's attorney, David Garfield, took his case for free. Garfield said even a clear case like Abdulateef's is not enough for a quick decision from the government.

## Many Strong Cases To Stay

Garfield is representing other Iraqis who also have strong cases. There are female doctors escaping kidnapping threats and a man who is being threatened because he converted to Christianity.

The cases have dragged on for nearly a year, and the Iraqis do not know what lies in their futures.

"It looks like they're just sitting on the Iraqi cases," Garfield said. "All these letters, they just don't get responded to. There's been no decisions — no denials, no approvals."

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office handles asylum cases. It reported that 1,133 Iraqis applied for asylum in 2014. Only 788 applied the year before. Part of the rise could be due to the violent Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Islamic State is a radical group in Iraq and Syria that wants to set up its own country under strict Islamic law.

Today, there are more than 1,300 asylum cases from Iraqis still open.

## International Language of Music

Abdulateef, who is 23, faces serious threats if he returns to Iraq. Violent fighters there have a history of attacking musicians and other artists.

His trip to the United States might have made things worse. He bonded with American musicians — playing Metallica on his oud. He was introduced to instruments like the mandolin.

Because the cultural exchange was paid for by the U.S. government, Abdulateef is now linked to the U.S. government in the eyes of Iraqi extremists.

Abdulateef said he did not come to the United States with the idea of applying for asylum. He learned of the asylum process from American friends, who steered him to Garfield, the immigration attorney.

To apply for asylum, Abdulateef had to turn in an affidavit. That is an official document telling his story. While his experiences are unique, they also echo the faded hopes of many Iraqis who dream of living in a country where basic freedoms are protected.

"All I want is to be safe from fear and be able to continue my musical career," Abdulateef's affidavit says.
