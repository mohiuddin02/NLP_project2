WASHINGTON â€” On Monday, the Supreme Court told employers that they cannot discriminate on the basis of religion. Federal anti-discrimination laws require employers to accept and make adjustments for the religious practices of employees and job applicants, the court said.

By an 8-1 vote, the justices sided with a Muslim girl who was rejected for a job at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch because she wore a headscarf, also called a hijab. The girl, who was 17 years old, had accused the popular clothing store chain of discriminating against her simply because she is Muslim.

The court's liberal justices have long championed religious minorities in discrimination cases. Recently, however, the court's conservatives have also been embracing claims of religious liberty. The shift has come as Christian conservatives have more frequently been put on the defensive over issues such as abortion and gay rights.

Last year, a conservative majority ruled in favor of the religious owners of the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores. They declared that the owners did not have to offer certain birth control methods as part of the company's health plan, as would normally be required by law.

## Abercombie &amp; Fitch Defends "Look Policy"

Monday's opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia ruled in favor of Samantha Elauf, who wore a black headscarf to a 2008 job interview for a sales position at an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store in Oklahoma. She was turned away because managers thought her scarf would clash with the retailer's image.

In its defense, the company said it had a standard "look policy" for its sales staff that did not include wearing a headscarf. It also said Elauf had never informed it of her religion nor of her need for accommodation based on her faith.

However, in the courtroom Monday, Scalia dismissed the company's claim. The store's managers must have known or "at least suspected" that Elauf wore the headscarf for religious reasons, he said.

Scalia said the Civil Rights Act of 1964 puts the legal burden on employers not to discriminate. It gives "favored treatment" to religion, he said, and "religious practice is one of the protected characteristics ... that must be accommodated."

## Company Intended To Avoid Issue, Majority Says

The majority ruled that it did not matter whether Elauf told the company of her need for religious accommodation. What counted was the company's desire to avoid making such an accommodation.

Experts in workplace discrimination said the decision could have a wide impact.

"This case dramatically changes the standards that apply to employers," said Michael Droke, a Seattle lawyer. "It removes the requirement that an employee or applicant request a religious accommodation."

The decision was welcomed by a wide variety of religious groups, including Sikhs, Orthodox Jews, Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists and the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

## Retailer's Representative Denies Discrimination

Carlene Benz, a spokeswoman for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, denied that the company had discriminated against Elauf. She said the retailer allowed workers to wear headscarves when requested for religious reasons.

Benz said the chain's "look policy" has been replaced by "a new dress code that allows associates to be more individualistic."

Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett saw the decision as reflecting the nation's broad support for religious liberty. "The free exercise of religion takes place every day, not just on holy days, and in all aspects of life, including work," he said.

The left-right support for religious claims in the United States is in sharp contrast to France, which has sought to keep religion out of public spaces and schools. Last year, a French appeals court upheld the dismissal of a Muslim day care employee for refusing to remove her headscarf at work. A law banning the wearing of full-face veils in public was introduced in 2010.

## U.S. Constitution Cites Freedom Of Religion

The U.S. Constitution forbids the government from interfering with the "free exercise of religion," and several federal laws forbid discrimination based on religion.

Monday's ruling was the second one this year in which a Muslim plaintiff prevailed. In January, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of a Muslim man who is being held in an Arkansas prison. He had sought the right to maintain a short beard despite the prison's "no beards" policy.

Even though the Civil Rights Act has been on the books since 1964, the Supreme Court has said remarkably little about its protection against religious discrimination. The law is better known for banning racial discrimination by schools, colleges, employers and businesses.

It says employers may not "refuse to hire" or otherwise discriminate against someone because of their "race, color, religion, sex or national origin." And the law says religion "includes all aspects of religious observance or practice as well as belief."

## Exceptions Allowed For "Hardship" On Business

Religious claims, however, do not always win. The law says employers must make a "reasonable accommodation" for an employee's religious practices, except when doing so would put an "undue hardship on the conduct" of the business.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces the law, sued on Elauf's behalf. A federal judge ruled that she was a victim of illegal discrimination and a jury awarded her $20,000 in compensation.

However, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver reversed the decision and said the company was not liable because she did not ask for a special accommodation for her religion.

Justice Clarence Thomas, who once headed the EEOC, was the lone dissenter on Monday. He said the company enforced a "neutral policy" on appropriate attire for the entire sales staff. Applying such a neutral policy to any particular individual does not amount to "intentional discrimination," he argued.

The justices sent the case back to the appeals court in Denver.
