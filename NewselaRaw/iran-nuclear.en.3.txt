TEHRAN, Iran â€” An important agreement between Iran and other countries, including the U.S., began Sunday. It slows down Iran's work on its nuclear program. Many had worried that Iran could build a very powerful nuclear bomb.

In 1979, the Iranian people threw out the government. They put Muslim religious leaders into power. The religious leaders ended many freedoms. They were also very anti-American and hated Western ideas, values and culture. In response, the United States and other countries began trade restrictions against Iran. The Middle Eastern country has a lot of oil. Yet, because of the trade restrictions, it was not allowed to sell its oil to most countries. Likewise, many countries refused to sell their goods to Iran.

Now, Iran will be able to trade again with other countries.

## Little Hope For Change In Near Future

Still, many Iranians doubt that life will get much better anytime soon. Others do not understand what all the fuss is about.

"I can't figure out what this deal is, but I hope it will be good for us," said Bahram Asgari. He is a carpet salesman with three children. "All I know is that prices keep going up, and it is harder and harder to make ends meet."

In the gold market, shop windows glittered with bracelets, rings and necklaces. Not many people are buying gold, store owners said.

"Business is very slack," said Asghar Nouzad, one of the gold sellers. "I don't see much to hope for in the future."

## President Asks Iran To Wait Until Spring

Hassan Rouhani is the president of Iran. On Sunday, he warned that people should not expect to see any change until spring when Iran starts selling its oil. The government does not want people to think that the deal will solve all their problems. Few Iranians seem to believe that anyway.

Iran's leaders do not want people to think that they have given in to U.S. demands. In fact, they have been giving even more speeches against the United States.

Officials say the deal is complicated, and it will take months for Iran to start cutting down on its nuclear program. Sometime in the middle of 2016, Iran should be able to begin trading like other countries, officials say.

## Working Multiple Jobs To Make A Living

The trade restrictions have made life difficult for Iranians. Many have had to take several jobs, and many senior citizens have begun driving taxis.

Ali Reza is 62 years old and has three children. He retired 10 years ago after working for the Iranian air force. Ten years ago, his retirement pay equalled about $2,500 a month. It is now worth about $600 a month, which is not enough to support his family.

Reza now works as a cabdriver to make more money.

"Nothing will ever change here," Reza said.

## Young Iranians Show More Confidence In Future

Iran's young people are more hopeful.

Parisa Jalili, who is 24 years old, was eating with her boyfriend at the Naderi restaurant. Her job is to decorate people's homes. Jalili hopes the agreement will mean that people will have more money. She hopes they spend that money decorating their homes.

Many young Iranians have college degrees, but there are few good jobs.

Ramin Haderi, who is 25 years old, is an engineer and earns about $600 a month. He said he believes that people from other countries will come and spend money in Iran.

Sam Madikians, who owns the Naderi restaurant, said that people are beginning to have hope.

## Clergy Says American Ideas Are Still Unwelcome

Iran's religious leaders have made a point over and over again: They say that Iran will not become more open to American ideas.

At Tehran University, people attended Friday prayers. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, who is 88, warned that Western values were not welcome in Iran. An ayatollah is an important Muslim religious leader.

"Yes, we made the nuclear deal, but that's it," said Abbas Khorramabadi, who was at the prayer service. He added that the values of America and Europe will not win.
