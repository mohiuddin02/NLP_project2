A recent study confirms what cat owners have long known: Our cats understand us when we talk to them â€” they're just not that interested in what we have to say.

A study by two University of Tokyo researchers determined that cats can recognize their owners' voices and can easily distinguish them from the voices of strangers. Conducted by Atsuko Saito and Kazutaka Shinozuka, the test included 20 domesticated cats from 14 homes.

The animals were tested in their own familiar places. This was done to ensure that the nervousness cats feel in strange surroundings wouldn't affect the tests.

With the owners out of the cats' line of vision, researchers first played recordings of three strangers calling the cats' names. Those recordings were followed by a call from the cats' owners and then by the call of another stranger.

## Standoffish With Strangers

Researchers charted the cats' reactions by measuring a number of responses. These included head movements, tail and ear movements, eye dilation, vocalization and whether they moved their paws.

When strangers called their names, the cats had no reaction to the voices whatsoever. When the cats heard their names being called by their owners, they moved their heads and ears to locate where the sound was coming from.

Researchers say it proves that while cats can distinguish their owners' voices, their responses are not communicative.

In other words, he hears you just fine, he just doesn't care what you want from him.

Cat owners will just have to accept and appreciate that they get even that much of a response from a species that obviously believes we are on the planet to do its bidding.

The study suggests that the reason cats are so standoffish might be traced back to their early domestication 10,000 years ago. Dogs are bred and have evolved "to follow their owner's orders, but cats have not been," study co-author Saito said. They were not domesticated to work with people as dogs were and, consequently, feel themselves our equals.

Cats originated in the Middle East from wild cats that killed rodents and kept them out of farmers' grain stores.

## Aloof From Owners (Mostly)

It appears that as soon as we welcomed them into our homes, cats quickly began to train humans to their wills.

Recent studies have shown that dogs have an advanced ability to pick up social cues from humans. Over time, dogs learned how to "read" humans' every movement from body language to hand and eye movement. Cats, on the other hand, pretty much evolved on their own.

Let's face it. Cats view humans as big, clumsy cats and treat us the same way they treat each other.

Cats live to be served and adored.

Which is not to say they haven't developed a keen ability to get what they want from us. How many cat owners have not experienced the joy of a hungry cat waking us by swatting our faces until they rouse us from sleep at 5 a.m.? And we respond as quickly to loud vocalizations of their demands as we do to a crying baby who needs a diaper change.

So, if you are thinking about adopting a cat, be realistic: Don't expect them to swish their tails and come running like the family dog when it's called.

A cat isn't generous with its love and that love must be well earned. Get used to it.
