CHONGQING, China â€” On May 4, 1939, 7-year-old Chen hid inside a crowded cave in Chongqing, China. Bombs fell outside. Small bits of metal flew everywhere. Chen was badly hurt. Both of her parents were killed.

Chen is now 83 years old. She cried as she remembered being alone. Chongqing is in southwest China, which is in Asia. During World War II, it was the capital of China.

Chen said she cried every day for her parents.

Chen's wounds can still be seen on her face and arm.

## Millions Of People Died In The War

In 1937, Japan invaded China. No Chinese city was bombed as hard as Chongqing.

From 1938 to 1941, Japanese planes bombed Chongqing. The city was hit more than 200 times. Nearly 12,000 people were killed. The worst two days of bombing were on May 3 and 4, 1939.

After the war ended, Chongqing was forgotten. For many years, no one really talked about Chongqing. In the last few years, that has changed.

Historian Rana Mitter wrote a book called "Forgotten Ally." It is about China during World War II, which ended in 1945. The book tells how Chongqing and China fought against Japan. About 14 million Chinese people died.

Mitter said the bombing was scary. Few cities have been bombed as badly as Chongqing.

## Chongqing Is Now A Bigger City

After Chen's parents died, she lived in a tent. She collected coal to sell. She found a job in a factory and got married. Chen became a mother, a grandmother and a great-grandmother.

Chongqing has recovered from the bombing. It has been rebuilt. Chongqing is now full of tall buildings. About 29 million people live there.

Over the last 20 years, both China and Chongqing started remembering the bombings. A museum in the city has exhibits about it.

## Museum Honors Partners

Chongqing also shows the partnership between the United States and China. A museum in the city honors the "Flying Tigers." Most of them were American pilots. They defended China in 1941 and 1942. Nearby is the wartime home and headquarters of General Joseph "Vinegar Joe" Stillwell. He was a United States Army general who commanded some troops in the Chinese army.

There is a sign at the museum's entrance. It says that Chinese and Americans fought side by side against the Japanese.
