SEATTLE â€” There are many fish at the Vancouver Aquarium in Canada.

The veterinarians there work hard to keep the fish healthy. A veterinarian is an animal doctor.

There are rockfish at the aquarium. Sometimes, rockfish have problems with their eyes. One rockfish had to have an eye removed.

The other fish saw the rockfish with only one eye. They started to attack it. Maybe they thought it was weaker, said Dr. Lesanna Lahner. She is a veterinarian at the Seattle Aquarium.

The one-eyed rockfish hid from other fish. It stayed behind the rocks in the tank.

## Time For A New Eye

The veterinarians came up with a plan. They would give the fish a new eye. It is a glass eye.

Dr. Lahner has been giving fish new eyes for years.

It took doctors about 20 minutes to give the rockfish a glass eye. First, they gave the fish medicine to put it to sleep. They kept the fish wet. Lahner popped the new eye into place. Finally, she used fishing line to hold the eye in.

## Happy And Swimming

The rockfish is back to normal with its new eye.

"It is now out in the open and behaving like a normal fish," the doctor said.

In the past, aquariums did not give fish new eyes. They were put to sleep. Now these fish can have a normal life.
