WASHINGTON - It's 10 a.m. Monday and the call center of Connecticut's new health insurance exchange is bustling with questions. An elderly man calls to ask if the land he owns will count as income to qualify for health coverage through Medicaid. A legal immigrant asks if she can sign up for a health plan through the state's online insurance marketplace. A broker wants help to become certified to start selling coverage.

The insurance exchange was established under the Affordable Care Act, the federal health law. About 25 operators in blue shaded cubicles are talking on telephone headsets while a dozen more callers wait on hold.

"It's controlled chaos," said David Lynch, the call center manager for the marketplace.

Consumers have been having trouble shopping and enrolling in plans through healthcare.gov. That website, run by the federal government for residents of 36 states, has been plagued by bugs. President Barack Obama touted the call centers last week as one of several alternatives for consumers having trouble shopping and enrolling in plans through healthcare.gov.

"The call centers are available," he said, reciting the telephone number â€“ 1-800-318-2596. "You can talk to somebody directly and they can walk you through the application process. Once you get on the phone with a trained representative, it usually takes about 25 minutes for an individual to apply for coverage, about 45 minutes for a family."

But consumer advocates say the centers were never meant to be an alternative to the insurance exchange website. They were only supposed to be a way to offer some consumers more help to understand their options.

## A Poor Substitute

"The telephone call center is not a realistic alternative to the website," said Adam Linker, a health policy analyst for the North Carolina Justice Center, a consumer advocacy group. "The marketplace was billed as a place to easily shop and compare plans, but on the phone there is no real way to do that."

Others agree that the call centers' representatives can provide only limited help to those who want to shop for coverage. That's because some states have dozens of plans to choose from. That process  could take hours to sort through on the telephone. In addition, the representatives are also having trouble getting information from healthcare.gov, which affects their ability to verify people's identities and income.

One healthcare.gov operator acknowledged that she cannot provide exact prices and benefits before a caller answers a series of questions to set up an account and his or her identity. She can only offer average premiums in a particular area without going through that process.

## Operators On Hold

Call center operators face many of the same delays as consumers because of the malfunctioning federal website, said John Foley, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County in Florida. The group received federal funding to help people navigate enrollment

"We are facing the same glitches on the telephone," he said. He is advising people to wait until the website becomes easier to use.

An administration spokeswoman said that as of Wednesday, federal call centers have received more than 1.3 million calls and are enrolling people in plans.

There are 17 call centers with more than 10,000 trained representatives to assist consumers. They are managed through a $530 million one-year contract with Vangent. States such as Connecticut that have set up their own state marketplace also have their own call centers.

Timothy Jost is a consumer advocate and law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. He said that for the young and healthy, who may be less motivated to sign up, hours-long phone calls to buy coverage "probably will not suffice."

## A Win For Connecticut Consumers

The situation is easier in the Hartford call center, since Connecticut has set up its own exchange and its website is functioning. Since Access Health CT opened on Oct. 1, an average of 1,300 people a day have called or asked for assistance to help fill out applications. Over 10,000 residents have started applications and more than 4,200 have enrolled in plans.

"Telephone assistance is something that people really want," said Lynn Quincy, a senior policy analyst with Consumers Union. "Many people are intimidated by the task of buying insurance on their own."

Benjamin Hunnicutt, who manages the Hartford call center, said most callers are older or poorer than people using the website. The top questions are about premiums and how to estimate 2014 income to calculate what federal discount they might be eligible for. The operators also have access to provider networks so they can tell callers if their doctor or hospital is in a given plan.

Some do enroll over the phone, which can take about 50 minutes. The exchange did not know how many had completed enrollment online.

Telephone enrollment is easy in Connecticut, however, because just three companies are selling a total of 16 plans. In states such as California and Florida where more than a dozen companies are selling plans, that could take much longer, Hunnicutt said.
