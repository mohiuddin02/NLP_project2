WASHINGTON â€” In 2011, police in Rialto, California, shot and wounded a man. At first, the shooting had many people angry. It looked as if there might be big protests, like those seen recently in Ferguson, Missouri.

Witnesses said the man was unarmed. Anger grew after cellphone video was released that made it look as if police had overreacted. The video was recorded from a nearby balcony.

In the Ferguson case, it is still not clear why Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown. In Rialto, however, what happened is clearly known.

The reason for the difference is simple: In Rialto, an officer was wearing a small camera on his uniform.

The officer's camera revealed what witnesses did not see: The suspect ran into the street waving a handgun in the air. The Rialto police had been accused of using too much force. The video allowed them to defend themselves.

"We were very, very upset" by the charges of using too much force, said Captain Randy De Anda. The video, he said, showed the facts.

## Camera Use Will Likely Grow

Cop cameras are catching on around the nation. Their use probably will grow as the anger over Ferguson continues.

Body-worn cameras are usually placed on an officer's jacket or cap. The Los Angeles Police Department is testing them out. This week, New York said it will also do so.

Some police departments are resisting the cameras. Others, however, say that there are benefits for them.

The "public has this type of technology with cellphones and iPads," De Anda said. Why not "our officers too?"

The cameras certainly can make a difference.

Take a case that happened last month in Salt Lake City, Utah. On Aug. 11, an officer shot and killed a 20-year-old man. The shooting occurred just two days after Brown was killed.

In Utah, however, things were different than they were in Ferguson. The officer was wearing a body camera. The video should help show whether the officer acted properly.

According to Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank, the video will provide something important: a record of what the officer saw. It will show what happened "through the eyes of a police officer."

"These cameras are capturing good work by law enforcement. If we're doing something wrong, it will capture that too," Burbank said. Either way, having a true picture of what really happened is a good thing for law enforcement, he added.

## Many People Support Cameras

Burbank said the city started with 15 cameras two years ago. By the end of next month, around 440 officers will have them. Across the country, he said, about a dozen cities use cameras.

California Congressman Adam B. Schiff is a big supporter of cop cameras. Having a "video record of events" is very useful, he said. Police know they are being recorded. As a result, they are careful not to act improperly. At the same time, cameras can help clear officers if they are falsely accused.

In Los Angeles, about 30 officers have been testing out cameras. The goal is to purchase 500 cameras.

In Rialto, 120 officers were given cameras in early 2012. Since then, claims of police misconduct have dropped dramatically.

De Anda said the city spent $100,000 on the cameras over the two years. The money was well worth it.

"We have had a big success," he said. "Great success."
