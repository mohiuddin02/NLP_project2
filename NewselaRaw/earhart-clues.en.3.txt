MIAMI — The photo of famous female pilot Amelia Earhart was taken on June 1, 1937, in the shadows before dawn. It shows her plane on a Miami runway moments before she took off on her doomed flight around the world.

The picture, though, contains a strange detail. There's a shiny silver patch that doesn't show up on any of the other pictures of Earhart's plane.

Could it be a clue to what happened when Earhart vanished over the Pacific Ocean three months later?

Longtime Earhart investigator Ric Gillespie thinks so. He thinks the silvery patch is proof that the plane had a repair. He hopes to use a computer to link it to a scrap of metal that possibly broke off Earhart's plane. The piece of metal was found on a tiny Pacific island in the area where Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan disappeared.

Gillespie hopes to match the photo to the wreckage. Someone would have to admit "that Noonan and Earhart weren't lost at sea, but made it to the island," Gillespie said. Gillespie is the head of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR). The group investigates missing plane cases and finds old planes.

If Gillespie is successful, it would solve one of the greatest mysteries in the history of airplanes.

## The Missing Window Mystery

Earhart was one of the world's most famous women when she and Noonan attempted to be the first to fly around the world. She was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic. She was also a feminist before the word was invented. Earhart wanted women to be allowed to become anything they wanted.

Their trip didn't go well from the start. First, Earhart and Noonan landed at the wrong airport in Miami. The landing was rough and the plane needed to be fixed.

One of the windows was removed in the back of the plane. That window can clearly be seen in photos of Earhart's plane taken at the start of her trip.

But in the photo shot on June 1, 1937, the window is gone. It is replaced by that odd silvery plate.

The window must have been broken by the hard landing in Miami, Gillespie said. "So they just took it out and patched the (plane) instead."

## The Antenna Was Next To Go

Then a month later, a radio antenna on the bottom of her plane tore away.

Nineteen hours later, she radioed, "We are circling but cannot see island, cannot hear you." Messages continued for more than an hour before Earhart gave her location: "We are on the line of position 157 dash 337. … We are now running north and south."

After that was silence.

Rescue ships began looking for Earhart right away. Search planes passed over Gardner Island 400 miles away. They spotted signs that someone had recently been there, but the planes moved on.

Later, British records showed a human skeleton and a woman's shoe had been found on Gardner Island. The bones disappeared long ago.

In 1991, during an expedition to Gardner, TIGHAR found a scrap of aluminum with rows of holes. The scrap looked like it was torn from the outer skin of an airplane.

Tests showed the scrap was made from a material used in all American planes made in the 1930s. But the pattern of holes didn't match the holes on Earhart's Lockheed Electra.

Investigators wanted to see if the scrap could have come from the plane's patch. They began looking at pictures. Only one shot offered a good view of the patch — the 1937 photo.

If we can match that hole pattern in the photo, Gillespie said, "I don't see how anybody can argue against this anymore."

## Many Heard Distress Calls

Gillespie thinks Earhart landed her plane on a coral reef off Gardner Island and radioed for help.

After she disappeared, more than 100 shortwave radio listeners reported distress calls from a woman identifying herself as Earhart. At the time, they were considered fakes. But Gillespie believes some of them may have been real.

One of the reports came from a Florida teenager named Betty Klenck. She died recently at the age of 92.

Three days after the plane went down, Betty heard a call on her radio from someone calling herself Earhart. For three hours, the teenager listened, taking notes. The woman asked for help. She said: "Oh, if they could hear me."

Officials weren't interested in the notebook and thought Betty made up the story. Yet the notebook contains information Betty couldn't possibly have known. The woman may really have been Earhart, calling from Gardner Island.
