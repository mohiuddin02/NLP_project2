COLUMBIA, Mo. — University of Missouri football player J'Mon Moore decided it was time to visit the protesters. The angry students were camped out in tents on a school plaza. They were demanding that the university do something about growing racism at the school.

The university's problems began months earlier after several black students said they were called ugly racist names. Many black students believe racism is increasing at the school. They say they no longer felt safe.

Many students quickly became angry at the school's president, Tim Wolfe. They said he was not doing enough to fight racism at the school.

Things got worse after Wolfe had police arrest several black students who were trying to speak with him. Soon, there were more protests at the school.

A black student named Jonathan Butler went on a hunger strike. He declared he would not eat until Wolfe had stepped down.

## Thirty Players Joined The Strike

Moore knew about all this. After talking to the tent city protestors, he decided he had to get more involved. Moore spoke to Tigers teammate Anthony Sherrils and told him he wanted to do something to support Butler.

Moore and Sherrils then spoke to teammates Ian Simon and Charles Harris. Soon, the push to support Butler began to spread. Saturday night, the players told their coach they planned to stop playing until the president was gone.

Later that night, the football players' protest began. Thirty black members of the team announced that they would not play or practice as long as Wolfe remained the school's president. The players also released a photo of themselves linking arms with Butler.

## Coaches Supported The Players

On Sunday, coach Gary Pinkel said he supported his players' decision. He said the other coaches were all behind the players as well.

"I'm talking to guys who have tears in their eyes and they're crying," Pinkel said. "And they asked me if I'd support them, and I said I would." Pinkel said he did not think about what might happen to him. "It was about helping my players, and supporting my players when they needed me."

On Monday, Wolfe announced that he would step down. As for the players, they had earned themselves a place in history. Their bold move had led to real change.

The players wanted "to make a difference and stand behind Jonathan," Moore said, speaking of Butler.

## Players Have The Power

Professor Shaun Harper is an expert on race and education. "These black football players understood that they have the power" to shape what happens at their university, he said. "That is so rare."

No other black students have as much power at universities as black football players do, Harper said. Never before have they used that power so boldly.

Most black student-athletes do not realize they have the power to bring about change, Harper said. Perhaps what just happened at the the University of Missouri will teach them that they do.

If black student-athletes elsewhere "do what these guys just did" they could make an enormous difference, Harper said. They would be able to greatly help all black students.

## A Man's Life Was More Important Than A Game

After Wolfe stepped down, the striking football players gathered with other students to celebrate.

Simon said Butler's hunger strike made the players feel they had to do something. "A fellow black man's life was on the line," he said. "We love the game, but at the end of the day, it is just that — a game."

The success of the players strike should be a lesson "to all of the athletes across the country that you do have power," Harris said. It all started with a few players "on our team and look what it's become," he said. "Look where it's at right now."
