### PRO: Provide visas when justified, send home safely when necessary

INDIANAPOLIS — Southwest Indiana is a long way from the U.S.-Mexico border, but the area recently became a hot spot of undocumented children from Mexico and Central America who snuck their way into the country.

From 2004 to 2010, the federal government hired a privately owned youth jail center in Vincennes, Indiana, to house immigrant children. It was meant to hold the children considered the most dangerous.

These children arrived at the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village after being identified at the border because of tattoos or suspicion of drug use and other offenses in their home countries. Others had caused trouble or run away from less secure holding centers in the United States. A few had U.S. police records.

As the director of the Immigration Clinic of Indiana University's school of law, I traveled to Vincennes with volunteer law school students. We went to provide legal assistance to these kids.

## "Know Your Rights"

The federal government helped pay for the Immigration Clinic students and me to give "Know Your Rights" presentations to the children. We explained to them their legal rights and what they could expect once they went to immigration court.

Children — like adults — have no legal right to government-provided attorneys in immigration proceedings. As a result, we interviewed the children to match strong cases with volunteer attorneys.

We found children fleeing domestic abuse, gang violence and drugs. Some were raped and mistreated in other U.S. holding centers.

These children were eligible for U.S. government protection in the form of asylum and other special visas. The visas, which grant them permission to stay in the U.S., are for abandoned children and victims of crime and human trafficking. Many children have been trafficked from their homes to other places and forced to work. Many were reunited with family in the United States. Others went home voluntarily. Some were deported.

## SWAT Team At Protest

At one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes staged a peaceful sit-down to protest the conditions in which they were held. The local Knox County SWAT team was called in with riot gear, billy clubs and a police dog. Children were subject to lockdown, solitary confinement and other abuse.

When they told IU's law school students of the holding center's bad treatment, we notified the federal government, which took immediate action. Shortly thereafter, the privately owned center stopped housing immigrant children.

The federal treatment of today's immigrant children is like what happened at Vincennes, although on a much larger scale.

The violence in Central America is increasing because the U.S. keeps buying illegal drugs and guns from there. Children are gathering along the border. Volunteer attorneys are being recruited to travel to these sites to deliver "Know Your Rights" presentations and individually screen children. Privately paid attorneys and those offering their services for free are representing children reunited with families throughout the country.

U.S. immigration and refugee law protects survivors of violence and persecution. Attorneys, law school students and other volunteers are now stepping up and coordinating their services with the federal government.

## Protecting The Children

Certainly, it is not a perfect system. But the Obama administration continues to demonstrate a commitment to protecting undocumented children within today's political and legal limits.

Part of that effort includes figuring out whether children in Honduras should count as refugees. Individuals fearing persecution throughout the world have had the right to seek refugee status at U.S. embassies because of the Refugee Act of 1980.

These laws are built upon our historical protection of persons and acceptance of international agreements passed in the wake of World War II.

Not every child should be allowed to stay. But turning children away at gunpoint does not match with law and practice. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their legal rights protected, provided visas when justified, and sent back home safely as necessary.

### CON: Secure the border, discourage illegal crossings

WASHINGTON — Try as he might, President Obama cannot escape responsibility for the disaster at the U.S. southwest border. It's been caused, in part, by his administration's mismanagement.

Until Congress returns next month, he should use the tools he has to secure the border and to discourage illegal crossings. One can only hope that he will not take actions on his own that might make matters worse.

The president has been trying to walk a fine line. He wants to keep Latino leaders who support him happy, while at the same time convincing Central Americans not to start the perilous journey north. Although compassionate talk about immigrants is good politics, it is not good policy.

After all, the current crisis has been stoked by loose talk in Washington about a possible "amnesty" of illegal immigrants. Obama's 2012 decision to suspend deportation of youth with long-standing ties to the United States got people first talking about an amnesty that would pardon immigrants who crossed illegally. News that young children arriving at the border were being released until their hearings only increased the chatter.

## A Rush Across The Border

During a visit to Washington last month, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez blamed the unclear understanding of U.S. border enforcement for helping encourage people to rush across the U.S. border. It is part of what he calls the "pull factor."

Hernandez also explained the push factor: drug violence that creates insecurity and deadly street gangs preying on youth in his country and neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala. Unfortunately, these are poor nations with governments unable or unwilling to deal with these challenges.

Immigrant supporters assert that more than half of those arriving recently have legitimate claims that require a hearing under U.S. and international law to determine if they qualify as refugees.

That is contradicted by a Border Patrol survey in May that found that nearly all of those interviewed made the trek because of recent rumors of weak border enforcement. According to sources in Central America, so-called "coyotes" — criminals who make their living smuggling people — have been advertising weak U.S. border enforcement to drum up business.

## Crisis Fueled By Smuggling

In 2008, a law was passed to prevent human trafficking, a crime in which people are taken from their homes and forced to work elsewhere, usually in another country. Part of the initial problem in responding to the border crisis was the Obama administration's too broad use of that law. It requires a complicated hearing to determine if an immigrant should receive protection in the form of asylum, which allows them to stay in the U.S.

The current crisis is fueled primarily by smuggling, not trafficking. Border guards should be allowed to use their experience and judgment to screen for authentic refugee or trafficking cases.

Of course, real refugees in U.S. territory must be treated lawfully. However, the United Nations should work with local governments to offer relief to refugees in their country of origin. It shouldn't wait for them to run all the way to the U.S. border.

One thing that all can agree upon is that no one is better off risking the thousand-mile trek through Mexico. Many migrants are abused, robbed, raped or killed along the journey.

If the appearance of weak enforcement lures people to risk life and limb that must change immediately. Republicans made these arguments while crafting a tough measure. It would strengthen border enforcement, make it easier to deport new arrivals and send a clear signal that the border is being secured.

## Securing The Border

Although the president initially talked tough on border enforcement, his political advisers apparently recommended that he toss the "hot potato" to congressional Republicans.

However, securing the border is the responsibility of the president, not the Congress. And, the president does not need new authority to get a handle on this crisis. He can gain control of it by stating firmly that illegal crossings will be stopped, most new arrivals will be turned around, and that "amnesty-for-all" is off the table.

Seeking a domestic political "win" by blaming congressional Republicans for inaction on the border is extraordinarily irresponsible — even dangerous.

Not only does it prolong the current crisis, it undermines any agreements between Democrats and Republicans. They'll need to work together to pay the costs of the current crisis and to eventually rebuild an immigration system that is failing the country.
