LUKANG, Taiwan — In 1947, the Taiwanese government took away Kenneth Wang's father. At the time, Wang was not even 3 years old. The arrest was a case of political revenge. 

Japan ruled parts of Taiwan and China from 1931 to 1945. Taiwan is an island off of China. Wang's father served in an important government position under the Japanese. 

After China took back the island, the country killed many people who worked for the Japanese. Many teachers, doctors and educated people died. Historians estimate the number was 10,000 to 30,000 people. One of them was Wang's father.

"My mother went to ask for his body. They denied they had even taken him," Wang remembered. He moved to the United States in the 1960s and now lives in San Diego, California.

## Witnesses To History

This week, Wang was one of about 100 Californians who returned to Taiwan. All were born in Taiwan, and they belong to a group called Friends of Tsai Overseas. They came to vote in Saturday's election. They also came to witness a historic change in power.

On Tuesday afternoon, Wang stood by the road in Lukang in western Taiwan, with other member of Friends of Tsai. They were waiting to cheer on presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen. Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will probably win both the presidency and control of Parliament. The Nationalists, also known as the KMT, have been in control of Taiwan's government since 1949.

"Seventy years — it's been a long struggle," Wang said. "Finally, we are going to overcome the KMT."

Wendy Yang and her mother were part of the group. 

"My dad was an (anti-KMT) activist in the 1980s, and he received threats — some that even mentioned me, my middle school, the route I took," Yang recalled. "He sent us away for our own safety. That was 1992."

As American as she has become, Yang said, "I can't stay away from Taiwan. That tie is always there."

## Political Heavyweights — Even In Another Country

The KMT presidential candidate is Eric Chu. Both Tsai and Chu visited Southern California last year. They both wanted to win support from Taiwanese-born Americans.

Just about 1,500 of the Taiwanese who now live overseas will actually fly to Taiwan to vote. Still, Taiwanese political leaders say they are very important in the last days before the election. Since arriving last weekend, Yang's group has been attending two to three campaign events daily.

On Tuesday afternoon, they were in the town of Lukang. They waved flags and held up green banners to support the DPP's candidate, filmmaker Chen Wen-bin. Later, they led victory cheers, "Dong suan!" they chanted. Get elected!

"When I see all these overseas Taiwanese coming back, it's like a big family reuniting," said Chen, the DPP candidate.

## Decades Of Disagreement Over Leadership

More than 65 years ago, China fought a civil war, which ended in 1949\. The Chinese Communist Party kept control of mainland China, and the Nationalist Party ruled in Taiwan. Since then, each side has argued it was the rightful ruler of all of China.

For many years, the United States and other countries said the Nationalists were the real ruler of China. That situation has changed. China has become very rich. Communist leaders in China have used its power to press many countries to ignore Taiwan. China continues to insist that Taiwan and the mainland are part of "one China" and must be reunited some day.

Many Taiwanese — especially younger voters — want full independence from mainland China.

Chen said he hopes the overseas Taiwanese will support Taiwan's cause. The United States is an important ally of Taiwan. 

"These overseas Taiwanese can witness this election, this important moment," Chen said. They also should return to their home countries "to explain Taiwan's need for democracy and need for international support."
