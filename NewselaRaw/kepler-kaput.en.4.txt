SAN JOSE, Calif. - NASA's Kepler spacecraft has broken down far away in the galaxy. It was on a mission to hunt for new planets. That mission is probably over. But it still has a lot to teach us about outer space.

Scientists have only begun to dig through the huge amounts of information from the damaged Kepler. They hope to find proof of another planet like Earth.

"The signals are there," said NASA's William Borucki. "We have to search for them."

Kepler has been focusing its telescope lens on stars for the past four years. It has been trying to find the slight dimming that happens every time a planet passes in front of its sun. The passes are called "transits."

## Would Life Have Been Found?

The project has been a big success. It changed our view of the universe.

The spacecraft lived as long as it was supposed to. But scientists had hoped it would live far longer. Kepler would have collected so much information that scientists would have been sure they found signs of a planet like Earth if Kepler lasted until 2019, the researchers said.

"We'll work with what we have," said scientist Alan Gould. "We need to make the most of the data that it has already gotten." Since last July, two of Kepler's four gyroscopes have broken. That makes it impossible for Kepler keep a steady focus on a distant star.

Kepler's not quite dead and buried. Engineers will try to bring the gyroscopes back into service. They will also try to find other ways to make the spacecraft work.

Kepler has found some planets that cannot support living things. They are either too close or too far away from their suns. Or they are very big and full of gas, like Jupiter or Saturn.

Kepler has found 2,700 possible planets. Scientists have confirmed 132 of those as actual planets since the spacecraft's 2009 launch.

Most recently, it revealed some planets circling in the right orbit around stars Kepler 62 and 69. It calls this area a "habitable zone" because it can support life.

## More Planets To Come

Astronomers can use the information from Kepler to figure out the size and position of the passing planet. They have two years of information to look at.

"The most important discoveries are yet to come. They're in our back pocket," said Natalie Batalha, deputy science team leader for the mission.

More years of study would have given scientists the chance to confirm an orbit like the Earth's. "It's so frustrating. It's such a nail-biter," said scientist Laurance R. Doyle. "We are almost there. We really wanted to go the next mile to nail down an Earth and to tell if there are moons," he added. "The extended mission, with extra transits, would have told us that."

Kepler is not providing any more information. So it is even more important to understand what it has already found and look more closely for patterns that might suggest a planet like Earth. Computer experts like Erik Petigura will have to crunch the numbers to make sense of it all.

"We will extend and improve the software. There are more improvements to be made," Petigura said.

The scientists said they are excited by what remains, although they are sad about what could have been if Kepler's gyroscopes had not failed.

"It could have all ended on the launchpad," Gould pointed out. "We are delighted to have been a part of such a beautiful and almost perfect mission."

Scientists also have two more missions to look forward to. One is called the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. It will work similarly to Kepler to find possible planets nearby. TESS is scheduled to launch in 2017. The other is the James Webb Space Telescope. It will use its infrared vision to scan TESS's  finds for signs of organic molecules. It is set to launch in 2018.
