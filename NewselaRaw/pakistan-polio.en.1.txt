PESHAWAR, Pakistan — For the past year, the Pakistani army has been waging a campaign against militants in the northern tribal areas of Pakistan. Area experts say the effort has had an unmistakable effect on the fight against polio in the region.

There have been six reported cases of polio this year in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan compared with 56 in the same period last year. In October, a quarter-million children could not be reached by vaccination teams. That number dropped to 47,000 by May.

Northwest Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan, is a rugged, mountainous area. The tribes that live there face challenges from the Taliban, a violent extremist group fighting for control of the country.

## Vaccination Teams Have Greater Access

The Pakistani Taliban opposes efforts to bring polio vaccines to the tribal areas, alleging that the medical teams are a cover for Western espionage. In past years, militants have routinely attacked health workers and security teams carrying out vaccination drives, killing dozens.

The army's yearlong battle with the Taliban is credited with improving security in the tribal areas. Before beginning the offensive last June, the Pakistani army provided advance warning to locals, allowing residents as well as militants time to flee the area.

Now as people return to towns and villages cleared by army operations, vaccination teams have resumed their work. They are finding greater access to areas once seen as off-limits.

"Pakistan has done remarkably well this year because the areas are now being cleared of militants and accessibility has become easier," said Aziz Memon, chairman of Rotary International's PolioPlus program in Pakistan.

"There are areas that are still not within reach, where fighting is going on, where we hope to get to sooner or later," Memon said. "But the quality of the campaign has improved."

## "A Positive Difference"

The Independent Monitoring Board tracks progress in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative — the drive to eliminate the disease. The board, which has sharply criticized Pakistan in the past, noted "a positive difference" in anti-polio efforts in a May report.

Pakistan is one of only three countries, along with Nigeria and Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic or regularly found. All but one of the 24 polio cases reported this year have been in Pakistan, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

Polio is a viral disease that mostly affects children. It can be serious, causing paralysis, often of the legs, or death.

In the early 20th century, polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. Effective vaccines were introduced in the 1950s, and today, polio has been eliminated in much of the world.

Most of Pakistan is free of the deadly viral disease, but it has been difficult to eradicate in several pockets of the country. These include the tribal belt, the neighboring province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the seaside metropolis of Karachi. The tribal belt had more than half of the 307 polio cases Pakistan recorded in 2014.

## Displaced Families Receive Vaccinations

For years, U.S. officials had urged the Pakistani military to take stronger action against militants based on its soil. The United States has offered some praise for the yearlong offensive, called Zarb-e-Azb, the name of a sword said to have been used by the prophet Muhammad.

Pakistani army leaders say they have killed hundreds of militants, but the claims have been difficult to verify.

The Pakistani army's offensive focused largely on the North Waziristan tribal area, which is home to several militant groups. One group of Pakistani Taliban is led by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, who banned the polio vaccine in June 2012, saying he would allow it only after the United States ceased drone strikes. Unmanned drone aircraft are used by the U.S. government to bomb militants in isolated areas.

Due to the fighting, more than 1 million Pakistanis fled their homes in North Waziristan and other militant-controlled areas. Many took shelter in displacement camps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where they lived temporarily. There, for the first time, health workers could reach families that had been inaccessible.

As a result, 86 percent of the tribal areas are now covered by the vaccine, up from 47 percent, according to health officials.

## Still More People To Reach

Some pockets remain stubbornly out of reach. The Khyber Agency tribal area, near Peshawar, has emerged as a new trouble spot. It has seen five of the six polio cases in the tribal region this year. Two areas, Bara and Jamrud, remain extremely difficult for health workers to access.

"Our workers have been attacked in Bara and Jamrud, and they do not feel safe," said a health official in the tribal region who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation.

Dr. Naseer Hussain Shah, health director for the tribal areas, said that teams were slowly beginning to visit those areas. He said workers can now conduct door-to-door visits to provide oral vaccines in virtually all of the tribal region except Shek Toi, a small pocket in South Waziristan.

## Better Government Support Needed

But serious challenges remain, international officials say. Many militants have moved from the tribal areas to Karachi, the most populous city in Pakistan.

This internal migration has increased fear that the virus could spread through the city of more than 20 million and on to other parts of Pakistan.

The Independent Monitoring Board has also criticized Pakistan for problems paying salaries to its health workers. Morale has suffered among health workers because of the violence and lack of government support. A Pakistani government task force that was set to meet quarterly has not convened in nine months.

"We need the top leadership to take the ownership," Memon said. "The results are good, but the work is not yet done."
