SAN JOSE, Calif. — NASA wants to find and track asteroids and it has decided to ask the public for ideas. Some asteroids have the ability to wipe out life as we know it. Finding asteroids might mean securing the future of planet Earth.

In February 2013, 65-foot-wide asteroid exploded over Russia. It unleashed the force of 500,000 tons of TNT. Nobody had known it existed before. Afterward, NASA launched a series of contests. The space agency wanted to come up with ways to keep an eye on asteroids that could threaten Earth.

Currently, NASA thinks that we have only found 1 percent of the asteroids out there. And there are millions flying around our solar system.

## Aiming Right At Us

NASA calls the series of contests the Asteroid Grand Challenge. It says they are "a broad call to action." The hope is to defend Earth against asteroids that could be bearing down on us right this instant.

"Good ideas can come from anywhere," said Ben Burress. He is a staff astronomer at Chabot Space &amp; Science Center in California. "There are millions of asteroids we don't know about, so the idea of more information really is better. Are we going to be hit? Yes. The question is, when and by how big of an asteroid?"

In a video announcing the contests, a NASA narrator says, "Asteroid hunting is an activity everyone can get involved with. Survival is its own reward. It's up to each of us to protect our planet from asteroids."

## Did Dinosaurs See It Coming?

The narrator makes a challenge to all citizens of Earth. He says, "the dinosaurs would have cared if they knew about this problem."

But NASA is out of the business of launching humans into space. So "Earth's defense," as NASA calls it, is left in the hands of us regular people.

NASA first invited what it calls "citizen scientists" to join the search for killer asteroids in March. The agency extended the invitation at the South by Southwest festival in Texas. It was during a talk titled, "Are We Smarter than the Dinosaurs?"

On Friday, NASA ended the third contest of its competition. The task was to make computer programs to find hidden asteroids. No fewer than 422 people from 63 countries — from Argentina to Zimbabwe — submitted programs.

In all, NASA plans to award $35,000 this year. That will go to people who can figure out how to find hidden asteroids.

## Everyone Can Help

The software contests are managed by NASA. They also have a partner in the Harvard Business School. They help NASA manage its contests.

"For the past three years, NASA has been learning and advancing the ability to (use) coding skills. The NASA Tournament Lab has solved tough problems," Jason Crusan said in a statement. Crusan runs the lab. "We are now applying our experience with (software) contests to helping protect the planet from asteroids."

This year, NASA hopes to receive help from citizen scientists. It wants to be able to find and track asteroids, and know their size and shape. Then it needs to know whether they are real threats to Earth. Finally, NASA will come up with ways to prevent them from hitting and wiping out plants, animals and humans.

"This is a big global problem that needs everybody to solve," NASA spokeswoman Sarah Ramsey said. "We can't do it alone. That's the whole point of the grand challenge."

NASA plans 10 contests this year. Asked how long the entire Asteroid Grand Challenge will last, Ramsey said, "Until the problem's solved."
