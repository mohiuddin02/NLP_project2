A new issue is growing out of the drive for a higher minimum wage for fast-food employees: wage theft, a term for failing to pay workers what they're legally owed.

In recent months, lawsuits charging wage theft abuses have been filed on behalf of fast-food workers in three states. Public attorneys in some states have obtained hefty settlements from employers charged with violations.

The issue came to the forefront Thursday in front of three McDonald's and Burger King restaurants in Kansas City, Mo. Signs there proclaiming "wage theft" and "stolen wages" dotted a midday rally by the StandUpKC coalition. It was attended by about 250 members of the fast-food workforce, labor unions, and religious and legal leaders.

Corporate spokesmen for McDonald's and Burger King say wage theft is contrary to company policy and that allegations are investigated.

## When Wage Theft Occurs

Burger King said Thursday that the company "respects the rights of all workers." The company said it "does not make scheduling, wage or other employment-related decisions for the franchisees who independently own and operate almost 100 percent of Burger King restaurants."

These franchisees do not work for the Burger King company, and instead own their own Burger King restaurants. They pay the Burger King company for the right to open their own Burger King restaurant, called a franchise.

McDonald's has responded repeatedly to previous protests that it takes all complaints seriously and that the company and the owners of its restaurants are committed to comprehensive investigations.

Wage theft protests occurred in numerous cities in mid-March. The protests come on the heels of national raise-the-minimum-wage campaigns by President Barack Obama, some members of Congress, and the U.S. Department of Labor. Some of the activism — calls for "$15 and a union" — focus on a minimum wage of $15 an hour and the right to organize into unions to fight for workplace rights. Activists also point to the weak job market as a reason for raising the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage).

The activist groups say wage theft occurs if an employer:

— Alters time records to reduce paid work time. This is often done to avoid paying overtime hours. When employers ask employees to work longer hours than usual, they often have to pay workers more per hour.

— Violates minimum wage law by charging workers for uniforms or other costs.  This is a violation if it cuts pay below the minimum wage.

— Incorrectly lists workers as not being allowed to get overtime.

— Demands off-clock work, where workers aren't paid at all for extra hours of work.

## Activists: Problem Is Widespread

Hart Research Associates conducted a poll of more than 1,000 fast-food workers nationally. Nine in 10 said they had experienced some form of wage theft, such as being told to work off the clock. That means employees were working, but not logging hours to get paid.

Michael Saltsman is a spokesman for the Employment Policies Institute, a group that generally supports employers' interests in the restaurant industry. He said his organization doesn't take such polls very seriously.

"The idea of individual instances of wage theft are sure to exist, but the widespread idea is driven by those sympathetic to SEIU and their efforts to unionize," Saltsman said. SEIU is the Service Employees International Union.

Furthermore, he said, some Internet posts inviting restaurant employees to participate in the Hart poll offered the chance for a gift card. This was the same as paying someone to take a survey, he said.

But labor advocates said the problems are widespread. Lawsuits against McDonald's and some of its franchisees have been filed in California, Michigan and New York. In general, they say workers were forced to clock out but keep working, that overtime wasn't paid, and that pay was docked too deeply to pay for company uniforms.

Separately, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced that one McDonald's franchisee paid a $500,000 wage theft settlement. The restaurant owner allegedly did not pay workers for the costs of laundering their uniforms.

In another case, owners of 23 Domino's pizza outlets in New York agreed to pay $448,000 to workers who claimed they were paid less than minimum wage. A Domino's spokesman told a New York newspaper that the company had nothing to comment on because the case involved franchisees. Those franchisees are "independent business owners" and are responsible for how they treat their own employees, the spokesman said.

## "Hurts The Economy"

Labor advocates say wage abuses are hard to stop because the U.S. Department of Labor lacks the funds or staff to be aggressive investigators.

"There just aren't enough people to enforce the laws," said Catherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel at the National Employment Law Project. "Low-wage workers have it hard finding an attorney willing to take a wage case. And our enforcement system is based on workers willing to come forward and tell their stories — and that's really hard."

That's why labor activists are pushing group rallies that produce publicity but provide some safety in numbers.

"Wage theft hurts businesses that are trying to compete with cheaters," she said. "It hurts the economy when workers don't have money to spend."

Kim Bobo, founder of the nonprofit Interfaith Worker Justice, said a top remedy for abuses is for the Labor Department to require employers to provide statements that clearly show workers how they were paid.

New York and California have laws that require employers to provide such information, and so do some other places.
