President Barack Obama made an announcement on Monday. He said that the government will be making more rules for people traveling on airplanes. They will be for people flying in from other countries or within the United States. The rules are to help control diseases that can spread from person to person. Ebola is one such disease.

Ebola is a virus that has killed more than 3,400 people in Africa. Now, the disease is also in the United States.

A man named Thomas Eric Duncan traveled from the African country of Liberia to the United States. When he was on the plane, he was not sick. Days after he arrived in Texas, he became very ill.

He went to the hospital but doctors did not realize he had Ebola.

## The Disease Got Worse

Three days later, he became sicker and was rushed back to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. He was in a room by himself in the hospital. He must be kept away from the other patients because the disease could spread. Duncan was extremely ill.

Because doctors did not realize Duncan had Ebola, many are afraid. They believe the disease could have spread to others.

Forty-eight people are being watched closely for signs of Ebola. Ten of them are called "high risk" because they were near Duncan when he was sick. The rest of the people spent time with the 10 high-risk people.

David Lakey is the head of the health department for Texas. Lakey told reporters that they were continuing to watch the people who might have been near Duncan. They are still looking for people who might have spent time with the high-risk group. Lakey said that no one in either the high-risk group or the low-risk group has gotten sick yet.

Health officials also cleaned out the apartment Duncan was in. They were afraid his belongings could spread the virus. They threw away nearly all of his things.

## Government Will Start To Do More

Obama met with his top advisers about the country's health and safety. He and the officials will think about screening plane passengers more closely.

New rules could be announced shortly, one official said.

Rick Perry is the governor of Texas. He also said there should be more screening for people coming from outside of the country.

Governor Perry said he has a new 17-member task force. The group will deal with diseases like Ebola that could spread. Perry said the government should be extra careful when screening people coming into the United States. Screeners should take travelers' temperatures and use other medical tools to make sure they are not sick.

## Ebola's Worst Outbreak Ever Known

Duncan is not the only person in the United States being treated for Ebola. Ashoka Mukpo is a journalist who had been working in Africa. He became sick with Ebola while in Liberia. He was flown back to the United States for treatment. He is the fifth American with Ebola to return to the United States for treatment during the outbreak.

His father, Dr. Mitchell Levy, said his son wanted to help the people of Liberia. Levy said Mukpo lived there for two years. He was working with a charity there.

It was not known how Mukpo became infected. Levy said it may have happened when his son helped clean a car that someone with Ebola had been in.

Spain is also facing a case of Ebola. Officials there announced that a nurse has Ebola. She was helping care for two priests infected with Ebola and became sick. The nurse is the first person known to have gotten Ebola outside of West Africa. Everyone else got the disease by traveling there.

The World Health Organization says more than 3,400 people have died from Ebola since it broke out in West Africa. It is the worst outbreak of the disease on record.

>UPDATE: On Oct. 8, Thomas Eric Duncan died at 7:51 a.m. Central Time. He died at the Dallas hospital where he was being treated for Ebola.
