KERDASA, Egypt â€” Nearly three months after nearby residents looted and burned the Archangel Michael Christian church, Rida Gaballah, 49, stood among the ruins. Gaballah was one of the six people who tried to ward off hundreds of attackers.

Utterly dismayed by the missing pews, the charred paintings of Jesus and the cross ripped off from the front door, he simply kept repeating over and over again: "This scene is horrible."

The Egyptian government vowed to rebuild the church, one of 74 destroyed since the army removed President Mohammed Morsi on July 3. But work has yet to begin here. The church remains as a monument to the violence brought by Morsi's supporters, and to the government's failure to protect historic Egyptian institutions.

But Gaballah, like other Christians, is reluctant to criticize. "Of course they are doing enough," Gaballah said when asked about the government's efforts, even as the scene around him proved otherwise, just 16 miles from the capital Cairo.

## Churches Continue To Burn

The wave of attacks on churches sparked outrage in the weeks immediately after Morsi was pushed out of office. But now, for both Christians and Muslim Egyptians alike, that anger has been replaced by a complete silence, even though attacks continue.

The 74 best-documented cases of attacks on churches came between June 30 and Sept. 30, but there have been others since. No yet knows how many attacks have happened recently.

Christians make up an estimated 10 percent of Egypt's 92 million population. But they have never had an easy time in the country, often caught between a strictly non-religious government and sometimes hostile Islamists who want the country to return to a strictly Islamic, or Muslim, state.

Some of the Egyptian Muslims believe the Christians in the country are a threat to their vision of an Islamic Egypt.

Christians have never found Egyptian governments to be friendly toward them. In 1934, Deputy Interior Minister Ezabi Pasha imposed 10 conditions on Christians who wanted to build a church. They included that Muslims had to approve construction of a church, and churches could not face the Nile River or public facilities. No church was allowed to be built within 340 feet of a mosque.

Added to this, Egyptian governments have historically done little to protect Christians from the occasional outbreak of violence from Muslims. No one has ever been convicted in Egypt for destroying Christian churches, going back to 1972, when the first one was burned. There has been, at best, a single arrest in the most recent church burnings.

## "Terrified To Speak"

Yet Christians don't want to criticize the militarily imposed new government. Experts believe that they don't want to annoy the latest people in power, who have not used anti-Christian language like Morsi.

This was common during the year-long rule of the former president, an Islamist who rose to prominence through the secretive Muslim Brotherhood.

Much of the recent anti-Christian violence was triggered by Islamist religious leaders preaching that Christians were the reason for Morsi's removal from power.

When Morsi was president, violence against Christians was rare. But Christians in Egypt now think that a military government is better for them than a democracy dominated by Muslims.

"They see it as better to live under a strong regime than a democracy that elects Islamists," said Ishak Ibrahim, a Christian who is the freedom of religion and belief officer for a civil rights group in Egypt. "The choice before people is freedom or the right to live," Ibrahim said.

Egyptian Christians fear that pushing back against an increasingly authoritarian government could somehow lead to something they believe is worse, the return of the Islamists.

Youssef Sidhom is the editor-in-chief of Watani, Egypt's biggest Christian newspaper, which his father founded.

Sidhom said that there was a "national solidarity unifying Christians and Muslims against the horrible damage inflicted by the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi." But he now believes that the Christians are "terrified to speak."

## Police Don't Protect Churches

So there is little pressure on the government to do more for Christians. The police claim they didn't have enough forces to protect the roughly 2,000 churches in Egypt, particularly as their police stations were also set on fire during the outbreak of violence after Morsi's ouster.

A police colonel said there are no specific efforts to go after those who destroyed the churches. They also have no plans to question residents in the small villages who might know who was involved.

According to the police officer, protecting churches is not the police's responsibility. There are bigger battles to be fought instead. The police officers first want to find out who destroyed their police stations and lock up members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.

"Our job is not to protect churches," the colonel said, speaking in secret for his own safety. The police officer said they have arrested some people but that the villagers won't talk about who burned the churches because they are scared.

Other people believe the police have their own reasons for the lack of protection of churches. Every attack on Christians gives the government more reasons to chase after their political opponents, the Islamists, all with the public's approval.

Ahmed Ragab is a legal researcher who conducted a study of the destruction of churches and visited five cities where such attacks happened. He said that when churches are burned the government can blame the Muslim Brotherhood and win support for their crackdown on the Islamists.

In a statement two days after Archangel Michael Church was destroyed, the leader of Egypt's Christian church, Pope Tawadros II, called for national unity and for Christians to stand with the armed forces. While buildings were destroyed, Christians could pray anywhere, he said.

"If the hands of evil kill, destroy and torch, then God's hands are greater and they build," Tawadros said. "Christ's commandments to us are love your enemy, bless those who curse you, and do good to those who abuse you."
