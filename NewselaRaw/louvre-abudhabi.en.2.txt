PARIS â€” The United Arab Emirates is certainly rich enough to be a first-class nation. Now it wants the culture of a first-class nation and hopes it can get it by buying $550 million worth of art.

The Louvre Abu Dhabi museum will open its doors in December 2015. Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates, a country known for its flashy hotels, deserts and huge oil reserves. Organizers hope the museum will put it on the map for its oil paintings instead.

But the project has been raising eyebrows among Europeans, who say that culture takes more than a checkbook.

In Paris, the original Louvre museum on Tuesday showed the art that the Abu Dhabi project has bought since 2009. French President Francois Hollande opened the exhibition of the 160 works. The exhibition was called "Birth of a Museum."

## A Remarkable Collection

The exhibition includes religious items like a 19th-century Yemeni Torah and a 13th-century Gothic Bible. It also includes works by famous artists such as Yves Klein, Rene Magritte and Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso).

The country had a lot of money to spend. The result is a varied and remarkable collection.

"(We want to) establish Abu Dhabi as a place for cultural tourism," the Louvre Abu Dhabi's assistant curator, Khalid Abdulkhaliq Abdulla, said at the Paris exhibit.

He said the Louvre will be the highlight of a planned cultural district. The district will also include a branch of New York's Guggenheim and a national museum.

However, skeptics in France say the United Arab Emirates can't simply buy its way into being "cultured."

## Making A Country's Identity

The museum's renowned architect, Jean Nouvel, brushed off such critics. He suggested they are just annoyed or jealous that Europe now doesn't have the money to pay for such costly cultural projects.

"Do you think we did it any differently in Europe when we used to be more powerful?" Nouvel asked. "It's normal that an economic power translates this (power) through the act of acquiring cultural art."

The exhibit curator compared the Abu Dhabi of today to the United States in the early 20th century. Then, the U.S. was emerging economically, and private collectors started founding museums to showcase their artistic wealth.

"During this period we said the same thing ... but with hindsight what do we see? It's that European and Asian art are present in the U.S. and participated in making the American culture ... in making the country's identity. And I think that's what needs to be remembered," said curator Vincent Pomerade.

One expert noted that many European collections were built in less desirable ways.

"Buying in culture is far better than looting it, which is what most nations did for hundreds of years," said Julian Radcliffe of the Art Loss Register.

The Louvre project's next hurdle will be to convince the greater Arab world to accept the museum's bold artistic representations of sexuality and religion.
