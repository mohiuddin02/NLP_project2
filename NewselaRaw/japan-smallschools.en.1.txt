Each one contains just three desks in a space designed for many more.

"It's a little bit lonely," said Taiki Kato, 11, who said he was looking forward to going to middle school next year. "It's a bit bigger and there might be kids from other elementary schools."

The middle school has eight students. The elementary school has six, and two of them, the only girls, are from the same family.

That meant Principal Yukari Sudo had just six names to learn when she began working at the elementary school in this small village.

Learning the staff members' names took a little longer — after all, there were twice as many of them.

## Deserting The Countryside

Aone, population 638, has two small general stores and a grimy restaurant that some say may serve some of the worst food in Japan. The average age here is 62.

This scene is played out across Japan, from the island of Hokkaido in the north to the mountains along the west coast to here, close to the capital.

For decades, people have been deserting the countryside and heading to the skyscrapers and better job opportunities of Tokyo, Japan's capital city. Now, almost a third of Japan's 127 million people live in the greater Tokyo area.

With a rapidly aging society and a low birth rate, the situation is only going to get worse, experts say. By 2050, the number of children younger than 14 is expected to be half what it is now, as fewer people have fewer children and the proportion of people of child-bearing age shrinks. By the middle of the century, there will be be about 5 million Japanese in their 90s.

Like Aone, nearly half the public elementary and junior high schools in Japan are too small.

The government in Tokyo would like to close these small schools and fold them into others nearby.

"If a small school has less than five classes, it should seriously and aggressively consider integrating with another school with a sense of urgency," said Hiroto Iwaoka. He is the chief of education reform at the Education Ministry.

## From 254 To 6 Students

The high cost of running these schools isn't the only factor. Officials also worry that kids at small schools won't develop the social skills they need in the wider world, because they see the same handful of classmates every day, year in and year out.

Local districts are resisting the strong suggestion to close their tiny schools. Kyoko Inoue, chief of educational affairs in Sagamihara, the area that incorporates Aone, says there's no plan to close the elementary school here, even though there's a much bigger school, with about 80 kids, 5 miles away.

"A school often functions as a core of a community," she said. "We want a school to be something a local community desires."

Aone's elementary school began about 142 years ago. At its peak, in 1945, 254 students sat in its classrooms, and in the 1960s, it still had close to 200 students.

Even now, the whole building is open, although the rooms are heated only when they are used. Its music room is complete with a grand piano, the science room is stocked with lab equipment and the library is filled with books. All of this is now for just six kids.

For a class one day recently, the six students walked to a field where they planted potato seeds.

Next they had lunch — grilled fish, rice, and soup with tofu, bamboo shoots and asparagus — while classical music played. Afterward the six students collected shiitake mushrooms from the forest, then did stretching exercises in the gym.

## "We Stick To The Subject"

The school does manage to have sports days, even though there aren't enough players to form a whole soccer team. The teachers also have to be careful not to put too many kids in the cheering squad at once or there will be no one to play.

There are educational limitations, too, including the fact that teachers have to teach kids of different ages at the same time.

"When you have a bigger class, you can divide them into small groups and get them to come up with ideas, present them to the class," said teacher Sachiko Kaneko. "But when they're only one student in each grade, you can't do that."

"In a bigger school, children learn social skills and how to live in the real world," said Kotoe Arakawa, who teaches the younger children. "These kids are so well behaved and so gentle, so when they get into a bigger group they sometimes find it hard to speak out."

But there are some advantages to having such a small school, the teachers say. "There are no students that get left behind here, because we stick to the subject until each kid gets it," Arakawa said.

Chiharu Yamaguchi, the mother of the only two girls in the school, moved to Aone nine years ago and was shocked by how small the town was.

"I was worried about sending my kids to the school, but we decided to try it and I got to know the school and the parents and the teachers," she said, as she waited by the school gate to walk her daughters home. "And that got rid of my worries."
