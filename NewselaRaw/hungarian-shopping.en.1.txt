Hungarian lawmakers on Tuesday passed a bill that will ban most shopping on Sundays. They argued that doing so would ensure that families have more time together.

However, Hungary is struggling with 10.5 percent unemployment and levels of pay for those with jobs is not high. Even 25 years after the country went from communist rule to a capitalist system of free buying and selling, the job situation is tough. Thus, the bill limiting shopping at retailers is likely to come in for some popular resentment if, as stores warn, it results in them getting rid of workers through layoffs. Others worry that the government will have less money as a result of the law, as it collects taxes for each sale made in stores.

## Planes, Trains And Automobiles

The law, similar to Western European restrictions of shopping on the Christian Sabbath after World War II, is the political brainchild of Hungary's Christian Democratic People's Party, a major political party. Like laws in Germany, Austria, Holland and other countries, the Hungarian shopping ban is riddled with exceptions.

Pharmacies, tobacco shops, farmers markets and stores on military bases are permitted to operate on Sundays. Bakeries can also open between 5 a.m. and noon.

Shops at airports, train stations, gas stations and hospitals also are allowed to operate on Sundays. They can stay open as late as 10 p.m.

Small shops with less than 2,150 square feet of retail space are not covered by the law, but under a certain condition: Their Sunday workforce has to consist of people who own at least 20 percent of the business or who are family members of the owners.

The four Sundays preceding Christmas are exempt from the shopping ban. All retailers also will be allowed to open their doors once a year on a Sunday of their choosing.

## Let's Take A Vote

The National Association of Entrepreneurs and Employers opposed the law. The group warned this month that its passage would lead to about 20,000 layoffs. It vowed to organize a national vote on the shopping ban. The business group pointed out that a government study by its Economics Ministry said about 20 percent of Hungarians do the bulk of their weekly shopping on Sundays.

About 37 percent of Hungary's 10 million people are Roman Catholic, according to the CIA World Factbook. An additional 16 percent follow other Christian religions. Meanwhile, 18 percent say they do not believe in God and 27 percent fail to specify any religion.

There were no studies done on what impact the law would have on the nation's economy — the amount of business activity and jobs lost or created — before it was passed, the Hungarian business news site Portfolio reported.

## Right Around The Corner

The shopping curbs take effect March 15. They will mostly affect large department stores and major European grocery chains such as Spar, Aldi, Tesco and Lidl.

Lawmakers who favored the ban promoted it as insurance that shopping won't "shorten the time that families spend together."

Economy Minister Mihaly Varga had urged rejection of the bill. Varga appealed instead for employers to work out arrangements for additional pay for those employees willing to work Sundays.
