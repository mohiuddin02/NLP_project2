WASHINGTON, D.C. — An old television. A first-generation iPhone. The printer that came with a new computer.

These once novel items are among the millions of tons of technology pitched into the trash or taken to recycling centers each year. States have been trying to get manufacturers to help pay for electronics recycling since the early 2000s. Still, half do not have statewide recycling programs. Those that do are evaluating how to make their programs work as the size, volume and value of recycled electronics changes.

Many electronic devices should not be thrown away with regular trash. They contain hazardous materials, such as mercury and lead, which can seep into soil and groundwater. Meanwhile, much of the metal, plastic and glass in devices can be recycled.

## California Leads The E-Way

California became the first state to pass a law mandating "e-cycling" — electronic recycling — in 2003. Under its program, consumers pay a fee that supports e-cycling when they buy a product. Another 24 states and Washington, D.C., put the cost of e-cycling programs on manufacturers. Many require that the companies that make the products pay for the collection and processing of a certain amount of e-waste based on how much they sell within the state.

Five states — Connecticut, Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington — have "centralized" or "convenience-based" programs. They require electronics makers to help pay for local drop-off centers.

The different laws, coupled with a variety of rules and registration requirements, makes complying difficult for manufacturers, said Walter Alcorn. He is a vice president at the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), an organization representing electronics sellers and manufacturers.

Some states have recycling quotas, where manufacturers have to pay for a certain weight of electronics to be recycled each year. Yet some states can see unanticipated costs when a manufacturer meets its annual weight goal and stops paying for local programs.

## Burden Of Paying

Initially, the CEA asked for laws requiring consumers to bear recycling costs, as they do in California. Now the group is working with states to make existing laws similar across states and more agreeable to the industry.

"We want to see recycling incorporated into these corporate business models," Alcorn said. "That's where they can thrive and companies can get creative in getting their customers to bring back their used products."

State laws that require manufacturers to pay for an annual weight of e-cycling can backfire when annual weight goals are met before the end of the year and manufacturers stop paying, said Resa Dimino. She works for the Product Stewardship Institute (PSI). The group focuses on the environmental and health impacts of consumer products.

When companies stop paying, nonprofits and state and local governments are left to either pay for recycling efforts themselves or shut them down, she said.

PSI provides technical and policy support to states with e-cycling laws. Dimino said that modifying programs so producers are required to keep paying for recycling collection, even after they have met their weight quota, is one way states could maintain manufacturer financing.

Manufacturers in Washington and Oregon pay for municipalities to have collection sites, Dimino said. Access to recycling centers makes it easy for residents to recycle and, without quotas, the states do not have to worry about suddenly losing manufacturers' funding. E-cycling in those states is more stable as a result.

## A Model Of Flexibility

As electronic devices become smaller and people hold on to them longer, there is sometimes a different problem: it may be difficult for electronics companies to collect enough recycled materials to meet the state weight quotas, said Allison Schumacher at the CEA.

She points to recent reforms of an e-cycling law in South Carolina to give legal protection to electronics makers so they can work together on recycling.

Schumacher said the reforms, which are in their first year, will give manufacturers the flexibility to meet state recycling requirements. She hopes other states will be able to use it as a model.

"We've always been concerned with the idea of having these arbitrary targets, they don't necessarily mean anything," Schumacher said.

Manufacturers' ability to meet recycling weight quotas also might decline because there are fewer cathode ray tubes (CRTs) in the recycling stream. CRTs, part of bulky older televisions and computer monitors, usually containing leaded glass, have largely faded out of production since 2010. Most TVs and computers today have lightweight flat screens.

Heavy CRT devices helped manufacturers meet their recycling weight requirements, but at this point fewer of them are entering the waste stream. Once they are gone, meeting recycling goals will be harder, Schumacher said.

## The Recycling Opportunities Are There

When electronics are recycled they are either fixed up for resale or broken down to smaller pieces of plastic and metal sold by manufacturers or recycling companies.

States without formal e-cycling programs are not without recycling opportunities. Programs in those states are supported by companies that host electronics buyback programs as well as nonprofit and local government efforts, said Jason Linnell, director of the National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER).

Instead of advocating for more state laws, NCER helps states implement existing laws more efficiently. Linnell said he does not expect more statewide laws to pass in coming years.
