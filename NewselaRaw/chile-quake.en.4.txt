ILLAPEL, Chile â€” A strong earthquake hit the country of Chile on Wednesday. It made the ground move. Many buildings fell down. Ten people were killed.

The small city of Illapel was hurt the most. It is near where the earthquake hit hardest. On Thursday, people there had to sleep outside.

## Strong Earthquake, Big Waves

Earthquakes have different strengths. The strengths are called magnitudes. An earthquake with a magnitude of 2 is not much. It would hardly be felt. Anything above 8 is very bad.

Wednesday's earthquake had a magnitude above 8.

Earthquakes that strong can make the sea move. The moving water makes big waves.

Such waves are called tsunamis. They can wash over houses near the sea. People can drown if they are caught in a tsunami.

On Wednesday, Chile's leaders said the country could be hit by tsunamis. Many people quickly moved inland or away from the sea. Others went to higher ground.

## Felt Like "The End Of The World"

Some towns were hit by tsunamis. They caused flooding. Luckily, the waves were smaller than some people feared.

The earthquake was very strong. It could even be felt in nearby countries. People in Argentina felt it.

"I thought it was the end of the world," said Manuel Moya. He lives in Illapel. The earthquake knocked down his home.

Moya said he and his wife were in bed when the earthquake hit. The two quickly ran outside. Minutes later their home fell down.

## Chile Has Had Many Earthquakes

"They said it was a magnitude 8 but it felt like a 10," Moya said.

Chile has had many earthquakes before. The world's biggest earthquake happened there in 1960. More than 5,000 people were killed.

Another earthquake hit Chile in 2010. It killed 500 people.

After that, Chile's leaders started working very hard. They wanted to be ready for any other earthquakes. They figured out the best ways for people to stay safe.

Their hard work helped greatly on Wednesday. Many more people could have been killed.
