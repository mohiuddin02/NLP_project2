### PRO: Foundations of our democracy disappearing like our privacy

WASHINGTON — Edward Snowden is a courageous American hero. He will be remembered as one long after the "war on terror" is replaced by some other excuse for violating Americans' rights and the rest of the world's rights, privacy and, sometimes, security.

He won his first major legal victory on Dec. 16 when a federal District Court ruled that the NSA's collection of Americans' phone records that Snowden first exposed was probably unconstitutional.

It's unfortunate that even most of the media's reporting on our national spy state has let us down. It still portrays the abuses that Snowden revealed as a result of overzealous efforts to protect Americans from terrorism.

But our government's actions obviously had nothing to do with terrorism.

## A National Spy State

Our government has spied on other countries to help give the U.S. an economic advantage. It has also tapped the phones of foreign leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. Even ignoring those gross actions, our spy state in the U.S. is doing much more than just violating our privacy.

Don't get me wrong: that's bad enough. Most people don't want to share the intimate details of their personal lives with government spies. But the Obama administration has managed to convince some of the more trusting among us that the NSA's big data sweeps just sit in some huge storage facility.

We're led to believe that they are sorted with computers and algorithms to identify or investigate targets that have something to do with terrorism.

However, there is a mountain of evidence that this massive data-gathering is in fact being used against citizens who are involved in activities that are protected by our Constitution. Political organizers and public educators have been targeted.

The American Civil Liberties Union has compiled a list of the "spying on American citizens and infiltrating or otherwise obstructing political activist groups" over recent years. The list includes activities by U.S. law enforcement agencies in 36 states.

Our government has plenty of additional resources to use the NSA's data for discouraging and disrupting opposition political activity. It has spied on anti-war groups like Pittsburgh's Thomas Merton Center. It has also infiltrated groups across the country who were planning to protest at the 2004 Republican convention.

In 2011, the Boston police, the Boston Regional Intelligence Center and the FBI were very busy tracking activists. These were not terrorists, just members of the Occupy movement, Code Pink, and Veterans for Peace.

As a result, they seem to have ignored the intelligence that was literally handed to them about the terrorists who bombed the Boston Marathon in April. This tells you a lot about the priorities of our morally corrupt national spy state.

## It's All About Power

"These programs were never about terrorism," wrote Snowden in a letter to Brazilians on Dec. 17, noting they are really about "economic spying, social control and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power."

In the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. was inspiring millions in the struggle for civil and voting rights for African-Americans, and for the rights of poor people. At the same time, the FBI was busy tapping his phone and harassing him.

At one point, it tried seriously to blackmail King into committing suicide. Today it would have a constant flow of real-time information not only on King's every move and phone call, but about every activist in that movement across the country. That is the difference that technology makes, if we let them get away with it.

The spy state is also making the U.S. into a banana republic, run by our elites in business, politics and the military. The expanding military-intelligence apparatus is becoming more powerful relative to our elected officials, including the president.

It was the military-intelligence community's priorities that got the Obama administration to threaten China, Russia and Latin America, and violate all sorts of international laws. It ended up being a pointless attempt to force other countries to co-operate in capturing Snowden.

And it is our military-intelligence community's power that is currently blocking reforms to reduce the NSA's abuses.

It's not just your privacy that is disappearing because of the abuses that Snowden exposed — it's the foundations of a democratic society.

### CON: Has jeopardized valuable cooperative efforts

In a strictly legal sense, under U.S. law Edward Snowden might not meet the definition of the word "traitor." But in the way most people think of the word, it would certainly apply.

The Australian government thinks so. Snowden's revelation of highly sensitive intelligence operations "down under" led Australian Federal Attorney-General George Brandis to brand the ex-NSA contractor an "American traitor."

No wonder the Aussies were angry. For years they had cooperated secretly with Indonesian intelligence services, even when open cooperation between the countries was impossible because of disagreements about various issues.

But behind the curtain, the two democracies had worked out a practical, mutually beneficial information-sharing deal that helped them handle sensitive issues like refugees and human trafficking. Snowden's disclosures have now jeopardized this valuable cooperative effort.

## Undercutting Champions Of Freedom

In disclosing national security secrets, Snowden was following in the footsteps of Julian Assange, the Australian-born founder of WikiLeaks. Both men claim a noble purpose: to use the power of the Internet to expose the corruption and wrong-doing of brutal, oppressive regimes. But in practice, they have told us almost nothing about countries like North Korea, Iran, China, Cuba and Venezuela.

Instead, they've mostly spilled secrets from nations ranked at the top of the Freedom House "Index of Freedom in the World." These are the countries that organize the peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, combat the spread of nuclear weapons, champion human rights, fight terrorism and human trafficking, and hold free and fair elections.

Regardless of why they say they did it, Snowden's and Assange's actions have undercut the world's champions of freedom while giving aid and comfort to the world's most undemocratic regimes.

Further, they have betrayed the idea of freedom. The Assange/Snowden doctrine asserts that complete transparency equals freedom, which is not just being overly innocent — it's worse.

Respect for individual privacy is a fundamental part of freedom. The government of free peoples is an extension of the people, because the government rules on their behalf. Free societies recognize that keeping legitimate secrets is a legitimate function of government.

## Neither Freedom Fighter Nor Whistle-Blower

Democracies operate under the idea of "ordered liberty." They establish rules to protect both the individual and the community as whole — guarding both individual freedom and public safety. No one has the right to discard those rules and substitute rules of his own choosing. Disregarding ordered liberty doesn't advance freedom — it just creates chaos, which enables evil and kills democracies like ours.

Snowden is neither "freedom fighter" nor "whistle-blower," because his leaks are broad and indiscriminate, and the vast majority expose no wrongdoing whatsoever.

What about those cases where Snowden might argue he has revealed government practices that may cross the line into actually being illegal? His actions are still, at best, irresponsible.

The United States system of ordered liberty offers multiple ways to raise claims of wrongdoing or abuse of power without compromising national security. Federal agencies have inspector generals and Congress routinely investigates such claims. And, yes, we have "whistle-blower" protection laws. The notion that Snowden had no option but to leak secrets is indefensible.

Finally, Snowden betrayed the trust he was given by the U.S. government to safeguard the nation's secrets.

Free societies depend on trustworthy citizens. Bank tellers, lawyers, doctors, police officials and others in positions of trust can't decide they are, individually, the best deciders of what information should or should not be dumped in the public sphere. If they did, we wouldn't be living in Assange's paradise, we would be living in North Korea, where no one is trusted … ever.

Edward Snowden has betrayed freedom, and in the end, that's a much greater offense than intentionally acting like an enemy agent.
