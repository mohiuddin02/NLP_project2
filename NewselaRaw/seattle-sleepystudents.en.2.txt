SEATTLE, Wash. — More school districts around the United States are finally heeding the advice of scientists. These experts have long said that expecting teens to show up to class before 8 a.m. is not good for their health or their report cards.

The Seattle school board voted last month to adopt an 8:45 a.m. start time beginning next year. All of Seattle's high schools and most of its middle schools will participate. They will join 70 districts across the nation that adopted a later start time in recent years.

The movement still has a long way to go: There are more than 24,000 U.S. high schools. Supporters expect that such decisions will be made more quickly now that people have mostly stopped debating the underlying science.

Proponents of later start times got a boost last year from the American Academy of Pediatrics. This professional group of pediatricians said starting later is not a cure-all for teen health and academic problems. But doctors said it can improve students' lives in many other ways.

## Cutting The Sandman A Little Slack

"Essentially, across the board, any domain that you look at improves pretty dramatically," said Dr. Judy Owens of Boston Children's Hospital and author of the academy's policy statement on teen sleep. After the report came out, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also pushed for later bell times. The CDC is the government agency whose goal is to protect public health and safety.

Research shows later start times help combat sleep deprivation in teens, who naturally fall asleep later than their parents would like. They also improve academic success, attendance and mental health and cut sleep-related car accidents.

"We're going to look back on this time period and wonder why it took so long," said Phyllis Payne of Start School Later. The organization helps parents groups push for later bell times. Payne said 49 local groups have started in the last three years.

The obstacles to change mostly have to do with money. St. Paul, Minnesota, public schools delayed the adoption of later start times for all its high school students, even after seeing great results in a one-school pilot study. The reason had to do with transportation.

## Parents Complain About Flipping Schedules

The district could not overcome parent complaints about earlier start times for elementary students. These would have become necessary because of the new later times for high school students. It would cost St. Paul about $8 million to add more buses, explained Jackie Statum Allen, who works for the district.

"It would be much better to put that in the classroom rather than the gas tank," Allen said.

In Seattle, officials encountered the same resistance. Some parents of younger children objected when bus schedules were flipped and their kids were put on an earlier schedule for next year. Some argued that later start times would get in the way of after-school activities like football practice.

The Seattle change was approved in part because the district listened to what parents had to say. The final plan was more expensive but also more popular, said Cindy Jatul. She's a Seattle teacher and parent and volunteer with Start School Later Seattle.

An effort to move school start times in Chicago, Illinois, failed because the district tried to make the change without hearing from the community. "It backfired terribly," said Jatul, who got involved in the effort in Seattle when her kids hit puberty. As a teacher, she was facing groggy teens at home and at school.

## Teens Have Their Own Opinions

Bridget Shelton is a freshman at Seattle's Roosevelt High School. She believes the change in bell times will help her get more sleep. This year, she sleeps six to seven hours a night. Next year, she hopes to get eight hours a night.  

"I know many students that come in and are just struggling to stay awake," she said. "Many of my friends are falling asleep in class."

Katie Benmar, a sophomore, does not think the new start time will make anything better. She expects her life will just shift one hour later — from after-school activities to dinner to homework and bed.

"I'm going to bed at midnight and waking up at 6," Benmar said of her current schedule, which includes jazz choir after school. "I'm really tired right now."
