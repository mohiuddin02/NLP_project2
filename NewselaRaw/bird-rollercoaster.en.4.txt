Some birds in Asia zoom up and down across some of the world's tallest mountains. Just like a roller coaster.

Scientists studied the birds, called bar-headed geese. They were on their way south for the winter. Geese often spend the summer in one place and then move on for the winter so they can stay warm.

The scientists followed the birds across the world's tallest mountains. They found that the geese do not fly in a straight line. The birds fly up, down and around, much like how a roller coaster moves, following the shape of the mountains.

## Long Journey South

Every winter, the bar-headed geese leave Mongolia, a country between China and Russia.

The birds fly across the world's tallest mountains. They head south to their winter homes in India and Tibet.

When it comes to flying south for the winter, the birds work very hard.

The scientists said the birds have many difficulties when they take off for the winter. They have to cross deserts and oceans. Still, the bar-headed goose is special. It is one of the few birds that flies across the Himalaya Mountains.

Bar-headed geese are very good fliers. They can climb to great heights. Scientists learned that some geese flew more than 4 miles high.

Scientists do not know how high the birds can really fly. They are curious to know how the geese can get so high. Many scientists thought the geese would fly to the top of the mountains and stay up there. They thought the birds would not waste energy flying down and back up again. They were wrong.

## Tracking Is For The Birds

Scientists attached tracking devices to the birds. They wanted to see how high the birds were flying. They also wanted to know how hard the geese were working.

The scientists found that the geese did not fly in a straight path. The birds flew higher and came back down. They climbed to get over a high peak and then sailed down when the ground dropped. They did extra work to keep flying over mountains, over and over again.

In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese went up and down, over and over. But they only climbed about 1 mile over the mountains.

It seemed to be difficult. The scientists wondered, why didn't the birds just fly in a straight line?

The scientists realized that it was the best way to travel. If the birds had flown straight instead of going higher and lower, they would have been more tired.

## Flapping Is Easier In Thick Air

Flying very high makes the birds tired. The air at the top of the mountains is very thin. The birds need thick air to push against their wings. When the air is thick, they do not have to flap their wings as much.

With thinner air, the birds have to flap their wings more to push forward. They have to work harder to keep moving.

The higher the birds flew, the more they had to beat their wings. The more they beat their wings, the harder their hearts had to work.

So flying up and down is better. And the wind helps the geese to climb back up.
