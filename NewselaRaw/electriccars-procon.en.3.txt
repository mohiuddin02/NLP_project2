### PRO: Electric-car makers need U.S. funding right now

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — It would be very unwise to "pull the plug" on government funding of the electric-car business at this time. This money is given by the government to encourage the auto business to make electric cars. The government also offers money to drivers who buy them.

If that help went away, car companies would lose money on electric vehicles. Electric cars and gas-powered cars are one of the few bright spots for business in the U.S.

The government support helps companies make up for tough environmental rules the government put in place.

The rules are a challenge to automakers. Between now and 2025, the distance cars go on a gallon of gas must improve. Now, cars and trucks go on average less than 30 miles per gallon (mpg). They must increase that to more than 50 mpg.

## Bad Time To Change Direction

At the same time, more cars that don't burn gas must be sold. In California and nine other states, one out every seven new cars for sale must be electric. Right now just a tiny amount of the cars for sale in those states are electric.

These rules were made for excellent reasons. The U.S. buys oil from other countries. If things go bad in another part of the world, it could be hard to get oil. If the U.S. buys less oil from other countries, American businesses won't have to worry as much that their oil supply is at risk.

The rules were also meant to improve the environment by reducing smog and greenhouse gases. These gases are linked to [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming). When we burn things, temperatures increase. That can change nature.

The rules might be too demanding, but the government won't look at or change them until 2017.

And since it takes a long time to launch new types of cars, this is the wrong time to change direction. But, it makes sense that some people would want to end subsidies.

President Obama's goal of one million plug-in vehicles in the U.S. by 2015 was too hopeful, and it won't happen in time.

However, plug-in vehicles are selling fast. Their sales are growing at a faster speed than traditional hybrids, which run on gas and batteries. The Toyota Prius was the first hybrid which rolled out in 2000.

## A Growing Business

We can learn from the experience of Oslo, Norway. In that European city, many drivers already choose plug-in vehicles over regular gas ones.

It is true that the first generation of plug-in vehicles do not meet the needs of most Americans. They're too expensive and don't go far before they have to be plugged in to recharge. The Chevrolet Volt, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla sports car are some of the most popular plug-in cars.

However, the four years that plug-ins have been around has paid off. The second generation of plug-in vehicles is about to hit showrooms and every automaker will be offering some form of plug-in vehicle.

Car companies are fighting to build better cars. Each automaker is trying to offer plug-in vehicles that can go far on a charge, recharge quickly, and not cost too much.

The money the government gives to electric car makers and drivers is important to see if this new technology will work out. Electric cars could be a breakthrough. All U.S. transportation businesses could benefit.

In the long run, electric vehicles must be sold without government support. They should even be taxed to help pay for keeping roads in good shape. Owners of gasoline-powered vehicles now pay a tax on gasoline.

But the right time to think about taxes and government support of electric cars is 2017.

### Con: A waste of government money for an impractical car

WASHINGTON — If government could force us to come up with new inventions to solve problems, we could all fill up our cars with water, instead of gas.

But even Washington can't fix our energy problems. Still, the government is trying by giving money to people who buy electric cars. But it's not money well spent.

What we drive says a lot about us.

What an electric car says about its owners is that they don't have children and don't plan to ever have any.

## Electric Cars Cost Too Much

Electric cars aren't good for families. They're too expensive, too small, and don't go far enough before they have to be recharged.

Children are very expensive. The average cost of raising a child for the first 18 years is over $240,000. Add the cost of college to that and each child can easily be more than $340,000.

At the same time, rich people are less likely to have children than poor people. And well-off people can afford expensive electric cars without needing the money the government awards electric car owners.

Electric cars cost too much, even with government money. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) examines how the government spends money. It says that the lifetime cost of an electric car or plug-in hybrid car is $12,000 more than a gas vehicle or regular hybrid. A hybrid is a car that runs on gas and electric batteries. Some can be plugged in to charge, like an electric car. Regular hybrids can't be plugged in. Their batteries get charged when the car's wheels move.

The most the government will give you for buying an electric car is $7,500. But that amount would need to be $4,500 more to make up for the difference in cost between an electric car and a regular hybrid.

But no amount of government action can fix other flaws of electric cars.

—These cars are too small. Space is lost because the batteries they need are so big. They're also made smaller so that they weigh less. Lighter cars can travel for longer before they need to be recharged.

—Most all-electric cars can't go more than 100 miles between charges.

—Charges can take hours and leave a driver dependent on the increasingly unreliable power grid.

Electric-gas hybrid cars run on gas and electric batteries. They are a better alternative, but are still expensive and are small.

## Not Practical For Families

How far electric cars can go without needing to be recharged is important for families. Electric cars are best for drivers with predictable driving patterns. Otherwise they could run out of power at bad times.

But kids can be all over the place. They may have band, choir, soccer, football or dance practices that change daily. They occasionally get sick and need to be taken home. Sometimes, they get in trouble at school and have to stay late for detention.

The $7.5 billion the government is spending over the next 10 years promoting electric cars won't result in much. It will just prop up a product that a select group of people will buy.

J.D. Power surveys people about the things they own. It says that electric car owners see "environmental friendliness as the most important benefit" of such cars. But even here, electric vehicles fail.

The Journal of Industrial Ecology published a report that found that manufacturing an electric car puts double the amount of carbon dioxide into the air than building gas cars does. Carbon dioxide is believed to cause climate change, which can hurt the environment. And, the electricity for these cars comes from burning oil and other fuels. Plus, their batteries contain toxic chemicals. Environmental benefits of electric cars are minimal.

It was 116 years ago that the first electric car went on the market.

Electric cars have been running on empty promises ever since. It's time for Washington to quit giving away money to people who buy them.
