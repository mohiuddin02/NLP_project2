In a place called Malaysian Borneo, people are getting a form of a disease that used to be found only in monkeys. Now scientists say they may know why. In a magazine for scientists and doctors, scientists say that cutting down trees in the rain forest is to blame. Clearing trees is changing the forest, and that is spreading a disease called malaria.

Malaysian Borneo is part of the country of Malaysia. It is on the island of Borneo included in the continent of Asia. The island is in the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the biggest islands in the world. It has beaches and rain forests where trees grow close together, and it is warm and wet. Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia are the three countries that share the island.  

Scientists noticed an increase in one kind of malaria that is usually found only in monkeys called macaques. Over the last 10 years, many people on the island have become sick with it. Now there are more people sick with this kind of malaria than any other kind. 

## Mosquitoes Carry Malaria To People

The disease is caused by a parasite that feeds off of the animal that it has attached itself to. It is then spread when mosquitoes bite the animal and then a person. People with malaria often feel like they have the flu. Some patients can get very sick and even die. In 2013, there were almost 200 million cases of malaria in the world. Half a million people died.

Scientists wanted to know why the parasite was spreading faster now than in the past. They thought the problem might be a change in the rain forest.

"That's when we started looking at deforestation," says Kimberly Fornace. She is a scientist from England. Fornace says she and her team thought maybe clearing trees in the rain forest was causing people, mosquitoes and macaques to be too close together.

## Sickness, Forests Studied Together

Fornace and her team studied information about people who were sick with malaria during a certain time. The information came from two health centers on the island. The scientists noticed where patients lived when they got the disease. Then they looked at satellite pictures. The pictures showed where deforestation was happening at the same time that people became sick.

The team found more malaria in places where many trees had been cleared before an outbreak of the disease. However, nearby areas with most of the forest still standing also had a large amount of malaria. Scientists call this the edge effect.

The edge effect is when animals and plants live in a place that suddenly goes through a large amount of change. The change, like cutting down trees, happens right at the edge of their home. The edge effect is sometimes strongest where people have left parts of the forest standing. There are holes in the forest caused by clearing trees.

## At Edge, Monkeys Are Closer

Fornace says she and her team think that malaria spreads at the edge of rain forests. People and macaques are close together there. The macaques are forced to move into smaller areas because of the clearing. Sometimes they have to leave the forest to look for food. Mosquitoes then carry the parasite from the monkeys to people.  

Fornace says scientists can now understand which parts of the island have the most malaria. They can draw better maps to show where people might become sick with malaria.

She also says that human actions do not just change the rain forest. The changes can also make people sick. Officials should plan to cut trees more responsibly to keep people safe. she says.

Scientists say that deforestation has affected the spread of other diseases, too. They also say that climate change might add to the problem. Another thing that can spread disease is when many people are forced to move to a new home. Disease may travel with them.
