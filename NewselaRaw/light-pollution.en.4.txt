SEATTLE â€” The skies just aren't dark enough anymore. Lights prevent us from seeing the night sky the way our ancestors used to. And that's affecting how we connect with nature.

These days, most people never think to look up at the stars. And if they do look, chances are they won't see much.

Dave Ingram heads a group which is trying to bring back dark skies. The sad truth, he says, is that there isn't much real night sky left.

And that means people alive today won't really know their place in the universe.

## The Loss Of Night

Put somebody "out under the stars for 30 minutes," Ingram says, "and they start asking the big questions."

But what if the sky isn't dark enough for them to really see those stars? These days, the sky is rarely black. Instead, it's usually a sort of greenish-gray.

In the old world, you walked beneath the stars nightly. They became your compass, your friends, even your gods. Today we don't do that anymore.

Humans have been walking under the stars for about 2.3 million years. Only in the past 135 have most of us lost how we connect with what shines above.

Darkness has been disappearing ever since the lightbulb was invented in 1879. Today, not much is left. All of Europe and most of the United States never falls into true darkness. Americans rarely ever see a true ink-black sky at night.

Scientists say light pollution has become a real problem.

It hurts trees. And it has been terrible for birds, who are used to flying by the stars. Birds become confused by brightly lit buildings, and run into them by accident. Up to a billion birds a year die in the U.S. alone.

And the loss of true darkness seems to cause problems for humans too. It can make us sick. And sad.

## The Universe Inspires

Light pollution is also making us lose something very important: Our understanding of our place in the universe. And we're losing a deep understanding of ourselves.

It's a question that writer Paul Bogard thinks about every day.

When we come face-to-face with the universe, he says, it changes us. "It's pretty easy, if you never see the universe, to think this world is all there is." But when we see the stars, we realize that "our problems are just not that big," he added.

"If you really see the night sky," he says, it moves you deeply. You can't help but feel "awe and wonder and gratitude and spirituality."

And a fascination with the universe inspires us, he says. It has led to art, science, and religion.

"And now," he says, "it's just gone."

Fortunately, light pollution is not hard to get rid of. Except for one thing: the way people feel about light.

Today, light means progress. And to many people, bright light means safety.

## To See The Wonder

Ingram and others keep those feelings in mind. They say that fighting light pollution doesn't mean getting rid of useful light.

"Nobody wants to go back to gas lamps," Ingram says.

There is a simple cure for light pollution: "full cutoff" lights. These stop light rays from shooting up into the sky.

Most lighting isn't designed that way, though. Some of the worst are found in parking lots, backyards and gas stations. Even some streetlights are a problem. These lights could easily be changed.

But dark-sky crusaders first need to get more people on their side. For that to happen, more people need to see what they're missing.

Ingram says that once people start looking up, they understand. They feel close to something they didn't even know they'd lost.

And that is why people like Ingram keep pushing. Look up at the stars, they say, and reconnect with the wonder. That wonder is what it means to be human.
