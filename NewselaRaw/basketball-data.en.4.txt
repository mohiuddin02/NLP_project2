Basketball teams that want to know more about other teams now have a new tool to use. For the first time, they can use computers to give themselves an advantage.

This year every NBA team can use information from a company called SportVU. SportVU cameras are installed in every NBA arena. They track large sets of small tidbits of information, known as big data.

The cameras record the position of the ball and every player on the court. They follow every second of every game of the season.

The camera data is starting to change basketball. It is changing everything from coaching to player fitness to how fans watch the game.

Ben Alamar works for an NBA team. He is excited about data in basketball. The NBA's system shows how helpful data can be.

Big data is helping scientists explore outer space. It is helping companies find out what customers want. It is also helping basketball teams learn some things about their players for the first time.

## Cameras Near The Roof

All sports are using data to make better decisions, said Brian Kopp. He works for a sports data company. "Basketball is pushing the front edge of that conversation."

SportVU puts cameras near the roof of a gym. The linked cameras collect data 25 times a second. They track where each player is on the court and the position of the ball. Computer "vision technology" sees the number and color on players' jerseys.

The player-tracking data goes from the cameras to a computer workstation in each arena. Then it's uploaded to SportVU's servers. From there, it's put into an even larger database.

The data gets matched up with the play-by-play information from scorekeepers. Reports are ready 60 seconds after something happens on the court.

Four teams put together the camera system before the 2010-2011 season. Before the start of this season, the league made sure all NBA teams could use it.

The SportVU system can tell how much players run during games. It can track how well players shoot from particular spots on the court. The system can help coaches know if a player is tired.

## Helping Coaches - And Fans Too

SportVU also shows how good players are on defense. Teams also use SportVU after the season is over to help find players they want to sign for next year.

Experts say the data reinforces what coaches already know in many cases. It is helpful in scouting other teams. Coaches can know the rest of the league like they know their own team.

SportVU proved to teams that the 3-point shot is one of the most useful ways to score points. It also recommended taking open shots. That led to a lot of passing and motion, said Steve Hellmuth, who works for the NBA.

Fans can see some of the data on the NBA's website. They can see how well players shoot from different spots on the court. They can also see how good some players are at guarding other players.

The NBA and its teams may be doing a lot more with the data soon. It could allow coaches to make in-game changes. The data could also allow TV stations to improve what they show during the game. Computers might make some of the calls now made by people.

Kopp says this data will become more valuable as time goes on.
