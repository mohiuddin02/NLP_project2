ISLAMABAD, Pakistan â€” Middle Eastern teen activist Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head in 2012 and survived. She was shot by Taliban fighters. They were angry with her because she was trying to help girls go to school in Pakistan. Yousafzai was just 15 and on her way home from school at the time. Two other girls were also injured in the attack.

Yousafzai has since become famous around the world. Although she is only a teenager, she acts much older than her age. Since being shot, she has called for getting more girls educated in very religious areas of Pakistan. Her views upset Islamic extremists. They believe that girls should not go to school. They think they should stay in the home.

## The Shooters Have Been Caught

On Friday, Pakistan's army said that it has arrested 10 fighters. They believe those 10 men helped to attack Yousafzai. The fighters were a part of a terror group.

General Asim Saleem Bajwa is the Pakistani army spokesman. He said the men were acting on orders from Mullah Fazlullah. He is the head of the Pakistani Taliban, a terror organization.

Malala is from the Swat Valley area of northwestern Pakistan. Fazlullah used to live there too, until Pakistan's army began attacking fighters in the Swat Valley in 2009. The fighters wanted to take over Pakistan. The group wanted to force everyone to obey extreme Islamic laws.

Since 2009, Fazlullah has been on the run.

Pakistan thinks he may be hiding across the border in Afghanistan. Pakistan's government asked the Afghan government about Fazlullah. Afghanistan said it didn't know anything. The two countries do not trust each other. They blame each other for letting terrorism happen.

Bajwa said Pakistan will capture or kill Fazlullah.

## Malala's Father Is Hopeful

Malala's father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, said the arrests of the 10 men is good news for his family. He said it is also important for the people of Pakistan and the world. It gives hope to "the hundreds of thousands of people whose lives have been affected by terrorism."

The Yousafzai family now lives safely in Britain.
