ALAMOGORDO, N.M. â€” A documentary film company has found hundreds of cartridges of old video games buried in a New Mexico landfill. The cartridges were all from one video game. Some call it the worst video game ever made.

It was a game made by Atari from the movie "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial." Atari made game consoles and video games.

Before video games were purchased online or put on discs, they were kept on cartridges. These were like tapes that were put into a machine called a console to play the video game. In the 1980s, the most popular video game console was not Xbox or PlayStation. It was one made by Atari.

Film director Zak Penn showed one "E.T." cartridge retrieved from the site. He said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped up by a backhoe.

About 200 residents and game enthusiasts gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico. They watched the big machines dig through the concrete-covered landfill. The equipment was used to search for up to a million discarded copies of "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial." The game's maker had wanted to hide the copies forever.

"I feel pretty relieved and psyched that they actually got to see something," said Penn. Meanwhile, members of the film production team sifted through the mounds of trash. They pulled out boxes, games and other Atari products.

## Landfill Dig In Documentary

Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery because of strong winds that kicked up huge clouds of dust and garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the game in a homemade gaming den with a TV and an 1980s game machine in the back of a van. Others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the "Back To The Future" movies.

One person who watched was Armando Ortega. He is a city official who back in 1983 got a tip from a landfill employee about the large amount of games buried there.

"It was pitch dark here that night, but we came with our flashlights and found dozens of games," he said. They braved the darkness, coyotes and snakes of the desert landfill. They even had to sneak past the security guard. But it paid off.

He says they found dozens of crushed cartridges that they took home. The video games still worked in their Atari consoles.

The game and how it helped lead to the fall of Atari's popularity have been the source of fascination for video game enthusiasts since the 1980s. The search for the cartridges will be featured in an upcoming documentary. The film is about Atari, the biggest video game company of the early '80s.

Xbox Entertainment Studios is one of the companies developing the film. It is expected to be released later this year on Microsoft's Xbox game machines.

## Crushed And Buried

Whether Atari decided to bury thousands or millions of copies of the failed game is part of much speculation on the Internet. More important is the question: why?

Kristen Keller, a spokeswoman at Atari, said "nobody here has any idea what that's about." The company has no "corporate knowledge" about the buried video games at Alamogordo. Atari has changed hands many times over the years. Keller said, "We're just watching like everybody else."

Atari currently manages about 200 game titles. They include Centipede and Asteroids. It was sold to a French company in 2001.

A New York Times article from Sept. 28, 1983, says 14 truckloads of discarded game cartridges and computer equipment were dumped on the site. An Atari spokesman quoted in the story said the games came from its plant in El Paso, Texas. El Paso is about 80 miles south of Alamogordo.

Local news reports from the time said that the landfill employees were throwing cartridges there. Then the workers ran a bulldozer over the games before covering them with dirt and trash.

The city of Alamogordo agreed to give the documentarians 250 cartridges or 10 percent of the cartridges found, whichever is greater.

## Game's Recurring Flaw

Alamogordo Mayor Susie Galea said finding something in the landfill might bring more tourists to this city in southeastern New Mexico that is home to an Air Force base and White Sands National Monument. "Lots of people just pass through, unfortunately," she said.

The "E.T." game is partially blamed for the decline of Atari and the collapse in the U.S. of a multimillion dollar video game industry. It took several years for the industry to bounce back.

Tina Amini is deputy editor at gaming website Kotaku. She said many people didn't buy the game because "it was practically broken." A recurring flaw, she said, was that the character of the game, the beloved alien, would fall into traps that were almost impossible to escape and would appear constantly and unpredictably.

The company produced millions of the game cartridges. Sales were not initially bad, but the frustrating gameplay prompted an immense amount of returns. "They had produced so many cartridges that were unsold that even if the game was insanely successful I doubt they'd be able to keep up," Amini says.

Joe Lewandowski became manager of the 300-acre landfill a few months after the cartridge dump and has been helping the documentarians. He said that they used old photographs and dug exploratory wells to find the actual burial site.

The incidents following the burial remained a part of Alamogordo's local folklore, he said. For him, the only memories of "E.T." the game were of an awful game he once bought for his kid.
