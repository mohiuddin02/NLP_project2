The Earth has been around for a very long time. In those millions of years, it has undergone many changes. Scientists can learn about the history of the planet by examining clues in rock and soil. Like the rings on a tree trunk, the layers of the Earth tell the planet's story.

Scientists divide this story into different chapters, based on the changes the planet has gone through. First, scientists have split Earth's history into a few big sections, called eons. Each is made up of a few eras. Eras are made up of periods, and periods are made up of epochs. While epochs are short compared with eons, they still usually last millions of years.

This system is called the geologic timescale. It is a useful way of describing the Earth's history. Each epoch describes a different stage in the planet's history.

## Modern Humans Have Aged Earth

We are currently in the Holocene epoch. It began about 11,750 years ago when an ice age ended. This brought about a series of geologic changes that shaped the Earth as we know it.

Scientists are now debating whether a new epoch is upon us. Normally, an epoch would last for longer than 11,750 years, but the planet is changing more quickly these days. This is because modern human activity is now so advanced that it is affecting the planet. 

Some scientists believe that as a result, the Earth has entered a new epoch, which they call the Anthropocene.

## Major Change Points To Global Warming

Jan Zalasiewicz is a scientist at Leicester University in England. He and a group of other scientists have just published a new report in the magazine Science. They make the case for the Anthropocene.

The scientists presented evidence that big changes have been taking place on Earth due to human activity. Not only that, the changes have started to speed up, Zalasiewicz said.

One change has to do with global warming. Humans burn fuels to power cars and factories, which adds certain gases to the atmosphere. The gases cause the planet's temperature to rise. As the temperature rises, ice melts, the oceans will rise, and the Earth's weather patterns will change. Overall, the effects of global warming could be enormous.

## Worldwide, Growth Explodes

Meanwhile, as the global population has grown and technology has advanced, humans have reshaped the land. For example, humans have now made enough concrete to encase the entire world. People have also created materials that never existed before, like metals and plastics. Some of these materials will last for hundreds of years. 

As a result of human activity, Zalasiewicz argues that the Earth is now a very different place. He feels that we are no longer in the the Holocene epoch.

## Questioning The Epoch's Beginning

Key questions remain, however. If the Earth has entered into a new epoch, when did it begin? Perhaps scientists have just started to see the signs of a change that occurred a long time ago. The new epoch could have started when our ancient ancestors began farming. Or perhaps the important changes started in the last few hundred years, when technology took huge leaps forward. 

Zalasiewicz saya the Anthropocene started on July 16, 1945\. That was the date of the first test of a nuclear bomb. Nuclear bombs have altered the planet in ways that will last for thousands of years. They leave behind traces of rare elements in soil and water.

Not everyone agrees that a new epoch has started, however. Some scientists doubt that human beings have changed the planet enough to make for a new epoch. Others think that it is just too soon to say.

By asking whether the Earth has entered a new epoch, scientists are trying to understand how humans are reshaping the planet. With the release of the new report, Zalasiewicz hopes scientists will continue to talk about the Anthropocene.
