Most likely, Siats was a close cousin to certain dinosaurs found on other continents.

The huge animal was 30 feet long and weighed 4 tons. Its remains were discovered by scientists from the Field Museum in Chicago. The bones were found in a region of 100-million-year-old rocks in Utah. Peter Makovicky and Lindsay Zanno led the expedition.

The discovery of Siats meekerorum is important. Until now, very little was known about North American wildlife during the time Siats lived. The species thrived tens of millions of years before T. rex entered the scene.

## A Bone On A Hillside

Siats wasn't as big as T. rex. But it was enormous all the same: It is the third-largest carnivore yet found on the continent. It was named after two things: a man-eating monster from the legends of the nearby Ute Indians, and the Meeker family who are big supporters of the museum.

Zanno spotted the first of the bones in 2008. She came across it on a hillside in Utah's Cedar Mountains. Her discovery came just as the group was getting ready to call it quits.

This Friday, Zanno and Makovicky will officially unveil the new species.

"It's more than just a new dinosaur," Makovicky said. "It's the first evidence we have of a whole new group of dinosaurs in North America. And it challenges a view that was common."

Makovicky said that scientists used to believe that dinosaurs in North America were just in North America. It was thought that they were "only remotely related to (those on) other continents. That's slowly being challenged. This is another piece of evidence saying, 'No, dinosaurs were actually distributing themselves pretty widely across the continents.'"

## Preyed On T. Rex's Ancestors?

Because of its size, Siats was probably on top of the food chain.

And they probably preyed on T. rex's smaller ancestors. Remains of T. rex's smaller ancestors were also recently discovered in Utah. The fully developed T. rex later ruled North America, until dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago.

Siats, though, isn't related to the dinosaur family that the T. rex is from. Instead, it's from the allosauroid family. It's related to the Giganotosaurus, found in South America.

Zanno recalled her discovery of the first bone.

They had spent a week looking at other rocks and had found nothing, she said. "I was walking across this low badland and stumbled across this sort of black bone. I looked down and saw immediately it was a type of bone from a predatory dinosaur."

The expedition team spent the rest of their time digging around the hipbone. The scientists began to wonder if maybe they hadn't found a meat-eating predator. Maybe they had found a big herbivore, or plant-eater, instead.

## Found Two Other Dinosaurs Too

But return visits for more extensive excavations in 2009 and 2010 confirmed Zanno's original hunch: They were dealing with a predator. More bones were turned up, including some from the backbone.

From there it was a matter of bringing the bones back to the lab. Many of the bones had to be carefully separated from the rock they were stuck in. After five years of careful preparation and study, the Siats bones were finally ready to be shown.

Most of the bones found are from one animal. But there is also a toe bone and a couple of tailbones from a second Siats.

Makovicky said he and Zanno also found two other new types of dinosaurs at the same place. Sometime soon, those dinosaurs too will have their own debut and get shown to the world.
