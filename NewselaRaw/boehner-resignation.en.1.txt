WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” In a surprising move, House Speaker John Boehner said on Friday that he would resign from Congress at the end of October. He will give up his top leadership post and his seat in the House in the face of opposition from hardline conservative Republicans.

The Ohio Congressman, who served 13 terms in the House, shocked his fellow Republican party members early Friday morning. He announced his decision in a closed-door session attended by Republican party members. The announcement came one day after a high point of Boehner's congressional career, a historic speech by Pope Francis to Congress given at Boehner's request.

Boehner later held a news conference to announce his decision to the public.

## Planned Parenthood Funds Disputed

Conservatives have demanded that any legislation to keep the government operating past next Wednesday's deadline strip the group Planned Parenthood of the funding it receives from the government. More moderate Republican lawmakers have disagreed with that call from Conservatives. They think voters will blame Republicans if their party forces a government shutdown over that issue.

Funding for Planned Parenthood has been controversial because not everyone agrees with the organization, which says its mission is to help all individuals manage their own fertility and birth control choices regardless of income, marital status, race, gender, age or nationality. Planned Parenthood gets 40 percent of their funding from the U.S. government. Planned Parenthood clinics also provide abortion services. Because of this, some people believe it should not receive any government funding.

The dispute threatened Boehner's speakership and shook the Republican caucus.

## "Tea Party" Cheers

A focus of conservatives' complaints, Boehner "just does not want to become the issue," said Representative John Mica, a Republican member of the House from Florida. "Some people have tried to make him the issue both in Congress and outside," Mica said.

Some Republicans welcomed his announcement. Many of these were members of the "Tea Party" caucus, who are among the most conservative members of their party.

Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas said "it's time for new leadership," and Representative Tom Massie of Kentucky said the speaker "subverted our Republic."

"I think it was inevitable," Massie said. "This is a condition of his own making right here."

But more mainstream Republicans said the victory for conservative Republicans was not worth it for the party as a whole.

## Criticizing "The Shutdown Caucus"

"The honor of John Boehner this morning stands in stark contrast to the idiocy of those members who seek to continually divide us," said Representative David Jolly of Florida.

"The shutdown caucus as I call them has a small victory," Jolly said.

Boehner's decision to resign on his own accord removes the possibility of a damaging vote to take away his speakership, a scenario that grew more likely amid the conservative clamor over a shutdown.

Boehner took over the speakership in January 2011.

He was first elected to the House in 1990 and soon established a strongly conservative record. He was part of former Speaker Newt Gingrich's leadership team when Republicans won control of the House for the first time in four decades in elections in 1995. In the wake of the GOP's disappointing performance in the 1998 Congressional elections, he was ousted from his leadership role.

## Government Shutdown Coming?

He won a 2006 race to succeed Tom DeLay as the House's No. 2 Republican when DeLay stepped aside as majority leader. He took over as the top Republican in the House in 2007 after Democrats retook the chamber.

His time as speaker has been defined by his early struggles to reach budget agreements with President Barack Obama and his disagreements with the expectations of conservatives who demanded a more confrontational approach with the White House.

In 2013, conservatives drove him to reluctantly embrace a partial government shutdown in hopes of delaying implementation of the new health care law. Now, conservative lawmakers have been pressing him to retry the tactic to attempt to take away federal funding from Planned Parenthood.
