They were there to test a new method of studying the biggest killer of beach swimmers — rip currents.

Again and again, the researchers toted 3-foot yellow-and-green contraptions into the surf. The odd devices were fashioned from foam, plastic sewer pipe, gym weights and cheap GPS units.

They then walked along the beach to wherever the devices washed up and retrieved them under the gaze of puzzled sunbathers.

Rip currents are blamed for killing 62 beachgoers in North Carolina since 1999. They are thought to be responsible for 80 percent of all U.S. surf rescues and are by far the most common reason that coastal swimmers drown.

## "Like An Endless Treadmill"

"It's really frightening for swimmers, because it's like an endless treadmill for them," said Simon Sanders, the ocean rescue supervisor for Carolina Beach.

The vast majority of his lifeguards' rescues, he said, were because of rip currents. The lifeguards themselves know how to deal with the currents, and often use them to zip out more quickly to swimmers in trouble.

The nature of perilous currents seems straightforward: Water piles up between the beach and an offshore sandbar, then finds a low point in the bar and rushes back out to sea, sometimes carrying swimmers with it.

Scientists, however, have only recently begun figuring out the life-and-death details. The 22 "data-logging drifters" that the team on the beach released Wednesday are thought to be the first ever used on the U.S. East Coast.

The team hopes the research will lead to more accurate ways of predicting rip currents and also, perhaps, better methods of escaping them.

The gadgets float along more or less as swimmers would and let researchers precisely and repeatedly track where the rip currents take them. They also gather other data on the currents' behavior.

## Unpredictable Hazards

On Wednesday, the surf was calm and the likelihood of dangerous rip currents was at the lowest of three risk levels that the National Weather Service uses for predictions. The group had set up right in front of a rip current that had been seen in the same location for weeks.

The rip current clearly was happening, with a dark patch of more or less calm water showing where the current split the surf on its way out to sea. The current was weak, though, and several swimmers and surfers bobbed cheerfully right in the middle of it.

The lack of danger actually underlined one reason why the research that could improve forecasting rip currents is important: They are unpredictable.

The currents develop constantly, but a given stretch of beach in North Carolina may develop them only rarely. The right combination of conditions necessary to create dangerously strong ones may exist for only five to 10 days a year in any one location. Such conditions include wave size and frequency, tides and sandbar shape.

"They're almost never dangerous," said Spencer Rogers, who led the construction of the drifters, "but when they are, Michael Phelps couldn't keep up with one." Phelps, a swimmer, has won more Olympic medals than anyone else.

The research also could lead to different advice about how to behave when caught in a rip current.

## Australian Says: Go With The Flow

One of the volunteers Wednesday was something of a celebrity in the world of coastal research — Rob Brander. He was visiting from Australia, as part of a multinational research trip.

The formal recommendation for escaping rip currents has long been to swim parallel to the beach until you're out of the relatively narrow band of flowing water. The advice has been the theme of a national rip current awareness campaign that for more than a decade has been an international model.

But Brander, an expert on surf behavior, said that in recent years researchers using drifters in Australia, the U.S. West Coast and elsewhere had found that in many cases the currents form circular movements of water. Known as eddies, these will return you to the beach if you simply float along with the flow.

The chances of that working in the currents studied were perhaps 80 percent to 90 percent.

Experts are now debating whether to continue advising people to swim parallel to shore — or whether they should instead be told to float and wait.

## Weak Swimmers Beware

Of course, the handful of cases that would shoot swimmers straight out and not return them could be fatal for weak swimmers.

Complicating things further, conditions can vary greatly on different kinds of coastline, and no one had really studied rip currents here the same way.

"A lot of people on the East Coast said, 'Ours don't behave that way,'" Brander said.

The new research project aims to find out.

Meanwhile, Brander said, the advice for beachgoers is pretty simple: If you know how to spot the tell-tale darker water and flatter surf of a rip current and are a good enough swimmer to get out of one, fine. If not, find a spot on a beach near a lifeguard or don't go in the water past your knees.

It's not so much the rip current that kills many of those who drown as it is the panic that getting caught in one triggers, Brander said.

His latest research includes polling people who have been caught in rip currents. The aim is to learn more about the experience and what that might tell researchers about how to improve beach safety.

Rip currents, he said, deserve a higher profile.

"There is this complacency, because they might only kill one or two people at a time," he said. "In Australia, they don't get much attention, but they kill more people than cyclones, bush fires, floods and sharks combined."
