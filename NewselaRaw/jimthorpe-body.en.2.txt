JIM THORPE, Pa. — Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe had [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) and European ancestry. When he died in 1953 at the age of 64, his children held a traditional Indian burial on the Sac and Fox Reservation in Oklahoma. Mourners shared a meal as the great athlete's body lay in full view inside a lodge.

The ceremony came to an abrupt halt when Thorpe's widow barged in. Patsy Thorpe, his third wife, was accompanied by state troopers and a funeral hearse. She seized the famous sportsman's body and drove away.

"It was a complete shock to all of us," recalls William Thorpe, the athlete's 85-year-old son, who was there that day. "We are all set to bury Dad in Oklahoma and then — boom! — he was gone, never to be returned."

Patsy Thorpe had cut a deal with two struggling towns in Pennsylvania called Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk. They agreed that if the towns merged, renamed themselves Jim Thorpe and built a memorial for him, she would present them with his remains for burial. The Olympian had never set foot in the town.

## "Time For My Dad To Come Home"

Thorpe was born in Oklahoma in 1888 and raised on the Sac and Fox Reservation. William Thorpe says the town of Jim Thorpe has done a wonderful job caring for his father's grave for 60 years, but now it's "time for my dad to come home."

William Thorpe, his brother and the Sac and Fox Nation won a lawsuit in April. The lawsuit demanded that the town return his father's body to the reservation. A federal judge ruled that the town had to return the body to Oklahoma under rules than govern Indian human remains and other artifacts.

The town of Jim Thorpe appealed the decision and is now defending itself. "People in this town are determined to keep our memorial, and keep the body here," says Mayor Michael Sofranko. "We've done nothing wrong. We've done nothing but honor Jim Thorpe all these years."

The grave site rests on soil from Oklahoma and the Olympic stadium in Stockholm, Sweden. Thorpe won gold medals in the decathlon and pentathlon in Stockholm in 1912. He also played professional football and baseball in the United States.

In his prime, Thorpe's fame was similar to that of quarterback Peyton Manning or Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps today.

## Townspeople Adore The Athlete

The athlete's full name was James Francis Thorpe. He is buried in his favorite white buckskin jacket. The memorial overlooks a grassy slope featuring statues saluting his varied career. Tributes are inscribed on the monuments and the stone building that holds his body.

One of the inscriptions is a comment to Thorpe from King Gustav V of Sweden at the Olympic medal ceremony. It reads: "Sir, you are the world's greatest athlete." Thorpe supposedly replied, "Thanks, King."

Anne Marie Fitzpatrick, 72, runs a downtown gift shop in Jim Thorpe, Pa. In her store there is a glass jar stuffed with cash with a sign that says "Keep Jim Thorpe In Jim Thorpe." Fitzpatrick has set up several donation jars around town to raise money for the appeal. "He's been here 59 years, and we're not about to give him up," Fitzpatrick explains.

Fitzpatrick was in grade school when Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk merged. She has helped organize an annual Jim Thorpe birthday ceremony in May at the memorial for many years.

It is difficult for outsiders to understand the adoration for the athlete from the townspeople of Jim Thorpe. After all, their only connection to him is his name. But many have raised money over the years to put up statues of the athlete. There is now a $60,000 statue of Thorpe throwing a discus and a $50,000 statue of him running with a football. Fundraising is underway to add a baseball statue.

## Thorpe Grandsons Stand With Town

Not all of the athlete's family agree that his body should be taken to Oklahoma. "The town was built around my grandpa — people revere him," says John Thorpe, 56. John is a grandson who lives in California. He has joined with another grandson to fight their uncles and tribe in an effort to keep Jim Thorpe in Jim Thorpe.

Mike Koehler, 75, thinks the town has honored his grandfather's memory well. "For God's sake, leave him alone," he says. John Thorpe and Koehler have traveled here for years to take part in Jim Thorpe celebrations. They point out that Oklahoma could have kept Thorpe in 1953 but passed on the chance.

After Thorpe's death, his widow and Oklahoma's governor agreed on a deal for the state to build a grave site and memorial. But after funding was approved, the governor abruptly changed his mind and dropped the plans.

Patsy Thorpe was furious and began, in the words of William Thorpe, "shopping my dad's body around the country." She first traveled to Philadelphia. There she tried but failed to persuade the commissioner of the National Football League to pay for a grave site and memorial. Thorpe did not just play football. He was also the NFL's first president.

William Thorpe says his stepmother also failed to enlist Carlisle, Pa. This town was home to Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where Thorpe excelled in football and track. Thorpe was sent to the boarding school at age 16 by his father to learn a trade.

While in Philadelphia, Patsy Thorpe saw a news story about Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk holding fundraisers to save the depressed towns. She contacted town leaders and made the deal that brought the towns a new name and Jim Thorpe's body.
