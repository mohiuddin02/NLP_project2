Look at the face of a friendly dog when it's being petted, and it's no surprise: dogs love being touched. Unlike other animals, like porcupines, dogs are a relatively hands-on species that likes the feeling of physical contact.

But research suggests that they aren't the only ones benefiting from the petting. Studies show that positive interactions between people and dogs make both species happier. After enjoyable activities, like petting, play or talking, both dogs and humans feel a surge of chemicals in their bodies called endorphins. The endorphins are linked to bonding and happy feelings.

A recent study shows that simply staring at your dog may help lead to this endorphin rush. Dogs are incredibly good at reading human faces. In some cases, they can even detect specific facial expressions. The act of gazing at your dog — or your dog gazing back at you — may actually be enough to lift both your spirits.

## Gazing, An "Attachment Behavior"

The new study, by Miho Nagasawa, of Azabu University in Japan, and her team, analyzed the levels of certain endorphins in humans and dogs before and after the two species stared at each other. They found that owners and dogs that shared a long gaze had higher levels of oxytocin than owners whose dogs only gave them a short gaze. Oxytocin is an endorphin and is sometimes called the "cuddle hormone." It plays an important role in social bonding and is also responsible for a mother's attachment to her newborn infant. Nagasawa and her colleagues concluded that gazing between dogs and owners was a form of "attachment behavior."

Nagasawa's study investigates whether a dog's gazing affected not just the owner's oxytocin levels, but the dog's as well. The researchers collected urine samples from 30 dog-and owner pairs before and after a 30-minute interaction. In the first study, they found that owners whose dogs gazed the longest had a significant increase in endorphin levels. This latest study shows that the dogs also experienced a similar increase.

The story that has emerged from this research should make dog lovers cheer. Sharing a gaze with your dog produces a similar reaction to what's observed between mothers and infants. This may help explain our intense and deep relationship with dogs.

## Looking At Wolves

Nagasawa's findings are part of a larger discussion among scientists related to the coevolution theory. Coevolution is the idea that two species evolved over time in ways that are related to one another.

Nagasawa wanted to better understand this type of evolution, so she and her team did a similar study with wolves. They hoped to determine if wolves would have increased levels of oxytocin as well. The wolves in the study had been raised by humans.

However, there was a major difference between the dogs and wolves, even before the humans could measure the oxytocin levels. The wolves couldn't hold gazes with the humans in the study for more than a few moments. This was a major difference. It led the researchers to conclude that the "dog-to-owner gaze" developed as dogs were domesticated. In other words, dogs learned to communicate with humans through eye contact because they are pets.

Testing evolutionary theories like coevolution can be tricky because animals are socialized in different ways. It can be exciting to test their behaviors in a variety of settings. However, there are many factors to consider. Zsófia Virányi is a scientist at  the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna and is the co-founder of the Wolf Science Center. Virányi maintains that some differences in animals are related to evolution, and others are related to how animals are raised.

## The Human Connection

In the wolf studies, it is important to understand the setting. For example, in the gazing study, were the wolves exploring a new environment where the testing took place? Were they trying to escape? If so, the factors may help explain why the wolf could not focus and stare at the human. Virányi even wonders about other social behaviors besides staring. Perhaps if scientists tested other types of behavior between wolves and humans, they would detect a positive hormonal connection between wolves and humans.

So far, science has supported what many people feel about dogs: there is a deep bond between a dog and its owner. However, we should not rule out other species, including wolves, from sharing similar connections to humans.

"I'm not convinced that this is something dog-specific," Virányi adds.
