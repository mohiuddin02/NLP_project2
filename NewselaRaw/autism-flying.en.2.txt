BALTIMORE â€” Tomas Harp was ready to get on an airplane for the very first time. He stood in the security line at BWI, Baltimore's airport, where bags are searched for everyone's safety.

Tomas wanted to go right away but he still had to wait. His mother, Carolina Harp, reminded the 7-year-old that waiting is part of going to the airport.

Tomas and his brother, Mateo, who is 9, were ready to do something strange. They were about to get on a flight that was not actually going to leave the runway. The plane would stay on the ground.

The Harps were taking part in the Wings for Autism program. Wings for Autism teaches children with autism how to board a plane. The Harps were one of 50 families in the program.

## Lots Of People, Lots Of Noise

Traveling with children can be hard for anyone. But for parents of children with autism, it can be terrifying. Autism affects the brain. A person with autism understands the world differently. They sometimes have trouble making sense of why things happen.

Everything about flying on a plane can be hard to understand if you have autism. You have to wait in lines with hundreds of other people. Airports also have many strange noises, like planes taking off and announcements over speakers. It can be very strange and scary.

Jennifer Bishop of Baltimore was at the airport with her son, Nathaniel Epstein, who is 14 years old. Nathaniel had been on a plane once before when he was 4. Nathaniel was very scared and the trip was a disaster. Now, 10 years later, she was ready to try again.

Nathaniel can walk, but he spends most of his time in a wheelchair, Bishop said. This is because he gets scared in new places. If he gets fearful, he might sit down and decide not to move. "Just going to the grocery store is a big deal," Bishop said.

The airport was different on the practice day, she said. Volunteers at the airport took families through a special security gate. They boarded the plane and got in their seats. They heard instructions about safety and were served pretzels and a glass of water. They were back off the plane in a half-hour. It was the fastest little flight to nowhere.

## Practice Was A Success

The parents who were there that day said they try to avoid airports. Instead, they just drive everywhere. Carolina Harp said she drives her sons a lot, even when they go on vacation. Tomas and Mateo have gone on long trips from their home in Maryland to Georgia and Florida, which means driving 10 or 12 hours.

This summer the family needs to go to California, which is all the way across the country. The trip would take days and Harp said she does not plan to drive that far. She has decided that her family must learn how to fly.

Wings for Autism was very helpful for the parents and children. Bishop learned a lot on the practice run. For example, she learned that getting on the plane was a challenge for Nathaniel. At first, he refused to get out of his wheelchair without his mom next to him.

Bishop was pushing the wheelchair from behind, so she decided to move around to the front of Nathaniel's chair to walk with him. Then the family went to the first seat of the plane and sat down. Nathaniel smiled. He had done it.

Bishop knows once they fly for real it might be harder. "How much easier it would be if the airport was filled with volunteers who were expecting us," Bishop said.
