Hungary has passed a law against most shopping on Sundays. Lawmakers argued that the move would give families more time together.

Not everybody thinks the law is a good idea. One in 10 people in the country do not have a job. Those who work, do not make that much money. Stores warn that the law will force them to get rid of workers by laying them off. Another worry is that the law will mean the government has less money. Every time an item is sold, the government collects a little money in taxes.

Sunday is the Christian day of rest. The law in Hungary is like others in Western European countries that limit shopping on the Christian Sabbath. Many countries started those laws after World War II.

## Some Will Still Be Open For Business

The Christian Democratic People's Party proposed the law. It is a group in the government that is in favor of Christianity. About half of the people in Hungary are Christian, according to the CIA World Factbook.

The law is like those in Germany, Austria, Holland and other countries. Like those laws, the one in Hungary allows several types of stores to stay open.

Drug stores can still be open on Sundays. So can tobacco shops, farmers markets and stores on military bases. Bakeries can open between 5 a.m. and noon.

Shops at airports, train stations, gas stations and hospitals also are allowed to be open. They can stay open as late as 10 p.m.

Smaller shops are not covered by the law. There is one condition, though. The people who work in those stores on Sunday have to own at least one-fifth of the business or be family members of the owners.

All stores can be open the four Sundays before Christmas. Each store can also chose one other Sunday a year to be open.

## Family Ties

The National Association of Entrepreneurs and Employers opposed the law. The business group said the law would lead to about 20,000 layoffs. It wants all Hungarians to vote on the shopping law. The group pointed out a government report that said about 1 in 5 Hungarians do most of their weekly shopping on Sundays.

The government did not check on how the law would affect businesses before it was proposed, the Hungarian business news website Portfolio said.

The law starts on March 15. It will mostly affect larger department stores and big European grocery store chains.

Lawmakers who favored the law believe it will strengthen families. They said it will make sure that shopping will not "shorten the time that families spend together."

Hungarian Economy Minister Mihaly Varga was against the law. He makes decisions about how Hungary uses its money. Varga asked stores to work out an arrangement to pay people willing to work Sundays.
