It is a mystery why the Airbus A320 crashed in the middle of the flight. The pilots did not send out an emergency call. They had lost radio contact with air traffic controllers before the crash, officials in France said. The plane went down while flying from Barcelona, Spain, to Duesseldorf, Germany.

The crash left officials and families across Europe deeply upset.

"The crash of the German plane with more than 140 people on board is a shock," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. She is the head of Germany's government. The crash "plunges us in Germany, the French and the Spanish into deep sorrow."

Merkel said it was still too soon to guess what happened.

## No Signs Of Life

The head of the French government said a helicopter crew landed briefly in the area of the crash. They saw no signs of life.

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a black box had been found at the crash site and "will be immediately investigated." He did not say whether it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder. One box records things the pilots say while they are flying.

Germanwings is the airline company that operated the plane. It said Flight 9525 carried 144 passengers and six crew members. A group of German high school students was onboard.

The plane left Barcelona Airport at 10:01 a.m. It suddenly began to dive after climbing  38,000 feet into the air, said Thomas Winkelmann. He is the head of Germanwings.

The plane crashed in the French Alps. The crash was near a popular ski area. The area is 430 miles south of Paris.

French government spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said the plane crashed in a very remote area. The mountains are steep and far from roads. Brandet expected "an extremely long and extremely difficult" search. The weather in the area became worse Tuesday afternoon. A chilly rain began falling.

## The Plane Had Flown Thousands Of Trips

Winkelmann said the airplane's pilot had worked for Germanwings and Lufthansa for more than 10 years. Germanwings is owned by Lufthansa, which is Germany's biggest airline.

Airbus delivered the plane in 1991 to Lufthansa. The plane had flown 58,300 hours in about 46,700 flights, Airbus said. It was last checked over on Monday. Its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013.

Pierre Polizzi owns a campground near where the plane crashed. He said he heard the plane making strange noises shortly before it crashed.

"At 11:30, I heard a series of loud noises in the air. There are often fighter jets flying over, so I thought it sounded just like that. I looked outside, but I couldn't see any fighter planes," he said.

Polizzi said the plane crashed about 3 to 11 miles from his campground.

"It's going to be very difficult to get there," he said. The mountain is snowy and very isolated.

## A320 Flies Very High

The A320 plane has two engines. It flies to cities between one and five hours apart. The A320 is built to fly up to an altitude of 39,000 feet. That is more than 7 miles high. It can begin to experience problems as low as 37,000 feet, depending on temperature and how much weight it is carrying.

Around the world, 3,606 A320s are in use, Airbus said.

The A320 is considered to be a very safe airplane. It has had fewer than one deadly accident for every 1 million takeoffs, Boeing said.
