CHICAGO â€” People are buying pianos again. Bob Frazier believes it so much he opened a second piano store, even when people told him it was crazy.

People told him the piano business was dying. They said youngsters were not interested in playing piano, and electronic keyboards were more popular. New homes were too small for pianos now, people said.

Frazier wanted to prove them wrong. He was the top salesperson at a piano shop near Chicago. He and the owners decided to open a second store in a town nearby.

It is a year later, and business at the new store is picking up, Frazier said. Many families know the value of music, so he thinks the piano will survive and thrive.

Piano sales had gone down for the last three years in a row. Now they are going up because the economy is getting better. An economy is made up of all the things a country makes and sells. As the economy has improved, more people are buying houses.

## Piano Sales Rise, Fall With Home Sales

Piano sales and house sales go together, said Larry Morton. He is president of Hal Leonard, a publisher of sheet music. People buy pianos like they buy other furniture, he said. It is part of the experience of having a house.

Piano sales were the worst during the recession that began in 2008. In a recession, businesses lose money and people lose jobs. In this recession, many families lost their homes. Sales are not back to where they were before the recession, but sales people and those who tune pianos for a living are hopeful.

Piano sales are not dying, just changing, said Dennis Saphir. He used to own a piano store. Saphir said there are too many used and digital pianos for sale. That cuts into sales of traditional, or acoustic, pianos.

Saphir closed his last store in April and switched to selling pianos online. His family started selling pianos in Austria in the early 1800s. He tried to keep it going after the recession started, but he had to close his five showrooms.

His website tries to take the worry out of buying a used piano. Saphir checks them out, and tunes and repairs them. He also lists pianos other people are selling. Customers can shop for pianos from home. There are now 22 pianos for sale on the website.

## People Still Interested In Music

People are still interested in music, Saphir said. Parents are still signing up their children for lessons. He said adults still buy sheet music to play. Today's parents want their children to learn music, but he said they might not want to buy a new piano.

Holly Kennedy said more of her students want to learn piano than any other instrument. She has been a music teacher in Chicago for 16 years. Her students' ages run from 4 to 60.

Kennedy said many adults studied piano as children, then stopped. Now that they have time and money, she said they want to learn as a hobby.

## It's Starting To Turn Around

Thomas Zoells fell in love with the piano growing up in Switzerland and has never grown out of it. He is one of Chicago's biggest piano fans. Zoells opened his shop, PianoForte, in 2004, and he sells very expensive pianos.

He opened at a bad time, just before the recession started. He struggled for years to make money. The store opened with only four pianos and a desk.

Today, it has three floors of pianos. Business has been busy and bounced back in the last three months.

Zoells has faith that people will keep falling in love with the piano. There are a lot of reasons to worry, said Zoells. But piano shops want to turn things around, he said, and it looks like it is already getting better.
