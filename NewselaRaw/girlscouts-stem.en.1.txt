IRVINE, Calif. — Janice Stanley is pumped up as the group stares intently — but quietly — at her.

Stanley, a nurse at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, uses robotic mannequins as a tool to train doctors, nurses and X-ray technicians.

But on this afternoon, no health professionals are seated before her, though they could be someday.

"Hi, guys," the cheery Stanley says.

Then, instantly, she corrects herself.

"Hi, girls!"

Today, Stanley is teaching 14 Girl Scouts, ages 11 to 14. They are at Kaiser to earn the new My STEM Life badge, which is unique to the Girl Scouts of Orange County, California.

## Reducing The Gender Gap

Girl Scouts and local companies are teaming up to reduce the gender gap within science, technology, engineering and math (together known as STEM). About three-fifths of Orange County's fastest-growing jobs are in STEM.

Research shows that by middle school, girls often turn away permanently from STEM subjects. They deprive themselves of career options and what women can offer the world in technology and science.

"We're leaving half the population out of the most exciting jobs of the 21st century," says Paula Golden, president of Broadcom, a computer chip company. Broadcom was the first to partner with the Girl Scouts to create the STEM Consortium, believing that training girls in STEM is a smart investment.

"The way women work, think and innovate is traditionally very different from that of young men," Golden explains. 

About one-fifth, or 4,000, of Orange County Girl Scouts can earn the STEM badge. 

## STEM Learning Is Important To The Economy

Before the girls get to work with Kaiser's robotic mannequins, Stanley points out some gender gap facts: Half the nation's work force are women, but they fill only one-quarter of STEM jobs. Meanwhile, women in STEM jobs earn 33 percent more than in other fields.

"We could actually be doing what's fun, and make more money and be doing better for ourselves and our families," Stanley explains.

It's not just girls and women who benefit from STEM careers. Educators and business leaders identify STEM learning as essential to competitive innovation and the country's economy.

Companies backing the My STEM Life badge each kicked in $10,000, with an additional $15,000 from Broadcom, to develop its learning program.

## Girls Learn Some High-Tech Medical Care

Hands-on activities show participants how math and science relate to girls' everyday interests, from creating music playlists to building sandcastles. Girls also learn how STEM education is necessary for specialized jobs. Skill emphasis ranges from problem solving to studying the insides of computers.

The girls mentored by nurse Stanley learned high-tech medical care basics with Kaiser's "SimMan 3G" robot. They donned germ-free gloves and stethoscopes to check his vitals, and to deliver chest compressions and shock treatment.

On the technology end, they manipulated SimMan's computerized breathing, turning his lips blue. They also got the mannequin to say, "Doc, I feel like I could die," and, "Go away."

Another project features an ocean excursion to monitor marine populations, collect samples, and supply information for the Crystal Cove Alliance, an environmental group that works to keep the coastline healthy. 

## Gender Barriers Still High

Girls pay $5 to cover some of the cost of the trips. The fee also holds the girls accountable to show up, says Lara Chard, program expert for Girl Scouts of Orange County and a former Girl Scout of 12 years.

Chard says roughly 300 STEM badges have been awarded so far.

In 2012, Girl Scouts of the USA published a report, "Generation STEM: What Girls Say about Science, Technology, Engineering and Math."

The report found that an encouraging 74 percent of high school girls were interested in STEM subjects. On the discouraging side, the report also noted that gender barriers "are still high for girls."

Last year, scouts who attended a "Voice for Girls" gathering were asked how schools could keep girls engaged in STEM learning. One scout answered, "Well, you can make sure your teachers know our first names, too, and not just the boys' first names."

## Still Lots Of Favoritism, Inequality

That answer stuck with Nancy Nygren, CEO of the Girl Scouts of Orange County. She is astounded by how much discouraging favoritism and inequality still occurs between boys and girls in learning environments.

Nygren, 60, knows through her own career what it is like to be a science-loving geek. Straight out of college, she worked on the space shuttle program in Houston. Later, Nygren worked as a software programmer in the defense industry before taking her skills to the nonprofit field.

"I was young and blonde and female, and there weren't that many of us," Nygren says. "That is changing, thank goodness."

Just not fast enough.

## Not Enough Role Models

Broadcom's Golden says that's partly because role models like Nygren are still too few. "They don't have a whole generation of mentors who can tell them, 'Come over to Broadcom and see what it's like to be an engineer.'"

From Nygren's viewpoint, "These young women have no way to see their future."

Twelve-year old Taylor Duzel, one of only three girls to raise her hand when Stanley asked about interest in a STEM career, came away more convinced about pursuing a career in medicine. Duzel enjoys her science class, but the way she sees it, she faces one unexpected hurdle.

"I have a light stomach, so I have to get over that if I want to be a surgeon or doctor," Taylor says.

"But I think I can do it."
