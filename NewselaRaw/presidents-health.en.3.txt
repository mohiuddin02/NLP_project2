After World War I, President Woodrow Wilson traveled the country by train. He was giving speeches to create public support for the Treaty of Versailles, the agreement that ended the war.

In Colorado, three weeks into his tour, Wilson collapsed from exhaustion. The train sped back to Washington. But a week later Wilson had a stroke that paralyzed his left side. A stroke is a sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain.

After his stroke, Wilson was in very bad shape. He couldn't move for days. Eventually, he was able to walk again, but he was still extremely weak.

Wilson wrote to his personal doctor and friend: "My personal pride must not be allowed to stand in the way of my duty to the country. If I am only half-efficient I should turn the office over to the vice president. The country cannot afford to wait for me."

But Wilson's doctor and wife convinced him to keep his condition a secret. For the last 17 months of his presidency, the presidents' advisers kept things running smoothly while he was seriously ill.

This may the most remarkable example of a president's secret health problems, but it is certainly not the only one.

Here are other examples of presidential illnesses that weren't known to the public:

## Abraham Lincoln

All his life, Lincoln suffered from "melancholy" â€” sadness without a particular reason. Today we call this depression. Lincoln was probably depressed all his life, even before the horrific Civil War and the deaths of his two sons.

As a young man, Lincoln talked of hurting himself more than once. As an adult, he often cried in public and read sad poetry. He saw the world as a dark and difficult place. Despite his depression, Lincoln was able to lead the country through one of its darkest periods, the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Americans.

## Grover Cleveland

During the 1893 financial panic, Cleveland noticed a sore on the roof his mouth. The sore seemed to be cancerous, and Cleveland had it removed while sailing on his yacht to his summer home. The crew of the ship had to swear to keep the operation a secret.

## Franklin D. Roosevelt

FDR was president for 12 years, from 1933 to 1945. He led the United States during the Great Depression and World War II. But the public during that time didn't know that FDR was paralyzed from the waist down due to polio.

## John F. Kennedy

Kennedy had many health problems, including serious back pain and Addison's disease, which caused physical weakness and yellow skin. JFK took as many as 12 pills at a time to cope with his illnesses.

## Ronald Reagan

After a speech at the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., Reagan was shot by John Hinckley. Reagan was wounded in the chest and arm. At 70 years old, the wounds were especially serious for the president. But the White House didn't want to show confusion or weakness. Reagan left the hospital after only 13 days even though it took him about seven months to recover fully.

Later in his presidency, Reagan sometimes had trouble remembering names and other details. He was in his late 70s.  In 1994, Reagan announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, which affects memory.
