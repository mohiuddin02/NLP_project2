EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. — Teachers in an Illinois school district are being told to stop talking about the protests in Ferguson with their students.

Ferguson is a city in Missouri. On Aug. 9, a white police officer there shot and killed an unarmed black teen named Michael Brown. Since then, people have been protesting. The black community is angry and they say they are seeking justice.

Many people are talking about the 18-year-old's death. Meanwhile, in the Edwardsville School District, only a few miles from Ferguson, Missouri, teachers have been told to "change the subject and refocus the students."

This new rule has upset some parents. They think the teachers should talk about the events in Ferguson. They say their children can learn from what happened. Teachers can use the subject to teach about the police and court systems. Students can also learn about the lack of trust between blacks and whites.

## Just The Facts

School officials say the problem is that teachers have not always stuck to the facts. Teachers give students their own opinions about what happened.

The feelings of teachers have caused anger among parents and students, according to a letter to teachers. This anger is not healthy for the community, the letter said.

Across the area, teachers are trying to figure out how to talk with their students about Ferguson. Brown's death has brought world attention to the problems between blacks and whites in the area. Many of the police departments have mostly white officers. That makes many blacks feel powerless.

Several school leaders met on Wednesday at EducationPlus. The group represents many local school districts. They talked about how to deal with students' feelings. Many students have watched fights between protesters and police on television. Some students may also have witnessed the riots in person. The leaders also talked about the kinds of discussions that might take place in classrooms.

"Nobody said the staff should be silent," said Don Senti. He is in charge of EducationPlus. Edwardsville may be the only school district in the area that told teachers not to discuss Ferguson, he said.

## "No One Got Upset" About The Discussion

Ed Hightower is in charge of all the schools in the Edwardsville district. He said the situation in Ferguson was a worthwhile subject. Still, he said discussion is useful only if teachers are fair. They have to discuss both sides and leave their opinions out of it.

"We all have personal opinions about what has gone wrong, what has gone right. And we all have opinions on what should be done," Hightower said.

Abigail Wilson, an Edwardsville senior, disagrees. She said she would like to talk about Ferguson. She talks about it with friends. She would like to discuss it in class.

"It's modern history," she said. "It's huge. It's so much more interesting than things that happened 200 years ago."

On Tuesday, student Nate Hunsell's health class talked about the situation in Ferguson. The teacher and class considered two sides — the community and the police.

The discussion was not emotional, Nate said. "No one got upset about anything that was said."

Then he learned from teachers Wednesday that they could not talk about Ferguson.

"I thought it was kind of dumb," Nate said. "It's something that's going on. It's kind of a big deal."

## Many Parents Support Talking

Some parents have responded on the Edwardsville parents' Facebook page. Many of them said teachers should try to keep their opinions to themselves. Still, they also do not think teachers should completely ignore Ferguson.

An event this big should not be ignored, said parent Glenn Beckmann. He said that there are hundreds of teachers in the district. Nearly all of those teachers would be fair.

Hightower said the district is not trying to ignore what's going on. They just want to keep teachers from paying too much attention to one side of the story, he said.
