WASHINGTON â€” For nearly 10 years, the F-22 Raptor fighter jets sat on the ground. The aircraft were called too dangerous to fly. People pointed to them as an example of wasteful spending by the U.S. military.

But last week, the F-22 finally got a chance to fly. U.S. military leaders said the plane was used along with other fighter jets and bombers. They targeted Islamic State (ISIL) fighters' bases and buildings in northern Syria.

The extremist group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt. The group wants to take over land in the Middle East and create a strict religious government. It has already taken control of land in Iraq and Syria.

General William Mayville is in charge of operations for the top U.S. military command. He said the aircraft helped drop bombs with precision on many targets. They destroyed the fighters' headquarters, training camps, housing and combat vehicles.

## The F-22's Long Takeoff

The F-22's seeming success is a real comeback from three years ago. The jet was not allowed to fly for nearly five months. It was found to have problems with its oxygen-supply system.

For a while, the plane's future was very much in doubt.

The story of the F-22 began during the Cold War. At this time, the United States' main enemy was the Soviet Union. Russia and a number of other countries made up the Soviet Union, which was a huge nation.

The United States wanted a plane that could beat a new generation of Soviet jets in dogfights. But after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Moscow never built those fighters.

Still, the Air Force held a final contest between two companies. Lockheed Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. were the best in the world at stealth technology. A "stealth" aircraft cannot be seen by radar.

## Flying Faster And Under The Radar

The two companies designed two models. One, the Lockheed YF-22, and the other, the Northrop YF-23, were both made in California.

A lot was riding on the contest beyond the technology in the aircraft. Northrop was already secretly building the B-2 Stealth bomber. If it had also won the fighter contest, it would have made almost all Air Force combat jets. At the same time, Northrop's reputation was hurt by an investigation. This put Lockheed in a stronger position to get political support in Congress.

Lockheed finally won the contest, and the F-22 got its final OK from Congress in 1991.

The plane can fly faster than the speed of sound. It has high-tech radar and sensors. A pilot is supposed to be able to track and shoot an enemy plane before that plane can detect the F-22.

The Air Force says the plane is necessary to keeping the United States in control of the air around the world. But it faced a huge problem.

The Pentagon said the plane was too advanced for low-tech enemies. So it sat in hangars while other U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on targets in Afghanistan. It didn't get used during the war in Iraq. There was no call for it in the fighting above Libya.

## We Don't Need That Many

Twenty years ago, the Pentagon planned to buy 648 F-22s. They were supposed to cost $139 million each. But the cost kept going up. Eventually, one F-22 cost $412 million. The government said it was the most expensive fighter jet ever.

In 2009, the Defense secretary stopped the purchases at 188 planes. He said they cost too much. The Air Force received the last F-22 in 2012.

The plane was originally intended to take the place of F-15 fighter jets, which were designed in the early 1970s. But the Air Force fleet is almost all still F-15s. These jets are supposed to be stronger than enemy planes and gain control of the sky.

The U.S. military got its first F-22s in 2005, but it did not take long before problems occured and it needed repairs.

Over the years, F-22 pilots have complained of one problem in particular. The jet's systems weren't feeding them enough oxygen. This made them dizzy. One pilot died in 2010 when his oxygen system failed.

## Pictures Tell The Mission's Story

Military officials kept all F-22s on the ground for nearly five months in 2011. The next year, F-22s were allowed to fly only near possible landing strip. This was in case a pilot was not getting enough oxygen.

The plane returned to regular service three months later. But no one noticed until a news conference Tuesday. Mayville shared black-and-white images with reporters. They showed several targets before and after the airstrikes in Syria.

In one picture, a building used by ISIL fighters was seen with its satellite dishes blown up. The rest of the building was hardly touched.

The bombs that destroyed the systems were dropped by F-22 Raptors, Mayville said.
