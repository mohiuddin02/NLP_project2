The 14-year-old towers above his peers at school. Bol is already a whopping 6 feet 10 inches tall. That makes him taller than 99 percent of adults in America and most NBA players.

Bol is already tall enough to be a professional basketball player. But the National Basketball Association (NBA) is years away. Right now, he plays on his school's team in Kansas. He does not qualify for the varsity team, so he has to play on the junior varsity squad.

"Look at me," he told his coach one day at school. "How am I supposed to be happy like this?"

## Hunting Clothes That Fit

Bol was upset because he is so tall that the sleeves of his school uniform barely go past his armpits. The bottom of his shirt doesn't even reach his belt. The cuffs on his pants hung just past his knees. The coach had to order a special pair of long pants for Bol Bol that cost $100.

Bol got the height genes and basketball skills from his father, Manute Bol. Manute was almost 7 feet 7 inches tall. He played 10 seasons in the NBA and was also known as a humanitarian. He spent all the money he made playing basketball to help poor people in Sudan, the country in Africa where he was born. He helped build schools and hospitals in Sudan, which had been turned into a war zone because of a civil war. Manute died in 2010 from an illness he got while he was helping people in Sudan.

Bol resembles his father in many ways. They have the same cheek bones, brown eyes and long hands. Bol's mother and Manute's former wife, Ajok Kuag, said the men even act he same.

## Dad Casts A Long Shadow

"I know he's my son, but he has nothing from me," Kuag said. "He's all Manute."

Manute still plays a big role in Bol's life and was the one who inspired his son to play ball. Bol and Manute used to visit the gym together to shoot baskets on the court, ignoring the strangers that would stare at the tall men as they played. Bol did not like basketball at first but he learned to enjoy the sport from his father and older brothers.

People often approach Bol Bol to ask him how tall he is or tell him how much he resembles his dad. He got used to having a hero for a father.

"He was always nice to anybody," Bol Bol said. "He liked everybody, and he always liked to help people."

Even though Bol is only 14, he has a lot of skill. His height helps him block shots and rebound like his dad and other tall centers. But coaches say he can also handle the ball, shoot and pass as well as many guards or small forwards.

## "The Sky Is The Limit"

"The sky is the limit," says L.J. Goolsby, Bol's former coach. "He's got natural abilities a lot of kids his age don't have, regardless of size."

The coaches at Bishop Miege, Bol's high school, are teaching him to act like an adult and play like a champion. At school, they remind him to tuck in his shirt and not wear a sweatshirt since it is not part of the school uniform. During practice, they encourage him to shoot better, keep his hands up, and stay focused all the way to the end of the game.

"He likes to shoot around and play basketball," Rick Zych, the boys basketball coach at Miege said. "But does he like to play competitive basketball? That's what we've got to figure out."

One day, Bol was kicked out of practice because the coach thought he had a bad attitude. Bol was told he'd never succeed without a better attitude. The coach wondered if he'd ever see Bol again.

## Putting In The Work

Bol showed up the next day, and had a great practice.

If Bol wants to become as talented and famous as his dad, he still has a lot of work to do. His focus now is to play harder and more often so he can continue to improve.

He is a sweet kid with a big heart and a lot of talent. He is at the beginning of a journey that many people will be watching. Even though the journey is similar to his father's, it's new for Bol.

"I'm trying to go to the NBA," he said. "To help my family."

There is a pause. Bol smiles. "Like my dad."
