SEATTLE, Wash. — When people want to make a difference in an election, they vote. Now one city is giving people another tool. It is giving voters money. Seattle, Washington, is giving people there $100 each in the form of coupons. They can then give the money to people running in elections. 

In Seattle, voters approved the program in November. It is the first system like it in the United States. The idea is to get people who don't normally give money to campaigns more involved in elections.

## Power To The People

The hope is to make democracy more, well, democratic. The plan makes it easier for everyday people to choose their leaders. It also aims to make big companies and rich people less powerful in elections.

"We're very eager to see how it works," said Michael Malin. He leads the Campaign Finance Institute in Washington, D.C. Malin said that right now, politics are controlled by too few people. The rich have more money to give. They can influence who runs in elections. 

Malin said that rich people will always be able to give more. Seattle's program could make them less powerful, however. When it's easier for more people to donate, more people will have a voice. 

## The Price Of Democracy

Seattle's plan isn't cheap. The money for the campaign donations has to come from somewhere. Seattle's voters decided to tax themselves $3 million a year - or $6 million for each two-year election cycle.

In exchange for paying higher taxes, residents will earn four paper vouchers, or coupons, worth $25 each - for a total of $100 per person. They can donate the vouchers to candidates for mayor or city council.

## Role Model Vs. Ripe For Abuse

David Donnelly is president of Every Voice, a group that supports the vouchers in Seattle. He expects other cities and states to copy Seattle's plan. 

"There are people all over the country that are seeing these examples as beacons of hope to take big money out of politics," Donnelly said. 

However, not everyone supports the new program.

Robert Mahon once ran Seattle's Ethics and Elections Commission. He thinks people will abuse the law. Mahon believes it will worsen the problem of "dark money" in elections. Some groups can accept as much money as they want from businesses and people and then give it to candidates. The law does not make them say who gives them money.

Some people think the program could cause other problems. One worry is that the vouchers might not support all candidates fairly. The system may benefit candidates already in office and make it harder for new candidates, whose campaigns might not be ready to accept money. Some people also say the $3 million a year might not be enough. They doubt it will cover vouchers for all 419,000 voters in Seattle.

The Seattle law also has a limit on how much candidates can spend. However, candidates can ask to be released from the spending limit. That would let some candidates raise and spend more money from vouchers and other donations. It could be an unfair advantage. 

## Simplifying Campaign Donations

Alan Durning helped write the law. He supports the program. Candidates who are in office and running again will always have an advantage in an election, he said. However, giving lesser-known candidates public money through vouchers only helps their campaigns, he pointed out. 

Fewer than two of every 10 Seattle voters gave money to candidates in Seattle in 2013. If the voucher system gets voters more involved, it will be a great problem to have, he said. If that's the case, Durning said, it can be fixed by adjusting the value of the vouchers. The city could also change how many vouchers are given. Not that many people are donating money at the moment. This new plan might help more people get involved with campaigns since it makes it easier for them to donate. 

Durning said that if the city is lucky enough to have more voters wanting to use the vouchers than expected, the city can adjust the system.
