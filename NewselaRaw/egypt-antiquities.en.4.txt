LUXOR, Egypt â€” Tutankhamun was an Egyptian king. He lived 3,300 years ago. King Tut died when he was just 19 years old. He was buried in a tomb. It was full of gold and jewels.

Experts think the tomb has hidden rooms. A beautiful queen may be buried in one of them.

Mamdouh el-Damaty is an Egyptian official. He is in charge of Egypt's ancient places. Egypt is in the Middle East.

Mamdouh wants to look for the rooms. They are in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Many ancient Egyptian kings were buried there. King Tut was also buried there.

## Tomb Was Built For A Queen, Expert Says

Nicholas Reeves is an expert on ancient Egypt. He visited Tut's tomb with Mamdouh. Nicholas thinks ancient Egyptians built it for Queen Nefertiti. He says Tut buried her. Tut died 10 years after Nefertiti. Then, Nicholas thinks Tut was buried near Nefertiti.

Nicholas said the walls may hide two doorways. One of them may lead to Nefertiti's tomb. The tomb looks like it was built for a queen. It does not look like it was built for a king.

## Official Says Maybe Tut's Mother Is In Tomb

Mamdouh agrees that a woman might be buried in the tomb. He thinks it is Kia, though. Some experts think Kia was Tut's mother.

Nefertiti was married to Pharaoh Akhenaten. Pharaoh is the ancient Egyptian word for king. Smenkhare became pharaoh after Akhenaten died. Tut came after.

Nicholas thinks Smenkhare was really Nefertiti. He says Nefertiti changed her name to Smenkhare. Then she became king.

Experts hope to find the secret rooms. Then they may find out the real story. King Tut's family is full of secrets.
