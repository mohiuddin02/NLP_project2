WATFORD CITY, N.D. — The dump truck rumbled over miles of unpaved roads in the hills just east of the Montana border. It drove past cattle and grain bins and haystacks, before arriving at the dirt pit. Bill Gore slid his truck onto the scale, inched up in line, and signaled a man to pile the dirt on high.

Gore's five-axle truck pulled out of the pit weighing 19,000 pounds more than its legal limit of 82,000 pounds.

"We try to run it as hard as we can," Gore said.

Heavy trucks are the backbone of the Bakken, North Dakota, oil fields. They transport the water, pipes and sand needed to produce more than 1 million barrels of oil a day. They move oil rigs from site to site and crude oil to pipelines and rail yards. They also carry the dirt and construction materials to build the new roads, homes and businesses needed to serve the exploding population of oil field workers.

## Heavy Trucks Pose Safety Concerns

The crazy pace of the oil fields and poor enforcement by authorities have encouraged overweight trucks. State authorities estimate that one-quarter of the Bakken's water trucks alone are overloaded.

Trucks hauling loads heavier than what they were designed for pose safety concerns. Extra weight makes it harder for drivers to brake and increases the damage they could cause in a collision. On the crowded Bakken roads, truck crashes that led to severe injuries jumped by 12 times during a recent four-year period. According to the Truck Safety Coalition, 100,000-pound trucks take 25 percent longer to stop than 80,000-pound trucks.

Heavy trucks also ruin bridges more quickly and crumble prairie roads built for light farm traffic. They have forced the state to make huge investments in rebuilding roads and bridges.

In McKenzie County, the state's top oil producer, the tiny sheriff's office has a file cabinet containing enormous violations. One driver was pulled over this summer while hauling a crane that was 61,300 pounds overweight. Another trucker was caught driving 76,100 pounds overweight while carrying a digger.

## Incentive To "Haul Heavy"

Trucker Michael Fisher, who drives overweight, said one problem is being able to slow down.

"It's the stopping power," he said, adding that he tried to keep more distance from other vehicles. "Your brakes are set up to stop a certain amount of weight, and if you increase that, you have a lot more chance of something going wrong."

In interviews, drivers described pressures to "haul heavy." They said jobs that pay by the ton or load, rather than by the hour, offer an incentive to overload their trucks.

"You have to go heavy just to keep up with the wells," said Jesse Scheffler, who once got a $3,000 ticket for driving a truck that was 20,000 pounds overweight. "We didn't come to North Dakota for the scenery. We're here for money."

Truckers are quick to let each other know when police are out and which routes to avoid. After word spread of a state official weighing each truck, one trucker dumped his load out at the side of the road.

A McKenzie County sheriff's deputy knew he had hit a prize as the water truck sped down County Road 10, its tires bulging.

Scott Luhman pulled six scales from his squad car and weighed the truck. It came in at more than 113,000 pounds — nearly 25,000 pounds over what it was licensed to haul.

The driver was fined $5,200.

## Enforcing Weight Limits

The county has only two officers responsible for the time-consuming task of truck-weight enforcement — not enough, Luhman said.

"(The state's) lack of enforcement causes trucks to be out there that are unsafe, and they're letting down the general public with that," Luhman said.

The North Dakota Highway Patrol ticketed 1,318 overweight trucks last year. In 2012, state troopers issued 1,701 violations. Captain Eldon Mehrer said he isn't sure why the number went down, but he thinks truckers are responding to enforcement.

Bakken's wealthy trucking business includes a mix of large and established companies and small and independent operators.

"The bigger companies generally are better," Luhman said. "It is the smaller companies. It's Joe Blow … that's out here trying to save his family. He's going to push the rules a little bit more."

Sunday morning, chugging down Route 200, Fisher and his friend, Gore, turned onto an unpaved road and bounced over ruts and potholes on the way to the dirt pit.

They were told the job would pay $9.50 a ton to haul the load to Watford City's water treatment plant, about 40 miles away.

Fisher pulled onto the scale so the pit could measure the truck's weight empty, and then pulled into line. Fisher flashed the man operating the front-end loader a "three" and "five" with his hands to signal that he wanted 35 tons, then lit up a cigarette as the man dropped giant buckets of dirt into his truck. Fisher gave him a thumbs up and pulled onto the scale.

His truck's capacity was 80,000 pounds, but the attendant handed him a ticket showing that it now weighed a little more than 104,000.

"You're a lightweight," Gore joked.

Going back to the pit, Gore got another call about a job that would pay $100 an hour.

"If I work by the hour," Gore said, "I can haul legal loads."
