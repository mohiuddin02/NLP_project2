MONTREAL, Canada — In Canada, aboriginal children were sent to live at schools away from their families. They were badly treated and some died. Their stories were hidden for a long time.

Last Tuesday, a new report finally told what happened. The report came from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). The TRC is part of the Canadian government. 

The goal of the TRC is to tell the truth. The second goal is for reconciliation. The Canadian government wants to make peace with the aboriginal people.

## Aboriginal Children Mistreated At School

Aboriginal people lived in Canada before the European settlers came to the country. The new settlers wanted the aboriginal people to forget their native culture. In the 1880s, the Canadian government forced the aboriginal children to go to schools with other aboriginal children. The government wanted the aboriginal children to learn a new way of life. 

The kids had to leave their families to attend. They lived at the schools. The report said that many of the students were hurt and abused. More than 3,000 students died at school. The schools existed for about 100 years.

## Group Hears Heartbreaking Stories

Justice Murray Sinclair is in the TRC. He helped write the report. People from the TRC traveled across Canada to talk to people who had been at these schools. The stories they heard were heartbreaking.

About 150,000 Aboriginal children were forced into these schools. Many students never went home again.

Sometimes, their parents did not know they were sick. The schools did not always tell parents that their child had died. 

Nobody knows the exact number of children who died in these schools. Nobody knows where some of those children were buried.

## Canada's Leader Says Government Is Sorry

Sinclair said that the report was not meant to make people feel bad. He wants the report to teach Canadians how to respect others. He wants to stop this from happening again.

Justin Trudeau is the prime minister of Canada. He is the leader of the country. Trudeau spoke at the presentation. He said that the law was wrong. The Canadian government had hurt many children and families.

Trudeau said that the government of Canada was sorry for the law. He asked for the aboriginal people to forgive the Canadians. "Today, there is reason for hope," he said.

Trudeau hopes that Canadians and aboriginal people can be friends. He knows that the Canadian people have much work to do.
