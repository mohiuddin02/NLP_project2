NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — As their names were called, 46 spellers in the 2014 Scripps National Spelling Bee lined up on stage with medals around their necks.

Many seemed shocked they had made it to the semifinals of the famous spelling bee, as parents and supports shouted, cheered and even cried with happiness. Several of the students had been on the semifinal stage in previous years.

The 87th edition of the iconic American spelling showdown was dramatic. The first round Wednesday went through 41 spellers before the first mistake. Out of the 281 contestants who began the day, 24 were eliminated. They stumbled on words like Keeshond, a Dutch dog breed, and paradigm, referring to patterns. The young scholars, ages 8 to 15, successfully spelled such tongue-twisters as sassafras, cynosure, ipecac, balalaika and Panglossian.

Wednesday afternoon's round began with 257 of the original 281 spellers. They stayed in the contest by correctly spelling obscure words for exotic animals, unfamiliar foods, medical terms and other curiosities. The words included objicient (argumentative), Valkyrian (related to battle) and formicivorous (feeding on ants). Other words spelled successfully were pikas (small mammals of the Asian mountains), ocellus (an insect eye used for detecting light) and Wordsworthian (relating to the poet William Wordsworth).

## Unguiculate And Obtundent

A crowd favorite and the youngest speller, Hussain A. Godhrawala, 8, of Barnwell, South Carolina, seemed almost overwhelmed when he got unguiculate. It means relating to nails or claws. Nine-year-old Kasey Cuenca Torres of San Angelo, Texas, got a rousing reaction to his winning word, phaeton — an open automobile.

Words that knocked out spellers in the second on-stage round included jeroboam (a wine bottle), obtundent (lessening pain) and palatalize (use of the tongue in producing sounds). Diphtheria, a childhood illness that few get anymore, knocked another speller out.

Many enjoyed joking with pronouncer Jacques Bailly, who tells the spellers their words. But some students seemed in a hurry. Instead of asking for languages of origin, parts of speech, or definitions, Nicole Seman, 13, of Leesburg, Virginia, Madeline Rickert, 13, of Minot, North Dakota, and Zander Reed, 11, of Ankeny, Iowa, went straight to correctly spelling their words: Faustian, connoisseur and Holstein, in that order.

Some spellers gave jaunty greetings to Bailly. Fourteen-year-old Sriram Hathwar's cheery "Hello, Dr. Bailly and friends" brought laughter from the crowd. He is from Painted Post, New York.

There were spellers who wrote invisible words on the backs of their name-and-number placards, on arms, on hands and in the air. Others bit lower lips, tousled their hair or stuck their hands deep in their pockets. Some sought to engage the crowd. Neha Seshadri, 13, of Detroit, asked Bailly: "May I take a deep breath, please?" When he said yes, she replied, "Back to business."

## From Algonquin To Yiddish

The spellers hailed from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. overseas territories. They also came from Defense Department schools in Europe and seven foreign countries.

The annual event has become a major phenomenon. More than 1 million students participate in local bees leading to the regional winners who compete in the national championships.

Some spellers were relieved at getting such common words as lieutenant, poignant, pyre, escargot, rapport, visceral, dichotomy and mistletoe. But they also seemed to welcome such head-scratchers as galjoen (a sport fish of Africa), roodebok (a small antelope) and schottische (a polka-like dance).

Ed Horan, 14, of Hoboken, New Jersey, had the crowd breathless as he appeared stumped by the word for puppets moved by overhead strings. Then he nailed the word, fantoccini. Similarly, Mary Polking, 14, of Charlotte, North Carolina, repeated the first few letters of the word for a man's felt hat. She started over twice, then committed herself to the right vowel in the second syllable, and spelled homburg.

Some of the words that few kids use in conversation have become spelling bee standards. They include mandir (a Hindu temple), quisling (a turncoat), jeremiad (an angry tirade), foggara (an underground conduit for carrying water), tarragon (an aromatic spice), Baedeker (travel guidebooks) and bobbejaan (an Afrikaans word for baboon).

Like the spellers, the spelling words came from all over the world. Languages of origin ranged from the Algonquin Native American language, Javanese and Yiddish to Russian, Dutch, Persian, Latin and Greek.

The Scripps National Spelling Bee crowned two winners Thursday night after a five-round duel in which neither could miss a word. In the end, Sriram Hathwar, of Painted Post, New York, and Ansun Sujoe, of Fort Worth, Texas, shared the prize.

It was only the fourth time in the Spelling Bee's history, and the first in more than 50 years, that winners shared the title.
