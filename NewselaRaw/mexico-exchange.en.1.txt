MEXICO CITY — Young Americans wanting to study in Latin America have stopped focusing on Mexico, which is no longer the No. 1 place for U.S. students to attend university in the region.

Only about 4,000 U.S. students now study in Mexico, with crime and drug violence being the main deterrent. More go to Costa Rica, Argentina and Brazil. In the past decade, Mexico dropped from first to fourth place.

Most U.S. colleges and universities have exchange programs, which offer their students the chance to study at another school elsewhere in the world for a year or semester. In exchange, the U.S. schools invite some foreign students for the same period.

## More Students Could Fix Misperceptions

The U.S. government wants more Americans studying in Latin America, which was one reason for coinciding visits Wednesday by both Secretary of State John Kerry and Janet Napolitano, the former Department of Homeland Security secretary. Napolitano now heads the 10-campus University of California (UC) system.

Napolitano, in an interview with The Associated Press, said she wants to increase exchanges between University of California campuses and Mexican universities at all levels, from college students to professors and researchers. Of 233,000 students in the UC system, only about 40 study in Mexico each year. About 1,900 Mexicans were at UC schools last year.

Student exchanges would help correct misperceptions on both sides of the border, Napolitano said. Among them, that Mexico is dangerous and that the United States is unfriendly to Mexicans.

"The best way to change that is to have an actual experience," she said. "There has to be marketing on both sides of the border if we're going to make this work."

## Student Goals For Future Exchanges

Kerry announced the new goal of launching a forum for higher education, innovation and research between the two countries. President Barack Obama's new higher education exchange project aims to have 100,000 U.S. students studying in Latin America and 100,000 from the region studying in the United States by 2020. A similar program in Mexico, "Proyecta," has the goal of sending 100,000 Mexican students a year to the United States by 2018. Just over 14,000 Mexicans come to the United States on exchange programs today.

"I'm convinced this is a way to strengthen our ties," Kerry said.

Mexico was once the top location for U.S. students studying in Latin America, with so many economic and familial ties between the two neighbors. But the numbers have dropped with the spike in drug violence, especially during the stepped-up attacks on drug networks by the administration of former President Felipe Calderon, who left office in 2012. He served at the same time Napolitano was in charge of homeland security for the United States. Napolitano's department openly supported Calderon's strategy.

"Once (the exchanges) are delayed or stopped, institutions set up affiliations and programs elsewhere, having longer term consequences for the numbers," said Shannon O'Neill, a senior fellow at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. "So even if violence wanes, it can be hard for the numbers to rebound."

## Safety Is A Big Issue

Current Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto argues that violence is down. However, several hot spots around the country contradict his depiction, including western Michoacan state, the state of Tamaulipas bordering Texas and both Morelos and Mexico state surrounding Mexico City.

Justin Bogda, 21, did an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in the summer of 2013 while studying at the University of Southern California. He said when he told his family about his plans, they were frightened.

"They said, 'Oh my God, there's all the violence,' because of what they see on the news,'" said the New Jersey native. He said that in places like Mexico City, it's more the perception than the reality.

According to the Institute of International Education, 8,360 Americans studied in Mexico in the 2000-2001 academic year. That dropped more than 50 percent to 3,815 by the 2011-2012 school year — the most recent figures available.

"It's the perception of safety, that's the main reason," institute president Allan Goodman said.

## Rain Forest Study Is Popular

Today, laid-back Costa Rica is the No. 1 pick of U.S. students, with nearly 8,000 Americans. The increase in students there can also be attributed to the U.S. emphasis on environmental studies, with Costa Rica's rain forests and national conservation programs, Goodman said.

In a document describing the "Proyecta" plan, Mexican government officials acknowledge that the perception of danger has made U.S. students reluctant to choose their country. It also cites a lack of English speakers in Mexico and Spanish speakers in the United States as obstacles, and says most Americans know nothing about educational opportunities in their neighboring country to the south.

Goodman said both countries would benefit from increased exchanges, especially given the number of Americans now of Mexican origin.

"To have Americans growing up and know nothing about our Spanish-speaking citizens ... means that our education is incomplete," he said. "Knowing Mexico to me is as important as taking another course in economics."
