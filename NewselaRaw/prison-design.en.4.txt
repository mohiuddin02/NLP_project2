SAN BRUNO, Calif. â€” Deanna VanBuren and Barb Toews are architects. They design buildings for a living. What makes them different from other architects is that they teach a class at a jail in San Francisco. It is called "Resolve to Stop the Violence."

All the students are prisoners.

The men have been sent to live in the jail because they have been accused of hurting or robbing other people. These are considered violent crimes.

Everyone in the jail must join the program taught by the architects. It teaches the men a new way of thinking about violent crimes.

The new way is called "restorative justice." The goal is to heal victims of crime, and the people who did the crimes.

## It Might Be The Answer

People often repeat their crimes when they leave jail. More and more people in the United States think restorative justice is the answer. They say it helps keep youths in school and out of jail.

VanBuren and Toews support restorative justice.

VanBuren was working for a big company when she heard a man talk about restorative justice.

The man was named Azim Khamisa. His son was killed by another teenage boy. After that, Khamisa reached out to the boy who killed his son and to the boy's grandfather.

The two older men decided to work together. They started a group in San Diego named for Khamisa's son, Tariq. The group works with young men to help them understand what causes violence and how to stop it.

The group's work inspired VanBuren. She teamed up with Toews and they started to offer restorative justice courses in jails.

The class they teach helps prisoners understand how to use the shape of buildings to think about their crimes.

The students also learn about how how can they avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.

There were 18 men in the class this summer.

## The Students Were Creative

One of them was tall man named Anthony Pratt. He designed a new prison building.

His design had a large room with a skylight to let the sun in. There was a fountain with a waterfall. He added private showers and toilets.

He also designed a healing center right in the middle of the building, with many windows.

Deandre Hill and Christopher Gillis were also in the class. They designed a prison cell with a computer to talk with their families.

Their prison cell also had lots of light. "In order to work on yourself you have to be comfortable," Gillis said.

On the final day of the class, the men made models of their designs. They pieced them together using glue sticks and tape. Then they presented their ideas to a group of people. Each of their models was reviewed.

## A New Way Of Thinking

After the presentation, Pratt said the class had changed the way he thinks about crime and violence.

Instead of fighting each other, "we can be like family," he said.

VanBuren said she is talking to architects who design prisons. She's telling them to do similar workshops with prisoners.

She said the goal is to get the architects to really talk to the people for whom they are designing the building. That's how an architect would work in any other setting, she explained.
