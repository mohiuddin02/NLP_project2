Millions of Filipinos are searching for food and shelter in the ruins left by a typhoon. The massive tropical storm was named Haiyan. Family members working overseas are trying to help them.

For more than 30 years, Filipinos have gone overseas to find jobs. There are 100 million people in the Philippines. Many of them live and work in other nations. Some clean homes for rich people in the Middle East. Others work as nannies in Europe. And Filipinos work on ships all over the world.

These people are called "expats" or "ex-patriots." They are people who leave their homelands to live and work in other countries. For many Filipinos, it was because there were not enough jobs for them in their own country.

Just like after other storms, floods and earthquakes, the overseas workers are sending money to their families back home. And their help is making the countries they work in more generous.

Many of the Filipinos living overseas are in the United States. That has provided a force of people to raise money for storm victims, said Albert Santoli. He's a Filipino who runs a group that provides emergency help to the Philippines. Filipino workers send money home usually. But this money is beyond that.

"People will send money to their families, since they don't trust the government," said Santoli. Some will send money to charities like the Red Cross, he said. But, they will want to help their own families and towns.

## Generosity From Foreign Lands

Countries with lots of Filipino workers are more giving. They are familiar with the islands' people. So, that has made the deadly storm more real, Filipino expats say.

About 680,000 Filipinos work in the United Arab Emirates. The Middle Eastern country has donated $10 million to help the Philippines.

Saudi Arabia has 1.55 million Filipinos. That's the highest number after the United States. It is giving $100,000 to help storm victims.

Australia is home to 380,000 Filipino workers. It has pledged $10 million in relief.

Money sent back to families in the Philippines from relatives overseas is very important. This money makes up a huge part of the money the Philippines has. Last year, overseas workers sent home $21 billion.

It is believed that a lot more money is sent home. But that money is hard to keep track of.

There are 569,000 Filipinos working in Malaysia. There are mail services there for Filipinos to send money back home. The companies that do these services are pitching in. Some are helping get storm relief to those who need it.

## Getting Money To Those Who Need It

LBC Remittance Express is a company that ships Christmas packages to Filipino families back home. But right now it is using its motorbike and bicycle delivery services for a different reason. It's getting relief goods from the ports on the water to areas further away that are damaged. Roads there are too clogged with storm wreckage for trucks to get through.

Even in countries with few Filipinos, the people living overseas are leading the drives to raise money. For example, only about 700 Filipinos live and work in the Bahamas. But, more than 200 put together a fundraiser. The money they raise will help people reach family members. Electricity and towers for cellphone signals were damaged. It has gotten hard to call some people.

There are several Filipino overseas workers groups worldwide. They are using the Internet and government lists to help Filipinos find missing brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers. And they're checking the number of dead. They're also looking for people to send money to.
