BEIJING â€” People in China are taking to the streets. The fast-growing country has enormous environmental problems. Its population does not trust the government. People are increasingly wired through online devices. Because of these things, it's no surprise that people are voicing their anger. They are protesting garbage dumps, chemical factories and other projects.

The latest protest was in the southern Chinese county of Boluo, where thousands of people marched through the streets Saturday. They were against a planned garbage incinerator, where garbage is burned and discarded. Police arrested 24 people, which was fewer than expected. Observers took it as a sign that the Chinese government will let some protests like this take place.

Pollution is the bad thing about China's growing power as a country. Pollution from factories has ruined about one-fifth of China's farmland. Air pollution levels in Beijing are 40 times higher than what is safe to breathe. Dangerous levels of heavy metals keep showing up in China's rice. Three-fourths of the nation's lakes and rivers are heavily polluted.

## Finding Ways To Gather

In China, there is no freedom to gather in public. Many people feel helpless in confronting these larger problems. Yet more of them are gathering in the streets. These people protest new projects in their communities they feel are threatening.

In April, hundreds of people in a city near Boluo clashed with police. They were opposed to a planned chemical plant. Plants like these have become controversial in China in the past few years.

In May, a protest near Shanghai also turned into a fight. It was against a new waste incinerator. Ten demonstrators and 29 police officers were injured.

Saturday's protest in Boluo was organized over mobile devices and social media. Two days before the protest, messages went out on Weibo. It is like China's Twitter. The messages told people to gather at a city square at 9 a.m. Saturday.

"For our families, reject cancer!" one message said.

The messages worked. Video from the protest shows that thousands of people marched through Boluo.

## Garbage Piles Are Growing

Dealing with garbage is becoming a problem for local governments. Chinese people are buying more and more things. China generates about 200 million metric tons of solid waste every year. In 2004, it passed the United States as the world's largest producer of garbage. By 2030, it is expected to make twice as much waste as the United States.

Some experts say incinerators are the best way to get rid of garbage. In crowded parts of China, landfill space is limited. Nie Yongfeng is a professor of the environment. He said new incinerators in China work as good, if not better, than the ones in Europe. People against the incinerators use old information to create fear, he said.

Others say the government has not been clear with its numbers. It knows how much pollution the waste burners create, but those numbers haven't been released to the public. "It is hard to know if the incinerators are being operated safely," said Lin Youzhu. She works on solid waste for Friends of Nature, China's oldest environmental group.

## Taking A Stand Against Pollution

By the end of 2013, 176 waste incinerators were being used in China. There were 74 more being built. She said the government helps pay for incinerator construction. This is hurting China's strong network of recycling. The government "pays little attention to reducing waste at the source and puts all its attention into disposal," she said.

Judith Shapiro is a professor studying the Chinese environment. She said it is good to see Chinese people standing together against worsening air, water and soil conditions. She is the author of the 2012 book "China's Environmental Challenges."

But the protests are usually in richer communities on China's eastern coast. That raises the risk that the government will just move incinerators and other controversial projects away from the coast. They could end up in the poorer areas in China.
