KENOSHA, Wis. â€” Inside a building next to Lake Michigan, the Civil War rages on. Cannons roar and smoke drifts across a battlefield. Men in blue and gray charge screaming at each other.

America's Civil War pitted brother against brother. Neighbor against neighbor. Northerner against Southerner. By the time the fighting ended, hundreds of thousands were dead or badly injured.

Only those who had fought in the Civil War really knew the fear and chaos of battle. But shortly after the war ended, painters began to re-create those hellish scenes in cycloramas. These were round, 360-degree pictures meant to be viewed from inside. They soon drew curious visitors seeking a taste of war.

Now Kenosha's Civil War Museum has updated the cyclorama approach to the 21st century. Using 360-degree technology, the museum has created an 11-minute movie called "Seeing the Elephant." The picture opened this month.

## Cycloramas Of The 1800s

The movie was filmed over five days last summer at Old World Wisconsin, an outdoor history museum. It features 200 re-enactors, who staged the battle scenes. The film follows three men who join the Union Army for different reasons and head off to battle.

"Our idea was to produce a 360-degree film that puts the viewer in the middle of the action," said museum curator Doug Dammann. The movie is "sort of a living, breathing cyclorama."

Cycloramas were a popular form of entertainment in the late 1800s. They were first developed in Europe before migrating to the United States in the 1880s. Many featured huge paintings of Civil War battles.

A handful of cycloramas can still be seen more than 125 years later. One in Atlanta was created with the help of Union and Confederate soldiers.

"In the age before movies and television," Dammann said, there was the cyclorama. "It was a way to transport the viewer" to the battlefield.

Kenosha's Civil War Museum opened in 2008. Organizers deliberately left open an area for a cyclorama to be installed someday. Plans got underway last year for the $1 million film.

The call went out to Civil War re-enactors from all over the Midwest as well as other states. Old World Wisconsin was the spot chosen for filming. In particular, shooting focused on the Norwegian farmstead area, the Catholic church and the town hall.

"Looking in every direction you feel you're in the past," said the film's director, Bob Noll.

## Filming A Battle Re-Enactment

A special 360-degree camera was used to film the battle scenes. This was actually nine high-definition digital cameras attached to a rig that allowed the filmmakers to sit inside a chamber and film the action outside. During filming, Noll and the camera operator huddled inside the chamber while re-enactors shot at each other. The battle was painstakingly mapped out in advance. And a coordinator helped plan the re-enactors moves during the fighting.

"We had a lot of cannon explosions," Noll said. As they were going across the field, fire, explosions and smoke were set off. "Everything was staked out with flags so people wouldn't step on them."

The battle shown in the museum's movie isn't exactly a real historical event. However, it is based on an event that happened right before the Second Battle of Bull Run as the North called it, or Second Battle of Manassas as the South called it.

"We talked about doing an actual battle," said Civil War historian Lance Herdegen, who helped write the script for the movie. "But the problem is when you do that some expert" always finds something to complain about. They'll say, "Well the fence is in the wrong place."

Most of what the three main characters say is based on fact, Herdegen said. Their words were taken from surviving letters and journals.

At the Civil War Museum, visitors climb up to a platform. Viewers turn as the action moves around them. The theater features eight projectors and seven speakers placed above viewers. There are also speakers underneath the platform. The screens are 11 feet high.

And what about the film's unusual title? This was chosen because "seeing the elephant" was a common expression during the Civil War. It was used by soldiers to describe their first experience of battle.
