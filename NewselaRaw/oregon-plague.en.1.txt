An Oregon teenager has come down with the bubonic plague. It is the dreaded disease that killed an estimated 60 percent of the European population during the Middle Ages, and has never been completely eradicated.

Authorities believe a flea infected the teen girl during a mid-October hunting trip. She became ill, was hospitalized and is now recovering in an intensive care unit. The incident appears to have been isolated.

"Many people think of the plague as a disease of the past," Oregon public health veterinarian Emilio DeBess said. The truth is, "it's still very much present in our environment, particularly among wildlife."

"Fortunately, plague remains a rare disease," DeBess continued. However, he added, "people need to take appropriate precautions with wildlife and their pets to keep it that way."

## Rodents Are The Culprits

The bubonic plague typically spreads through flea bites or when plague bacteria comes in contact with an individual's broken skin. Onset can be sudden and typically involves fever, headache, chills, weakness and swollen lymph glands, known as "buboes."

To protect themselves from the disease, individuals should avoid contact with wild animals such as squirrels, chipmunks or other rodents, who can carry fleas, DeBess said. People should also keep their pets away from such animals.

The disease is certainly not common. Only eight cases of plague have been documented in Oregon in the past two decades.

In the United States overall, there were just 1,006 confirmed or probable cases of plague between 1900 and 2012, nearly 5 in 6 of them of the bubonic variety. In recent decades, the United States has averaged about seven annual cases of human plague, the majority of them in the West. Eleven cases of plague were reported this year from April through August.

## Plague Through The Millennia

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria can invade the bloodstream, which usually leads to rapid death. Once antibiotic medicines were discovered, the chances of survival became much greater. In the early decades of the 20th century, before the introduction of antibiotics, 66 percent of bubonic plague cases in the United States were fatal. Between 1990 to 2010, only 11 percent were fatal.

The "Great Plague" or "Black Death" of the Middle Ages is just one of three major plague outbreaks in recorded history. The first was the Justinian Plague, which began in 541 A.D. and was named for Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. More than 25 million people died over the next two centuries.

The Black Death was next, starting in 1334 in China and spreading along trade routes to Europe. It wiped out around 60 percent of the European population. Despite these massive losses, some say the disease played a role in spurring modernization, as it created huge labor shortages that in turn created a need for labor-saving machinery.

The final major outbreak, the Modern Plague, also began in China, in the 1860s. It appeared in Hong Kong by 1894 and was spread throughout the world by rats on ships over the next two decades. It was during that outbreak that scientists discovered the plague was caused by a bacteria and often spread through fleas.
