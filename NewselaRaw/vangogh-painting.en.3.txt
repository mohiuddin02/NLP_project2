AMSTERDAM (AP) — Art experts said a painting by Van Gogh was the real thing this month. It had sat for 60 years in a Norwegian attic after its first owner was told it was a fake. It is the first full-size painting by the famous artist to be discovered since 1928.

The 1888 painting "Sunset at Montmajour" was sent to experts at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. They looked at Vincent Van Gogh's letters, the chemical makeup of the paint, and X-rays of the painting.

Museum director Axel Rueger called the discovery a "once-in-a-lifetime experience."

Museum officials would not say who the owner was. He had brought the artwork to them in 2011 so they could say if it was a Van Gogh. The artist's paintings are among the most valuable in the world. They don't get put up for sale very often, but they are sold for tens of millions of dollars when they do.

## Landscape Of Oaks, Bushes And Sky

The painting will be on display at the museum beginning Sept. 24.

"Sunset at Montmajour" is roughly 37-by-29-inches. It shows a dry landscape of twisting oak trees, bushes and sky. It was done during the period when Van Gogh was using the thick "impasto" brush strokes. They became typical of his work in the final years of his short life.

Experts can say the exact day it was painted, since Van Gogh described it in a letter to his brother, Theo. He said he had painted it the day before — July 4, 1888.

"At sunset I was on a stony heath where very small, twisted oaks grow, in the background a ruin on the hill and wheat fields in the valley," Van Gogh wrote. But then Van Gogh confessed that the painting was "well below what I'd wished to do." Later he sent it to Theo to keep.

Van Gogh struggled with periods of mental illness all his life. He shot himself in the head and died in 1890. He sold only one painting during his lifetime.

## Recorded As Number 180

Three researchers published an article in The Burlington Magazine. They said the painting was recorded as number 180 in Theo's collection. It was given the title "Sun Setting at Arles." It was sold to Maurice Fabre in 1901. Fabre was a Frenchman who bought and sold art.

Fabre never wrote down that he sold the work. Then the painting disappeared from history. It only reappeared in 1970. It was in the estate of Norwegian industrialist Christian Nicolai Mustad.

Mustad's family said he purchased it in 1908 as a young man. It was one of his first attempts at art collecting. He was soon told it was a fake. Embarrassed, Mustad banished it to the attic.

After Mustad's death in 1970, the famous art seller Daniel Wildenstein took another look at it. He said he thought the painting was a fake Van Gogh. It was sold to a collector. The museum would not say who bought it or whether it had been resold since then.

The museum decided not to say if the painting was a Van Gogh in 1991. The unknown owner brought it to them then.

"That may be a painful admission," The Burlington Magazine article said. The same museum now says it is a Van Gogh. But it is understandable. The experts had no information about what was shown in the painting.

## Van Gogh Wrote About Painting In Letters

Teio Meedendorp is one of three experts who worked on the project. He said the previous experts might also have been confused because the painting was done as Van Gogh's style was changing.

Among other reasons experts had their doubts back then: The painting was unsigned. Parts of the foreground were not "as well-observed as usual," the researchers said. And part of the right side of the painting used a different style of brush strokes.

But when the museum took a fresh look at the work in 2011, its experts had the advantage of a new collection of all Van Gogh's letters. They were able to identify the exact location "Sunset" shows for the first time. It is Montmajour hill, near Arles. The ruins of Montmajour Abbey can be seen in the background.

Van Gogh mentioned the painting in two other letters that same summer.

Meedendorp said the painting is part of a special experimental group of Van Gogh's paintings. He sometimes thought they weren't as good as people do today.

Meedendorp said another unknown or lost Van Gogh could be found someday. The artist is believed to have completed more than 800 works. He destroyed some when he wasn't satisfied with the results. But there are others that are mentioned in his letters or early catalogs which haven't been found.

The Van Gogh Museum has 140 Van Gogh paintings. More than a million visitors come there a year.
