THE HAGUE, Netherlands â€” A new museum exhibit features "selfies" from the 17th century Dutch Golden Age of art.

These days, anybody with a smartphone can snap a selfie in a second and post it on the Internet. Four hundred years ago, the Dutch Golden Age was a highpoint for trade, science, military and art in the Netherlands. Back then, the selfies were called self-portraits. They were painted by highly trained artists who thought long and hard about every detail.

## A First Of Its Kind

The Mauritshuis museum is staging an exhibition focused solely on these 17th century self-portraits. The exhibit highlights the similarities and the differences between modern-day snapshots and historic works of art.

The museum's director, Emilie Gordenker, said that this is the first time a museum has exhibited Dutch Golden Age self-portraits like this. The Mauritshuis was eager to tie the paintings to the modern-day selfie phenomenon, she said.

The exhibition opened October 8 and runs through January 3. It features 27 self-portraits by artists ranging from Rembrandt van Rijn, who painted dozens of self-portraits, to his student Carel Fabritius and Judith Leyster. Her self-portrait is on loan from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

## The Original Selfie-Portraits

A less well-known artist, Huygh Pietersz Voskuyl, is the poster boy for the exhibition. His striking 1638 self-portrait features a classic selfie pose. He is staring over his right shoulder out of the frame and into the distance. It does not take much imagination to picture him gazing into the lens of a smartphone rather than a mirror, which Golden Age artists used to capture their images for self-portraits. Giant mirrors are spread through the exhibition space. They create reflections within reflections of paintings, which are mirror images of the artists.

The similarities between selfies and self-portraits are obvious, since the subject of the painting is the painter. Yet, there are also big differences. A selfie is often shot quickly with little concern for how people are posed. By comparison, these self-portraits are carefully thought out works of art. A video made for the exhibition shows the thought that went into the paintings and what today's selfie makers can learn from them to improve their snapshots.

And, yes, you are allowed to take selfies in the museum.

## Early Attention To Detail

The painting by Voskuyl is a good example of the rich details that can be found in a picture that looks so simple.

"He brings out all these little details, like his beard or the little embroidery on his shirt, even a kind of fake wood-paneled wall behind him," Gordenker said. "So he's thought very hard about the textures and the things that make him who he is. At the same time, you can see the skill with which he painted this. And this will have definitely been a very good advertisement for what he could do."

That kind of attention to detail made the self-portraits almost a Golden Age advertisement for the painter. They showed off the artist and his or her talents to potential clients, who might pay to have their own portraits done.

"A lot of artists in the 17th century painted self-portraits, not only as portraits of themselves but also as an example of the beautiful art that they could make," said curator Ariane van Suchtelen. She organized the exhibit.

Rembrandt, for instance, was very famous for his sketchy way of painting, van Suchtelen said. "If you would buy a self-portrait by Rembrandt, you would not only have a portrait of this famous artist but also an example of what he could do, what he was famous for."
