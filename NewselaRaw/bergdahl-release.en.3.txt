In June 2009, U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was captured in Afghanistan and held prisoner by enemy fighters. For nearly five years, he was called a hero.

But in the days since Bergdahl's release Saturday, a different story has emerged. In this version, the 28-year-old soldier from Idaho is not a hero but a deserter.

Early reports of his capture suggested that Bergdahl was taken prisoner while he was out on patrol. But several soldiers who were stationed with Bergdahl say he walked away from his unit. They are demanding that Bergdahl be punished for what they consider to be his decision to abandon his post. He risked the lives of soldiers who went looking for him, they say.

"He walked away from his duty as an American soldier — he deserted," said Joshua Cornelison, who served with Bergdahl. "People are calling him a hero. And that is absolutely wrong."

Another former soldier, Evan Buetow, said Bergdahl had talked about "walking across the mountains on his own" or walking to India. They thought he was joking, Buetow said.

Army officials have said they will be talking with Bergdahl. They expect to be able to figure out what happened.

## Details Had Been Kept Quiet

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that first, the military will make sure that Bergdahl is well and reunite him with his family. After that, the other questions can be answered, he said.

Bergdahl was freed after U.S. officials arranged a prisoner swap. Five Taliban commanders were released from the military jail at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The Taliban is an Islamic fundamentalist group in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan). They controlled the country from 1996 to 2001. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Taliban was overthrown by U.S.-led forces and has been fighting against them ever since.

Questions of how and why Bergdahl disappeared have trailed him during his years held by the Taliban.

Members of his unit had obeyed orders not to discuss him. Now that Bergdahl is free, they have decided to tell what they know, Cornelison said.

## It Just Didn't Add Up

The 30 soldiers of 2nd Platoon, Blackfoot Company saw Bergdahl as an outsider. He was quiet and kept to himself. He didn't talk much about himself unlike other soldiers.

Bergdahl slept in a one-man tent at the observation post. The post is a tiny patch of brush near the Pakistan border in eastern Afghanistan. He carried a notebook everywhere.

Bergdahl disappeared before dawn on June 30, 2009. At the time, some of his platoon mates said they quickly suspected that he hadn't been taken by force.

Bergdahl was "upset at the way the Army was handling the war effort in Afghanistan," said Buetow.

Like several other fellow soldiers, Buetow is calling for the Army to punish him.

"He's a deserter — 100 percent — in every definition of the word," Buetow said. "We want him to answer for that."

In the wake of Bergdahl's release, critics have accused President Barack Obama of caving in to Taliban demands. They say from now on there will be a higher price to bring back any future U.S. servicemen and women captured by the Taliban. They also complain he didn't give Congress enough notice of the deal.

On Saturday at Bagram air base in Afghanistan, Hagel announced, "This is a happy day. We got one of our own back." His words, though, were greeted with near silence by U.S. troops.

## His Side Will Eventually Come Out

After Bergdahl disappeared, a search of his tent turned up his rifle, helmet, armored vest, night-vision goggles and other gear. Missing was Bergdahl's notebook and  possibly his compass.

Soldiers searched the area for him, Cornelison said. A village boy told the soldiers he had seen an American soldier crawling through the weeds nearby.

In 2012, Rolling Stone magazine quoted emails supposedly from Bergdahl suggesting that he had become disappointed with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. The emails said he was "ashamed to be an American" and it seemed that he was considering leaving.

Bergdahl is now undergoing medical and mental evaluations at a U.S. military hospital in Germany. Soon he will be sent home to the United States for long-term treatment.

Only then may all the questions be answered, his fellow soldiers say. One of those soldiers with questions is Gerald Sutton. He said he wants to see Bergdahl face a military trial, though he considered him a good soldier until he disappeared.

"I'd like to talk to the man and find out what was going on with him," Sutton said. "I mean, he was my friend. I want to know."
