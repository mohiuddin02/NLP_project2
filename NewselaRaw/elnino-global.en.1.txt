A fog of thick smoke settles over the Indonesian countryside, sickening hundreds of thousands of people. The fog has triggered an environmental crisis.

In Peru, officials cancel plans to host a famous car race, the Dakar Rally. Instead, they prepare for torrential rains and devastating floods.

And in Ethiopia, crops die for lack of seasonal rain. The United Nations warns that a famine is coming.

Many Californians hope a "Godzilla" El Nino will bring rains this winter to end the long drought through which they've suffered. However, the idea of this mysterious climate phenomenon creates fear in much of the world.

Its wide-ranging effects are so great that some researchers argue it doubles the risk of war in much of the developing world.

## Negatives Outweigh The Positives

"Some people like to say it has positive aspects, but generally speaking it's doom and gloom," said El Nino researcher Michael "Mickey" Glantz, director of the Consortium for Capacity Building at the University of Colorado, Boulder. 

Periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean has occurred for thousands of years. Only in recent times have scientists come to appreciate its global reach, or even recognize its telltale signs.

El Nino's effects are like placing a large stone in a shallow river, according to David Pierce, a climate researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. "It causes ripples that run far downstream," he said.

Storms get their energy from warm ocean water, and normally, the hottest ocean surface temperatures on the planet are found in the western Pacific, near Indonesia. During an El Nino, however, these warm, rain-generating waters slide east, creating conditions for large storms.

## El Nino Can Hold Sway Over Rain, Wind

This can also change the path of powerful jet stream currents high above the Earth. These high winds throw seasonal weather patterns into serious disorder.

Seasonal rains can fail to arrive in parts of India, Africa and Southeast Asia, killing crops and stirring up wildfires. In parts of North and South America, a series of pounding storms can roll over the landscape, as though on a conveyor belt.

In Southern California, El Nino is best known for traffic-halting downpours and overflowing rivers. However, El Nino's ability to steer rain away from agricultural fields has earned it an evil reputation.  

A series of disastrous famines killed more than 30 million people in India and China in the late 1800s. This is what first made researchers aware of the weather phenomenon we now call El Nino.

In the early 1900s, British mathematician Sir Gilbert Walker asked his staff in India to gather weather data for him to analyze. He correlated recurring monsoon failures and drought to seesawing atmospheric pressure in the eastern and western Pacific.

## Never Been Better Prepared, U.N. Says

Today, U.N. officials say the world is better prepared than ever to deal with the consequences of El Nino. They warn, however, that 11 million children are at risk from hunger, disease and lack of water in eastern and southern Africa alone.

"It's the intense drought that causes the greatest human casualties and crop devastation," said historian Mike Davis, author of "Late Victorian Holocausts: El Nino Famines and the Making of the Third World."

Drought causes other dangers as well. In Indonesia, slash-and-burn clearing of agricultural land has given rise to wildly spreading forest fires. These massive fires, which have occurred during every El Nino since 1982, have sickened hundreds of thousands of people and killed 19 already this year.

The smoke, which has spread to Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand, has also released enormous quantities of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, according to researchers.

Drought and flooding triggered by El Nino can have other health effects. Outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and other diarrheal diseases spread in areas where floodwaters have been contaminated by human or animal waste, health experts say.

## Warming Waters And The Ripple Effects

El Nino's damaging effects are not confined to land.

Warming Pacific waters can generate an increase in hurricanes. El Nino was cited as a possible factor in the creation of Hurricane Patricia, one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded.

"Warm water is kind of rocket fuel for those hurricanes," said Josh Willis, a climatologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.

Similarly, researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cited the warming effects of El Nino as a factor in a recently declared global coral bleaching event. Temperature change is one of several factors that can cause coral reefs to release their coating of algae, a plantlike life form that grows mostly in water, and often lives on coral. Without the algae the coral needs for food, the coral reefs whiten and can become sick and die.

## Named For Its Arrival Around Christmas

El Nino's effect on fisheries gave it its name. Before it was understood to be a global event, fishermen in Peru and Ecuador used the term to describe the warm currents that sometimes arrived around Christmas and seemed to drive fish away. El Nino, Spanish for "the child," was a reference to the birth of Christ.

Normally, trade winds that blow from east to west cause an upwelling in the ocean, along the coast of South America. Deep, cold, nutrient-rich water in lower parts of the ocean moves toward the surface. This cool water sustains fish like anchovies, which are used internationally to feed livestock. During El Nino, however, the trade winds slow, or collapse entirely, putting an end to the upwelling — and the anchovy fisheries.

Glantz said that this not only affects the Peruvian anglers but also sends shock waves through the commodities market as the price for soybeans — another source of livestock feed — rises.

"It kind of starts a chain reaction around the globe," Glantz said.
