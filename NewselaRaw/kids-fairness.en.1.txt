Life isn't fair.

That universal truth is something that children seem to understand almost intuitively at a young age. However, the path through which they develop a sense of what's fair and what isn't — and how they act on injustices — is something that has been a puzzle for social scientists.

Fairness is a willingness to sacrifice for the sake of greater equality. It is an ideal that supports cooperation, resource sharing and sacrifice. But it also can lead to competition and greed.

It is often talked about as the basis of human civilization, and it affects every aspect of our lives. As the gap in wealth between the world's top 1 percent and the rest has increased to historic highs in recent years, fairness in material payoffs or inequality has become one of the most important issues of our time.

## Children From Seven Countries

In an effort to understand how much of this idea is hard-wired into our DNA and how much of it is cultural, a team of psychologists and anthropologists traveled to seven countries to study how different groups of children play fair. Harvard University social sciences professor Felix Warneken led the team.

Their work, which was published in the magazine Nature, was focused on the children's reaction to two types of scenarios that are unfair. The first, disadvantageous inequity, occurs when one receives less than a peer. The second, advantageous inequity, happens when one receives more than a peer.

The theory has been that these are two distinct ideas that emerge at different ages and use different parts of the brain. But little has been known about environmental influences until this study.

## Principle Affects Societies

Both are believed to be part of the glue that holds societies together.

An opposition to disadvantageous inequity "can provide long-term benefits by preventing competitors from attaining a relative advantage and signaling that one will not tolerate being exploited," Warneken and his co-authors wrote.

Advantageous inequity opposition requires "a larger immediate sacrifice by rejecting a relative advantage. It may signal that one is a good cooperative partner who will not exploit others."

Previous studies have found that a distaste for disadvantageous inequity develops in children by the time they are 4 years old. Advantageous inequity opposition, on the other hand, doesn't appear until closer to age 8\. That seems to indicate the influence of social norms.

## "Inequity Game" Tests Kids In Pairs

The new study is believed to be the first to look at inequity opposition across societies in children. It was seeking to find out more about which aspects of fairness might be universal and which might be culturally driven. To that end, the researchers designed an "inequity game" that they used to test 866 pairs of children. These children were aged 4 to 15 in Canada, India, Mexico, Peru, Senegal, Uganda and the United States.

Co-author Peter Blake, a professor of psychology at Boston University, explained that the experiment was specifically designed to see how children would respond to two sides of inequality and how they made decisions that affected both themselves and a peer.

The rules were simple: Two children of the same sex and similar age were seated across from each other and were offered some Skittles candy. Sometimes the allocations were equal and sometimes they were not. One of the two children got to decide whether both of them accepted the allocation or rejected it.

## Kids At A Disadvantage Reject Deal

The experiment was set up to work through a machine that required the child to pull on one of two handles. The first handle accepted the deal — resulting in the candy being poured into a bowl for each child — and the second handle rejected it — dumping the sweets into a third bowl where neither one would get to eat it.

In all seven societies — which ranged from small villages with a very basic farming economy to large industrialized cities — the results indicated a rejection of disadvantageous inequity. That is, when the children were allocated less candy than their peers, they tended to route all the treats into the bowl that no one could access.

That was expected. "This seems to be a basic human response to getting less than someone else," said study co-author Katherine McAuliffe, a professor at Boston College.

Whether they were rejecting the candy out of frustration or meanness, the children were motivated to deprive others of an advantage, she said.

## Results Mixed For Kids With Advantage

The reactions to advantageous inequity were more mixed. Children in only three countries — the United States, Canada and Uganda — had a tendency to reject unequal distributions of candy when they got more than their peers.

"In these societies, rejections of advantageous allocations increased with age. … Given that Western societies tend to emphasize establishing and enforcing norms of equality, it is possible that children in these communities face social pressures to internalize and enact these norms earlier in development compared to other societies," the researchers wrote. They noted that although Uganda, located in eastern Africa, is a non-Western society, the students they studied there often had Western teachers.

Blake said the differing results on the two types of inequality show that "different psychological processes may be at work depending on whether someone is at an advantage or disadvantage."
