There were plenty of reasons to be suspicious of Arcangelo Ricciardi at a recent chess competition. He kept his thumb tucked into his armpit throughout several rounds of chess. He refused to get up from his seat after hours of competition.

Ricciardi was ranked number 51,366 in the world, but he speedily beat several superior opponents during one of Italy's most prestigious tournaments.

In the end, his eyes gave him away.

The 37-year-old was "batting his eyelids in the most unnatural way," referee Jean Coqueraut told the Italian newspaper La Stampa. Perhaps that explained Ricciardi's success at the Imperia Chess Festival, which featured several top chess players.

Coqueraut said he then figured out that Ricciardi was blinking in Morse code, according to Chess.com.

## Good-Luck Charms Or Cheating Tricks?

After refusing to remove his shirt when confronted by the referee, Ricciardi was sent through a metal detector. Hanging beneath his shirt, the detector found a necklace. It contained a tiny video camera connected to a small box underneath his armpit.

It is believed Ricciardi was using the video camera to send videos of his games to a helper or a computer program. He then received signals for suggested moves via tiny beeps sent to the armpit box, according to the Telegraph. Ricciardi said that the necklace and box were good-luck charms.

"It's only envy," he told La Stampa. "I always knew my potential, but I was never able to express it." Ricciardi said yoga and "self-training" helped him to play better.

Ricciardi was kicked out of the tournament. The Italian Chess Federation may charge him with sports fraud. Coqueraut said that he thinks Ricciardi was testing the cheating system for another player. The Imperia festival's prize is only about $1,100. It seems a poor reward for risking a career, he said.

## A Chess Player's Home Run

The Guardian newspaper's Stephen Moss has written many times about chess. He said there seems to be more and more cheating. Computers are now capable of beating even the best players. There are a million ways a cheater can use a computer.

For example, in April, the 25-year-old Georgian chess champion Gaioz Nigalidze was disqualified from the Dubai Open. Officials had found an iPhone with an open chess app hidden in a bathroom stall. Nigalidze's opponent had become suspicious when the young player kept getting up to use the bathroom after every move.

In chess, using a computer is like taking steroids in sports. Some say it is even worse.

It would be the same as an amateur baseball player putting on a special suit "to hit the ball 500 feet out and hitting a home run every time," Tony Rich, the chief official for the U.S. Chess Championship, said.

## Pick A Move, Any Move

According to mathematician Claude Shannon, the number of possible ways for a chess game to play out is enormous. There are more possible combinations of moves in any chess game than there are bacterial cells on Earth.

Even super-fast computers are outmatched. Shannon writes that it would take a standard machine longer than the age of the universe just to look at all the possible things that could happen from its first move.

But computers do have a better shot. In 1997, an IBM supercomputer named Deep Blue became the first program to beat a reigning world champion in a match under standard time controls. Since then, computers have only gotten smarter. The basic iPhone is now capable of the feat that Deep Blue performed less than 20 years ago.

## Tipping The Chess Scales

Experts believe the current best chess computer programs would be rated between 3200 and 3300 on the scale used to measure chess performance. Magnus Carlsen is the world's top living chess player. He is rated 2862.

"The basic problem is that it's incredibly easy to cheat with a phone," English chess grandmaster Nigel Short, who once was ranked third in the world and is now 60th, said after Nigalidze was caught cheating. "My dog could win a major tournament using one of these devices. Or my grandmother. Anybody could do this."

If anybody with a phone can win a chess tournament, then nobody is going to bother, chess fans worry. They believe the best way to keep the game competitive is to keep iPhones — and hidden cameras, and Morse code messaging boxes — out of it.

But, as Rich pointed out, that is no easy task.

You cannot ask players to take their shoes off and be searched before every game, he said. "I doubt you'll find many people who'd want to come out to the chess tournament," he said.
