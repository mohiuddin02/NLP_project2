PHILADELPHIA — The civil war in Syria has been going on for more than three years now. Hundreds of thousands have been killed and millions of people have fled their homes.

Syria's history — its cultural heritage — has also suffered in the war.

There are six sites in Syria that the United Nations considers important historically or culturally. Five of these six U.N. World Heritage sites have "significant damage" and some buildings have been "reduced to rubble," according to a report issued this week.

Using high-resolution satellite photos, researchers were able to track damage to historic mosques, Roman buildings and a Byzantine castle.

## Destroying An Identity

The current conflict in Syria began in 2011, when many residents of Arab countries began protesting against their leaders. That time is now known as the "Arab Spring."

In Syria, the government led by President Bashar Assad violently stopped the protests. By 2012, Syria was fighting a civil war, with various rebel groups trying to oust President Assad.

Richard Leventhal, the executive director of the Cultural Heritage Center (CHC) at the University of Pennsylvania, said his group is studying how historic sites are used in conflicts and wars. The CHC released this report on Syria's historic sites along with the Smithsonian Institution, the Syrian Heritage Task Force and other groups.

According to Leventhal, heritage helps us determine who we are and where we come from. In a war, destroying historical sites can also destroy the identity of a group of people.

## "Family Photos For The Country"

Brian Daniels, who works with Leventhal, went to the Turkey-Syria border earlier this summer to train 20 Syrians who want to protect the historic sites. They were taught how to protect museum collections during emergencies and were given supplies to secure pottery and library books, some of which are now being kept in private homes.

Daniels said he was "incredibly floored" by the bravery of the Syrians.

"They are aware their lives are at extreme risk," Daniels  said. "They feel that it is their responsibility, their duty, to try to save these things that are most precious about Syria's history."

Daniels compared this situation to a home that is on fire. First, it's important to make sure everyone is safe. Then, you might try to save the family pictures.

"These people's jobs are to try to save the family photos for the country," he said.

## Both Sides To Blame

The report does not assign blame for the damage. Both the insurgents and the Assad government  are responsible for an "incredible amount" of destruction, Daniels said.

The extremist group Islamic State (ISIL) has been intentionally targeting some historic sites, Daniels said, including Christian graves. The group "has been destroying these things left, right and center," Daniels said.

The militant group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

ISIL has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. The U.S. government says the group is a great danger to the Middle East.

Experts are not as sure about the Assad government's role in the destruction, though it is the only group fighting in the war that can use airstrikes.

The United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture keeps a list of more than 1,000 World Heritage sites. These cities, buildings or national parks represent important cultural or natural significance.

There are 22 World Heritage sites in the United States — most are national parks.

The Heritage sites in Syria are buildings or towns. They include the Ancient City of Damascus, the Ancient City of Bosra, the Site of Palmyra, the Ancient City of Aleppo, two castles — the Crac des Chevaliers and Qal'at Salah El-Din — and the Ancient Villages of Northern Syria, which are also known as the Dead Cities.

## The Great Mosque Damaged

Of the six sites, the ancient city of Damascus, the capital of Syria, has been the luckiest. The report noted that Damascus  has been "largely protected from the violence that has heavily impacted neighborhoods surrounding the city."

Aleppo, in northwestern Syria, has not been so lucky. Aleppo has been a major trading post for more than 3,000 years, reaching its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries. During the war, Aleppo has seen heavy fighting, and many historic buildings have been damaged. That includes the Great Mosque, one of the city's most well-known sites.

Elsewhere in Syria, the report found evidence of looting, new construction at historic sites, and the use of ancient buildings to store military equipment.

The authors of this report hope it will help the U.S. government and humanitarian groups to better protect heritage sites in future wars.

Daniels also pointed out that the report may give the Syrians who are working to protect the country's history "a better sense of what they're up against and where they can better direct their resources and energy."
