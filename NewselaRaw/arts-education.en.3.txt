WASHINGTON â€” On Tuesday, Michelle Obama strongly declared that the arts belong in schools and are an important part of a student's education.

The arts, the first lady said, shouldn't just be an add-on to be introduced only after student test scores go up. Rather, they are a necessary part of the school day. They can help students achieve those higher test scores in the first place.

Mrs. Obama made her comments while opening the first-ever White House student talent show. It featured spirited song and dance from a group of student performers. The students all attend schools that have been performing poorly. To turn things around, their schools were chosen for a new arts education program.

By the end of the hour-long show, Mrs. Obama joined the students on stage, dancing with them during their closing number.

President Barack Obama showed up as well. He broke away from his work to make his own pitch for arts education. The president also congratulated the student performers.

## Arts + Excited Students = Better Grades

Tuesday's talent show was meant to showcase the "Turnaround Arts" program. This was created as an experiment in 2012. Its purpose is to see whether arts education can improve test scores and make students feel better about school. Famous artists adopted each school in the program.

So far, things have been going well: Reading and math scores have gone up. Encouraged by those results, Mrs. Obama announced that the program is being expanded this year. It is growing from the original eight schools to 35 schools.

Two of the original schools have already improved dramatically, she said. They have improved so much they are no longer in need of "turnaround."

The arts, the first lady said, help get students excited about taking their seats in class. Students are happy to be in school. They look forward to the next musical they're performing in, or the instrument they can't wait to play.

"But if they're not in their seats then we can't teach them anything at all," Mrs. Obama said. "The bottom line here is very clear: Arts education isn't something we add on." Arts, she said, shouldn't be introduced after goals "like raising test scores and getting kids into college" have been achieved. They are actually all-important to achieving those goals "in the first place."

## President Says More Kids Need Arts Education

Six million children do not have art or music instruction in their schools, she said. Millions more get only a very slight amount of arts education.

In his surprise appearance, the president made his own pitch for arts education.

"The arts are central to who we are as a people, and they are central to the success of our kids. This is not an afterthought," he said. "This is not something you do because it's kind of nice to do. It is necessary for these young people."

A few big-name artists, such as actresses Sarah Jessica Parker and Alfre Woodard, were at the White House event. The stars performed with students from the schools they have adopted. They also spoke about the changes they have seen in their students.

## Happy Changes

"Our kids are glimpsing the fact that they have" worth, Woodard said. "That confidence just spreads across their lives."

Students spoke about what the arts mean to them, too.

"I think that the arts are important to our school," said 8-year-old Sinai Jones from Oregon. Arts education gives kids "an opportunity to see what they want to do in their life," she said. It gives them "a level of confidence."

At the White House, Sinai was in an all-girl singing group. The students performed "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from the musical "Annie" and Parker sang backup.
