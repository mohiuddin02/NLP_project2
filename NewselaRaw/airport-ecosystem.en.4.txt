SEATTLE â€” Steve Osmek is a wildlife biologist. He works at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport. It's his job to make sure animals play nice with planes.

"If it moves, if it has legs, I'm responsible," he says.

Sometimes, it can be as easy as a fence to keep them out. The airport has a 12-foot fence that stops coyotes and deer from wandering onto the runways.

But it gets more complicated with birds.

## Short Grass, Few Plants With Berries

When birds hit planes, it costs airlines lots of money. The government said these accidents cost airlines $700 million a year. The accidents are called bird strikes and they can also kill people if the airliner crashes.

You can't fence birds out. So Osmek tries other things. He tries to keep out birds that fly together, like starlings, or big birds of prey, like hawks.

Osmek has to think about plants. The grass is short. That way, rats and insects that birds eat will stay away. Plants with berries, nuts and seeds are few and far between. Birds like to eat those plants. Shrubs are planted to prevent birds from nesting.

Goats were once used to eat the blackberries, so that the birds wouldn't come to feed on them. But the goats ate good plants, too. So people take care of those plants, now.

Sea-Tac was the first airport with a wildlife biologist. A few others now have the biologists, too.

## Voles Multiplied Bird Strikes

"Sea-Tac has one of the longest histories of wildlife management," said Ed Herricks. He is a professor at the University of Illinois. Herricks leads a pilot project using radar to find birds at a few airports including Sea-Tac.

Airports are working harder to keep birds away. It seems to be working. There are more planes and animals around. But there are fewer accidents.

Even things made by people for the airport can play a part. Take the ponds that catch storm water. The ponds are covered in nets and lined with black plastic to keep away plants that attract birds. This keeps away Canada geese, which are large and like to fly together.

But Osmek cannot control everything. Nature sometimes has its say.

Two years ago, the number of bird strikes at Sea-Tac was 121, nearly twice the usual number. The reason? Voles, small animals that look like mice. The voles had multiplied during an especially wet spring and attracted lots of birds.

## First Airport With Bird Radar

Osmek and his team trapped and moved more than 100 birds in 2011. This year they have moved 40. The birds are tagged and taken away. Some of the traps use pigeons from the parking garages to keep hunting birds away from the runways.

Some birds are put down. Their bodies go to the Burke Museum for classes to study.

Osmek says there are fewer starlings. At the same time, the airport now has more songbirds. Songbirds are okay because they do not fly together in groups.

Seattle is the first airport with bird radar. The system is better now than when it was first put in place. Managers would answer any time a bird showed up. But by the time they got there, the bird would be gone. Now they know to look only for groups. They shoo them with "screamers and bangers" that are like fireworks.

There's no way for an airport to be perfectly friendly to nature. People are mixing with wildlife. But the wildlife was there first. People can play by nature's rules, and not fight. And that's why even airports need wildlife biologists.
