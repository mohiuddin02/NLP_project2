BEIJING — It was two hours before showtime at Beijing's prestigious National Center for the Performing Arts, China's version of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Performers with the American Hollywood Film Orchestra were at their latest stop on their winter tour of China.

They'll schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing tunes from movies like "Titanic," "Dances With Wolves," "The Incredibles" and "The Godfather." To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around drums, upright basses or cellos or other large instruments. Instead, local promoters provide them.

There can be problems, sometimes like a slapstick scene from a mivie. On this Saturday evening in Beijing, when two cellists opened the cases of the loaner instruments and found the bridge on one had come completely off. Nearby, percussionist Chris Nolan briefly had steam coming out of his ears.

"Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!" he exclaimed, pointing at the pitted and sagging drum heads. Stagehands with walkie-talkies, an interpreter and the local promoter buzzed around the stage, trying to figure out what to do.

## The Show Must Go On

But as they say in Hollywood, the show must go on, and so it did. Nolan got his new drum heads just in time. It was 20 minutes before the curtain went up for the show, called "Classic Oscar: The American Hollywood Film Orchestra New Year's Audio-Visual Concert."

At 7:30 p.m., conductor Jason Altieri took to the podium, raised his baton and launched the group into Berlioz's "Rakoczi March." Its connection to Hollywood? Well, there was none. But the song was included in the 1966 French film "La Grande Vadrouille." Judging from the accompanying clips on a giant screen at the rear of the stage, the movie was a slapstick comedy with lots of Nazis.

The orchestra has a grueling schedule — 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, 11 p.m. dinners, with travel, rehearsal and performances in between. China is investing heavily in new concert venues and classic music education. The never-ending demand to hear them play is a testament to the country's a thirst for Western orchestral music.

In just the last few months, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the San Diego Symphony, the BBC Concert Orchestra, Canada's National Arts Center Orchestra and even Pierce College's L.A. Symphonic Winds have staged China tours.

Some performers are recent college graduates. Others are senior citizens like Jack Cobos, a retired carpet salesman and former violinist with the Chattanooga Symphony who's turning 71 during this tour. They're hardly famous, but in smaller cities, they've been swarmed by crowds eager to take dozens of pictures after their shows.

Sometimes, the concert halls are freezing cold or still under construction. Jason Heidelberg, a cellist from Cleveland, said this year they arrived in the eastern resort of Haiyang, and the day of the show, "the floor was still not done — they just put red carpet over it."

## "Making Music And Sharing It"

John Bryant, a trumpeter who has toured with the group twice, said that when the group's plane was grounded by a snowstorm in Shenyang, the musicians had to resort to a standing-room-only train and made it to their next concert, in Xian, 90 minutes late. "Playing after like 18 hours of travel was crazy. We didn't even have time to change into our tuxes; we just went straight to the concert in our traveling clothes," he said.

At another venue, Bryant said, he was stunned to find the room filled with cigarette smoke. "I'm a trumpet player," he said, "and when you're trying to play and the room is full of smoke, well, it's a bit tough."

Some audience members appear to be attending the expensive shows out of curiosity. Others are big Hollywood film fans. One such person at the Beijing show was college student Cecilia Yu, who studied violin for several years. Yu said she was particularly looking forward to music from "Lord of the Rings," "Phantom of the Opera" and "Harry Potter."

In an effort to connect with the local crowds, the group performed selections from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." The performers also surprised the audience with a piece from the 1961 Chinese film "The Red Detachment of Women," probably the first time that song has been played with the "Mission: Impossible" theme and the alien style jazz of "Cantina Band" from "Star Wars."

Most of the performers, though, say they're touring not so much for the money as the opportunity to see a bit of China. They enjoy the companionship of their fellow musicians and connect with audiences who speak a different language and come from a different culture.

The conductor recalled how in another city in China, Ningbo, the group stumbled across a music school where an old man was teaching the erhu, a traditional Chinese two-stringed instrument, to youngsters. The Americans watched for half an hour, and the kids staged an unplanned concert. Later, the Americans found a group of people performing karaoke in a park, and joined in.

"One of our players sang 'My Heart Will Go On' with them, and that night, all the karaoke people ended up buying tickets to our show. They even came backstage and gave us flowers," he said. "That's what I love about doing this — making music and sharing it, having that connection with other people that goes beyond language."
