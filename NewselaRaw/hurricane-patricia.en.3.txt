CHAMELA, Mexico â€” Hurricane Patricia began as one of the strongest storms in history. It caused surprisingly little damage Saturday.

The storm landed in an area of Mexico's Pacific Coast with few people. It then crashed into the mountains and quickly blew over.

The popular beach city of Puerto Vallarta was hardly affected.

Authorities were still checking some areas. So far, there were no reports that anyone died or was injured, said Roberto Lopez Lara. He is a top official for the Mexican state of Jalisco, where the storm landed. Later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto reported that between 3,000 and 3,500 homes had been damaged. The storm also affected about 8,650 acres of farmland. Nieto said that 235,000 people had lost electricity.

## A Sudden Storm That Quickly Grew

Patricia formed suddenly Oct. 20. It quickly grew into a hurricane. Within 30 hours it had zoomed to a Category 5 storm, the strongest on a scale of 1 to 5. Many experts were surprised at how fast it grew.

By Friday, winds were blowing up to 200 miles per hour. It became the most powerful hurricane on record in North America and South America.

The World Meteorological Organization is the weather service of the United Nations. It reported that Patricia's power while still out at sea was about as strong as Typhoon Haiyan. The typhoon, a hurricane at sea, left more than 7,300 dead or missing in the Philippines two years ago.

Patricia came to shore in an area with sleepy villages and a few fancy hotels. People said they were terrified.

## Riding Out The Worst

"Those were the longest five hours of my life," said Sergio Reyna Ruiz. He lives in the village of La Fortuna, about two miles from the ocean. "Five hours riding the monster."

He and family members tried to clean up the damage. They sawed through a fallen tree. They also put wet mattresses and books into the sun to dry.

They were thankful that everyone survived. "It's something to tell the grandchildren," Reyna Ruiz said.

## One Village Was Not So Lucky

Down the road in the town of Chamela, people searched for anything that could be saved. All 40 families that live there took shelter in another town. When they returned, they hardly recognized their village.

Arturo Morfin Garcia's home was just a jumble of bricks and beams. The only part left standing was a concrete bathroom.

"It was hard to come back and find this," Morfin Garcia said. "So much work to build something. It makes me very sad."

## Resort Town Escaped Everything But Rain

About 200,000 people live in Puerto Vallarta. The population includes thousands of Americans. The city was hardly touched by the storm. After the hurricane passed, people snapped selfies. Business owners swept sidewalks as they would on any morning.

Dennis Feltgen is a meteorologist for the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Meteorologists study the weather. He said it was good that Patricia came ashore in an area with so few people. It would have been another matter if it landed at Puerto Vallarta.

Hurricane experts said Mexico was well prepared for the storm. They also said Mexico was lucky.

Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, a top Mexican official, put it another way. "Nature was good to us," he said.
