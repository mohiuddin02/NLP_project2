Across the nation, there has been an intensifying focus on concussions in young athletes. Resulting from blows to the head, [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) are minor brain injuries that, particularly if they occur repeatedly, can have serious long-term effects.

In response to this growing concern, the White House on Wednesday unveiled a host of new strategies for dealing with the problem. The goal is to help prevent, track and more effectively treat concussions in children.

Officials announced a new commitment of $65 million in private funds to boost clinical and scientific work.

Of that amount, $30 million came from the National College Athletic Association (NCAA) and $25 million came from the National Football League (NFL). An additional $10 million was a gift from New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch. Tisch's contribution went to the University of California, Los Angeles, and is intended to help get a national tracking system for concussions off the ground.

## Helping To Better Recognize Severe Injuries

"Hopefully, 20 years from today, athletes won't be discovering the head injuries that football players now are discovering they may have gotten when they were playing in high school and college," Tisch said. "This is kind of a new frontier."

Tisch's donation will sustain and expand a university program founded in 2012. So far, that program has treated 600 young patients with brain injuries and studied the aftereffects of concussions in middle school, high school and college athletes.

"This commitment will launch our program to the next level," said Dr. Christopher Giza, the director of the program. In the coming years, Giza said, the program hopes to broaden its reach into schools and youth sports leagues across the region. Its goal will be to fuel advances in detection, care and recovery, and to clarify the longer-term effects of concussion on the still-developing brain.

## President Obama Supports The Research

There have been reports that concussions may set the stage for learning problems, mental health problems and even dementia. As White House spokesman Jay Carney pointed out, this has made parents wary of allowing their children to participate in organized athletics.

In late 2013, President Barack Obama reflected that growing concern, saying that if he had a son, he would not let him play pro football. Nonetheless, the Obamas take a strong interest in sports, as seen in the first lady's campaign to increase physical activity among the nation's children. The president, Carney said, has been eager to boost research on concussions.

A report on concussions was issued last fall by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. It found significant gaps in what is known about the effects of repeated blows to the developing brain.

## Safety Rules Must Be Enforced

The panel recommended that, until more is known, leagues, coaches and parents should take several precautions: A child who has been hit hard in the head should be banned from playing until he or she has been medically evaluated. And game rules regulating safety should be strictly enforced. Those, for instance, penalize head-to-head contact in football and blindside hits to the head in hockey and lacrosse.

Some researchers suggest that the young brain may rebound more quickly from bumps and injuries than the brain of an older athlete. Others fear the opposite: Because the young brain is still developing, they say, repetitive blows may be more damaging. For one thing, they point out, much of a young brain's wiring does not have the protective, fatty coating seen in older brains.

According to the latest available figures, about 250,000 people under the age of 19 were treated for concussions in 2009, up from 150,000 in 2001. And an NCAA survey of 15 college sports recently showed that between 1989 and 2004 the overall rate of reported concussions doubled.

## How The Money Will Be Spent

Other new efforts to combat concussions include the following:

—The NCAA and the Department of Defense will spend $30 million to fund the most comprehensive research to date on concussions. The goal of this effort also will be to change an athletic culture in which blows to the head are seen as dings to be "shaken off."

—The NFL will commit $25 million to projects aimed at promoting youth sports safety. The league says it will launch pilot programs to expand access to athletic trainers in schools. Under a program called "Back to Sports," the NFL also will work with the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) to educate parents about sports safety.

—The National Institutes of Health will launch a long-term study of the effects of repetitive blows to the head.

—The National Institute of Standards and Technology will invest $5 million to develop advanced materials for helmets. Such materials, it is hoped, will better protect against concussion.
