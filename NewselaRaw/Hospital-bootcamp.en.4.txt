Several hospitals offer programs to help kids stay healthy. The programs include exercise. They teach kids about healthy eating. Good eating habits and exercise prevent health problems.

Dr. William Muinos is a doctor. Too many kids are overweight, he says.

"It's a serious problem and can only get worse," Muinos said. He runs a program for overweight kids. The program is based at Miami Children's Hospital.

## Everyone Has Their Own Plan

Muinos sees about 30 children every Friday. Some need to lose more than 100 pounds. He creates a plan for each one.

Muinos helps the kids understand why it is important to lose weight. It is also important for families to understand. Parents need to feed their kids healthy food. They need to limit television and computer time.

"A child cannot do it by themselves," Muinos said.

Jose Carlos Sanchez is 14. When he met Muinos, he weighed nearly 250 pounds. Now, Sanchez has lost about 20 pounds.

"I feel much better about myself," said Sanchez. "I have a lot more energy."

## Working Out Is Made Fun

Rickey Dickenson teaches the boot camp. He makes it like a dance party. He plays popular music. The kids play games. They work out with hula hoops, weights and balls.

"The kids get into it," he said. "By the end of the class they are all sweating."

Viana Espinal is 7. She said she feels good about herself.
