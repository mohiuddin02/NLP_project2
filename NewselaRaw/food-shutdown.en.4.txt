WASHINGTON â€” The government shutdown means many people are not working at some important federal agencies. Their absence makes it harder to protect Americans' health and safety. It is more difficult to look into the cause of accidents at work and on the roads and trains. It is also harder to track diseases that come from food.

A case of salmonella in chicken is the latest example. Salmonella is bacteria. It makes people very sick. More than 270 people across 18 states have gotten sick from the chicken.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) keeps track of diseases in food. It said Tuesday that it was bringing back some of its staff. They will deal with the salmonella outbreak.

The states have had to pick up work from missing federal employees who have been told to stay home because of the government shutdown.

## An Outbreak Of Salmonella

Take the case of food safety. State labs are investigating illnesses from food. They are communicating with each other to figure out whether outbreaks have spread.

Dr. Christopher Braden heads the CDC division that investigates illness from food. He said bringing the staff back will let the agency keep a better eye on the salmonella outbreak. But the agency is monitoring more than 30 outbreaks. Gaps still exist.

The staff will go through other cases, he said. They could find something that was missed earlier. "When that's the case, it's harder to start" later than earlier, Braden said.

The shutdown is beginning its second week. So far, no end is in sight. It started Oct. 1 when Republicans in Congress and the White House failed to agree on a law to pay for the government.

The CDC isn't the only agency that's strained. The shutdown also affects the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The agency has stopped its regular mine safety inspections. It normally looks at each of the nation's underground mines every three months.

## Deadly Mine Accidents

Three mine workers died in separate accidents. The accidents happened on three straight days during the past week. The coal mining industry has not had three consecutive days of fatal accidents in more than 10 years. The nation's largest mine workers union has raised alarms.

"The government's watchdog isn't watching," union president Cecil Roberts said.

Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board is only investigating some accidents. Officials have to believe lives or property are in danger.

The Food and Drug Administration has stopped normal food plant inspections. Food imports are still being inspected at borders. But any samples that need to be checked could be held up. There aren't as many scientists to check them right now.

The CDC also has had to stop monitoring flu. That might not seem like a big deal. But the disease spreads. It kills about 24,000 Americans a year.

It is too early in the flu season for many people to be sick. So there is not a lot to test. But some state health departments have been testing samples that otherwise would have gone to the CDC, said Kelly Wroblewski. She works at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

## Only One CDC Officer At Each Airport

The CDC also is slashing its staff at airports. CDC officers stationed at airports examine sick people arriving into the United States. They can keep them out of the country if it's found they can sicken others.

Dr. Martin Cetron works for the CDC. He said there is one person working at each airport station. That could increase the chance that some diseases could slip into the country. Serious diseases are spreading in other places. For example, measles is raging in Turkey, and cholera is breaking out in Mexico.

Many workers who protect safety and health are still working. Air traffic controllers and the majority of federal law enforcement are all on duty. Soldiers are working. Most of the staff is on the job at the USDA's agency responsible for investigating the poultry farm in California that is linked to the salmonella outbreak.

But the absence of other workers matters, said Caroline Smith DeWaal. Her job is to stand up for food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. She pointed out that it was hard for the public to get information on any outbreaks. Even government websites are shut down.

"These agencies are always running behind, and the idea that you can just shut them down is just foolish," said Smith DeWaal.
