WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday night that recent diplomatic steps offer "the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons" inside Syria without the use of force, but he also insisted the U.S. military will keep the pressure on President Bashar Assad "and be ready to respond" if other measures fail.

Speaking in a nationally televised address from the White House, Obama said he had asked congressional leaders to postpone a vote on legislation he has been seeking to authorize the use of military force against Syria.

Acknowledging the weariness the nation feels after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama said, "America is not the world's policeman."

And yet, he added, "When with modest effort and risk we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act. That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional."

## U.S. To Work With Russia And U.N.

The speech capped a frenzied 10-day stretch of events that began when he unexpectedly announced he was stepping back from a threatened military strike. Obama said he would first ask Congress to pass legislation authorizing the use of force against Assad.

Public opinion polls consistently show widespread opposition to American military intervention. The White House has struggled  to generate support among lawmakers in both parties who fear getting involved in another war in the Middle East. They have questioned whether U.S. national security interests were at stake in Syria. Obama had trouble, as well, building international support for a military attack.

But events took another unexpected turn this week. First Russia and then Syria reacted positively to a seemingly off-hand remark from Secretary of State John Kerry. He indicated that the crisis could be defused if Damascus agreed to put its chemical weapons under international control.

The president said he was sending Kerry to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday. Obama added, "I will continue my own discussion" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The United States and its allies will also work with Russia and China to present a resolution to the United Nations Security Council "requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons and to ultimately destroy them under international control."

## "The Facts Cannot Be Denied"

Obama recounted the events of the deadly chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21 that the United States blames on Assad.

"When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until these horrifying pictures fade from memory. But these things happened. The facts cannot be denied," he said.

The president said firmly that Assad's alleged attack was "not only a violation of international law, it's also a danger to our security."

If diplomacy now fails and the United States fails to act Assad could keep using poison gas. So could other tyrants. U.S. troops could face the threat of chemical warfare and "these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel," Obama said.

The president sought to deal methodically with what he said were questions asked by lawmakers and citizens who took the time to write him with their concerns about U.S. military action.

"I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria," he promised. "I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan. I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo. This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective: deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's capabilities."

## Syria Ready To Turn Over Chemical Weapons

Before the  president's speech, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointedly told a congressional hearing that the threat of military action needed to stay in place for diplomacy to work.

Kerry said that any agreement must include binding consequences if Syria fails to comply.

Obama himself "wasn't overly optimistic about" prospects for a solution at the U.N., said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., after party members met with the president.

U.S. officials say more than 1,400 died in the Aug. 21 incident, including at least 400 children. Other casualty estimates are lower. Assad has said the attack was launched by rebels who have been fighting to drive him from power in a civil war. So far, more than 100,000 civilians have died in the war.

Russia supports Assad and has blocked U.S. attempts to rally the Security Council behind a military strike. But Monday, after a remark by Kerry, it spoke favorably about requiring Syria to surrender control of its chemical weapons. The Syrian foreign minister did likewise.

The foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said Tuesday that his government was ready to turn over its chemical weapons stockpile in line with Russia's proposal in order "to thwart U.S. aggression." He also said Syria was prepared to sign an international chemical agreement it has long rejected.

## Lukewarm Support In Congress For Strikes

The response in Congress to support such a strike has been lukewarm at best — as underscored during the day when liberal Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and conservative Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., both announced their opposition.

Earlier, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky became the first congressional leader to come out against legislation giving the president authority for limited strikes. "There are just too many unanswered questions about our long-term strategy in Syria," he said.

Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, the top two Republicans in the House, have endorsed Obama's request.

Still, there was ample skepticism in Congress about the United Nations as well as Russia's true intentions. Lawmakers also questioned Syria's willingness to be bound by international agreements.

Said Boehner, "Clearly, diplomacy is always a better outcome than military action. But I will say that I'm somewhat skeptical of those that are involved in the diplomatic discussions today."
