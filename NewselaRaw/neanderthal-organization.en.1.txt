Until recently Neanderthals were considered uncivilized creatures and were believed to have lived in disorderly conditions. But now scientists have reason to believe that they, like modern humans, may have organized their living spaces according to tasks.

Neanderthals are our closest extinct human relatives. They lived approximately 200,000 to 28,000 years ago in Europe and southwestern to central Asia. They had bodies that were shorter and stockier than ours.

But, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, "their brains were just as large as ours and often larger - proportional to their brawnier bodies."

Researchers recently published a piece in the Canadian Journal of Archaeology about their latest Neanderthal findings. In it they explain that according to recently discovered artifacts, Neanderthals butchered animals, sharpened tools and gathered around a hearth in separate areas of their living space.

## A Place For Everything ...

The findings are based on excavations at Riparo Bombrini, a collapsed rock shelter in northwestern Italy where Neanderthals lived for thousands of years.

"There has been this idea that Neanderthals did not have an organized use of space, something that has always been attributed to humans," said Julien Riel-Salvatore, a professor at the University of Colorado-Denver. Riel-Salvatore was a lead author of the study.

"We found that Neanderthals did not just throw their stuff everywhere but in fact were organized and purposeful when it came to domestic space," Riel-Salvatore said in a prepared statement.

The archaeological site, which was severely destroyed during railroad construction, hosted both Neanderthals and humans. Researchers focused on three levels of the cave that Neanderthals used roughly 45,000 years ago.

Riel-Salvatore and his fellow scholars wrote that the cave was probably used at times as a permanent residence, and as a logistical base at other times. It's for this latter use that researchers noticed the greatest organization.

Specifically, researchers found evidence of fire building, or hearths, toward the rear wall of the cave. Stone tools and chips, as well as animal materials, were found outside the cave.

## ... And Everything In Its Place

The authors wrote that "this may suggest an effort to keep activities" that produced harmful debris away from those parts of the shelter that were more enclosed. Those areas may have been associated with sleeping and socializing next to hearths.

Researchers cautioned that their conclusions were made on a roughly 15-square-foot initial excavation. They added that further work was necessary to confirm their observations.

Among other findings, researchers noted the presence of edible shellfish remains throughout the cave dwelling. They also found large amounts of ochre, a clay-like substance found in the earth.

Study authors said they were unclear as to what the ochre was used for. But they speculated that it may have been used during animal butchering or in processing animal hides.

"Neanderthals could have used it for tanning hides, for gluing, as an antiseptic or even for symbolic purposes," Riel Salvatore said of the ochre. "We really can't tell at this point."
