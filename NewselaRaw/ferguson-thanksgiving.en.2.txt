FERGUSON, Mo. — The hungry crowd had traveled far for their Thanksgiving meal.

Some were hundreds or thousands of miles from home, but inside this St. Louis-area church it seemed like a family dinner. Most of the people didn't know each other until three months ago. Now, they were united by their anger over the death of Michael Brown, and their thankfulness for Cat Daniels, who has fed them since August.

They call her "Momma Cat." She has been serving Sunday meals to protesters outside the Ferguson Police Department nearly every week since Aug. 9. On that day, Brown, an unarmed black teen, was killed by Officer Darren Wilson, who is white. Last Monday, protests broke out again after a grand jury decided not to indict, or charge, Wilson. A grand jury is a group of citizens who decide if a person should be charged with a crime.

Daniels, 53, who lives in nearby Florissant, has tried to calm the scene with plates of food. "Momma Cat does have quite a bit of influence," said Pastor Henry Logan. He is a Ferguson activist who has been working with Daniels since August. "She does it one meal at a time."

## "I Can't Sit Down"

After months of protests, sometimes violent, the city of Ferguson seemed to take a deep breath on Thanksgiving. The protesters were gone. The holiday was cold and quiet — at least for a few hours.

"It's a day to breathe, to love one another, to share and give thanks for what we have and what we will have," said Daniels. She was surrounded by fried turkey, collard greens and other dishes she spent a sleepless night cooking.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon shared Thanksgiving dinner with National Guard troops. He sent more than 2,000 of the soldiers to keep the city safe. West Florissant Avenue, where protesters stole and burned stores after Monday's grand jury decision, was still under guard.

Some of the protesters attended a fundraiser to provide meals for poor schoolchildren.

Momma Cat said she was moved to help by the unfair treatment of black people by police.

"I can't sit down. I have to be on the right side of history. But it's not my fight these days," Daniels said. She said that it's the fight of younger people, but she believes it's her generation's duty to support them.

To do that, Daniels turned to one thing she believes can unite any group of people, regardless of what they think or where they come from, food.

## Southern-Style Comfort Food

Said Daniels, "Food has a healing power. Food can heal your soul."

On most Sundays, Daniels has been behind a row of warming dishes and cooking pans in the parking lot across from the police station. She has dished out food and advice to anyone who walks up.

At first, Daniels paid for most of the food out of her pocket. As the weeks wore on, she began accepting donations from the dozens of protesters she feeds each week.

Daniels has been attending classes at a cooking school, the Culinary Institute of St. Louis. She also cooks meals for doctors at DePaul Health Center in St. Louis.

Daniels says her passion is cake design, although she serves up Southern-style comfort food on Sundays. Police officers have yet to walk across the street for a meal, Daniels said. But if anyone with a badge and gun joins the buffet line, she'll gladly fix them a plate.

A great-grandmother, Daniels has been a mother, therapist, chef and friend to the protesters.

## Keeping The Protesters Fed

"She's definitely one of the mother hens," said Biko Baker, a demonstrator from Milwaukee. "When you've got 35- and 40-year-old people calling you Momma, you've done something."

Baker said the Thanksgiving dinner served at St. Luke's AME Church came at an important time for the demonstrators. "Momma Cat gives us an opportunity for people to come together and heal," Baker said.

Before, Daniels and her husband had been thinking of selling their house. They wanted to move away from the area she says is divided between black and white and rich and poor. After Brown's death, Daniels said, she knew she had to do something.

Maybe she didn't belong on the front lines of the protests, but she could at least keep the protesters fed.

"I'm not a professional protester. I'm not an activist," Daniels said. "We had to get active. We had to say, that's enough."
