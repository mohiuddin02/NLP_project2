LOS ANGELES â€” Los Angeles police helicopters are stopping crimes before they start.

It is a new way to use helicopters, says Captain Gary Walters, who heads the police helicopter unit.

A few years ago, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) tried a new way to keep crime from happening. Using technology and police records, it figured out where crimes were more likely to happen. Then, the department sent police there.

Now the police department is flying helicopters to these crime "hot spots." Police think people will not break the law while a helicopter hovers overhead.

The police department has 17 helicopters. It is the largest police helicopter fleet in the country. Most police departments use helicopters to search for criminals. Crime experts say that using helicopters to prevent crime is really unusual, but sounds like a good idea.

## Flights Rise, Crimes Drop

So far, LAPD officials say, the helicopters are working. When the helicopters made more flights, the number of serious crimes went down.

During a week in June 2013, for instance, helicopters flew 36 times over an area in South Los Angeles. A total of 125 crimes were reported that week. During another week in July, the number of flights in the area rose to 91. The number of crimes dropped to 86.

The biggest difference came last September. During one week, police helicopters flew over the same area 65 times. Ninety crimes were reported. A week later, the number of flights dropped to 40 and the number of reported crimes skyrocketed to 136. Almost all types of crime went up, including burglary, car theft and thefts from vehicles.

Craig Uchida looks at the LAPD's crime numbers and offers advice on preventing crime. He says it is too early to prove the link between the flights and crime. So far though, the results look good.

The project sometimes had unexpected results.

## Last Dance For Bad Guys

In March 2014, a helicopter pilot was checking a crime hot spot. Crooks had been stealing vehicles, breaking into cars and attacking people, says Sergeant Tony DeMolina, an LAPD pilot. While keeping an eye out for crime, the pilot spotted something else. The pilot saw an illegal dance party inside a huge warehouse.

The partygoers would park their cars in nearby alleys. Then, thieves broke into the cars. After the dance parties ended, DeMolina says, the people themselves were robbed. The police sent extra patrol cars to shut the parties down.

Geoffrey Alpert, who teaches at the University of South Carolina, studies the use of police helicopters. He says helicopters can work for a while. However, criminals will likely return after the helicopters leave.

Helicopters can scare off criminals, but not stop them from wanting to commit a crime, he said. "Those criminals could strike in a different time and place."

##Noise, Threats And Spies

While some see helicopters as a new tool for reducing crime, others think they are loud and scary.

Andrew Guthrie Ferguson teaches at the University of the District of Columbia. He pointed out that helicopters are very loud and can feel threatening to people.

Police departments say they want to have a better relationship with the community. A hovering helicopter can get in the way of that, Ferguson says.

## Are Drones Next?

Some people were unhappy when the LAPD received two drones from Seattle police last year. The Los Angeles police are not using the unmanned aircraft. The drones remain locked away for the time being. Some people worry that drones, which carry cameras, could be used to spy on people.

If the helicopter project is successful, the LAPD could use drones the same way, said Peter Bibring. He is a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union.

Commander Sean Malinowski sees them in a different way. He says using the helicopters to prevent crime shows how creative and exciting police work has become.

"That gets people pumped up to do something different," Malinowski says. He helped develop the new way to prevent crime. "It kind of injects life into the crime fighting."
