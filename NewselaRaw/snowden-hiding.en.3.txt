MOSCOW, Russia â€” Edward Snowden lives somewhere in the thousands of apartment buildings that surround Moscow in Russia. He cannot come home.

Two years ago, he made the American government very angry. He let people know that the government was collecting the cellphone calls of millions of regular people. It was hoping to spot enemies talking to each other. Many people were unhappy to learn the government was spying on them.

Snowden also released secret information he took from his job with the National Security Agency. The government department gathers information to help fight enemies of the United States. Snowden's actions led to a worldwide discussion about whether governments can listen in on their citizens. American lawmakers recently decided that the government must stop listening in on the phone calls of ordinary people.

## Doesn't Want To Go To Prison

Snowden, 32, is proud of what he did and feels a sense of accomplishment. Other than that, he has not gained much. The American government wants to put him on trial for spying. In interviews, he has said he would like to return to America, but not to prison.

Some people say Snowden seems to think the government might let him come home without being punished. The problem is he may think he is more popular than he actually is.

Although many younger Americans like what he did, an opinion poll showed that most people do not.

Even those helping him try to get home say that he does not have a good chance of avoiding prison.

One of them is Snowden's lawyer in Russia, Anatoly Kucherena. "Edward loves America and he would definitely like to return home," he said.

Kucherena said Snowden might be willing to talk to the American government about returning. First, though, he needs to make a deal "that he won't go to jail for 100 years," Kucherena said.

## Stealing State Secrets

The Russian lawyer said that what Snowden did could have been worse. He pointed out that Snowden did not give up his American citizenship and switch his allegiance to Russia. Snowden also did not give the secret material to Russia.

Kucherena insisted that Snowden took the information because he thought it was the right thing to do. Snowden has said that he wanted people to know that the government was listening in on the phone conversations.

Experts, however, say what Snowden did was illegal. He stole information from the NSA. They say he deserves to be put on trial if he comes back.

Kori Schake is a former National Security Council member and is now at Stanford University in California. She said that it does not matter if Snowden wanted to be a spy, he became one.

She also worries that more of the secret information he stole could be made public.

If what Snowden did was not spying against America, "I can't imagine what would be," Schake said.

## "He Has Two Choices"

Snowden had not intended to stay so long in Russia. Two years ago, his plane had stopped in Moscow and the American government canceled his passport. Without a passport, or travel papers, Snowden could not leave Russia or enter another country.

Sergei Markov works for the Russian government. He said Snowden needed Russia's protection.

"We can't send him back just because America demands it," Markov said.

Ronald Goldfarb is a lawyer who put together a book called "After Snowden."

Goldfarb said the government needs to determine what information Snowden stole. It also needs to figure out if the information is just embarrassing or actually could hurt America.

Ben Wizner is one of Snowden's lawyers. He said that Snowden is not likely to leave Moscow soon.

"Right now he has two choices. Stay indefinitely there or report to a U.S. prison," Wizner said. If he is found guilty of spying, he could spend 30 years in prison.
