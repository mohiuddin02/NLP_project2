FOWLER, Calif. â€” Shandeep Dhillon was lucky that his family had so many traditional Punjabi suits at home.

That meant he could be a big help in the preparations for the first "Bollywood night" at Fowler High School. He gave traditional coats for several people to wear. Bollywood is the nickname of India's movie industry.

The school's dining room was completely transformed for the party. The preparations cost more than $200. But Harcoover Singh Bhatti, the president of the Punjabi Club, said the money was not a problem.

"This was three years in the making. Three years!" he said.

## "A Sense That We're Family"

Hank Gutierrez, the school principal, watched the preparations. He was wearing a coat that belonged to Dhillon's uncle. On his feet he wore sparkling slippers that curled on his toes.

"This is my favorite moment of being principal," he said. "I grew up in this small town.  I wanted this school to have ... a sense that we're family."

The party was also a special event for Bhatti. His family is from the Punjab, a region in India. He is also a Sikh, which is the religion of many people who come from the Punjab.

But it is not easy being a young Sikh in central California.

Sikhs there are bullied more than other young people in the rest of the country. A study found this out by asking students about their experiences. Sikhs are often bullied because of how they wear their hair. For Sikhs, all parts of a person's body, including hair, is very important. Men and boys often do not cut their hair. As their hair grows, they tie it up in long pieces of cloth, like a turban.

The Sikhs in California are worried about all the bullying. Sikhs have been living in the cities near Fowler High School for more than 100 years. They have built houses and temples all over the region. The temples are always open to everybody.

## Worries About The Party

The 18-year-old Bhatti was born in the United States. But when he was little, his parents sent him to a school in the Himalayan mountains. While he was there, he received just one letter a month. He only got to talk to his parents on the phone once a week for five minutes.

"It was just like Harry Potter, but without the magic," he said.

When Bhatti came back to the United States to go to high school in Fowler, he could not understand English. But he studied it by himself.

Now he plans to study to become a doctor. But before that, he wanted to make a Bollywood party happen.

There are 608 students in Fowler High School. Only 51 of them are Punjabi.

Some of Bhatti's Sikh classmates did not believe the party was going to be a success.

"They said it was going to be lame because they worried people would make fun of it," Bhatti said.

## Classmates Cheer Him On

"I kept quiet," he said. But he knew that the Bollywood night was going to be great.

The night of the party, students took photos. They clapped along with the music, watching the dancers drum their feet and swirl. Bhatti's friends thumped him on the shoulders.

Later, a DJ dimmed the lights. He put on the songs of a popular Punjabi singer. People rushed to the dance floor.

Chandler Collins waved hands covered with washable tattoos. Bhatti's best friend, Caleb Savoia, pogoed into a group of girls dancing together. The only one dancing more lively was Harjinder (J.J.) Kalirai, a tall, quiet boy who wears a turban.

While they danced, Anika Arya, a teacher, sneaked off to a corner and cried.

She said she was not sure why. But it had something to do with seeing a shy Sikh boy suddenly happy. Usually he walked with his head down. But now he was dancing with joy as his classmates cheered him on.
