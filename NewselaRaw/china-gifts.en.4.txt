BEIJING â€” Want a full-time teaching job in China? Luo Chunlei advises that you buy the school principal a box of mooncakes. Then follow that up with an envelope full of cash.

Having an operation? Better slip the doctor some money.

"I'm absolutely disgusted by it, but this is how our system works," said Luo, a math teacher. Luo is fighting hard to change things.

The Chinese government has also started speaking out against overly expensive gifts. Such gifts are often really bribes. They are given to an important person to get something in return. It is against the law both to give and to take bribes. When government officials take bribes for favors, it is called corruption.

## A $200 Box Of Mooncakes ...

"Gift-giving is a must, but you should avoid extravagance," the government newspaper declared. It warned against certain kinds of gifts: luxury brands, wine, expensive cigarettes, and large amounts of cash.

"China has always been a society of guanxi," or connections, said economist Hu Xingdou. "Treating people to meals, giving people gifts, is all part of the Chinese lifestyle. This is something that goes way back."

But, he said, it "definitely clashes with the rule of law."

The government crackdown has forced the Chinese to ask a tough question: How much is too much?

For the Mid-Autumn Festival, businessmen give each other mooncakes. These sometimes cost as much as $200 per box.

Panda brand cigarettes are also popular. These are designed less for smoking than for giving as fancy gifts. Prices can reach up to $50 a pack.

## ... Or $10,000 Watches, A $3 Million Villa

In southern China, cash is slipped into red envelopes. Gift certificates are another popular choice: They can be easily traded for cash.

Then there are the gifts parents give to help their children get good grades. These are especially expected on Teachers' Day, a public holiday in China.

But such gifts are chicken feed compared to the gifts important people get: things like expensive Montblanc pens and $10,000 Rolex watches.

Or a $3 million villa on the French Riviera. That's what former government official Bo Xilai got. Bo was recently sentenced to life in prison for accepting bribes.

China's population is enormous. Battles for education, health care, jobs and promotions can be tough. Gifts are widely seen as a way to gain some advantage.

Luo said that his family paid doctors around $16,000 when his grandfather needed an operation. They did this even though health insurance supposedly paid for the operation. Health insurance is bought in advance to pay for costs if a person gets sick.

Parents in his town have to pay at least $3,200 to move their child to a better school, he said.

## "Brother Watch" Goes To Jail

Bribes are a particularly serious problem in government. Some officials have been photographed wearing very expensive watches. The watches cost more than they should be able to afford. Most make no more than $850 per month.

One official had a large collection of watches. One cost $62,000. This earned him the nickname "Brother Watch." It also got him a 14-year prison sentence.

By law, officials are not supposed to take gifts worth more than around $820 each. But the law is widely ignored.

President Xi is not the first Chinese leader to speak up about corruption.

"There is a pattern in China. Each time a new leader comes in, he sets a fire and starts to crack down very hard on corruption," said Professor Qiao Xinsheng. "These campaigns come and go." But over time, he said, China will become less corrupt.

Hu, the economist, said anti-corruption laws in China aren't applied evenly.

It has to be that way, he said. "We couldn't possibly hold all Chinese officials to the same standard because if we did, there would be no officials left standing."
