The New Horizons spacecraft mission to Pluto has survived its most dangerous task: making a close approach to the dwarf planet. The NASA spacecraft was controlled by scientists at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. This was where New Horizons sent confirmation that it had triumphantly passed 12,500 kilometers (7,767 miles) above Pluto.

It has been a successful mission for the spacecraft. New Horizons reached Pluto, the most distant object ever visited in space. It was also the first trip to what is known as the Kuiper Belt. That is the name for the region that includes Pluto and other icy worlds that ring the outer solar system.

## People Pushed For Pluto

The mission almost didn't happen. In the early stages, NASA had problems finding money for the mission, but public support was strong. People really wanted it to happen and kept pushing for it.

Scientists have always been fascinated by Pluto. For a long time, though, they had very little information about it. Then in the 1990s the Hubble Space Telescope showed them a little more. Observations from the telescope showed some light and dark areas on the planet. The most recent mission by New Horizons tells a much more detailed story about Pluto.

Scientists at the Applied Physics Laboratory have examined the last image the spacecraft sent before going into radio silence. It is far more detailed than any picture of Pluto they have seen before. It shows the hemisphere of Pluto that faces away from its main moon, Charon. On the surface of Pluto there appears to be a heart-shaped area, which scientists believe may be an icy region. The two sides of the heart have two distinct colors which indicates distinct chemical compositions.

## Bigger Than We Thought

New Horizons is not finished beaming back images. It is scheduled to send more detailed pictures in the coming weeks, including images of three of Pluto's five moons.

The New Horizons mission has shown that the planet is bigger than they previously thought. Now scientists believe Pluto's diameter is about 3 percent wider than past estimates. The new information may tell a story about the planet's atmosphere too. The lowest layer of Pluto's atmosphere, called the troposphere, is much thinner than thought. It may only be a kilometer or two at most.

Images have shown no new moons other than the five scientists already knew about. These are called Charon, Hydra, Nix, Styx and Kerberos. Nix and Hydra are 30 to 50 kilometers in diameter, the first size measurements of these bodies.

## "How Alien This Place Is"

Images from the spacecraft also show the difference between the varied and active surface of Pluto and the darker, grayer, cratered terrain of its largest moon Charon. "Now we see how dramatically different they really are," said Alan Stern, a planetary scientist working on the mission. "These images show a much younger surface on Pluto and an older, more battered surface on Charon." Pluto appears to have craters that have been filled in and are now smooth areas.

It is also now clear that Pluto is quite different from Neptune's moon Triton. For a long time researchers considered the two to be similar. "It's unbelievable how alien this place is," Stern said. For example, it is much redder than Triton, so much so that its surface looks closer to Mars. Charon's polar cap is also oddly reddish. The surfaces presumably take their color from hydrocarbons that have been baked by solar radiation, creating dark tars known as "tholins."

## So Long Solar System!

The most recent flyby is only the beginning of New Horizon's overall mission. The spacecraft will also study Pluto's moonlit night side and search for planetary rings lit from behind by the sun. In September the spacecraft will begin downloading all the information it has gathered to radio telescopes on Earth at a rate of about two kilobits per second. This is equal to Internet speeds from the 1980s, so it will take about 10 weeks.

Thanks to its plutonium power source, an element which was of course named after the planet, New Horizons still has enough juice to operate though the 2030s. By then it will be about twice as far from the sun as it is now. Eventually it will leave our solar system entirely and join NASA's four other spacecraft that are also headed to or already in interstellar space: Pioneers 10 and 11, and Voyagers 1 and 2.
