WASHINGTON — For many Americans, checking the right box on the U.S. census form is automatic, whether it's marking "black," "white," "Hispanic," "Asian," "American Indian" — or all of the above.

But for Americans of Middle Eastern and North African descent, or "MENA," it's a real predicament. They range in shade from pale to deepest ebony, and come from 22 different countries, from Iran to Egypt to Morocco. Most are Arabs, but many are Iranians, Turks and others. And yet, for more than 100 years the MENA community has been labeled "white" by the Census Bureau.

Every 10 years, the census is mailed to each U.S. home, asking a range of questions about Americans' lives.

## A Need To Be Counted Separately

Members of the MENA community are now asking the Census Bureau to create a separate "MENA" category for the 2020 count. "White," they argue, makes them invisible in population counts. Without correct numbers, they say, cities and states cannot properly fund educational or health programs, track discrimination, or staff hospitals with translators. Census numbers determine how $400 billion in government money is given to different states.

Census numbers also have an effect on voting results. For example, the census decides areas across the country that are required to provide voters with language help, or translations.

"Education is obviously a key point," says Sarab Al-Jijakli, the Brooklyn-based president of the Network of Arab-American Professionals. About 25 percent of public schoolchildren in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, may be of Arab descent, he says. "Are the services being given in that school really serving the local community?"

Additionally, some say being classified as "white" prohibits the MENA community from receiving benefits available to minorities. For instance, government programs assist minority-owned businesses.

"We're counted as 'white,' but we're not treated as 'white,'" said Samer Khalef, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. He said members of the MENA community are watched more closely because of terrorism concerns. "That's our problem. We are considered 'white' without the privileges of being 'white.'"

## Too Few Options On The Form

Since 1980, the Census Bureau has counted the growing Arab-American population from an ancestry question on the form. Based on that, there are about 1.6 million Americans of Arab heritage. But the Arab-American Institute says the "ancestry" question undercounts the MENA community. They estimate the number of Arab Americans to be 3.7 million. Counting non-Arabs such as Iranians, Turks, Chaldeans and Armenians would bring the MENA population up to 5 million, according to Helen Hatab Samham, of the Arab-American Institute.

"The kind of strict racial options that we have right now don't fit," she said. "More of us would identify as people of color."

Currently, the census lists five races — black, white, Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and one ethnic category, Hispanic. But Hispanics, like the MENA population, can be of any race.

Some cities and states track MENA populations on their own. Michigan did a survey to see why Arab-American infants die at a rate 40 percent higher than that of whites. The city of San Francisco has held hearings into discrimination against the MENA and Muslim communities following the Sept. 11 terror attacks. California has the largest MENA population.

## The Changing American Landscape

Race is an ever changing idea in America. From the 1890s through the 1930s, an African-American family with a mixed-race background, for example, could be classified as everything from "mulatto" to "black" to "Negro." Meanwhile, the "East Asian" category separated into ones for Koreans, Filipinos, Japanese and "Hindus," or South Asians. The stakes were high: Except for freed slaves given citizenship in 1864, non-whites were not allowed citizenship for many years.

In 1909, George Shishim, a policeman living in California, fought to claim U.S. citizenship. Because he was born in Lebanon, the United States considered him to be "Chinese-Mongolian" and not qualified for citizenship. The Syrian-Lebanese community rallied behind him and hired a lawyer. Ethnographic studies were done to prove that the Arab population is "white." A judge agreed, and Shishim was sworn in as a citizen.

Today, "white" is defined by the government as "any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa."

Adding a new category to the census form can be a long process. The bureau will test a new MENA category in 2015 and 2016.

"'White' is a made-up category, 'black' is a made-up category. Categories shift over time," said Akram Khater, a professor at North Carolina State University. "Those who are Arab- and Iranian-American are starting to construct this community called MENA that is as real or as false as everything else in this country."
