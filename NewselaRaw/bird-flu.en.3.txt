A 20-year-old woman in Taiwan has become the first patient to have a certain type of bird flu. It's known as H6N1.

Bird flu is a type of flu that jumps from birds to humans. It rarely affects humans. But it is scary because a particular type of the flu called H5N1 kills more than half of the people who are infected with it. Luckily, only 638 people have caught it in the world ever. In the past few years there have been outbreaks in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe. Because it jumps from birds to humans, millions of birds have been killed to prevent its spread in the past.

The woman became ill in May. She appears to have gotten completely better, says a report published this week by the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine. But her case raises important questions that scientists are trying to answer, including: How did she get the flu? And: Does this make humans more likely to be affected by a bird flu pandemic?

A pandemic is a disease that can spread through groups of humans over long distances.

## Full Recovery From Bird Flu ...

Let's start with what scientists know.

The woman was in good health. But, then she came down with a fever and a cough on May 5, says the report. The next day, she went to a hospital emergency room after her fever spiked. She also had trouble breathing. She was checked into the hospital on May 8.

X-rays showed that she had an infection that affects the throat and lungs. But tests failed to turn up signs of known types of flu. Doctors checked her for other diseases, but nothing came up. Doctors treated her with with drugs that prevent the spread of viruses and she began to improve.

Viruses are infections that attack the cells in the body. The flu is a virus.

She was sent home from the hospital two days later. A follow-up X-ray that was taken showed that her infection had cleared up.

The woman may have returned to her normal life. But, doctors and scientists in Taiwan continued to look into her case. They did a test and got a match for H6N1 flu.

Scientists did a more detailed genetic test. Eight genes make up the H6N1 virus. Genes are the building blocks of living things.

The test showed that the genes were like a strain of flu found in Taiwanese chickens. Types of the H6N1 that sickened the woman have been infecting chickens in Taiwan since 1997.

## ... But How Did She Get It?

It is still not clear how the virus was able to jump from chickens to the 20-year-old woman. She worked at a deli and didn't touch any chickens, live or dead. She hadn't been traveling in the three months before she got sick.

The scientists identified 36 people close to her including family members, co-workers and the people who treated her in the hospital. Six of these people became ill with fevers or infections. A doctor who treated her and several other patients with infections was one of those who got sick. None of the people who got sick showed signs of the flu after they were tested.

A family that lived near the woman kept a flock of 60 ducks, chickens and geese. The woman said she hadn't touched the birds for at least a year, but the scientists tested samples of bird stool anyway. None of them showed signs of the flu. The scientists will keep looking for clues.

The scientists who wrote the article in Lancet Respiratory Medicine said it's not clear how the new flu was spread. Understanding how a new flu virus is transferred is very important to public health. They say that more tests should be done.

Winter flus are the H1, H2 or H3 types. A flu shot can protect you against them.

Marion Koopmans studies viruses in the Netherlands. Each person infected with an animal virus is seen as "a threat to public health," Koopmans said. In the past 100 years, all the big flu outbreaks have come from animals. The big question now is if this flu could get bigger and spread to more people.
