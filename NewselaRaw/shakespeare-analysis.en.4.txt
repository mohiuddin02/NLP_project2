For 300 years, people have being trying to decide who wrote a play called "Double Falsehood."

They thought that it was written by William Shakespeare, but they were not sure. Shakespeare was a famous writer who lived in the 1500s. Now two professors say Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the play.

## The Play Has Its Own Language

A writer named John Fletcher seems to have helped write the play. Experts think that Fletcher wrote three plays with Shakespeare. One of those plays was a lot like "Double Falsehood."

Two professors, Ryan L. Boyd and James W. Pennebacker, used computers to study the play's language. They used a way of studying literature called "stylometry." The computers made the work easier and faster. Millions of sentences were studied.

The computers were specially programmed. They could quickly find language patterns that show up a lot. Repeated language becomes a writer's "signature." This can help when there is an argument about who wrote something. Stylometry done with computers can compare writers' "signatures" to a book or play. It is a scientific way to decide who the real writer was.

## Professors Needed Proof

The two professors from the University of Texas decided that Shakespeare wrote "Double Falsehood." Some people thought that Lewis Theobold wrote it.

Theobold studied and collected Shakespeare's plays. He published "Double Falsehood" in 1728. Theobold claimed it came from three pieces written by hand by William Shakespeare. But those pieces supposedly burned in a fire. There was no proof that Shakespeare wrote the play. Without proof, scholars thought that Theobold might have lied that the play was written by Shakespeare.

Boyd and Pennebaker's computers studied 54 plays. There were 33 by Shakespeare, nine by Fletcher and 12 by Theobold. The machines figured out the average length of sentences in the play. They also calculated how difficult the writing was. The computers even counted how often unusual words were used.

Boyd and Pennebaker said the study showed proof that the work was not a fake by Theobold.

## We Don't Really Know Will

Boyd and Pennebaker said that being able to figure out a writer's "signature" was important. It can lead to new ways of proving who wrote a book or play. It can also be used to help us better understand who a person was and how they thought, they said.

Much of William Shakespeare's life is a mystery. The study offers a bit of information. The way he wrote shows he was very educated in grammar. It also shows he cared more about how people acted. He paid less attention to the way people think or feel, the professors wrote.
