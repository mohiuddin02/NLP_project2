They were there to test a new way of studying the biggest danger to swimmers at the beach: rip currents.

Again and again, the scientists dragged 3-foot yellow-and-green objects into the waves. The plastic and foam devices are known as "drifters."

They then walked along the beach to wherever the drifters washed up and collected them.

Rip currents have killed 62 beachgoers in North Carolina since 1999. They are thought to be the reason for four out of five beach rescues in the U.S. They are by far the most common reason that coastal swimmers drown.

## "Really Frightening"

"It's really frightening for swimmers," said Simon Sanders, the man in charge of ocean rescues at Carolina Beach. It's like a machine that makes you keep moving and you can't stop.

The way dangerous currents work seems straightforward: Water piles up between the beach and a sandbar in the ocean. A sandbar is a buildup of sand that is in a line. In a riptide, the water will find a low point in the sandbar and rush back out to sea. Sometimes swimmers are carried along with the flow.

Scientists, however, have only recently begun figuring out the details of how they work. The 22 drifters released Wednesday are thought to be the first ever used on the U.S. East Coast.

The devices float along more or less as swimmers would. Scientists precisely and repeatedly track where the rip currents take them.

On Wednesday, the group set up right where a rip current had been reported.

## Dark Patch Of Water

The rip current clearly was happening. A dark patch of water showed where the current split the waves on its way out to sea. The current was weak, though, and several swimmers bobbed cheerfully right in the middle of it.

Rip currents are unpredictable, however.

The currents develop constantly. Nonetheless, one particular beach may develop them only rarely. Dangerously strong ones may be seen for only five to 10 days a year at any one beach.

Spencer Rogers led the construction of the drifters used on Wednesday. Currents, he said, are "almost never dangerous." When they are, though, watch out: Even Olympic champion swimmer Michael Phelps wouldn't be able to "keep up with one."

The new studies aren't just about understanding how rip currents work. They also could lead to different advice on how to behave if you are caught in one.

One of the volunteers Wednesday was Ron Brander, a well-known scientist from Australia.

## Stay Near A Lifeguard!

Brander thinks current advice on how to escape rip currents is wrong. Swimmers are told to swim parallel to the beach until they are out of the current.

Brander said that in many cases the currents form circles of water. Known as eddies, these can return you to the beach. All you have to do is stay calm and float along with the flow.

Experts are now deciding whether or not to change the advice given to swimmers. Some want to continue advising people to swim parallel to, or in the same direction as, the shore. Others feel swimmers should instead be told to float and wait.

The "float and wait" approach does have its dangers. In a handful of cases, swimmers would be shot straight out into the ocean and not returned to shore. For weak swimmers, that could be very dangerous.

Whether the advice given swimmers will change or not remains to be seen.

Meanwhile, Brander said, beachgoers should keep a simple tip in mind: If you spot a rip current, play it safe. Swim near a lifeguard or don't go in the water past your knees.

Brander thinks rip currents aren't treated seriously enough.

"In Australia," he said, "they don't get much attention." Rip currents "only kill one or two people at a time," so no one worries too much. Nonetheless, "they kill more people than cyclones, bush fires, floods and sharks combined."
