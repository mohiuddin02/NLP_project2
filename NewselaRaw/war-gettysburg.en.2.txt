ALLENTOWN, Pa. — At the mention of Gettysburg, Jeff Stocker fidgets in his chair. Stocker, wearing a necktie with Abraham Lincoln on it, turns and tilts his head slightly toward the ceiling. A smile emerges from his small gray beard.

"To be in the field at Gettysburg … it gives me chills just talking about it," Stocker says from behind the desk of his Pennsylvania law office. The rolling farmland, just 10 miles north of the Mason-Dixon line, is where Stocker's great-grandfather put his arms around a wounded Union captain and dragged him away from enemy soldiers.

It is where Stocker retraced the footsteps of both armies on summer days with his father, who wondered aloud what their Civil War ancestor looked like. It is where Stocker was on Monday to mark the 150th anniversary of the three-day battle that claimed more than 50,000 casualties.

And it is the inspiration for part of Stocker's latest book, "We Fought Desperate." The book takes a close look at eastern Pennsylvania's 153rd Volunteer Regiment, the band of untested soldiers that his great-grandfather joined.

## With The 153rd

Over the last seven years, he has relived Gettysburg through the letters, diaries and pension files of hundreds of men. Many of those soldiers never made it back home. "The dots on the map are people," said Stocker, who is from Center Valley, a town an hour north of Philadelphia. "I hope you realize that this is a real-life person with a real-life family. Chances are, just like you."

One of those dots on the map is Heinrich Feirich, a 40-year-old Prussian immigrant and shoemaker. Feirich's wife was pregnant, but that did not stop him from volunteering to serve nine months with the 153rd Pennsylvania in September 1862. Only four months into his enlistment, Pvt. Feirich began suffering from deafness and was reassigned as a servant for Capt. George Young.

By late June 1863, Confederate forces under Gen. Robert E. Lee were invading the North. As Lee's army swept through the countryside, the 153rd marched 10 miles over four hours on the morning of July 1. It  came to a grassy hilltop on the northeast corner of Gettysburg's battlefield. But it was too far from other Union troops and the regiment got hit hard by Confederate soldiers who charged out of a thicket of trees.

Capt. Young was shot in the face. He was among more than 250 from the regiment to be wounded, killed or captured. Feirich began dragging him from the battlefield. He stopped when Young ordered him to save himself and run, Stocker's research found. Young was captured and survived the war.

## Family Tree

Feirich completed his nine-month tour of duty. Then he enlisted in a different unit. He deserted in April 1864, was captured, and spent two weeks in prison. The Union Army added him back to its ranks because it was desperate for soldiers. Feirich was shot in the left knee at another battle, an injury that plagued him for the rest of his life.  He became a U.S. citizen after the war and died in 1894.

One of Feirich's daughters, Emma, married Albert Stocker. In February 1919, she gave birth to the last of her 14 children: Donald Stocker. He was Jeff Stocker's father. After fighting in World War II, Donald Stocker married and started his own family. From the time Jeff was old enough to walk, his dad took him to Gettysburg.

As they walked the battlefield, Donald Stocker would talk about Feirich. "I wonder where Feirich was," Stocker would say to his son. "I wish I had a photo of Feirich."

Jeff Stocker inherited his father's love of reading about the Civil War and World War II.  He is especially drawn to primary sources, such as copies of Civil War soldiers' handwritten journals and diaries. He has collected about 1,000 manuscripts and donates a copy of each one to Gettysburg's library.

## His First Book

In 1990, he was donating a manuscript from the 4th Alabama regiment. Scott Hartwig, a Gettysburg historian, suggested that he try to publish it. Stocker edited the manuscript and the University of Tennessee Press published "From Huntsville to Appomattox, Robert T. Coles' History of the 4th Alabama."

Then with Ed Root, he co-wrote "Isn't This Glorious," which traces the steps of the 15th, 19th and 20th Massachusetts regiments, which all fought at Gettysburg.

By the time "Isn't This Glorious" was published in 2006, Donald Stocker was in his mid-80s and still visiting Gettysburg, retracing the steps of Pickett's Charge. Jeff Stocker thought his father would get a kick out of reading about Heinrich Feirich and the 153rd.

He read newspaper obituaries at the Easton Public Library, and made trips to the National Archives in Washington to examine pension records. He read every diary, newspaper account and letter that he could find. The research, including a knee-high stack of 993 census records, is stuffed into file folders in Stocker's law office.

"My wife doesn't want any of this at home," he says of the stacks of paper records.

## His Father Remembered

The title, "We Fought Desperate," is a quote from a soldier describing a battle fought in Virginia two months before Gettysburg and the other major battle where the 153rd fought.

This week thousands are gathering at Gettysburg for the anniversary, but Donald Stocker will not be with them. He died last summer at 93. Stocker placed a manuscript of "We Fought Desperate" in his coffin.

Stocker knows that if his father were alive, he'd be on the old battlefield this week, walking in the footsteps of his ancestor.
