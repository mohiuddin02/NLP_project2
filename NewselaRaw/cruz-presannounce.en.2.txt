LYNCHBURG, Va. — Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, announced his plans to run for president on Monday. The senator made his announcement at Liberty University, a symbol for American evangelical Christians.

"Today, I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States," Cruz said in a speech to students.

"Ted! Ted!" students yelled.

"It is the time for truth. It is the time for liberty," Cruz said.

Cruz's speech had the feel of a sermon at a megachurch. The candidate walked around a stage wearing a wireless microphone while delivering his remarks. He discussed the humble backgrounds of his parents and how his wife is the daughter of religious missionaries. He pointed out that he had to borrow $100,000 to attend college and that he only paid it off a few years ago. He talked about the power of the American dream and rallying average people to push his campaign forward.

## Something For Everyone In The Party

The speech spoke to many different groups within the Republican Party: Christian conservatives, military supporters and members of the tea party, who want a smaller government. The location of the announcement, at a college, showed that Cruz hopes to get young people involved in his campaign.

One of Cruz's advisers said he plans to emphasize a positive message of moving America forward and uniting conservatives behind his campaign. At the same time, he will continue to show he is willing to take on both parties and will not budge in his beliefs. Cruz has pushed to end Obamacare, which is officially called the Affordable Care Act. He has also called for the Common Core education standards to be thrown out. Cruz has expressed doubts about climate change, or global warming.

## In-Person Declaration

Cruz had already announced his candidacy with a tweet sent Monday morning. Cruz decided to speak at Liberty to make it clear that he is courting young people, plus evangelicals and conservatives who are frustrated with Republicans in Washington.

"I'm running for president, and I hope to earn your support!" he wrote early Monday. That made Cruz the first major candidate to formally declare himself running in 2016. Many Republican hopefuls have been jockeying unofficially for a spot as the front-runner, including Cruz.

Later Monday, Cruz said it again, in person, at Liberty University.

"We stand together for liberty!" Cruz said. "This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington ... (It will come) when the American people stand together, and say, 'We will get back to the principles that made this country great.'"

## Applause From The Crowd

Cruz began his speech by discussing his parents. He described his mother's childhood in Delaware and his father's escape from Cuba. Cruz's father abandoned his family and Cruz said it was the power of Christianity that convinced him to return. He also spoke about American freedom. His father's experience in Cuba, Cruz said, had taught him "how fragile liberty is."

The student audience cheered like a concert crowd. Cruz got loud applause when he mentioned Patrick Henry, a famous Virginian from the American Revolution. They went wild when he talked about his own student loans, or the idea of shutting down the Internal Revenue Service, the government agency that collects taxes.

They booed loudly when Cruz mentioned President Barack Obama's health care law.

Cruz moved around the stage, urging students to imagine scenarios in which conservative ideals prevailed in Washington. Imagine no "Obamacare." Imagine no Common Core.

"Instead of a government that works to undermine our Second Amendment rights — that seeks to ban our ammunition – imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law-abiding Americans," he said.

## Calling On Big Money

Cruz's announcement will likely put the 2016 presidential race into high gear. By announcing early, Cruz intends to seize the attention of big donors and voters who favor the tea party, a group that insists on low taxes and small government. He has managed to beat conservative rivals like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and brain surgeon Ben Carson to the punch. By announcing at an evangelical Christian school like Liberty, Cruz is hoping to attract evangelical voters who might also be interested in slower-starting candidates like former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.

Cruz, 44, is a lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Princeton. He is best known for trying to block Obama's health care law from going into effect in 2013. His efforts included a 21-hour filibuster, or long speech, on the Senate floor.

Cruz's campaign is looking to raise $40 million to $50 million for the primary race. The campaign is also buying online advertising early so it can give Cruz greater name recognition before primary votes.

## Campaigns And Free Speech

He has talked about raising money from average people, and getting donations from the wealthier donors who supported him in Congress.

Cruz supports fewer restrictions on campaign spending. "Money absolutely can be speech," he said last week in New Hampshire, referring to a U.S. Supreme Court decision. In the decision, the court said the government cannot ban businesses or other organizations from donating to elections because it would violate the right to free speech as outlined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Cruz lives in Houston with his wife and two young daughters. His wife, Heidi, works for a large bank called Goldman Sachs. She will take a temporary leave from her job to campaign with her husband.
