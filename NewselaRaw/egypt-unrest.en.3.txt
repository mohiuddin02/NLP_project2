CAIRO â€” Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians protested in villages and cities on Sunday against Egypt's president. Some fear a revolution may break out and hurt the country's young democracy.

Protesters angry at President Mohamed Morsi filled streets and squares, yelling "Leave, leave." Morsi's supporters also gathered to stand up for their president. The dueling rallies were a sign that Egypt is growing more and more divided.

President Morsi is in the Muslim Brotherhood party. The Brotherhood pushes for the Muslim religion to play a greater role in Egyptian law and society.

There were reports of violence at some of the protests. Fireworks and lasers lighted the Sunday night sky. About 500 young men set on fire the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters oin Cairo. Four people were killed in clashes in Upper Egypt. Three of them outside a Brotherhood office in Assiut. More than 220 were injured nationwide.

A group of young people have collected more than 22 million signatures on petitions. They called for Morsi to step aside for early elections. The president and the Brotherhood have refused. The military has sent out troops to protect government buildings and the Suez Canal, an important waterway for shipping.

## Will The Military Take Over?

The size of the protests was called a big rejection of Morsi. Some wonder if his presidency can survive. And if more violence erupts, some fear the military will take control of the government.

Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi commands the Egyptian military. So far, he has so far sided with the president. He has not given any signs that the military plans to take over. But Sisi has said he will not allow the country to go into a "dark tunnel."

Two years ago, Egyptians pushed out President Hosni Mubarak with huge protests. Mubarak was a dictator who ruled the country for 30 years. After he was thrown out of power, the army ruled for a short while the country prepared for an election. Exactly one year ago, Morsi became president after he won the election.

But the public mood has changed over the last year. Thousands of protesters cheered and waved flags at army helicopters flying overhead. Many people took it as a sign that Egyptians would support the army taking over from Morsi.

"When the military was in control, things were better. Now we have power cuts, no fuel, and everything's going bad," said Mohammad Khaled, a 19-year-old electrician. "Morsi promised he would fix many problems in his first 100 days but did nothing. ... If he's not able to handle it, then he should let someone else do the work.

He added, "We succeeded in removing Mubarak, who was here for 30 years. You don't think we can remove Morsi, who has only been here for a year? We've been preparing for this day for over two months, and I will stay until he says, 'I'm stepping down.'"

## Fears Of A Clash

The protesters tried to recreate the mood that helped push out Mubarak. They swept across streets. They gathered at the presidential palace. There they raised national flags and flew banners with the images of those killed in the protests.

Morsi's supporters said the protesters were hurting the country by trying to drive out its first freely elected leader.

The battle for Egypt lies between the two groups.

The rallies Sunday were largely peaceful. At times strangers acted kindly. People poured water off their balconies in Tahrir Square to cool protesters sweating in the summer heat. There were also moments of stillness, like when people prayed in silence with their heads pressed to the ground.

But there are fears the two sides might clash. At least six people have been killed. Much of the violence happened when anti-Morsi forces attacked Muslim Brotherhood offices. And the police have not protected Brotherhood headquarters. People saw it as a sign the police do not support Morsi.

## "We Need Someone Who Is Good"

In a speech to the nation last week, Morsi admitted mistakes during his first year in office. But he spent much of his time blaming other people. He said the opposition, friends of Mubarak and journalists were to blame.

His comments didn't calm a tense poor and working class. They have lived through months of rising prices, power shortages and gas lines. Tourism workers joined marchers in the ancient city of Luxor to protest a steep slide in visitors.

"I live in a room with a hallway, that's all I have," Khadiga Ibrahim said from her wheelchair in Tahrir. She cannot afford knee surgery. "I want an apartment. What did Morsi do for us? For the poor? God curse him. I don't want Morsi. I want God's justice. We need someone who is good ... someone who cares about us."
