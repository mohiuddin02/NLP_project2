FERGUSON, Mo. â€” A grand jury has decided not to indict, or charge, a Ferguson police officer with a crime in the shooting death of Michael Brown.

Brown was an unarmed, black 18-year-old. His shooting by officer Darren Wilson sparked weeks of sometimes violent protests.

## Anger Erupts

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced the decision Monday evening. A grand jury of nine white members and three black members had been meeting weekly since August to consider evidence. A grand jury is a group of citizens chosen to decide if a person should be charged with a crime. The group met for 70 hours and heard from 60 witnesses.

McCulloch stressed that the grand jurors were "the only people who heard every witness ... and every piece of evidence." He said many witnesses said things that in the end did not match the physical evidence.

"These grand jurors poured their hearts and soul into this process," he said.

As McCulloch was reading his statement, a crowd gathered around a car from which it was being broadcast on a stereo. When the decision was announced, Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, burst into tears and began screaming before being whisked away by supporters.

The crowd erupted in anger, moving toward the barrier where police in riot gear were standing. They pushed down the barrier and began pelting police with items. Police stood their ground.

## "Channel Your Frustration"

At least nine votes would have been required to indict Wilson, who is white. The panel met in secret, a standard practice for a grand jury.

Brown's family released a statement saying they were "profoundly disappointed" in the decision. They also asked that the public "channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change. We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen."

U.S. investigators are separately looking into possible civil rights violations that could result in federal charges. Federal investigators also launched a broad investigation into the Ferguson Police Department. It is looking for patterns of discrimination.

The shooting happened on Aug. 9 in the mostly black St. Louis suburb that is patrolled by an overwhelmingly white police force. As Brown's body lay for hours in the center of a street, an angry crowd of onlookers gathered. Rioting and looting occurred the following night. Police responded with armored vehicles and tear gas.

Protests continued for weeks. They were often peaceful, but sometimes turned violent. Demonstrators sometimes threw rocks and handmade explosives and police fired smoke canisters, tear gas and rubber bullets. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon briefly called in the National Guard.

In a parking lot near the apartment building where Brown lived, about 60 other people gathered to listen to McCulloch's statement over car stereos, then scattered immediately after the announcement. Some drove off. Others shouted that they should go to the police department.

Hours before the decision was made public, Nixon urged people to remain peaceful.
