WASHINGTON — There is work to be done at many of America's national parks. The work is not glamorous, but it is expensive. Overdue repairs will cost an estimated $11.5 billion.

Yosemite National Park is among those that need some serious repairs. Located in central California, it is famous for its steep granite cliffs, waterfalls, and biodiversity — it has more than 250 species of birds and 80 species of mammals, including black bears, coyotes and mountain lions.

The park needs several types of repairs. Some of the sewer lines at Yosemite need to be updated. One of the park's campgrounds needs a new drain for its septic waste system. The famous Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoia trees needs to be rehabilitated.

## It's The Government's Responsibility

National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis spoke to a group of lawmakers recently. He met with Congress to discuss how much funding the National Park Service will receive.

Jarvis argued that the government should provide the money needed to fix up national parks. He called it "a federal responsibility."

Another park that needs work is Sequoia National Park. It is to the south of Yosemite, and is home to some of the tallest trees on Earth. The park needs to improve the water treatment at one of its campgrounds. Meanwhile, Lassen Volcanic National Park, to the north of Yosemite, could use a new headquarters for its utility system. The utility system handles the park's electricity, water, wastewater, gas and telecommunications.

## Parks Need A Bigger Allowance

The Obama administration has suggested that the National Park Service be given $3 billion next year. Jarvis acknowledged that the price is high, but argued it is necessary, saying the amount of work that needs to be done is "overwhelming."

Jarvis also discussed buying additional land for new national parks. Because funds are limited, however, not all lawmakers are likely to agree. In the end, the government may have to make difficult choices about what to spend money on.

At the hearing, Jarvis was asked whether repairs were more important than buying new land. He said that if it could only do one, the National Park Service would choose to repair its parks. However, he argued that developing new parks is important as well.

## Money Disagreements

Republican members of Congress have frequently clashed with President Obama over what they see as too much government spending. They have indicated that they do not want to spend money on new parks. Tom McClintock, a Republican congressman from California, is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Federal Lands. Yosemite is part of the district he represents.

"Shouldn't we be taking care of the property we already have instead of acquiring additional property?" he asked at the hearing. Congressman Doug LaMalfa, another California Republican, voiced his own "grave concerns" about the park service's request for money to buy more land. He represents the sprawling Sacramento Valley district that includes the 106,372-acre Lassen park.

The new land that the National Parks Service would like to buy is in Colorado and Hawaii, among other states.

## Other Suggestions

McClintock and other Republicans used the House Subcommittee on Federal Lands hearing as an opportunity to make their own suggestions.

Rather than buy land to create more parks, McClintock suggested developing current parks. He suggested setting aside money for bicycling, horseback riding and ice skating in the national parks.

"At Yosemite, there is a continuing effort to try to reduce or remove those activities," McClintock said. He argued that this sends "a wrong message to the public."
