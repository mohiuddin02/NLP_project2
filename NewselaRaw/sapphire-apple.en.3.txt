CUPERTINO, Calif. —  Apple is putting a lot of money into sapphire. The company isn't buying up the precious gem. Instead, it just signed a $578 million deal with another tech company to make artificial sapphire crystals. Experts think that man-made sapphire will soon be used in Apple touch-screens.

Just like the real thing, man-made sapphire is almost impossible to scratch. It also senses the touch of fingers very well. These two features are important in touch-screens.

As usual, Apple has kept its plans to itself. However, it is known that Apple has invented many uses for the man-made sapphire crystals. Its partner in the man-made sapphire business, GT Advanced Technologies, will eventually produce more sapphire than the rest of the world combined, said Eric Virey. He is with the researcher Yole Développement.

## Sapphire Has Many Uses

Sapphire is one of the hardest minerals in the world after diamond. By using sapphire, Apple could give iPhone users a much tougher touch-screen. Experts say sapphire is harder than glass. It also responds better to the touch. The material may help Apple enter new businesses such as online shopping, gaming and medicine.

"It opens up a lot of doors for Apple," said Matt Margolis. He is a tech industry expert.

Apple's models already contain some sapphire. Sapphire protects the camera lens and the fingerprint scanner. With more sapphire, experts think Apple will use it to make screens for its next iPhone and perhaps a smartwatch. Apple is expected to announce its next-generation iPhone next week. Apple and GT will not talk about their plans.

It's a lot of money, even for Apple. Sapphire costs much more than the glass Apple now uses for its screens. Smartphone makers are extremely competitive. They need to take chances, Virey said.

## It's Tough, But Expensive

The screen, Virey said, remains one of the main ways for a smartphone to stand out.

Smartphone screens need to be hard and transparent. Sapphire, which is clear in its pure form, is a top choice, said Andrew Hsu. He works at Synaptics, which develops touch-screens.

"Other than the fact that it's expensive, it's pretty much a better material than glass," he said.

Apple has been using Gorilla Glass in its iPhones. A screen made of sapphire would likely be tougher to scratch or crack than Gorilla Glass. Sapphire's hardness could be a strong selling point with customers. Nearly one out of 10 iPhone users have a device with a cracked screen, says SquareTrade. The company sells insurance for electronic devices.

But sapphire has a softer side. A sapphire touch-screen can better sense the touch of a finger, experts say. Touch-screens are able to recognize the movements of a user's finger. GT claims that sapphire performed much better than Gorilla Glass in touch testing.

With a sapphire screen, a device might be able to sense fingerprints across the entire display. Users could save the prints of several of their fingers. They could also sign their signature more easily on their smartphone screens, Margolis said.

## Everyone Wants Slimmer Phones

A more responsive screen also would make gaming more fun.

A sapphire screen could improve the experience of "gaming, typing and playing instruments in apps like Garage Band," says Carolina Milanesi, a technology expert.

Sapphire could also help preschoolers use Apple devices more easily. Many young children love technology. Yet, touch-screens made of glass don't always respond to their little fingers, Hsu said.

What's more, sapphire is denser than glass. That means Apple may be able to use a thinner layer to shield its devices, Hsu said. With slim phones in fashion, that is important, he noted.

"Everyone's looking at ways to save tenths of millimeters," Hsu said.

Experts say smartphone makers will be watching Apple as they think about using sapphire in their own phones. Of course, if other smartphone makers start using sapphire, Apple would have to find a new way to wow customers. Could a diamond screen be next?

"I wouldn't rule that out," Hsu said, laughing.
