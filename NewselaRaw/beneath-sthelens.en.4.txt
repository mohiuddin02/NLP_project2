TACOMA, Wash. â€” On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens erupted. Ever since, scientists have been tracking the volcano's explosive energy. The goal: to better understand how Washington's most active volcano works.

This summer, the scientists will be the ones setting off the explosions.

Scientists will set off explosions in two dozen wells. The 80-foot deep holes have been drilled around the mountain. Volunteers traveling by car, on foot and on horseback will place 2,600 small seismometers near the mountain. The seismometers will record the seismic energy of the explosions.

The goal is to understand how molten rock, or magma, makes its way to St. Helens' crater. About 60 miles beneath the surface are large plates. These tectonic plates shift slowly. Magma is created in the same place. Sometimes the plates hit each other and cause earthquakes. If an earthquake happens below a volcano, hot magma can bubble up.

## Mystery Of Moving Magma

Scientists don't know much about volcanoes, said Seth Moran, an expert with the Cascade Volcano Observatory in Washington. The new experiments "should make things quite a bit clearer."

The explosive experiments are scheduled for this summer. They're one of several experiments that are part of iMUSH, or "Imaging Magma Under St. Helens." It is one of the largest volcano experiments ever.

The project involves scientists from several universities.

In addition to the explosive testing, scientists are measuring seismic activity that occurs naturally. Special sensors will measure it. Scientists will also examine the magnetic and electrical properties of rock deep beneath the volcano. It could help find magma.

The goal is to understand what's deep below St. Helens. Miles down is the area where a tectonic plate from the Pacific is forced under the North American plate. When this happens it can produce earthquakes as the plates slip or break.

Magma then bubbles to the surface in volcanoes. Exactly how that happens is a mystery.

## What's Going On Down There?

Scientists understand what's beneath the volcano down to about 6 miles, Moran said. No one is exactly sure what's going on any deeper.

Does the magma form a pool near the crust? Does it make its way upward in a single, narrow pipe-like passage? Or does it collect in underground ponds?

Finding answers is important, scientists say. They hope it will let them better understand when magma is moving. That knowledge, they say, will help them predict when volcanoes around the world might erupt. It might save thousands of lives.

Scientists have studied volcanoes in different ways. All of them have their own problems, Moran says. This time they'll use several approaches, he said.

Moran and other scientists discovered last month that St. Helens remains active. An eruption is not near, however. Yet, magma is slowly building up beneath the mountain.

Steve Malone is a professor and 24 years ago helped predict that St. Helens would erupt. He is involved in the iMush studies.

Thanks to Malone and others, scientists were able to roughly predict when the eruption would happen. They saved many lives.

Still, 57 people died in the eruption. About 150 square miles of southwestern Washington were ruined. The volcano launched a cloud into the atmosphere.

## "Right Under Our Feet"

Malone and other scientists are designing 70 seismic stations. They would be placed up to 30 miles from the mountain to measure natural seismicity.

The 2,600 smaller seismometers will be used in the explosive testing.

Putting seismometers close to the volcano will be difficult. The land nearby has no roads.

An "army of volunteers," will be needed, said Carolyn Driedger. She's a scientist at the Cascades Volcano Observatory.

The involvement of people in the project is valuable, Driedger said.

"Here in the Pacific Northwest we are literally living on the edge," she said. "We have land being shoved beneath us, right under our feet. We have magma being formed right now. We have rocks that are crunching together that will eventually slip and create earthquakes."

She added, "Getting people out there helps them to recognize that these changes are happening."
