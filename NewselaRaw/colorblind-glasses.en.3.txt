WICHITA, Kan. — Seth Ogden is 8 years old. When he was younger, his grandma asked him about the roses in her backyard.

At first Seth could not see any roses. He thought his grandma was playing a trick. "Once I got closer, I could see the roses," Seth said.

Seth is colorblind. He has trouble seeing the difference between certain colors. Kids like Seth are usually born with colorblindness. It is passed down from their families.  

Sometimes Seth mismatches clothes or confuses soccer jerseys. His mom worries that he has never liked doing art because he is colorblind. 

## Company Held A Contest

Seth and his mom, Heidi, live in Wichita, Kansas. Not long ago they made a YouTube video for a contest. It was put on by a company called EnChroma that creates glasses to help people see color. 

People like Seth can see between 10,000 and 100,000 basic colors. But people who are not colorblind can make out 1 million colors. The world does not appear gray to Seth, but when colors are close together he struggles to tell the difference.

After Seth won the contest, EnChroma sent him a free pair of its color-correcting glasses. They usually cost hundreds of dollars.

Earlier this month, he tried them on for the first time. 

"Whoa," he said, with his parents looking on. The sun shimmered through tree branches that had lost their leaves for the winter. Everything looked golden.

## "The Sky Looks A Lot Different"

Seth and his mom first heard about the glasses by watching YouTube videos. Some of the videos have thousands of views. A lot of the men in the videos wore the glasses and looked at beautiful places in nature. They were shocked to see certain colors for the first time. 

His parents asked if the greens looked greener. "A little bit," Seth said. "The sky looks a lot different." 

Seth walked over to a bush behind his house. Seth was excited to see berries on it that he'd never seen before.

Seth walked around his backyard. He looked at grass and leaves, bird feeders and plant pots. He picked up a dead leaf and saw speckles of red that he had not seen before. Before, the dried leaves on the trees had looked like clumps but now they looked much clearer, he said.

## A Little Darker With Sunglasses

His mom asked him whether he could see one color or another. Often he said he could, though not always. Seth said that orange looked much brighter with the glasses on. His mom laughed and reminded him that the sunglasses make everything look a little darker.

"What color is the umbrella?" his parents asked.

"It's green, kind of a dark green," Seth said.

"What color does it look without the glasses?" they asked again.

"It still looks green," Seth said. He decided that he is just better at seeing green than red, whether the glasses were on or not.

## Fun Seeing Colors For The First Time

Seth's grandpa is also colorblind. He was not impressed by the glasses. "I've been colorblind my whole life," he said.

Seth said the glasses helped him see the difference between colors. However, the colors didn't "show out" as much as he had expected.

"Does it make you wish you weren't colorblind in the first place?" his parents asked.

No, he said, wearing the glasses was more fun. Regular kids had always seen color and would never get to see colors for the first time like he did.
