NEWARK, Del. â€” Two years ago, a team of researchers traveled to Africa to search for chickens. They weren't, however, looking for hens that laid delicious eggs.

They were seeking birds that could survive a hotter planet.

Around the country, food scientists are racing to develop new breeds of farm animals that can stand up to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global warming).

Some climate change activists dismiss their work, which is just getting under way. They consider it a distraction to the real problem. They also say it gives in to factory farms, which they blame for making the world's environmental problems worse. The scientists, though, say new breeds of farm animals that can resist heat will be essential to feeding the world.

## Looking For A New Direction

The experiments reflect a shift in the federal government's response to climate change. Efforts to slow global warming aren't going as well as hoped. So the government is looking for ways to make sure that key industries, like food production, won't suffer from a warmer Earth.

In agriculture, "we are dealing with the challenge of difficult weather conditions at the same time we have to massively increase food production,"  said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Larger populations will mean a need for more meat.

At the University of Delaware, Carl Schmidt and other researchers are trying to map the genetic code of a bizarre-looking African naked-neck chicken. They hope the chicken's ability to withstand heat can be bred into U.S. fowl.

"The game is changing since the climate is changing," Schmidt said. "We have to start now to anticipate what changes we have to make in order to feed 9 billion people."

## Animals React To Heat

Warmer temperatures can create huge problems for animals farmed for food. Turkeys are at risk for a condition that makes their meat mushy. Heat also helps disease to rip through chicken coops. Bad weather can kill entire cattle herds.

"It's a big problem when it happens," said Gale Strasburg. He is a professor of food science and human nutrition at Michigan State University. His goal is to develop stronger turkeys. Right now, within a day or two after a heat wave hits, 40 percent of turkeys will be suffering from the heat.

"If we start seeing a lot more shifts in summer temperature extremes, there is going to be more of this," he said.

Strasburg is turning up the heat lamps on hundreds of turkey chicks and eggs. He then tries to figure out which genes could help the animals endure hotter environments.

"The reality we deal with is that worldwide the demand is growing for meat," he said. There will be more pressure to produce farm animals that can be raised without using so many resources.

## Many Questions Still Unanswered

Some well-known climate experts, however, question the federal government's emphasis on the growing demand for meat. Raising animals uses many resources. So the only way to reduce greenhouse gases may be to encourage people to eat less meat, they say. Scientists are just about certain that global warming is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gasses. Greenhouses gasses are created by burning fossil fuels, like oil and coal, and cutting down trees.

"There's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people," Bill Gates wrote recently on his blog. Gates, the founder of Microsoft, supports technology that uses pea proteins to create beef and chicken that look like the real thing. In the year 2050, it's estimated there will be 9 billion people on Earth. Right now, there are about 7 billion.

The food scientists argue that they, too, are focused on using fewer resources.

Megan Rolf is a scientist at Oklahoma State University. She is trying to develop cattle that need less water and feed.

Picky eaters complicate her work.

The Brahman breed of cattle, for example, does well in hot, harsh conditions. But it doesn't taste good. Rolf's goal is to create a steer as hardy as a Brahman and as tasty as an Angus, a cattle breed known for delicious meat.

## Let's Look At The Chicken Again

Back in Delaware, Schmidt pulled up an image of the African bird. He pointed to the lack of feathers on its bare neck. Its naked neck helps keep it cool.

"What the industry really wants is that in a meat producer," he said.

He then pulled out a climate map of the United States. The map is marked with yellow dots where the temperature spikes above 100 degrees Fahrenheit more than 10 days a year.

Scientists say the Earth will warm an average of 2 degrees. But that's not what Schmidt is focused on. "It's the increased number and duration of heat waves. The issue is helping these chickens or any animals survive in a state of increased heat."

A few buildings away, students delicately drop chicken blood into test tubes to map the chickens' genes. Schmidt predicts that heat resistant chickens will start being produced in large numbers in about 15 years.

But Schmidt says his work can be most helpful in increasing the survival of chickens in poverty-stricken areas of Africa and South America.

If the developing world doesn't have enough food, he said, "that affects everybody."
