It can be hard to hear what someone is saying when it is noisy. Some students find it hard to listen to a teacher talking when there is a lot of noise in a classroom. It is not a problem for everyone, though.

Preschool children who do not mind noise might be better at reading later in life. A new study looked at how children's brains change when background noise interrupted them while they were watching TV.

Scientists studied the brains of young children. Some were only 3 years old.

## Some Sounds Are Harder Than Others

Some sounds, like consonants, are hard to hear in a noisy place. D, B, T and Z sounds can be hard. Scientists think children who can hear the sound of consonants in a noisy place will be better readers than those who cannot. Letters like A, E, I, O or U are easier. They are known as vowels. People often say vowels louder and longer. It makes them easier to hear.

Nina Kraus is the scientist leading the study. She says the early years in a child's life are a very important time for learning to read.

Children must first understand how sound and meaning go together. For example, preschoolers who can match sounds to letters earlier learn how to read more quickly.

Some children are slow to learn the difference between a D' and a B sound. It can make learning words and putting together sentences hard.

Kraus says it is hard for the brain to hear someone's voice when it is noisy. It is one of the hardest things we ask our brain to do, she says.

## Machine Shows How Brain Reacts

The new study used a machine called an EEG. It can tell how the brain reacts to different sounds.

The children wore a special hat that records what their brain is doing. It was attached to the EEG. Then they sat down to watch a video. They listened to the soundtrack of the video in one ear. In the other ear they had an earpiece. It played the sound "dah" and sounds of people talking. The EEG measured how the brain reacted to the noise.

The scientists learned a lot from the EEG information. It helped them to guess how children would do on early literacy tests. The EEG information also helped them make new tests. The new experiments looked at children of different ages.

The new test was first tried on 3-year-olds. It showed how well they could learn new skills that lead to learning languages. The test also showed how the children could perform a year later. It is still too early to know how well these children will read someday.

## Listening Helps Improve Reading

The scientists tested older children, too. Their EEG scores matched their current reading levels in school. The test even spotted some children who had been known to have learning difficulties.

Listening to people speak is important for young children. The more time they spend listening the better they will be at reading.

In the future Kraus hopes to test even younger children. She even hopes the test will one day be used on babies.
