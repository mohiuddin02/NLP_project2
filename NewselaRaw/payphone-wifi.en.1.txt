NEW YORK, N.Y. — A 9-foot-tall, narrow structure was installed recently on a Manhattan sidewalk. It signals a plan to turn old style payphones into what is billed as the world's biggest and fastest municipal Wi-Fi network.

The first of at least 7,500 planned hot spots are due to go online early this year. They promise super fast and free Wi-Fi service, new street phones with free calling, ports to charge personal phones and extra money for the city earned through advertising at the hot spots.

## Renewed Interest In Public Wi-Fi

Some cities nationwide are renewing pushes for public Wi-Fi after an earlier wave of enthusiasm faded. New York officials say their project is democratizing data access while modernizing outmoded street phones.

For now, the first hot spot is still being tested and sits under a gray cover. Still, some passers-by like the sound of what is in store.

"It's always helpful" to have Wi-Fi to reduce the bite that apps and Web-surfing take out of cellular data service, Jack Thomas said while texting near the nonworking kiosk. Data usage is also capped in many people's cellphone plans.

Others, however, are worried about New Yorkers using their devices on a public network as they stroll down the street. The city has said data will be encrypted and any information used for advertising will mask the identity of the users.

"I think it makes us all more vulnerable to wrongdoers," Bee Mosca said as she eyed the future hot spot.

## City's Projected Financial Windfall

Payphones might seem like telecom relics now that 68 percent of Americans own smartphones, according to the Pew Research Center on Internet, Science & Technology. About 8,200 payphones still dot New York streets.

Some were pressed into service amid outages after Superstorm Sandy in 2012, but their numbers and usage have declined overall. Thirty-seven percent of those inspected last year did not work.

The city experimented with providing Wi-Fi from a few payphones in 2012. Afterward, it hatched the current, eight-year "LinkNYC" plan.

A group of companies, including wireless technology company Qualcomm Inc., is to pay the estimated $200 million installation cost. In return, the groups will take half the revenue earned from the kiosks' digital advertising, projected at $1 billion over 12 years. The city gets the other half, more than doubling the $17 million a year it currently gets from payphones.

## Service Faster Than A Speeding Bullet

Each hot spot covers about a 150-foot radius with what is pledged as service some 20 times the speed of average home Internet service. Officials have said the service is intended for outdoor use, and it is not clear whether it might extend inside some businesses and homes.

Many Americans now carry Internet connectivity in their pockets. Still, the network "can be a win for users who can save on their data plans, and it can be a win for (cellular) networks" if they are really overused, said Erik Stallman, a lawyer for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a group that advocates for Internet liberties and access.

Tourists without local cellular service also could benefit, noted John Breyault, a National Consumers League vice president.

## Opponents Weigh In

LinkNYC is not without opponents. A payphone company has sued the city, saying it created a monopoly, or unfair business, where only the new group can offer the Wi-Fi service. The city has said it believes the arrangement is legal.

Many U.S. cities strove to cover themselves in Wi-Fi in the early 2000s. A number of the plans stalled as home access increased, usage and ad revenue disappointed.  Some Internet service providers also complained the city networks were unfair competitors to their service.

Yet some cities have recently recast and reinvigorated their efforts. Boston is working to expand a "Wicked Free WiFi" network with more than 170 hot spots, and Los Angeles is encouraging companies to provide free basic wireless to all homes and businesses, with outdoor coverage as a goal.

Still, some question whether it is wise for city governments to get into offering Wi-Fi, rather than leaving it to businesses.

But "New York is not a typical city," Jeff Kagan, a telecommunications analyst and consultant to businesses, said.
