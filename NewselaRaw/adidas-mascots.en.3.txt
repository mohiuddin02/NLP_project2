Some schools name their sports teams after Native Americans. It is upsetting to many Native Americans. On Thursday, Adidas offered to help high schools change their mascots.

Adidas will work with schools to design new team mascots and logos. The shoe and clothing company will also help to pay for the change. New uniforms, mascots and signs can be expensive for schools. A mascot is usually a person or animal. It represents a group or school, and many people think it brings good luck. Most sports teams have a mascot.

The White House Tribal Nations Conference took place on Thursday. It is a meeting between tribal leaders and government officials. Some Adidas officials also attended.

Adidas said it will help start a new group. It will deal with the problem of Native American mascots in sports. The first people who lived in the Americas were the Native Americans.

## Showing Respect To All

Change the Mascot is a group that wants schools to stop using Native American mascots. About 2,000 American schools have them, the group said. About a dozen of the schools decided to pick new mascots in the last two years. Another 20 are thinking about it.

Eric Liedtke, who works for Adidas, attended the Tribal Nations conference. Sports must include everyone, he said.

Liedtke said that many schools want to do what is right. Teachers and students want to make a difference in their lives and in the world. Adidas wants to make it easier for them, he said.

He said the new school mascots will respect all American athletes.

Each school could decide if it wants to be part of the program.

## NFL Team Will Not Change Name

Native American groups and others have grown upset over the mascots. They have repeatedly asked the Washington Redskins football team to change its name and mascot. Redskins is an old word for Native Americans, who feel that it is unkind. The football team has refused to change its name.

In 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) told colleges to stop using Native American mascots. The group is in charge of college sports. It said the colleges could be punished if they did not obey. Some colleges were able to keep their names, though. They received permission from tribes.

States also have taken action against the mascots. Last month California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law. It prevents high schools from using the name "Redskins."

In 2012, Oregon ordered high schools to stop using Native American mascots. If they did not, they could lose some money from the state. Public schools get money from state governments. The schools have until 2017 to obey.

## Native American Groups Praise Adidas

Jackie Pata is with Change the Mascot. She is also the head of the National Congress of American Indians. Both Pata and Ray Halbritter were happy with Adidas' program. Halrbitter is an official with the Oneida Nation, which is a Native American tribe.

They hope other companies will follow Adidas.

"Businesses cannot sit on the sideline on this issue," Pata and Halbritter said. "They must choose which side they are on."

Adidas chose to respect and include everyone. The company "has set an example for others to follow," they said.
