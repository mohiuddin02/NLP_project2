Imagine a squid or a fish swimming in the ocean of another planet. What would these sea animals swim like? A new study says they would probably move a lot like they do on Earth.

The study looked at the way different sea animals move through water. Scientists found that their swim strokes have the same pattern. The scientists believe this happens because of evolution. They think two different species might grow and change because of their environment. If they have similar environments, they will change in similar ways.

There are different kinds of swimmers. For example, the bony cuttlefish is very different from the squid, but they swim in similar ways. The study could also help engineers build better swimming robots.

## Knifefish Makes Waves

A team of scientists was studying the black ghost knifefish. The black ghost knifefish lives in streams in South America. It has a fin that runs along most of its body. It swims by moving the fin under its body like a wave.

The knifefish moves differently than fish like trout or salmon. Trout sweep their tail and the back part of their bodies back and forth. The knifefish moves by creating a wave that moves down its one thin fin.

The scientists began to wonder about the rules of movement for fish.

Sea creatures who move like the fish are called fin swimmers. Some creatures have one fin like the black ghost knifefish. Their fin runs along the length of their bodies. Other animals have a pair of fins. They have one on each side.

## Different Fish, Same Swim Rules

The scientists studied the way the knifefish moved. Two waves moved along the length of its fin. The waves allowed the fish to move forward fast. The scientists wanted to find out if there was a common rule of movement for different animals.

They studied 22 sea animals with fins. The fish were all very different from each other.

The scientists wanted to find what was the same among the fish.

They found that all the animals follow the same rules when they swim. Every full back-and-forth wave of the fish's fin was 20 times as long as the wiggle was wide. The scientists studied skates and rays. They looked at black ghost knifefish and the cuttlefish. That fraction remained the same. It was always 20 to 1.

## Maybe Robots Will Swim Like Fish

This way of moving has shown up over and over again in different animals for thousands of years. The scientists think this is because this method works best. It lets sea creatures swim faster and better.

If alien fish were found on another planet, they would move in similar ways, said Malcolm MacIver. He is a scientist at Northwestern University. He wrote the study with another scientist.

The study could help scientists build underwater robots. They hope to make robots move more like fish.
