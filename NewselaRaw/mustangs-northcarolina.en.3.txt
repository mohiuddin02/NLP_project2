COROLLA, N.C. â€” Retired police officer E.T. Smith patrols the beach in Corolla, North Carolina. He is keeping an eye out for anyone who might be bothering the wild horses that live along the shore.

These wild horses are known as mustangs. Nobody knows exactly how they first came to the island of Corolla.

About 500 years ago, ships sailed from Spain to North America. Experts think those ships got stuck in shallow water near North Carolina. They believe the horses on those ships were able to swim to the shore.

The Corolla mustangs have survived centuries of storms and hurricanes in this area on their own. Now they have new problems.

## Nowhere To Go

The mustangs attract many visitors, but all that attention makes life difficult for the animals. Some people try to play with the wild horses or even hurt them. Others build huge vacation homes that crowd the beach where the horses live.

The mustangs have nowhere else to go. There is water all around their home, so they cannot leave the island to find a more peaceful place to live.

Living on an island also keeps the mustangs from being able to mix with horses in other areas. This hurts the size and health of the herd.

Animals do not usually mate with other animals that are closely related to them. When they do, their babies are often born with disabilities.

Over the years, the wild horses in Corolla have become very closely related. Now their babies, called foals, are starting to have serious problems.

Last year, one foal was born with so many broken places in its legs that veterinarians could not save it. Another foal could only walk on the very tips of his hooves. This time, veterinarians were able to help.

## The Herd Needs More Horses

The Corolla mustangs are some of the only wild horses left on the East Coast. A group of volunteers wants to make sure their herd has strong, healthy babies. They want the mustangs to have plenty of room to run free.

These horse lovers need more support from the government. Some leaders took a vote and decided to let the volunteers bring more outside horses to Corolla. This will help the mustangs have healthier babies.

Right now, there are 101 horses in the mustang herd. The volunteers plan to bring several wild horses from another island near North Carolina. Their goal is for the herd to increase to 130 horses. They know this won't fix all of the herd's problems, but they believe it is a good start.

## There Needs To Be A Solution

But other horses might not be allowed in. The problem is that at least some horses cross into the island's Currituck National Wildlife Refuge. Although the most sensitive parts are fenced off, there are other animals there. There are flocks of endangered birds that migrate to the area and nesting sea turtles also live there. The government calls the horses a "nuisance" to the other animals.

Pressure is growing for a solution. Refuge manager David Viker tried to calm people down in a recent interview. Viker said they were working with a scientist who studies horses on a new study to help the horses have fewer disabilities. Viker also wants to find out how many horses could live in the refuge.

The Corolla herd is "such an important icon in that part of the world," Viker said.
