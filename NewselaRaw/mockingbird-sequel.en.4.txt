NEW YORK — Harper Lee published "To Kill a Mockingbird" in 1960. It became one of the best-loved books of all time. More than 40 million copies have been sold worldwide. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961.

In "To Kill a Mockingbird" we meet Atticus Finch, a brave lawyer, and his young children, Scout and Jem. We are also introduced to a mysterious neighborhood boy named Boo Radley.

"To Kill a Mockingbird" was Harper Lee's only book — until now. She announced this week that she has a new book. It will feature some of the same characters as "Mockingbird."

The new book is called "Go Set a Watchman." Many people are excited for it. The publisher is planning to print at least 2 million copies.

## Lost And Found

Even though "Go Set a Watchman" is being published this summer, Harper Lee wrote it in the 1950s. In fact, she wrote it before "To Kill a Mockingbird."

In "Go Set a Watchman," Scout Finch is an adult who lives in New York. She is returning to her hometown in Alabama to visit her father, Atticus.

Like "To Kill a Mockingbird," Harper Lee's other novel is partly based on the author's own life. Lee is from Monroeville, Alabama. She lived in New York in the 1950s. She now lives back in her hometown. Her father was a lawyer.

Harper Lee said she did not know her first novel, "Go Set a Watchman," had survived all these years. She said she was "surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it."

Lee showed the newly discovered novel to some trusted friends. They encouraged her to publish it.

"I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years," she said.

## "Mockingbird" Set The Stage

"Mockingbird" is set in the Great Depression of the 1930s. "Watchman" takes place in the mid-1950s. At that time, the civil rights movement was fighting for the rights of African-Americans.

In 1953, the Supreme Court said that separate schools for black and white children were not allowed. In 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for not giving up her bus seat to a white passenger. That led to a boycott of the bus system. During the boycott, people did not ride the bus. The laws were changed after the yearlong boycott.

## No Big Book Tour

Harper Lee has rarely spoken to the media since the 1960s. At that time, she told one reporter she wanted "to leave some record of small-town, middle-class Southern life."

Her publisher said she probably will not talk to the media about this book. She is a private person.

Lee has said she prefers real, paper books to e-books. Still, she allowed "To Kill a Mockingbird" to come out as an e-book. Her new book will also be available as an e-book.
