FLINT, Mich. — Ariana Hawk heated a bowl of bottled water in the microwave. She dipped a washcloth in the water and then wiped her 2-year-old son's itchy, irritated skin.

Hawk said she has been cleaning Sincere Smith's body this way — or with wet wipes — since last summer. The boy's doctor doesn't want him bathing in the tap water at their Flint home.

"I can't afford to go buy 20 gallons of water just to bathe him one time," said Hawk. She is a single mother of three.

Sincere has rough patches on his legs, arms and face, she explained. His skin condition started with a rash on his stomach after Flint switched its water supply in April 2014\. The city used to use water from Lake Huron, but changed to the more polluted Flint River to save money.

Hawk blames the water for her child's suffering and plans to sue.

"We get treated like … we don't matter," she said. "That's how it's been feeling."

## Betrayal, Worry, Anger

Residents across Flint also feel frustrated. Some of then stopped using the water immediately after the cost-saving change because of its smell, color, taste and source. Others continued to drink and cook with it.

People, pets, even plants have been affected by the poisonous water, residents say.

Community members feel betrayed, worried, angry, sad and stressed. The city has a population of 99,000, and 4 out of 10 residents live in poverty.

Flint River water is contaminated with lead. The city has seen a spike in the levels of lead in children's blood. Lead poisoning, experts say, affects intelligence and has lifelong impact. It can cause learning disabilities, speech and language problems and behavioral problems.

Kids absorb lead more easily than adults.

## Battling Effects Of Lead Poisoning

To limit the effect of lead poisoning in children, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a doctor at Hurley Children's Hospital, made several suggestions. Children should eat well, get good health care and participate in early education programs.

Pamela Battle, whose seven children range in age from 1 to 16, said she got a water filter Monday. Before that, she was using water from her faucet to cook and make up bottles for her two youngest children.

"We were drinking it regularly," said Battle. "The whole family."

She went to Freeman Elementary School last Tuesday with her kids to get their blood checked for lead. She learned about lead poisoning and its effects on children.

"I'm really concerned now," she said.

"I love my kids," Battle said. "I want them to grow up like I grew up" with no worries about water.

## Working To Make Amends

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency Jan. 5\. He said that the state has not done enough to ease the crisis and that "more work needs to be done with more urgency."

The state has worked to get free bottled water, filtering supplies and water-testing kits to Flint residents. Members of the Michigan National Guard have been sent to Flint to help distribute the water.

On Saturday, President Barack Obama declared an emergency in Flint and ordered the government to help.

Throughout last week, people lined up to pick up free water and filters at fire stations. More free supplies have been passed out door-to-door by Michigan State Police troopers, volunteers and others.

Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said Thursday night that the city has made progress. More people are needed to help, though.

## Problems Are Still Around

In October, the city began using Lake Huron water again. People are still worried because the Flint River water damaged the pipes and the drinking water may still be poisonous.

Dan Wyant, the former head of the state Department of Environmental Quality, resigned last month. The department did not make Flint use chemicals that would keep the river water from damaging the pipes.

Snyder has repeatedly apologized for the state's role in the water crisis, but many say he still hasn't done enough.

"That apology ain't going to help these kids," said Hawk, who said she doesn't know what dangers her children may face because of the lead.

Weaver said that people no longer have trust in the government. She said the solution is to fix the water system and provide long-term help for Flint residents.

"We didn't deserve to be in this position, in this situation," she said, "and what happened here in Flint should never happen to any community."
