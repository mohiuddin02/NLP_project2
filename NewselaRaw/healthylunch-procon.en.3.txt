### PRO: It's good for kids and for education

WASHINGTON — As a new school year begins, American parents should be thrilled to get behind first lady Michelle Obama's campaign for healthier school lunches. It is based on science and nutrition. Her goal is to make our kids healthier and happier.

The first lady wants to improve childhood health through better eating and more exercise. She wants it to be the issue she is known for.

America has a weight problem, and many people aren't just overweight — they are obese. Childhood obesity has become a national problem. In 2012, 1 in 3 American children were overweight or obese. Overweight children are at higher risk of developing a variety of diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Living with these diseases makes their lives worse and costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars a year.

One part of Obama's overall program is the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. It's an update to the national school lunch program, which has helped pay for school meals since 1946. More than 30 million students benefit from it. Yet over the past 15 years, the program hasn't changed much.

## More Fruit And Vegetables

The Institute of Medicine has pushed for healthier school meals. It recommends meals containing fewer calories, less fat and salt, and more fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Most parents would agree these are excellent goals.

Along with the menu changes, the new law makes it easier for low-income and foster kids to have school meals. It helps pay for their meals.

However, the government only sets guidelines — local school systems create their own menus. Don't believe ridiculous rumors. There is nothing in the law that prevents bake sales or birthday cakes in the classroom.

Still, there have been glitches. For instance, it turned out many high school athletes needed more protein than the guidelines allowed. The government responded by changing the regulations.

Most school systems are working with Washington to go along with the changes. More than 90 percent now meet the new guidelines. Studies show most kids have grown to like the new, healthier choices.

But, some people prefer attacking the law to improving it. There have been efforts in Congress to hold off on the new nutritional standards for a year. Some supporters of healthy nutrition say junk-food sellers are trying to influence Congress to prevent the new standards.

## Kids Resist Healthy Food

It should be no surprise to any parent that kids resist healthy food. But, just like home-cooked food, with sufficient time and encouragement, children can be persuaded to try new foods. Eventually, they come to enjoy them. School systems that made the changes slowly found students more ready to accept them.

Groups that promote good nutrition, such as the Food Research and Action Center, completely support the new meal standards. And they are fighting efforts to weaken them.

A study done by Congress this year found that the new standards were achieving the goal of better nutrition for kids. It blamed the problems of putting them in place on the speed and size of the changes.

The government has been contributing food and money to our schools to improve student nutrition for years. Such aid is good for the kids, good for education and good for our country. Over the years, aid has helped kids afford breakfast as well as lunch.

Obama's campaign is just the latest effort to make sure our kids eat right at school. It deserves every parent's support.

### CON: It's too much government control

WASHINGTON — The purpose of the national school meal programs should be to meet students' needs. But for that to happen, it must be accepted that parents know what's best for their children. Neither first lady Michelle Obama nor our leaders in Congress should think they do.

Unfortunately, new school meal standards ignore parents. Called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, the standards started to go into effect two years ago.

The standards come from a government that thinks it knows everything.

Those who dare to speak against these standards have quickly felt the wrath of Obama and her supporters.

## Too Many Don'ts

It's not just politicians who have felt the anger of the first lady. The School Nutrition Association represents more than 55,000 school nutrition experts. It sent a letter to the first lady expressing "disappointment." The group said some of her comments put down school nutrition professionals.

The new meal standards try to control everything about what's served to children. They place severe restrictions on calories, nutritional content and portion sizes. Some schools have left the program. They'd rather sacrifice the huge amounts of money it offers to be free from its restrictions.

Our government believes it must control nutrition in the schools. It assumes parents can't be trusted to teach their children how to make the right food choices.

Supporters of the law claim that parents need help. They believe parents can't ensure their kids are eating properly at school. Of course, parents can't know every single thing that their children eat at school. Yet this doesn't mean parents haven't taught their children how to make the right choices.

Parents concerned about the food provided to their children at school are much better off going to local officials to address these issues. They will generally get the chance to meet with the officials and have their voices heard.

Parents aren't going to get very far trying to convince D.C. politicians about their concerns. Officials have their hands tied because these new standards don't let them address many concerns.

## It's Too Expensive

If the new standards gave more choices to states and local authorities, it would help officials better meet the needs of their students. Not only that, but it would also give parents a greater say in the food provided through meal programs.

The standards have faced criticism from nutrition officials. The Government Accountability Office surveyed state nutrition officials. It found that local school food authorities had concerns about the lunch standards — from uneaten food to the costs of meeting the new standards.

The National School Board Association cautioned, "school boards cannot ignore the higher costs" created by the rules. Some schools have reportedly even taken money away from teacher pay to cover the extra costs.

Worse, students are disgusted by the food provided to them. According to the GAO report, students in one district refused to eat school lunches for three weeks. Students are posting their anger over the program using Twitter at "#ThanksMichelle."

The first lady and other supporters of the standards haven't listened to complaints. They've even opposed giving some poorer schools a one-year break from going along with the standards. Nothing, it seems, will be allowed to slow it from taking effect.

And that's a shame. The meal standards aren't fit for our students. They need to be scrapped.
