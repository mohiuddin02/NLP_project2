WASHINGTON â€” The president of Brazil has canceled an official visit to Washington. She is angry that the National Security Agency had spied on her and other Brazilian officials. The cancellation deepens a split between South America's biggest country and the Obama administration.

Dilma Rousseff on Tuesday called off the high-profile state visit that both governments had planned for Oct. 23.  A state visit is an elaborate affair, with meetings and a formal dinner with toasts.

A White House spokesman sought to downplay the diplomatic insult by a key ally and trading partner. He said the decision to indefinitely postpone the visit was made by both sides.

The White House said that Rousseff and President Barack Obama had agreed it would be better to have the visit when the two nations were getting along better.

## A Tough RSVP

Obama "understands and regrets" the concern that disclosures about U.S. spying has generated in Brazil, the White House said. Obama is committed to working with Rousseff and her government to move past the issue, it said.

A statement from the Brazilian president's office was tougher. It noted a "lack of ... explanations and commitment to cease" spying for the cancellation.

Brazil called the illegal collection of communications information on citizens, companies and members of the its government "a grave matter." It was "incompatible with relations between friendly nations."

Since July, Brazilian news organizations have carried three reports based on classified documents. The information was leaked by Edward Snowden, a former IT worker for the NSA. One indicated that the intelligence agency had intercepted communications between Rousseff and her aides, among other senior officials.

Rousseff quickly blasted the eavesdropping. Her aides said then that she wanted an apology from Obama and was reconsidering her invitation to Washington.

## Spurned Outreach

Obama tried to make amends. At a meeting this month with top nations in Russia, he added a meeting with Rousseff to his schedule and offered to address her concerns. National security adviser Susan Rice met with her Brazilian counterpart last week.

But the outreach failed. On Monday, the two leaders spoke by phone. They agreed to delay the ceremony of a state visit. They did not want it to be overshadowed by one issue between the countries, "no matter how important or challenging the issue may be," the White House said.

Snowden's leak of secret spying documents to the news media already had led to another canceled presidential visit. Only then it was Obama doing the canceling.

He canceled a planned meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month. Putin let Snowden stay in Russia temporarily. The two leaders met informally during the Group of 20 meeting in St. Petersburg, however. Both governments have since worked together on a plan to take away Syria's chemical weapons.

The invitation to Rousseff was the only state visit the White House had planned this year. It was widely seen in Brazil as affirmation of its rising place on the international stage. But Rousseff appears to have calculated that scolding Washington over spying was more important for her audience at home than a sit-down in the Oval Office.

"Slapping Obama in the face, standing up to the big neighbor in the North" could make her more popular as she faces next year's elections, said David Fleischer, a political scientist at the University of Brasilia. "It increases Brazil's standing in the world by saying we can stand up to the U.S. when they did something very nasty to us."

## Awfully Awkward Dinner Conversation

"The issue of spying would have dominated the Washington visit," said Peter Hakim. He is president emeritus at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington group that focuses on relations with Latin America. "And Rousseff must have been nervous that something more could come out (from Snowden) before then."

A Brazilian government group met Tuesday with officials at the Russian Embassy to talk about a visit to Russia to meet with Snowden. Rousseff also is promoting legislation that would require Google, Facebook and other technology companies to store information collected in Brazil on Brazilian soil. The companies would then have to submit it to Brazilian law. Rousseff plans to speak about spying next week at the United Nations.

The White House dismissed the downturn in relations. But it could affect U.S. businesses. A multibillion-dollar contract to sell Boeing aircraft and access to oil fields for U.S. companies were probably going to be talked about at the state meeting, said Carl Meacham. He is director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"This signals a different kind of environment for the U.S.," said Meacham.
