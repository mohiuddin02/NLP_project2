NEW YORK — Five years into the global financial crisis, families around the world are still too nervous to take any chances with their money.

They speak different languages. They live in rich countries and poor ones, with good job markets and bad. But when it comes to money they all are acting the same. Families are holding tight to their cash, driven more by a fear of losing what they have than a wish to increase it.

An Associated Press study shows that families in the 10 biggest economies are spending carefully. They have pulled hundreds of billions of dollars out of the stock market, and are putting their money into savings and other investments that offer low interest. The return on their money is often too little to keep up with the increase in the cost of living.

"It doesn't take very much to destroy confidence, but it takes an awful lot to build it back," says Ian Bright. He is a senior economist at ING, a global bank based in Amsterdam. "The attitude toward risk is permanently reset."

## Avoiding Debt Like The Plague

There hasn't been so much caution globally since the end of World War II in 1945.

The implications are huge: Avoiding debt and spending less can be good for a family's finances. But when hundreds of millions of people are too careful with their money, it can starve the global economy.

Slow economic growth means salaries in the United States will rise slowly. Right now, unemployment in parts of Europe is at an all-time high. In several countries, more than 35 percent of young people are out of work.

High unemployment in many countries means fewer people with money to spend. But even people with stable jobs are being careful.

Five years ago, Lehman Brothers, one of the largest banks in the world, went bankrupt, triggering the global crisis. Now, said Arne Holzhausen, a senior economist based in Munich, "It's safety, safety, safety."

The Associated Press analyzed data showing what people did with their money five years before December 2007, when the economic downturn began, and five years afterward. It focused on the world's 10 biggest economies — the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Brazil, Russia, Italy and India.

## Slamming The Brakes On Spending

Some key findings from the data include:

— RETREAT FROM STOCKS: A desire for safety drove people to sell stocks even as stock prices soared, and put their money into bonds. A stock is a very small ownership interest in a company that can be bought. A bond is a loan that helps a government or company pay for a long-term project, and is generally considered the safer investment.

— AVOIDING DEBT: The amount of money people owed on consumer debt, things like home mortgages and credit card purchases, rose at an enormous rate in the five years before the financial crisis. When the financial crisis hit, people slammed the brakes on this kind of borrowing.

"Given what they've lived through, households are (reluctant) to borrow again," says Jack Ablin. He is chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank in Chicago.

— HOARDING CASH: In the five years after the crisis, households in the six countries with the most highly developed economies began keeping a larger proportion of their money in cash.

The growth of this is remarkable, since the cash wasn't coming from increased salaries. After all, millions more people were unemployed and wages grew slowly. They also put money into bank accounts, although they earned little interest.

— SPENDING SLUMP: Cutting debt and saving more may be good in the long term. But to stop borrowing and save more, people have had to stop spending as much, which isn't good for the economy. During the five years after the crisis, the spending rate went up only about half of what it was before. This is according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting and consulting firm.

— DEVELOPING WORLD NOT HELPING ENOUGH: When the financial crisis hit, the major developed countries looked to the developing world to take over in powering global growth. The four big developing countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — recovered quickly from the crisis. But this year, their economies are stumbling.

## Deep Into Debt No More

Consumers will eventually begin spending their money, but few economists expect them to snap back to their old ways.

The spending habits in the years before the financial crisis were not normal. Experts now understand that before the crisis, families did not have more money to spend because they earned more. Instead, they went into debt to buy what they wanted.

More importantly, economists say the global crisis has psychologically "scarred" consumers. Scarring is the fear of losing money during an economic downturn, a feeling that doesn't go away so quickly.

Even after the economy improves, people still want to keep their money safe. Americans who suffered through the Great Depression in the 1930s remained careful about money for decades, even as the U.S. economy boomed after World War II.

Some economists think the psychological blow of the most recent crisis was so severe that normal spending levels won't come back for at least another five years.
