ORLANDO, Fla. â€” Disney parks used to let disabled guests go to the head of the line. Disney is not allowing that anymore. Parents of disabled children are upset.

Curtis Doyle is 27 years old. He has autism. It affects his brain. He's excited to go to Walt Disney World next summer. He reminds his dad about it each day.

But the trip worries his father, Brad.

## Big Problem For Disabled Kids

It might seem like a small change to most families. But it's not to Brad.

His son gets attached to some things. That's normal for people with mental disabilities. And he gets frustrated when he doesn't get what he wants. Sometimes he has a fit. He gets so upset that he may bite his own hands.

The families say making disabled kids stand in line does not work. Some kids cannot understand why there's a wait. Others need regular food, medicine or bathroom breaks. Some can be in the parks for only two or three hours. After that, they get tired or upset.

Brad said it will be a huge problem for his son. He has taken Curtis many times to Disneyland. Brad says he may have to change his plans.

Disney says it understands why they are upset. But it also says it must make changes to the line rule. Other people have been using it to get ahead of others.

## Lying To Cut In Line

Some families pay disabled people to come along. Many people fake health problems. It can be hard to know if people are lying.

The problem has gotten worse. Millions of people go to Disney parks each year. The big crowds have led to more cheaters.

Disney is one of the most friendly parks for disabled people. They get a special card that helps. It gets them on a fast line. And they can use a different entrance.

Disney has a new plan for disabled visitors. If they want to go on a ride, they will show their card. The Disney worker will tell them when to come back. They still have to wait, but not in line. The new plan starts Oct. 9.

Parents say there must be a better fix. Waiting is just too hard for certain families with very disabled children.

There has to be a way, said Don La Vette. He has an 11-year-old son with autism. Don't hurt kids with disabilities because people cheat, he said.
