WASHINGTON â€” The U.S. will do everything it can to help find [276 Nigerian girls](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian+schoolgirls), said President Barack Obama. The girls were kidnapped from their school three weeks ago. A terror group, called Boko Haram, is responsible.

It is very important to find them quickly. Boko Haram has threatened to sell the girls into slavery. Boko Haram means "Western education is sinful."

Obama said the U.S. will send a team of experts to the African country immediately.

Finding the girls is the most important thing, said President Barack Obama. But the extremist group also must be stopped.

The goal "is to do everything we can to recover these young ladies," Obama said Tuesday. These were some of his first public comments about the kidnapping. He called it a "terrible situation."

But the world also needs to stop terror groups like Boko Haram. These groups cause chaos in people's day-to-day lives, Obama said.

## Nigeria Comes Under Pressure

The kidnapping has caused anger around the world. Nigeria is under pressure to free the girls before they are made slaves or hurt.

On April 15, the girls were taken by force from their high school. The high school is located in an area of Nigeria that is hard to reach. A total of 276 girls remain missing. Another 53 girls managed to escape.

Obama said he will soon send experts to the African country. The experts specialize in investigating crimes. They also have expertise in negotiating, and gathering and sharing information. The U.S. will also send people who help victims, said Jay Carney. He is the White House spokesman.

The military won't be sent, Carney noted.

"Obviously, what's happening is awful," Obama said. "As a father of two girls, I can't imagine what their parents are going through." Obama's daughters, Malia and Natasha, are 15 and 13.

## Terror Group Boko Haram

Obama said the U.S. has tried in the past to work with Nigeria to stop Boko Haram. Boko Haram is an Islamist extremist group. It is against anything that comes from Western countries. This includes voting in elections and a non-religious education. The group believes girls shouldn't go to school at all.

Obama called Boko Haram one of the worst local terrorist groups. He said they kill people without mercy.

The Nigeria government has been unable to rescue the girls. And that may get the world to stop "this horrendous organization," Obama said.

On Tuesday, U.S. lawmakers urged that the girls be safely and immediately returned. Some lawmakers also observed a moment of silence on the Capitol steps. Dozens of people protested outside the Nigerian Embassy in Washington.

All 20 female senators asked Obama to punish Boko Haram.

## More Attacks Threatened

The official in charge of international relations is Secretary of State John Kerry. He said the U.S. had been in touch with Nigeria "from day one." But repeated offers of U.S. help were ignored. On Tuesday, Kerry got on the phone with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

Kerry said Nigeria now realizes that it needs to do more.

Boko Haram's threat to sell the girls into slavery has "convinced everybody that there needs to be a greater effort," Kerry said. "And it will begin immediately. I mean, literally, immediately."

A statement from Jonathan's office said the U.S. will send experts to work with  Nigeria in the search and rescue plan. It said Nigeria's police and army are doing all they can to find the girls. Nigeria welcomes advice and experts from the U.S.

Abubaker Shekau is the leader of Boko Haram. He said Boko Haram is responsible for kidnapping the girls. He has been threatening to make them slaves. Shekau also warned that Boko Haram will attack more schools and kidnap more girls.

The U.S. government said U.S. citizens shouldn't travel to Nigeria.
