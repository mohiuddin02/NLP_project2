BALTIMORE — Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner California Chrome has just the June 7 Belmont Stakes ahead of him in his bid to become horse racing's 12th Triple Crown winner. To win the Triple Crown, a horse must win three races — the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.

If California Chrome wins the Belmont Stakes, he will be the first Triple Crown winner in 36 years.

Since Affirmed last won the Triple Crown in 1978, 12 horses have completed the Derby-Preakness double without adding the third jewel. That's more than have won all three in the series' 139-year history (11).

## So close ...

A double-winning horse has fallen short at Belmont Park 12 times. Each time, the racing community is left to wonder whether the three-race sweep will ever be achieved again.

"I honestly believe that if the Triple Crown is not won this year by California Chrome, I will never see it in my entire lifetime," said Steve Coburn. He is one of California Chrome's owners.

The 36 years since a Triple Crown winner is the longest wait ever. The previous record drought was 25 years between the horse named Citation in 1948 and Secretariat in 1973. California Chrome's owners and trainer hope their colt will break that streak, not become the 23rd to just miss.

A year after Affirmed won in 1978, Spectacular Bid won the series' first two races. He lost at Belmont, kicking off a stretch of near-misses.

## Everyone Is Feeling Lucky

California Chrome jockey Victor Espinoza rode War Emblem to victory in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 2002. He said he'll likely enjoy himself more this time around.

The horse's owners and trainers are almost folksy by the standards of big-money thoroughbred horse racing. They already have also experienced the pressure of being the Derby winner at Pimlico Race Course. Trainer Art Sherman said that with all the attention he was getting, he felt like singer Willie Nelson.

But all their attention will be on California Chrome, whom they believe can win again in three weeks.

"I wouldn't want to be in anybody else's shoes right now," Sherman said. "I know, right now, we're running on a high, but I think when we get to Belmont, this horse is going to run big."

## Horses Are Trained Differently These Days

Other trainers with Triple Crown dreams likely have felt the same. But Steven Brandt, a Frederick native who owns Preakness entrant Kid Cruz, said horses have changed since Affirmed pulled off the feat.

The races still matter, he said. "I just think that the breeding has changed the horse significantly, and it just makes it more difficult to come back as rapidly as 15, 20 years ago. So I think it makes it tougher. If you can do it today, you really have an excellent horse — not to take away from other Triple Crown winners. But racing and medication and everything was different back then."

Owners and trainers prefer more rest for their horses between races. Horses who run at Churchill Downs and Pimlico also face steeper competition in New York at the Belmont. Several Derby horses skip the Preakness and instead wait for the Belmont to give them a better chance. Those horses have five weeks' rest between races.

Coburn argued against that trend after the Preakness. He said "there are trainers out there that train horses just to upset the apple cart."

He added, "They don't want a Triple Crown winner. They want a paycheck."

He said the fields for the Preakness and the Belmont should be limited to Kentucky Derby entrants. Horses who don't run in the Preakness should not be allowed to go to the Belmont, he said.

## It's Time For A Triple Crown

Many of his peers believe the sport needs a Triple Crown winner as well. Bob Baffert, who trained Bayern ahead of the Preakness, said Chrome is a "cool customer."

"He does everything right," Baffert said. "He's fast enough to stay out of trouble. Victor rides him with so much confidence."

Kid Cruz trainer Linda Rice also said California Chrome has a chance to join the list of Triple Crown winners. She added that the absence of one since Affirmed proves just how hard it is.

"I think, sooner or later, it'd be good if we had one," Rice said. "We're due."

Rick Watson is a Pimlico regular. He said he doesn't think that owners and trainers will become less enthusiastic, even if the Triple Crown appears more unattainable each year.

"They're going to keep striving," Watson said.

As long as they do, there likely will be a large crowd for those races at Belmont. The Triple Crown races are a big deal on their own. Still, the storylines that develop during Triple Crown season attract casual race fans such as Glenn Moyer.

"I think this is going to generate a lot more interest in horse racing," he said. "I think it's exciting for such a unique success story to unfold the way it's unfolding."
