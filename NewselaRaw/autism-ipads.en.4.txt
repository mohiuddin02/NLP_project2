AUSTIN, Texas â€” Jaime Morin, 9, has autism. The condition makes him nonverbal, or unable to talk. Things have gotten better ever since his mother, Lupe Santander, found out about Zach's Voice. The group gives iPads to autistic children who can't talk.

"He can say exactly what he wants with the iPad," says Santander. "When he first figured it out, the look on his face was priceless. We could finally understand him, we didn't have to say 'Yes' or 'No' when he pointed to things."

When children with autism cannot talk, their thoughts are unable to come out. That's where the iPad comes in. Through the app of their choice, the children can form sentences by putting together words. These words come in the form of buttons and a picture to match the word. Once they've written a sentence, they play it back for others to hear. The iPad becomes their voice.

This improves "their understanding of the world around them," says teacher Danielle Skala. She has a few students who use iPads in her classroom.

## An iPad Is So Much Easier!

Zach's Voice was created last May. The group gives iPads to autistic children who have a hard time talking.

Zach's Voice was founded by Abby Whitworth, who named the group after her 7-year-old son. Whitworth was inspired by Zach's experience with the iPad. Before the Apple product, he used DynaVox, a heavy device that was hard to program, Whitworth said. Besides being clunky, it drew attention to him. With an iPad, he blends in.

Whitworth was inspired to form Zach's Voice after seeing something at a grocery store. While shopping, she noticed an autistic child walking around with note cards. He was using the cards as a way to talk to people. With note cards, however, the number of words a person can use is limited.

"The iPad lets kids use all the words they want," says Whitworth.

"With picture books and note cards, I got to decide what the kids said," says Skala. "Now, the child decides."

## Kids Can Add Their Own Words

The app recommended by Zach's Voice is ProLoQuo2Go. However, the group provides a gift card that covers the cost of whatever app families want. Jaime chose Lamp Words for Life. He was already familiar with that particular program.

ProLoQuo2Go lets kids add words to the program. For example, they can add family members' names. They can also add things like the names of their favorite cartoon characters.

"The kids start off using the app to" talk to people about the things they love, says Whitworth. "It's rewarding and motivates them to use the program."

## Now They Use Their Voices

The iPad can do more than just help children with autism express themselves with others. It sometimes also can make it easier for them to speak.

"Zach talks now," Whitworth says. "It started six months ago, about a year and a half after he first got his iPad."

Jaime has been speaking more since he began using the iPad. He has started to repeat sentences and words after hearing them through the app. When he hears a certain pronunciation, he tries to imitate it.

"It opens up their world, their voice can be heard," Santander says. "He's not stuck in his little body anymore. It has given him confidence."

The iPad also can make kids feel less anxious.

"Being heard and understood," Whitworth says, is such a great relief.
