WASHINGTON, D.C. — As the nation's economy continues to improve, business activity is picking up and more Americans are finding work. People are also heading South and West again in search of jobs and more affordable housing.

The U.S. Census Bureau is a government agency that measures the population every 10 years. It estimates that, between 2014 and 2015, almost 1.4 million people moved to the South. This part of the United States includes 16 states and the District of Columbia. The 13 states in the West grew by about 866,000 people. 

People migrated to the South, or Sun Belt, for many decades before the Great Recession. This was a period between 2007 and 2009 when the U.S. economy weakened and many people could not find jobs. The population growth in recent years signals that people are moving South and West again. 

In comparison, population growth in the Northeast and the Midwest — including what's known as the Snow Belt — remained slow. In those areas, the population grew by about 258,000 residents combined.

"Clearly, the Snow Belt-to-Sun Belt migration is coming back after a huge lull in response to the recession and post-recession period," said William Frey. He studies populations at the Brookings Institution, an organization that researches the economy and policy issues. "Up until now, regional migration was not picking up at the same time that other economic indicators — jobs and housing — seemed to be on the upswing."

## After A Lull, Population Is Shifting

The numbers indicate that Americans are more willing to relocate after having sat still earlier in the decade. At that time, the Census Bureau reported that only 1 in 5 people who wanted to move somewhere else did so.

The new estimates arrive midway through the decade, halfway to the next census in 2020. The bigger a state's population, the more representatives it can elect to the U.S. House.  

If the population shift continues, Texas could gain three new seats in the U.S. House, Florida could gain two, and Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina and Oregon, one apiece after the next census. This analysis comes from the Election Data Services, a political research firm based in Virginia.

Nine states — Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia — could meanwhile lose a seat apiece.

## Moving Toward Jobs, Affordable Homes

A separate census report says two-thirds of the people who made long-distance moves between 2014 and 2015 were looking for jobs and more affordable housing. One-quarter of the households moved for family reasons, such as getting married or rejoining relatives. 

Texas, for example — which had the biggest population gain from 2014 to 2015 — is a magnet for job-seekers from elsewhere. It has led in high job growth and outpaced the nation's economic growth since the recession.

Other Sun Belt states that witnessed a growth in population — such as Georgia and Nevada — also had some of the largest increases in job growth or economic output. So did Colorado, Oregon and Utah.

West Virginia, meanwhile, suffered a population loss of almost 5,000\. The state, which has relied economically on a declining coal industry, has higher unemployment and lower job growth rates than the national average. This gave more people more reasons to leave.

Six other states also had population losses for the year: Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico and Vermont. And like West Virginia, many are struggling to provide economic opportunity. New Mexico, Connecticut and Maine had some of the lowest rates of job growth in recent years.

## Florida Is A Magnet For Seniors Again

Florida's gain of almost 366,000 people was its largest in a decade. It reflects another cause behind the renewed migration to the Sun Belt: The nation's swollen population of baby boomers now feels more secure economically in picking up and moving to traditional retirement spots.

"The state continues to attract retiring baby boomers because of our climate and the relatively low costs of living," said Richard Doty. He's a demographer who studies populations at the University of Florida.  

The arrival and departure of people has significant implications for states. It affects housing, local governments and the amount of of money a government can tax.

In Oregon, many young people are moving to Portland, a major city where technology is helping to drive the economy.  Josh Lehner, an economist who works for the state, says that's creating a housing shortage. The city can't build homes quickly enough for all of the people who are moving there. 

## Goodbye, California. Hello, Oregon

Many of Oregon's newcomers are from neighboring California, which had more than 77,000 people move out. That's more than twice the number who left between 2013 and 2014\.  

Many left because of housing costs. A typical home in California costs two-thirds more than in Oregon, for example.

The cost of housing can limit the number of people willing to move into California to take even high-paying, high-tech jobs in places like San Francisco, said John Malson, chief of demographic research at the California Department of Finance.

"You have a very good job market here in tech, so people who are coming here are coming for the attractive job opportunities," Malson said. "But it's very expensive to live in California."
