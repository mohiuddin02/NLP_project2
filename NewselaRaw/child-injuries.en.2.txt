New research shows that broken bones in children are almost never treated correctly.

Hundreds of thousands of children in the United States go to emergency rooms with bone fractures every year.

But 93 percent of the time, the splints, which are used temporarily to keep the bones from moving, are not put on correctly, according to the University of Maryland School of Medicine study. That can lead to swelling, skin injuries and other problems. Some of them can last a long time.

"I did the study because I see a lot of splints on wrong, but I didn't think it would be that high," said Dr. Joshua M. Abzug, the main author of the study. Abzug said the research showed that there is a problem.

"The next step is education," Abzug added. He is the director of pediatric orthopedics (a children's bone doctor) at the University of Maryland Medical Center.

## From Splint To Cast

The splints that are used to stabilize broken bones usually include a strip of hard material and soft padding, An elastic bandage is wrapped around it to hold it in place.

Most of the time, Abzug said, a splint is good enough. The patient will usually see an orthopedist within a few days and have a cast put on.

But if that visit is delayed, he said, serious problems can develop. They include wounds that require skin grafts, which is healthy skin taken from another part of a person's body, or even surgery to reset a bone.

## The Study Was Shocking

Abzug studied 275 children and teenagers with broken bones in the Baltimore area. In 77 percent of the cases, elastic bandages were incorrectly put directly on skin. In 59 percent, joints were not kept immobile. In 52 percent, splints were the wrong length. About 40 percent of the kids wound up with problems.

Those percentages are particularly troubling, he said, given the huge number of kids who need splints. Nearly half of all boys and a quarter of girls break a bone before age 16, Abzug said.

Almost 1 million kids younger than 15 break an arm or leg each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. Millions more get splints for sprains or strains.

Abzug suspects that health care workers are not correctly putting splints on adults either.

The researchers planned to go to hospitals and urgent-care centers to demonstrate the right way to put on splints. An urgent-care center treats illnesses or emergencies that aren't serious enough to require an emergency room. The researchers also hope to give out posters and cards as reminders. Later, they plan to redo the study to see whether more splints were put on correctly.

## Important: Leave On Splint

Dr. Robert G. Graw Jr. is the founder and medical director of the Righttime Medical Care. The company runs 13 urgent-care centers in Maryland. He said he would welcome the additional training.

Methods and materials change, Graw said. Also, people lose skills they do not use regularly, so updates are important. Graw said children and their parents should not take off splints, because they could put them back on improperly.

When 1-year-old Hudson was injured last month, X-rays showed a broken shinbone.

His leg was splinted at the emergency room. At one point, the Maryland boy crawled out of the splint. Another time, his mother removed it so he could sleep.

Later, Abzug told Hudson's mother he was not surprised to see a sore on Hudson's heel.

More than a month later, the cast is now off. Hudson and his twin brother are learning to walk. But his mother, Jessica Ryan, still thinks about the family's experience.

"I wonder how many emergency rooms even know this is happening," she said. "They didn't warn us to look out for blistering or rubbing so maybe they didn't know that was a possibility."

She said she feels terrible that her son may take longer to recover now.

## Everyone Needs Proper Training

Dr. Jennifer M. Weiss has long noticed improperly placed splints.

Weiss is a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center. She said there is little training in proper methods even for bone doctors. Most learn on the job from someone who might or might not know how to do it correctly.

Weiss said Abzug's study should provide good evidence to push for additional training.

She said medical schools and hospitals need to make sure they teach doctors how to put on a splint. Just like a broken bone, she added, "I think this is fixable."
