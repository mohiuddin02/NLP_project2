Mothers of teenagers are used to getting text messages from their children. But the text that Roni Dean-Burren received from her 15-year-old son last week wasn't about dating or money for the movies.

Instead, it was about history.

Her son, Coby, had sent her a photo of a colorful page in his ninth-grade McGraw-Hill World Geography textbook. In a section titled "Patterns of Immigration," a speech bubble pointed to the continent of Africa. It read: "The Atlantic Slave Trade between the 1500s and 1800s brought millions of workers from Africa to the southern United States to work on agricultural plantations."

The words alarmed Dean-Burren, who was an English teacher for 11 years. She is now getting her doctorate from the University of Houston's Language Arts program, and has spent much of her life thinking about the power and dangers of language. The motive behind the textbook's choice of words seemed clear.

## Book Revised History, She Says

"This is erasure," Dean-Burren said, adding that the textbook revised history â€” "retelling the story however the winners would like it told."

The book called the slaves "workers" and their move to the United States "immigration." She noted in Facebook posts this suggests that her African-American ancestors arrived in America willingly and makes it seem like they were paid for their labor.

In a Facebook announcement Friday McGraw-Hill Education sought to correct the book's statements. The publishing company said that "our language in that caption did not adequately convey that Africans were both forced into migration and to labor against their will as slaves."

"We believe we can do better," it continues. To communicate these facts more clearly, the publishing company will update the caption to describe the arrival of African slaves in the United States as a forced migration. It will also emphasize that their work was done as slave labor.

## Publisher Agrees To Make Changes

The publisher said the changes will be made in the textbook online and included in the next printed version.

McGraw-Hill's statement came quickly, but it was only after tens of thousands of people expressed their outrage on social media. By the time Dean-Burren received news of the company's response, her video about the textbook had half a million views.

Dean-Burren has mixed feelings about the outcome. On a surface level, she said she felt happy. "I understand that McGraw-Hill is a textbook giant, so thumbs up for listening."

On the other hand, few students use the online version of the book. Because her son's textbook is brand-new, another print version likely won't come out for 10 years.

## Mother Urges Faster Action

"I know they can do better," she said. Dean-Burren said they can send out a new page to be inserted in the books, or recall the books.

Dean-Burren added that the book downplays slavery. It "is a way of saying those black lives, those black bodies, that black pain didn't matter enough to give it a full description."

The publisher has been criticized for its Texas textbooks before. In 2010, the Texas State Board of Education adopted new guidelines for social studies. Many educators criticized them and said they interfered with teaching history accurately.

The changes were made only to books sold in Texas, but some feared that school districts in other states would use them.

## Not The First Problem With Texas Books

As recently as last year, scholars found a number of problems in the textbooks. The books declared that a Muslim headscarf interfered with women's rights, for instance. They downplayed Jim Crow laws in the South that discriminated against African-Americans and said that slavery was not the main cause of the Civil War between the Northern and Southern states.

Edward Countryman is a history professor at Southern Methodist University. He said that it harms students to include little more than a mention of race and slavery in textbooks.

"It's kind of like teaching physics and stopping at Newton without bringing in Einstein," said Countryman. Isaac Newton, who died in 1727, is the scientist and mathematician who discovered gravity, and Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity.

Still, McGraw-Hill's description of the slave trade has had a positive impact on at least one student.

Shortly after the publisher's decision to change the book, Dean-Burren and her son were sitting next to each other on the couch, when Coby started dialing his mother's cellphone number.

"Why are you calling me?" she asked, confused.

"Answer your phone," he urged. Speaking into his phone, Coby fulfilled a request his mother made when he started high school.

"Mom," he said, "you told me to call you when I realized I could change the world."
