KABUL, Afghanistan â€” Abdul Rafi is only 9 years old. But he began working when he was just 6.

Abdul Rafi's job is to find customers for tax drivers.

Abdul is the oldest of three brothers. In [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan), older sons are expected to support their families. He is up every day at 5 a.m. for morning prayers. Then he rushes to the taxi stands. Most days, he barely earns $3.

"I would rather just go to school," Abdul croaks. His voice wore out from yelling for customers. "But my family needs the money."

Nearly 2 million children between the ages of 6 and 17 work in Afghanistan. It is against the law for children under 14 to work full time. Kids under 18 can't work at dangerous jobs.

## Low Pay For Children

But the laws are mostly ignored. Bosses want to hire children. They don't have to pay them as much as adults. Also, families need the money the children make, said Sami Hashemi. He is a child-protection expert.

Children as young as 6 work in brick making, carpet weaving, building and farming. Others beg for money. They collect trash or sell little toys.

Many families need their kids to work to get enough money for food. "They must focus on today, not on a future for their children," Hashemi said. He is frustrated that so many kids don't go to school.

## Up Before The Sun

Thirteen-year-old Sami Rahimi is another child who works. He gets up before the sun to work in his uncle's bakery. He works until after dark. His bed is a bread rack on the bakery's cold floor.

Working six days a week, Sami earns about $80 a month. It is enough to take care of his entire family. His family is his father, his mother and eight brothers and sisters.

Sami is happy he can feed his family. He also feels lucky he has a job. But his mind is on his future.

"I think always about my lessons," he says. "I think about my future, which is my education."
