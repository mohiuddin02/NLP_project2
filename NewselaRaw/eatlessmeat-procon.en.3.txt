### PRO: To help the environment, we should eat less meat

People around the world are eating more and more meat these days. As a result, giant farms are raising more and more animals. 

Cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens and other livestock give off methane gas. The gas is released as their bodies break down the food they eat. 

Methane gas is one of the greenhouse gases. Other greenhouse gases are created when fuels such as coal and oil are burned.

When greenhouse gases are released, they remain in the air. They build up in the atmosphere and trap heat. Over time, they have caused a steep rise in average global temperatures. 

## Melting Icecaps, Dry Riverbeds

The increase in temperature that greenhouse gases cause is known as global warming, or climate change. It has led to many serious problems. 

For example, rising temperatures have made giant icecaps melt. The water released by this melting ice is causing sea levels to rise. Coastal shorelines and island nations are being swallowed up by the rising waters. 

In other parts of the world, the problem is the opposite. Hot weather is drying up lakes and rivers. Scientists say many places may soon have too little water.

One way Americans can help is by changing their eating habits. 

Huge farms produce most of our meat. These companies say beef, lamb, chicken and pork are good food choices. They are not, because the way farm animals are raised is bad for the planet.

Livestock produce a big part of the world's greenhouse gas. The situation is not getting any better. Indeed, it is quickly getting worse.

The big livestock companies are trying to convince us that eating meat is not part of the problem. They have even suggested that vegetarians cause more greenhouse gas buildup than meat eaters. Nothing could be more ridiculous.

## What Some Studies Say

New studies show that half the world's greenhouse gas is created by livestock. Farm animals produce more greenhouse gas than all the cars, trucks, airplanes, trains and ships in the world put together.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an agency of the U.S. government responsible for protecting the environment. The environment is the natural world we all live in.

Like many scientists, the EPA believes methane gas released by livestock is a serious problem. It says such gas accounts for one-third of all greenhouse gas created by U.S. agriculture. Greenhouse gases are also produced when farmers burn fuels to power their tractors and other machines.

No one is saying we should never eat another hamburger or steak again. However, the United States and other rich countries do need to eat less meat.

Getting people to eat less meat must be part of the push for cleaner farming. Farming has to change so it does less damage to the environment.

Eating less meat is not only good for the environment. Doctors say it is also good for your health.

## Making A Small Sacrifice

The decision to be a vegetarian or a meat eater should be your own, though. Governments should not try to force people to eat one way or the other.

When it comes to livestock and the environment, it is far better to stick to the methane gas problem. There is no need to throw in health concerns.

Also, government plans to tax meat go too far. The government should not punish people for eating meat.

The big livestock companies say there is no link between climate change and farm animals. Many scientists do not agree with them. One study found that eating just a half cup less of meat a day would greatly lower the amount of methane gas released.

We can all make that small sacrifice. It is easy to do and will help save our planet.

### CON: Eating less meat might actually hurt the environment

Recently, many of the world's leaders met in Paris. Together, they reached an agreement on what must be done to fight global warming. Each country agreed it would work hard to lower the amount of greenhouse gas released every year.

Some people are disappointed with the Paris agreement, however. They feel it does not go far enough. 

One of the big things such people want is a tax on meat. The added tax would make meat more expensive. As a result, many people might decide to start eating less of it. The change would be good for the planet, they say. 

Supporters of the tax say raising livestock produces too much greenhouse gas. They believe it is worse for the environment than raising other kinds of food. 

## This Idea Won't Work

Tax supporters say we could greatly slow climate change if we can change how people eat. If fewer people ate meat, farms would raise fewer animals. Then, less methane gas would be released and global warming would slow.

The idea sounds reasonable. However, it would not actually work. People who say eating less meat is the answer are not thinking things through. They are not looking closely at what would happen if many people switched away from meat and began eating more of the other kinds of food.

For instance, many health food fans like to use almond milk in place of cow milk. However, growing almonds requires a great deal of water. Almonds can be bad for the planet, too. Growing them wastes a good deal of water at a time when much of the world's water supply is shrinking.

For years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has pushed Americans to eat less red meat, and more fruits, vegetables and grains. Doctors have long said eating that way is more healthy. 

Suppose Americans did follow these suggestions. What effect would it have on the level of greenhouse gases?

## More, Not Less, Greenhouse Gas

Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University looked at just that question. They found that a shift toward eating more fruits and vegetables would actually raise the amount of greenhouse gas released. 

The reason is that growing fruits and vegetables requires a lot of machinery. The machinery needs fuel to run. When that fuel is burned, greenhouse gases are released. In the end, more greenhouse gas would be produced than what farm animals cause.

The British newspaper The Independent put it simply. When it comes to greenhouse gases, lettuce is "three times worse than bacon." Being a vegetarian "could be bad for the environment," the paper said.

Growing fruits and vegetables also uses up a huge amount of water. Farmers would both use more water and burn more fuel if they switched to growing more fruits and vegetables. 

In the end, raising farm animals for meat is both less wasteful and less harmful for the environment. Of course, people still need their fruits and vegetables. However, it would not be healthier for the planet if we all began to eat less meat.

The Carnegie Mellon study is not the only one to challenge the idea that meat is bad for the environment. A University of Michigan study also found that growing more fruits and vegetables would raise the level of greenhouse gasses. 

The truth is, science does not supports the idea of a meat tax. It also does not support a move away from eating meat. Neither step will help the environment. Indeed, both are likely to make the greenhouse gas problem even worse.
