BELLEVILLE, Ill. â€” Students of German at Belleville East High School have a tough job. They read articles from an old Belleville newspaper that was written in German, and then translate them into English. The articles were notices about someone's death, called obituaries. The students want to help people learn about their ancestors.

It is not easy, because the obituaries were written in the 1800s in old German. It had a different alphabet from German today and is hard to read. The students took different approaches to translating it.

## Like Solving A Puzzle

Students Colin Creedon and Daniel Jackson chose to translate the old German alphabet, known as Fraktur, into modern German first. Then they translated the modern German text they were more familiar with into English.

"We have to translate it and then rearrange it so it makes sense in English," Creedon explained.

Other students chose to translate the old German directly into English. Peyton Kaercher was one of them.

"Once you know what the words say, it's really easy," Kaercher said.

## Getting To Know Great-Great Grandfather

The task, overseen by teacher Andrew Gaa, isn't just for a grade. It serves a larger purpose of helping families learn more about their ancestry.

After the students translate the obituaries, they are posted online.

That's where Craig Eberhard of San Diego, California, found the obituary of his great-great grandfather.

Eberhard recently sent an email to Gaa and his students thanking them.

The project is "one to be appreciated and admired," Eberhard said. "Without that, I never would have known that history of my great-great grandfather."

Eberhard said the obituary allowed him to "connect some of the dots" of his family's history.

"There was so much information in there," he said. "It gave a little bit of color to my great-great grandfather."

Eberhard's great-great grandfather, Friedrich Pannier, was born in 1832 and died in 1893. He was a farmer who came to Belleville in 1866. He brought his wife and five children, including Eberhard's great grandfather, William, who was 6 years old at the time. William moved from Belleville to California.

## It Translates Into A Public Service

Gaa said the German students are providing "a service to people" who can't read German.

It's a difficult task for the 19 students in his fourth-year class, Gaa said. "Old German script is hard to read."

The students don't have to figure it out alone. They work with partners, and Gaa is there to help as well.

"The challenge is translating it and making it sound like good English," Gaa said. "There's definitely an art to it."

Student Madelyne Knipp said it's "really cool" to translate the old German notices into English. "I like translating this stuff knowing it's going to help people."

## Mistakes Are Not An Option

After the students translate the obituaries, they type them up and send them to Gaa for review.

Gaa must make sure there are no mistakes, because people will use them to look into their family history.

"I'm interested in Belleville history, so it's worthwhile for me," Gaa said.

## All About Those German Towns

Gaa actually learned about his own family history through this project, which started in the fall of 2012.

So far, the students are almost through the obituaries published in 1898 and then they will move on to 1899.

Diane Walsh studies family history, or genealogy. She said she appreciates the work Gaa and his students put into the project.

The most important thing about the German obituaries is they mention the particular town the person came from, Walsh said.

The work the students do helps bring ancestors to life, she said.

"That's what this project is about."
