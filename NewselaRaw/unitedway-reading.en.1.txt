WASHINGTON â€” Texas principal Alfreida Colvin encourages reading every way she can.

So when the United Way offered to donate to her school a reading nook, books for students to keep and a reading website, Colvin jumped at the chance.

This week, the charity rolled out its new early reading program, Club Connect Adopt-a-School, after testing it in Fort Worth, Texas, Miami and New Orleans. It is the first time the nation's largest charity has adopted high-poverty schools, like Colvin's, across the country.

Colvin said her school, Harlean Beal Elementary in Fort Worth, Texas, was short on space to put the reading nook. The only available location was a cubbyhole next to her office where parents previously sat and browsed through newsletters.

## "It Is Awesome"

Colvin asked janitors to make a little curtain for a door, and United Way brought in some colorful beanbags and a rocking chair. Scholastic, the children's book publisher, contributed books, and someone added a big stuffed lion.

"They're using it, and it is awesome," Colvin said.

Parents read to children in the nook on the days they have lunch at school together, and preschoolers use it during an after-school program. Young readers curl up on the beanbags.

Bill O'Dowd, the creator of the Club Connect program, has years of experience in TV, film and digital programming for young viewers. O'Dowd is chief executive and president of Dolphin Entertainment, and served as the executive producer of Nickelodeon's teen drama series "Zoey101."

The new project is a partnership between the United Way, the National Association of Elementary School Principals and Scholastic. "They've come together to design what principals think will do the most to help them get every kid to read," O'Dowd said.

## The Need To Read

O'Dowd, who is active in the United Way, spent several years developing Club Connect and the Reading Oasis, as the nooks in schools are called. He said the work is part of a trend among charities to try to make sweeping changes in society. The United Way decided to focus on stopping teen pregnancy, helping kids avoid a life of crime and prison, and lowering the number of high school dropouts.

It has long been known that high school graduation improves the odds for a better life, O'Dowd said. Research shows that reading by third grade is critical for later school success, because that's when reading lessons end and the need to read to learn begins, he said.

But it's no secret that many students are behind. In 2013, a federal report showed that just 32 percent of boys and 38 percent of girls were able to read well in fourth grade.

O'Dowd said he traveled to meet principals in many states. The message he got was that they wanted help to keep children reading after school, on the weekends and during the summer.

Club Connect was designed for the nation's poorest schools, those that receive federal aid for disadvantaged students. It gives the students books and other resources they don't otherwise have at home.

## Club Connect's Website

Parents register their children to use the website, which promotes reading through games and hiring celebrities to read books. The United Way sends the parents emails about the importance of reading, as well as coupons from companies "to encourage and reward them," O'Dowd said.

The website is designed to work on mobile phones, because many families don't have computers, but just about everyone has a phone, he added.

Club Connect has the potential to expand because many major companies give to the United Way. O'Dowd said the program cost about $10,000 per school, and funding depends on a decision by local United Way donors.

The Fort Worth donors included Pier One, Basic Energy Services and several large private donors, said Emily Furney. She is the vice president for community development of United Way of Tarrant County, where Colvin's school is located.

"There's definitely a great need in Tarrant County, and we'd love to be able to provide these resources for all of our schools," she said.

O'Dowd said there's potential to expand the program nationwide, because the United Way is in so many communities.
