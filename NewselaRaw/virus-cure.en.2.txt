In the spring of 2012, Emma Whitehead was close to death. She was just 6 years old. She was suffering from leukemia, a form of cancer.

The cancer was discovered in 2010. Doctors first treated her with the standard cancer treatment, called chemotherapy. But after each chemotherapy treatment, Emma's cancer reappeared.

Emma's parents were desperate to save their only child. They decided to let her try an experimental treatment at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in April 2012.

## Killer Cells

The treatment involved collecting and removing millions of Emma's T-cells. A T-cell is a type of white blood cell. It is a vital part of the body's immune system.

Those T-cells were then infected with a disabled form of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. It is a disease that kills its victims if left untreated. For decades, doctors have studied how to prevent HIV from infecting the body. Now, they are trying to infect people on purpose. But this is not the same dreaded kind of HIV.

"The virus has been engineered so it can't cause disease anymore," said Dr. Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania. "But it still retains the ability to reprogram the immune system so that it will now attack cancer cells." Dr. June's work and Emma's story were told in the short film "Fire With Fire".

Doctors inject the altered T-cells into the patient's veins. If all goes right, the cells will multiply.

"We call the modified immune (T) cells, serial killer cells," June says in the film. "Each infused cell can kill more than 1,000 different tumor cells."

The experimental procedure made Emma very ill.

She was placed on a ventilator to help her breathe and her temperature spiked to 105 degrees. She lay in bed swollen and unconscious while her family prepared for her death.

"Emma had breathing difficulties and blood pressure difficulties," said Dr. Stephan Grupp of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "We knew that she could not have gotten any sicker without actually dying."

But Emma did not die.

The modified T-cells in her body began to work. They also started to fight the cancer in her system.

On the day of her 7th birthday, Emma woke up feeling better. Her fever dropped and she was able to breathe again on her own. She was also cancer-free.

"It was like the calm after the storm," June said. "The clouds went away and she woke up and there was no leukemia. When that child survived it was an amazing event."

## Treatment Does Not Work For All

Emma was the first child to get the experimental treatment. However, she was not the first patient in the advanced stages of leukemia to try the procedure. Adults have also tried to cure their cancer with the disabled HIV treatment.

Three adults with leukemia got the same treatment and were now cancer-free, The New York Times reported.

However, six other adults and one other child who received the treatment still have leukemia.

According to The New York Times, "the research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails."

The modified T-cells not only destroy cancer cells, they also destroy some healthy cells. That means patients like Emma are at risk of becoming sick from infection.

The treatment is far from perfect. Its results are mixed and it has side effects. Nevertheless, there is hope it may get better. Novartis, a large company that makes medicine, gave $20 million to the researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis wants to help study and improve the treatment so it can eventually offer it to more patients.

## A Cheaper Cure

Currently, leukemia patients turn to bone-marrow transplants when all other options run out.

Bone marrow is the soft, spongy, fatty tissue inside your bones. A bone-marrow transplant replaces damaged or destroyed bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells.

A bone-marrow transplant is very tough on the patient. Its results are uncertain. It is also a very expensive procedure.

Using altered T-cells to treat leukemia is much cheaper. But saving money is not the point of this experimental treatment. Researchers and leukemia patients alike just want to find a cure for the disease - no matter what the cost.

Just ask Emma's parents.

Last year their daughter was deathly ill.  Today she is cancer-free and leading a healthy life.

Emma will enter third grade this fall.
