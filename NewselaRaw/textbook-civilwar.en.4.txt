Texas students will begin using new books in school. Not everyone likes them.

They leave out a lot of history. The books do not say much about blacks being treated unfairly.

They also do not say that slavery caused the Civil War.

The war ended 150 years ago. It was fought between the Northern and Southern states.

Most historians say the war was mainly over slavery. In 2010, the Texas Board of Education disagreed. The board decides what students learn in school.

Slavery was a "side issue to the Civil War," said Pat Hardy. He was on the state education board in 2010. Hardy said the war was fought for states' rights. The South thought states should have more rights than the American government in Washington.

## Southern States Wanted To Keep Slavery

Historians say states' rights and slavery were the same thing. Southern states wanted to protect the right to buy and sell people.

At the time, Southern states made that clear, said James Grossman. He is the head of the American Historical Association.

The Civil War happened because of only one reason, Grossman said. Eleven Southern states wanted the right to own other human beings, Grossman said. Northern states said all people should be free.

"The Civil War was fought" over slavery, he said.

About half of Americans think that states' rights caused the war. Fewer people think it was caused by slavery. This is from a 2011 opinion survey.

## History Important For Young People

Raul Cevallos started a group in Texas. He found that young people do not know much history.

His group made a video. In it, students did not know who won the Civil War, he said. Yet, they knew the name of Brad Pitt's wife, Angelina Jolie. They are movie stars.

Cevallos said it is important to know about the Civil War and slavery. Otherwise, people will not understand why America is the way it is.

Stephen Wright is an eighth-grade teacher in Nacogdoches. It is a small town in Texas. Wright said some students do not learn in class what really caused the Civil War. But he teaches them the truth, he said. The leaders of the Southern states wrote that they wanted to keep slavery. He has his students read their writings.

"Man, it's all about slavery," Wright said. "The students know that."
