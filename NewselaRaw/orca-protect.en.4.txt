SEATTLE â€” Lolita the orca was taken from Washington state's Puget Sound many years ago. She has been kept at Miami's Seaquarium ever since.

On Wednesday, the government said that Lolita is still a Puget Sound orca.

Orcas are also known as killer whales. They are in the dolphin family and are very large. Males can grow as much as 30 feet long. Females can be as long as 26 feet.

There are now fewer than 80 wild Puget Sound orcas left. They are protected by the government.

Lolita will now have special protection too. She is covered by a law known as the Endangered Species Act.

## It's About Keeping Her Safe

People wanting Lolita's release welcomed the government's announcement. Some may try to force Seaquarium to free her. They could argue in court that it is now against the law to hold her.

Howard Garrett works with a group called the Orca Network. He hopes that Lolita will one day be freed. The group wants her moved to a small bay off of San Juan Island, near Washington state. There, she could be prepared to re-enter the wild, he said.

However, Seaquarium says it has no plans to release Lolita.

Andrew Hertz runs Seaquarium. He says releasing Lolita would not be right.

"Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years," Hertz said. She is healthy and happy, he said.

Hertz said Lolita has been in the aquarium too long. She might not be able to live in the ocean on her own.

"We are not willing to treat her life as an experiment," he said.

## Protect The Whales

Between 1965 and 1975, many Puget Sound orcas were captured for aquariums. Lolita was taken during that period.

It is now against the law to harm or mistreat a Puget Sound orca.

However, keeping an orca in an aquarium is not necessarily considered to be mistreatment. It depends on how the orca is kept.

Some believe that Seaquarium is mistreating Lolita. The space she lives in is too small, they say. They also think it is wrong to force her to perform in shows.

## Release Has Not Always Gone Well

The government is still not sure if releasing captive whales is a good idea. It worries about the spread of disease. It also worries that newly released orcas will not be able to find food on their own.

There are certainly good reasons to be worried. Other attempts to release captive orcas were unsuccessful. Some freed orcas died.

Garrett said things would be different if Lolita was freed. She would first be taken to a netted-off area of the bay. Trainers she knows would stay with her. They would help her "every bit of the way," he said.

Lolita would not be released until she was completely ready, he said.
