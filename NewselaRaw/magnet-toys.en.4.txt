Christin Rivas found this out the hard way.

The 14-year-old was playing with magnets at school. She needed both hands to grab something. So she put the magnets in her mouth. Someone made her laugh. And gulp, she swallowed them.

Five days later, Christin was in the hospital. Doctors took the magnets out. Along with the magnets, doctors removed part of her colon. The colon is beneath the stomach. It's part of the body's system to break down food.

## Playing With Magnets

Many magnet toys include warnings. They tell people not to put magnets in their mouths or noses. But that has not stopped a growing number of kids from doing that.

"Kids swallow a lot of objects," said Dr. Tejas Mehta. He is a doctor at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children. Dr. Mehta cared for Rivas. "Magnets cause more damage than anything else."

Magnet injuries have became much more common. Between 2002 and 2011, a doctor said, 22,500 kids had to go to the hospital. Usually the kids swallowed the magnets. But a quarter of the kids put the magnets up their nose, said Julie Brown. She is a doctor in Seattle.

The magnet problem is getting worse, she said.

"There is something very tempting about" magnets, Brown said.

To toddlers, magnets can look like sprinkles. Older kids also like magnets. They use them to pretend they have a pierced tongue or nose.

## Taken To The Hospital

Some doctors don't know magnets can be a serious problem. When Christin swallowed the magnets, her mom took her to the hospital. A doctor said the magnets would leave her body when she pooped. He sent them home.

This didn't sound right to her mom. She read about magnet injuries on the Internet. Then she got scared.

She took Christin to another hospital. There, doctors tracked the magnets with an X-ray machine.

The magnets looked stuck. So, the doctors decided to operate.

The doctors safely removed them. But the operation can cause health problems later on.

"Don't even think about touching them or buying" magnets, Christin said. "I messed up my intestines. I worry about that down the road."
