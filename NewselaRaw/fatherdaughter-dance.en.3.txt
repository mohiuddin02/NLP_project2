Willie Bailey twirled and bounced on the dance floor. Soul music played from the speakers. He was happy because his dance partner was his 7-year-old daughter, Taniya.

"I feel so happy," Taniya said after they stopped dancing. "I feel pretty."

They were at a father-daughter dance on Chicago's South Side. At this type of dance, a girl brings her dad as her date.The dances celebrate how important fathers are in their daughters' lives. The evening is also a fun reason to get dressed up.

There is a special bond between dads and daughters. These dances are a way for fathers to show their girls how much they care. Father-daughter dances are popular in African-American communities.

## An Important Person

Many black children don't grow up with both a mom and dad. They are being raised in single-parent homes.

The relationship a girl has with her father is important. It can affect how she sees men in the future and how she forms relationships with them.

Kelly Fair has a group called Polished Pebbles. It is an organization that finds mentors for young black girls. It connects young black girls with successful female adults. The adults give the kids advice about school and work. Fair wants the girls to realize how men can affect their lives.

"There are men out here who are responsible, loving, trusting, caring and doing good things," said Fair. "We want our girls to see them."

## Volunteer "Dads"

Polished Pebbles also hosts a father-daughter dance in Chicago. Girls can bring their fathers, uncles, cousins or brothers. Fair finds volunteer "dads" for girls who do not have another man to invite.

The event is fun for both the girls and dads. They play group games, line dance, play musical chairs and boogie down together.

The father-daughter dance that Bailey and Tanya went to was big. There were about 70 men there. Most men came to the dance with their young daughters. Some men brought their nieces, cousins or other girls from their neighborhoods.

Joe Dunford was there with his daughter, Miranda. When the dance started, he moved his body from side to side, nodding to the music. Miranda had her own unique dance moves. He reached out for her hands. He pulled her arms into smooth movements. He was teaching her to dance.

"It's a little embarrassing, but it's fun," said Miranda, 8. "He dances weird. I like it though."

## "Makes Her Happy"

This was Dunford's first time at a father-daughter event. It meant a lot to him to be there. He wants to teach Miranda what to expect from a man. He also wants her to know from an early age than men should treat her with respect.

Bailey and his daughter, Taniya, turned the dance into a special day. They had breakfast together. They took photos in their outfits. Taniya wore a gown with a pearl necklace. Bailey wore a cap and tan blazer.

"She loves to get dressed up and look pretty," Bailey said. "I love to do what makes her happy and keeps her smiling."
