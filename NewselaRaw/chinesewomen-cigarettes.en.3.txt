BEIJING â€” Many women in China work in offices filled with clouds of cigarette smoke. Usually, though, it is not the women who are smoking, but the men around them.

After work is over, many women go home to even more cigarette smoke. Again, that smoke is usually not created by them, but by husbands or other men in the family.

Smoking is so common in China that the country is known as the Smoking Dragon. However, women smoke far less then men do. In 2010, about 288 million Chinese men smoked regularly, while only 13 million women did.

Lately, Chinese women are fighting back. They know smoking is bad not only for the people who smoke, but also for the people around smokers. So-called secondhand smoke can make nonsmokers sick, and is particularly bad for children.

## New Rules Took Many Years

Women have been very important in efforts to control smoking. They have been pushing the government to make new rules that will limit smoking in public.

Last November, their efforts paid off. The Chinese government came up with a tough new set of rules on smoking and tobacco sales. The new rules are not yet in place, but many are hopeful they will become law.

"This is a very important step," said Yang Gonghuan, a doctor who has been studying the dangers of tobacco since the 1980s. "It is very difficult to push for these kinds of changes," she said. "It has taken many, many years."

China is known for its smog created by smoke from factories and cars. However, tobacco is a much bigger health problem. Each year, about 1 million Chinese die from diseases caused by smoking.

Of course, there are men who are trying hard to get the Chinese to cut down on smoking. Ex-basketball player Yao Ming is one famous example.

However, it is women who are leading the charge against smoking.

## Uncool For Women To Smoke

Smoking has gone down over the years, but the battle against tobacco is far from won. More than half of Chinese men still smoke regularly. About 700 million Chinese breathe in secondhand smoke. It kills around 100,000 people there each year.

The Chinese have smoked tobacco for centuries. For many years, women were as likely as men to smoke. However, things changed after most Chinese switched from pipes to cigarettes during the early 1900s. Cigarette-smoking was seen as not very ladylike, and before long, many women quit smoking.

At the same time, male Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping smoked openly in public. They made the habit even more popular among men.

Smoking has remained common in public places across the country, particularly in the countryside, where half the population lives. Large numbers of doctors in China smoke.

## Getting Used To The New Laws

If the new rules pass, the way smoking is treated will change everywhere. Smoking at work, in restaurants or in other public places will be against the law.

Xu Guihua is a member of the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control. She said the new rules would only work if everyone helps out, since police cannot be everywhere. For that to happen, Chinese ideas about smoking will have to change.

In the past few hundred years, people have gotten used to "smoking wherever they want," she said. "Changing this will take some time."

Even so, Xu is hopeful that change will come. For one thing, China's new president, Xi Jinping, is taking the smoking problem seriously.

Xi has most likely been influenced by his wife, Peng Liyuan. She was once a very popular singer. These days, Peng is well-known for speaking out against smoking.
