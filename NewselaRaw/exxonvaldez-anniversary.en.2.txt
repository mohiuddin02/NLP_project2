WASHINGTON — Andy Wills was laying on a friend's couch in Cordova, Alaska, on March 24, 1989. He was up early, ready to head out and harvest spring herring in Prince William Sound.

"My buddy had just handed me a cup of coffee in the morning and we're watching 'Good Morning America,'" Wills said. "And there's the Exxon Valdez on TV, spilling oil."

He added, "We were like, 'No!' It was just the start of a nightmare."

The herring of Prince William Sound still have not recovered. Neither have killer whales, and legal issues remain unresolved a quarter of a century later. Monday was the 25th anniversary of the disaster, in which the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef and spilled at least 11 million gallons of oil into the clean, unspoiled waters of the sound.

## Persistent Pockets Of Oil

Prince William Sound today looks spectacular, a stunning landscape of mountainous fjords — cliffs framed by blue-green waters, and thickly forested islands. Pick up a stone on a rocky beach, maybe dig a little, though, and it is possible to still find pockets of oil.

"I think the big surprise for all of us who have worked on this thing for the last 25 years has been the continued presence of relatively fresh oil," said Gary Shigenaka. He's a marine scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The question of how well Prince William Sound has recovered from what at the time was the nation's largest oil spill is open to debate. Exxon Mobil Corp., which owned the Valdez, says studies show the area is bouncing back.

"The sound is thriving environmentally and we've had a very solid, complete recovery," said Richard Keil, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil.

Government scientists have a different view.

The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, a state-federal group, was set up to oversee the revival of Prince William Sound. It considers the pink and sockeye salmon to be recovered, as well as the bald eagles and harbor seals. Several other species are listed as still recovering.

Sea otters have had a rough time. Thousands died in the months following the spill, and the population has struggled to recover in the 25 years since. The U.S. Geological Survey reported earlier this month that the sea otters of the area had finally returned to their pre-spill numbers.

Listed as still not recovering are the herring, a group of killer whales and a type of North Pacific seabird.

## The Fate Of The Herring

Wills, who fished salmon as well as herring, said the spill left a huge mark on those who made a living from Prince William Sound.

Exxon sent money to people to make up for what they lost. But, the checks were too late and too little, he said.

"A lot of people got real hurt. I know a lot of guys committed suicide and all that stuff. I got divorced," said Wills, who now runs a bookshop and cafe in Homer, Alaska. "It was rough."

Among the scientific puzzles of the spill, the fate of the herring is a particular mystery. It's an extremely important species for the ecosystem, giving food and protein to whales, salmon, birds and others.

Prince William Sound was home to a booming spring herring fishery. It supported fishermen badly in need of cash coming off the long winter in between fishing seasons.

Researchers found physical changes in herring exposed to the oil. Then, four years after the spill, the herring population crashed dramatically. The reasons are a subject of intense debate, with suggestions that the effects of the spill could have made the herring weak against disease.

## Drop In Killer Whales

"No other (fish) stock in Alaska crashed in 1993, so that's indirect evidence it is spill-related," said Jeep Rice. He studied the spill for more than 20 years as a federal scientist. "That's kind of weak, and yet it is about as good as we can get in terms of explaining why it happened in that year."

The herring never really recovered, and the current population is too low to fight off predators. Herring fishing, with a brief exception, has been closed for more than 20 years.

The killer whales of Prince William Sound also have suffered. Two groups were hit especially hard. Scientists saw killer whales from one of the groups swimming through oil floating on the ocean surface. A Los Angeles Times photo showed whales from the other group swimming near the tanker as it gushed oil. Populations dropped dramatically in the year after the spill.

"The evidence is pretty compelling that it was a spill-related effect on those two groups of killer whales," said federal marine scientist Shigenaka.

One of the groups continues its slow recovery. The other numbered 22 killer whales at the time of the spill and is down to just seven. Scientists now expect it to go extinct. If it does, it would be the end of a genetic line that researchers say has hunted in the area for thousands of years, maybe since the last ice age.

The federal and state governments are still weighing the science of the spill's effects. Court cases will decide whether to seek more money from Exxon Mobil for cleaning up the remaining oil.
