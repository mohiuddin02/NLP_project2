In 2014, the average surface temperature of the Earth was the highest recorded since scientists began taking detailed measurements 135 years ago.

The Earth's average temperature has risen 1.4-degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, confirming that the planet is warming over the long term. This warming could cause coastal flooding, more severe storms, and global droughts, climate experts from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said Friday.

Scientists from NASA, the U.S. space agency, and NOAA relied on data collected from around the world: 6,300 weather stations on land, ships and satellite-connected buoys in the world's oceans, and research stations in Antarctica.

Experts from both agencies found 2014's temperatures to be higher than the average temperatures in the 1900s.

## Heat-Trapping Greenhouse Gases

Scientists at NOAA found the Earth's average surface temperature in 2014 was 1.24 degrees higher than the 20th century average of 57 degrees Fahrenheit. NASA scientists also found the Earth was warmer in 2014 than a base line period between 1951 and 1980.

Sometimes a new record in the Earth's surface temperature is caused by El Nino, a change in currents and temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. Worryingly, 2014 is the first time in 25 years that the record was not tied to El Nino.

December 2014 closed out the year as the warmest month ever measured, NOAA reported. May, June, August and September set new records for monthly highs, while October tied a previous high, NOAA said.

This hasn't been the only warm year lately. Nine of the 10 warmest years ever recorded have occurred since 2002, according to NOAA.

This long-term warming trend can only be explained by looking at the effects of human activity, such as burning fossil fuels that add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to Earth's atmosphere, scientists said.

"Greenhouse gas trends are responsible for the majority of the trend that we see," said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.

Because such emissions continue to rise, Schmidt added, "we may anticipate further record highs in the years to come."

## Record-High Ocean Temperatures

Although land temperatures in 2014 ranked fourth warmest of all time, record-high temperatures in the oceans drove the global average up. Ocean water retains, or keeps, heat longer than land. As water heats up, ice masses melt, causing sea levels to rise.

"This was very clearly the warmest year in the ocean records," Schmidt said. "It wasn't quite the warmest year in the land records, but combined, this did actually give the warmest year" since scientists began tracking global surface temperatures in 1880.

Last year was still the warmest ever despite a colder-than-usual U.S. winter caused by a "polar vortex," the scientific agencies said. The colder U.S. winter was balanced out by hotter periods elsewhere throughout the year, including blazing heat that worsened the drought in the Western U.S., and heat spells in Europe and Australia.

Russia's vast Siberian region and Alaska also saw warmer-than-usual temperatures in 2014. The city of Anchorage, Alaska, did not see temperatures drop below zero degrees in 2014. It was the first time ever.

Temperatures in the far northern latitudes of the Earth: northern Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, for example, are rising twice as fast as more temperate zones closer to the equator. The rising temperatures in the north are melting snow cover, making it harder for the Earth to reflect heat, the climate scientists said.

"We see significant decreases in spring and early summer months," said Tom Karl, head of NASA's National Climatic Data Center in North Carolina. "It's important because that's when the sun is high. A lot of additional heat is gained because there's less snow to reflect the sunlight back to space."

Arctic sea ice melted more due to higher summer temperatures, Schmidt said. The ice around the North Pole fell to its sixth lowest level ever, he said.

## "The Nature Of The Beast"

Meanwhile, Antarctic sea ice hit record highs in 2014, "which is a little surprising given the warmth on the rest of the planet," Schmidt said.

Antarctic sea ice is less tied to global temperatures, Schmidt said, and more influenced by local factors including wind and fresh water from melting ice on land.

Skeptics who doubt global warming often point to record-high temperatures in 1998 to argue that the warming has slowed down, or stopped. But NASA and NOAA scientists said the new data showed that there has been a steady rise in temperatures since the 1970s.

"2014 is exactly where we would've expected, before 1998," Schmidt said. "There are going to be periods when short-term trends go up and go down â€” that's just the nature of the beast. But there's no evidence that the long-term trend is much different from what it has been."

Tim Barnett, a marine physicist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said the evidence showed that warming had not taken a "hiatus," or paused, since the late 1990s.

"You have to interpret what you're seeing over the long haul," he said. "You have to look at a couple of decades at least before you begin to see that things have changed."

## All-Time Warm Years

Until last year, the warmest years ever were 2005 and 2010. The global average for 2014 edged those years by 0.07 degree Fahrenheit, government scientists said.

Between 1880 and 1970, the global annual temperature increased at an average rate of 0.11 degree Fahrenheit per decade. Since then, it has increased by 0.28 degree Fahrenheit per decade, NOAA data showed.

In the U.S., California, Alaska, Nevada and New Mexico saw all-time warm years in 2014. At the same time, most of the Midwest and East Coast experienced temperatures far lower than usual, NOAA said.
