Our distant ancestors may not have roasted marshmallows. However, telling stories and singing around a campfire may have played an important role in their lives.

A new study suggests that it may have expanded their minds.

Humans first learned to control fire about 400,000 years ago. The quality of their lives changed dramatically, a researcher believes. Brain size and stomach size increased, and predators became much less of a threat. Firelight also extended the day by several hours, according to the study.

The light interfered with melatonin production. Melatonin is a chemical in the body that makes people feel sleepy when it gets dark. Firelight let people stay awake long after the sun went down. Polly Wiessner is an anthropologist who studies how people evolved and changed over time. She wondered whether this new leisure time let people socialize in different ways.

## Talking During The Day

Wiessner argues that conversations at night around a fire are different than in the daytime. She published her study Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

"I think people are much more open at night by a fire," said Wiessner, who teaches at the University of Utah. Wiessner said that people always check other people's expressions. "But at night, people are mostly staring into the fire and expressions are concealed."

In 1974, Wiessner recorded conversations among the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen. They are a group of hunters and gatherers who live in southwestern Africa. The lives of the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen have changed since the 1970s. Now, they get only a small amount of food from hunting animals and gathering wild fruits and berries.

Wiessner originally hoped to learn how they kept up friendships across a vast area of 124 miles. Recently, she listened again to the recordings. She heard how their conversations were different during the day and night. Between 2011 and 2013, she returned to Namibia to record stories from people she had met in the 1970s.

The conversations took place between at least four or five adults and lasted for 20 to 30 minutes. She recorded 122 conversations during the day. About 31 percent of them were about searching for food or technology. Another 34 percent were devoted to speaking harshly about other people. Joking made up 16 percent of the conversations. Stories made up just 6 percent.

## Telling Stories At Night

At night, however, the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen gathered around a fire. Then they told stories 81 percent of the time.

"During the day, the conversation was kind of nasty a lot of the time," Wiessner said. "But at night they would mellow out and talk about the past."

The stories were mainly about the adventures of people they knew. They were full of information about Bushmen customs and traditions. From hearing about the experiences of other people, the listeners gained empathy, Wiessner said. In other words, they understood how other people thought and felt.

Wiessner doesn't think that the lives of the Ju/'hoansi in the 1970s were the same as our early ancestors. But their lives can help anthropologists imagine what our hunter-gatherer ancestors' lives were like, she said. They probably lived much the same way as the Bushmen hundreds of thousands of years ago.

Next, Wiessner would like to examine how the firelight affects our bodies. She hopes to measure what happens when people relax and talk by the fire.

She hopes other researchers will study firelight and other cultures. Wiessner would also like to know how the lack of firelight and storytelling time in our lives affect our sense of empathy.

## Nighttime Still Spent With Stories

After all, many of us are naturally drawn to fire. We like candlelight dinners, fireplaces with a roaring fire, or making s'mores during a family camping trip.

Today, electricity has largely replaced firelight. Yet, our nighttime hours are still often spent with stories. We watch our stories on television or read them in books, although that seems to be changing.

"Like hunter-gatherers, we work our imaginations, gain new (ideas) and expand our horizons from stories," Wiessner wrote in the paper. Even so, she added, electric light and computers are turning the night into work time for many people. They are replacing social and story time.
