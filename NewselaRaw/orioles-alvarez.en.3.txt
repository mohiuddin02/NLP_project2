In the Gulf of Mexico, Dariel Alvarez was afraid he might die. His boat had run out of fuel during his escape from Cuba. He had not eaten for days.

"I was scared to come so far and fall short," Alvarez said, in Spanish.

Two years later, the 25-year-old is considered one of the brightest prospects of the Baltimore Orioles. He is just one step away from his goal of playing in Major League Baseball.

His journey from a beach in Cuba to a spot on the Norfolk Tides, a minor league baseball team, was not easy. It is against the law for Cubans to leave their country without permission. Alvarez had to sneak off the island.

## Fleeing Cuba By Boat

Getting spotted meant being forced to return to Cuba and going to prison. Alvarez was willing to risk it, to help his family and follow this dreams. After a dangerous journey through jungles, and then across the Gulf of Mexico, he reached Mexico.

If Alvarez had been stopped before he got there, he would be suspended from playing baseball in Cuba. He would also go to prison. He left knowing he might never see his family again. He left without saying goodbye to several friends.

To play sports in the United States, Cubans need a special permit, called an unblocking license. Alvarez waited more than year for his unblocking license. He couldn't play baseball for that year. He also couldn't go back to Cuba.

Alvarez said the Cuban government won't allow him back into the country until 2021. He says he wishes the time would pass faster so he could hug his mom. When his grandmother died, he couldn't do anything but call home.

He considers other Cuban baseball players in America his brothers. They all have stories of escaping Cuba to play baseball in the major leagues.

## An All-Star Invitation

Alvarez has spoken to many of the Cuban players on different Major League teams. He looks up to them for succeeding and for representing Cuba in America. Some of them are star players, like Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox.

"They're examples to follow," Alvarez said. "They're Cuban, they came here, they triumphed. That's what we all want. Come here, succeed, and leave our names in this country representing Cuba."

This year, Alvarez has come closer to his goal of joining his friends in the major leagues.

In late June, the outfielder received an invitation to the All-Star Futures Game in Minneapolis. Many current All-Stars once played in the Futures Game. Four days after the Futures Game, the Orioles promoted Alvarez to Norfolk. Norfolk plays at the highest level of baseball before the major leagues.

## Orioles' High Hopes For Him

The Baltimore Orioles are aware of Alvarez's skills. They know they have a player with raw power, speed, and natural talent.

Defensively, he covers a lot of ground in the outfield. Coaches also know he has a strong throwing arm and can catch opposing baserunners.

Orioles manager Buck Showalter thinks Alvarez still needs to improve his batting. Showalter has high hopes for Alvarez and thinks he could play in the major leagues.

"We think he has the best arm of everyone" with the Orioles, Showalter said.

Alvarez's future was not always that bright. When he came to America, he signed a deal with the Orioles for $800,000 in 2013. His deal is smaller than those of the other Cuban stars of Major League Baseball.

The money was still an improvement from baseball in Cuba. Alvarez said he used to make just $12 a month.

"[The money] surprised me a little," he said about his deal with the Orioles. "Honestly, I would have taken whatever they would have offered me, because I wanted to play baseball."

## His Hopes For His Mom

Alvarez met his girlfriend, Patricia Canedo, in the U.S., and they're expecting a baby boy in September. Canedo, who Alvarez said immigrated from Cuba legally, is working to become an American citizen. The Cuban government might permit Alvarez's family to visit when that happens.

Alvarez hopes to introduce his mother to her American-born grandson someday.

"The only thing left to make me the happiest man in the world is to have my family by my side," he said.
