ORLANDO, Fla. — A little more than a minute after launch, space shuttle Challenger was ripped apart. The failure of a rubber seal allowed a spurt of rocket flame to ignite the spacecraft's giant fuel tank.

Challenger's disintegration high above Kennedy Space Center occurred 30 years ago this Thursday. Seven astronauts were killed, among them teacher Christa McAuliffe.

"We will never forget them," said President Ronald Reagan shortly afterward, in a broadcast in which he vowed that the nation would not give up on space exploration despite the tragedy. "The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them."

## Emotional Impact Has Faded

However, if Challenger's meaning seemed clear then, today nearly half the nation is too young to remember the loss or had not been born when it happened. Over time, the emotional impact of America's first loss of astronauts in flight has faded. With it, the drive to keep pushing into space has faded as well.

Challenger may have lost relevance in a nation now struggling to figure out the future of human spaceflight.

Howard Lieb, a New York dentist who lives part time in Florida, remembers Challenger's fate vividly. As a father, he has not forgotten the faces of McAuliffe's parents in news photos.

At the time of the disaster, he said, there was national will to try again and do better, to embrace Reagan's inspiration that "nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue."

## NASA Lacks Funds, Spacecraft

However, the country's attitude toward the dangers of space flight has changed over the past 30 years, he said.

Today, "we've begun to look at such risks as unacceptable," Lieb said.

How Challenger lessons will serve the nation's next era in space remains unclear. The government-run National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has neither funding nor a spacecraft to deliver astronauts to Mars anytime soon.

More immediately pressing for the nation's space endeavors is the rise of the commercial rocket business. Cape Canaveral saw 17 rockets launched last year, marking a 12-year high, and the launch count is expected to increase this year.

Private, billionaire-led companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin have helped restore excitement around space exploration. Such excitement had waned after the shuttle program ended in 2011.

## Challenger Center Keeps Vision Alive

However, at the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, the tragedy is far from forgotten. The center, founded in 1986 by the families of the astronauts who died, has expanded to more than 40 schools, universities and museums.

"When you enter a Challenger Center, all of them have pictures of the crew on the walls," said Lance Bush, the organization's president. "When children come in to get their briefings, they are told about these heroic individuals."

So far, more than 4.4 million students have visited the centers. 

Families of the seven-member crew lost in the shuttle Columbia accident in 2003 have added their support. 

"It's important to have programs like this that inspire adventure and discovery," said Laura Husband, 25\. She is the daughter of Rick Husband, commander during Columbia's ill-fated flight.

## Safety Still Not A Certainty

Roger Launius is associate director of Washington, D.C.'s National Air and Space Museum. NASA had once seemed supremely competent, he said, but following the Challenger disaster that image was lost.

After Challenger exploded, NASA pledged to redesign the shuttle's flawed rockets, and to remake the agency's approach to safety.

However, after Columbia disintegrated during re-entry 17 years later, the investigator of that disaster said NASA's safety procedures were still inadequate.

Bob Crippen was a pilot during the first shuttle flight in 1981 and flew three more times as commander. In his opinion, the lessons of Challenger and Columbia remain important today.

NASA did not respond adequately when it learned rocket parts had been damaged during spaceflight, he said. A lapse of this sort may be even harder to prevent with commercial launches, he added.

## Less Control With Commercial Launches

With commercial launches, NASA "doesn't have the same degree of control" over rocket parts, Crippen said.

Crippen noted that SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corp. suffered disasters with unmanned rockets during the past two years. He hopes that such disasters will provide a valuable learning experience.

Alex Roland, a NASA historian, said NASA was significantly weakened by two things at the time of the accidents: an extremely multilayered chain of command and intense political pressure to get the job done on schedule.

He said that leaner, private companies presumably would not be as likely to fall prey to the failures behind Challenger and Columbia.

"But I'm not so sure," Roland said. "I think they experience a lot of the same pressures because they are trying to get renewals and increases in their NASA contracts."

## Remembrance Of Past Disasters

A new effort at Kennedy Space Center could ensure that private companies learn from past disasters.

Last week, the center kicked off "Apollo, Challenger, Columbia Lessons Learned," a program that targets the emerging commercial space industry with education related to the disasters.

At the Space Center's Visitor Complex, artifacts manager Mike Ciannilli said he often hears stories from visitors who remember exactly where they were when the Challenger exploded: in a fourth-grade classroom; at home watching television with family; or outside, neck craned to see Challenger rising.

The memories remind Ciannilli that the moment does not belong only to NASA. Instead, the explosion created a marker in the lives of many who witnessed it, he said.

"It's such a pivotal event in their lives, much like the Kennedy assassination," Ciannilli said.
