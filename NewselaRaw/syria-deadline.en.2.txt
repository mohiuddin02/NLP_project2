GENEVA â€” Syria President Bashar al-Assad has one week to reveal what kind of chemical weapons his country has and where they are being kept, under a deal struck Saturday by the United States and Russia.

The agreement is aimed at ridding the Middle Eastern country of weapons like poison gas.

It sets a November deadline for eliminating that country's ability to manufacture and mix the weapons. All materials that could be used to make such weapons would have to be destroyed by the middle of next year. One U.S. official called the deadlines ambitious.

Under the agreement, inspectors from the international body that monitors compliance with chemical weapons bans would be able to inspect any sites in Syria immediately. Nobody would be able to get in their way. The initial inspections are to be completed in November.

## Syrian Opposition Unhappy With Deal

U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed the U.S.-Russian agreement, calling it an "important, concrete step" toward the goal of destroying the weapons. But he warned that "if diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act."

The prospect of a U.S. military strike seemed just hours away only two weeks ago. Now it appears not likely to happen at all. The agreement suggests that a military strike could be authorized if Syria does not follow the agreement. But the U.N. Security Council would have to approve an attack and Russia holds a veto on the council. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said an attack was off the table for now.

There was no immediate reaction from Syria or Assad. Syria's president said last week that his country would reveal the details of its chemical weapons stockpiles a month after the country formally agreed to the treaty that bans the weapons. But it seemed unlikely that he would openly resist a timeline agreed to publicly by Russia. Syria gets most of its military supplies from Russia.

Syrian opposition figures were not happy with the agreement. They said it failed to hold Assad accountable for the deaths of hundreds of civilians killed with poison gas. But rebel Gen. Salim Idriss said his group would help the inspectors to get their job done and would hold its fire when inspectors pass through government-held areas where rebels are fighting.

Idriss heads the U.S.-backed Syrian Military Council. He said the rebels would not agree to a general cease-fire, however. "In regions under our control, there are no chemical weapons," he said.

## U.S. And Russia At Odds For Months

But it was still unknown how other rebel groups like the Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant would respond. Both are affiliated with al-Qaida. They are also the Syrian rebels' most effective fighters.

Magnus Ranstorp is an expert on terrorism at the Swedish Defense College. He said that both groups do not like the United States, Russia or the United Nations. They could target the attempt to control poison gas. Rebels from Central Asia and the Caucasus have fought bitter battles against Russian influence in Chechnya and elsewhere and are especially likely to try to cause problems.

The agreement is spelled out in a four-page document. It marks a remarkable development in the 30-month Syrian Civil War. More than 100,000 people from both sides have been killed and 6.5 million people have been displaced from their homes in the past 2 1/2 years. Until recently, there also seemed to be no way the United States and Russia could agree about how the conflict should be resolved.

Only two weeks ago, the United States appeared to be just hours away from sending cruise missiles into Syria as punishment for an Aug. 21 alleged poison gas attack that killed hundreds of people. Russia was staunchly defending Syria. It insisted that the rebels, not the government, were responsible.

## Two Days To Hammer Out Agreement

At one point, Russian President Vladimir Putin called U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry a liar. Last week, Putin wrote a column that appeared in the New York Times. It accused the United States of violating international law with its Syrian threats.

Yet it took delegations from the two countries just two days to hammer out the agreement. There was little sign of bad feelings when the agreement was announced on Saturday.

The agreement itself also suggested that U.S. and Russian officials had shared intelligence with one another during the talks. The agreement says the two sides had agreed on estimates of the size of Assad's poison gas inventory. One official said the negotiators had concluded that that arsenal consists of about 1,000 tonnes of poison gas. A tonne is a metric measurement equal to about 2,200 pounds.

Kerry still indicated the U.S. did not completely trust Russia. He recalled what President Ronald Reagan said about dealing with the Soviet Union: "Trust, but verify." To verify means you have to check to make sure something is true.

"Verify, then verify" would be the new U.S. motto, Kerry said.
