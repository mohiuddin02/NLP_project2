MIAMI — Drones are remote-controlled planes that are used to fight terrorists and criminals. Now, they are about to take on an insect enemy.

On Sept. 2, a new type of drone began to be tested in the Florida Keys. It will join the daily battle against the black salt marsh mosquito.

The new [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) is about half the size of a Florida sea hawk. It won't spray or blast bugs. Instead, it will carry a special camera. This so-called thermal camera picks up differences in temperature.

The goal is to survey the area's mangrove swamps which are hard for people to get to. It is there that the marsh mosquito breeds, an awful lot.

## A Drone Called Maveric

Mosquitoes are born in shallow pools of water. In just days, they grow from tiny worms into buzzing blood-suckers. The hope is that the bird-size drone will be able to spot pools containing the insects. This could save mosquito-fighters time, effort and money. Right now, people on the ground struggle to find where the pools are.

The new drone may or may not turn out to be a good mosquito hunter. But even if it doesn't, the test shows how these planes with no pilots are quickly changing. Drones have changed the way wars are fought. They are used by the police. And now scientists and businesses are finding more and more ways to use them.

Drones have spotted outlawed hunting in Africa. They've tracked wildfires in California. They've filmed volcanoes in Costa Rica. Soon, drones no bigger than paper airplanes may fly though hurricanes.

The new anti-mosquito drone is called the Maveric. It was built by a small Florida company named Prioria Robotics.

## State's Biggest Mosquito Problem

"I would have laughed two years ago if you told me this could help with mosquito control," said company salesman Derek Lyons. "You put it in people's hands and it becomes like the iPhone. You have no idea what the applications are going to be.''

If the Maveric does work, it will be used to fight Florida's biggest mosquito problem.

Marsh mosquitoes don't spread dangerous diseases the way some other mosquitoes do. But they are all over the place, causing itchy bites. Every time it rains heavily or floods, huge numbers are born. To get rid of them, helicopters drop small doses of of bacteria on the insects. This kills newly born mosquitoes before they hatch and fly away.

About 80 percent of marsh mosquitoes are killed by the bacteria drops. But some escape. These adult bugs can be controlled by spraying insecticide. However, spraying is now forbidden in many places. The spray also kills certain rare butterflies.

## Spotting Where The Biters Breed

The goal now is to kill more of the unhatched mosquitoes. That means finding more pools of water.

The new drone is battery-powered. It weighs 2.6 pounds and its wings are just over 2-½ feet long. It can easily be launched by hand like a paper airplane. Or, it can be shot from a tube. The drone can fly for up to 70 minutes at about 30 miles per hour. As it flies, its rotating camera sends live video to a computer.

The drone costs $65,000. And it may not even work. Will it really be able to spot pools that are only a few inches deep? And just by picking up differences in temperature?

Fred Culbertson isn't worried. He's piloting the test flights. "Once we get down and work with them for a couple of days, we can probably tweak things to make it work."
