Tan Huiyan grew up in southern China in a town called Shaoshan. She remembers the feeling in the wintertime of stepping inside her house through the front door â€” and into the cold.

"People in my hometown always say it's colder in your home than outside in winter," said Tan, 31, who now lives in Beijing. "When I came home, I had to change into warmer clothes. After taking off my winter jacket, I had to put on very thick and padded pajamas. My Nike sneakers were not warm enough to be used at home, I always had to change into boots with furs inside, like those Ugg boots."

## Waiting For November

Winters can be very cold in Shaoshan. Temperatures drop to around 23 degrees in January. Despite these cold months, not everyone in China has access to central heating in their homes. About 60 years ago, the government divided the country into two sections. A line was established that separates the north and the south parts of the country. The homes on one side of the line have heat, the others do not. Tan's house was on the cold side of the line.

Each year on Nov. 15, the government turns on the central heating plants. People who live north of the boundary line will celebrate as their apartments warm up quickly. Those who live south of the line will face a season of cold.

Around 1950, China started installing centralized heat systems in residential areas. However, at the time, the country was facing an energy shortage. There was not enough heat for everyone. So a government leader named Zhou Enlai suggested the Qin-Huai line as a cut-off point.

The line divides two of China's largest cities, Shanghai and Beijing. Shanghai is located below the boundary so homes there do not have central heat. It is much colder in Beijing, the northern city that does receive heat from the government. There, temperatures only reach about 25 degrees in January.

## China Has Changed Economically

The United States has stricter laws on heating in residential buildings than China does. Residential buildings, like homes and apartments, are typically required to have a heating system for cold weather. The heat must reach a minimum temperature inside when the weather is cold outside. Chinese cities do not have these same standards. In areas where the Chinese government does not provide central heating, the residents have to find other ways to warm up inside.

Since the Qin-Huai line was established, things in China have changed a lot. Today, the economy is growing, which means that people have more money and resources than they did in the past. Private companies are now building homes and apartment buildings. The Qin-Huai line causes problems for people across the country and is considered by many to be an inconvenience. Cities below the line sometimes experience blackouts because so many people are plugging in space heaters since they need warmth in the winter. The space heaters overload the electric system.

## More People Should Be Warm

A professor from the Institute of Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning and Gas Engineering at Tongji University in Shanghai, said that the line does not satisfy people's needs anymore. Outdoor temperatures, not location, should determine what cities receive heat from the government.

Some government representatives and journalists believe the line should be extended to the south. The extension would give more cities access to centralized heat. The government is "no longer in shambles," they say. Now, it has the ability to let even more Chinese citizens experience warmth during the winter months.

There are different ideas about how exactly the line could be extended so more citizens have heat privileges. Heating systems that support entire cities in the north are inefficient. It may be better for individual homes or buildings to have their own centralized heating systems.

This type of heating system is more common in Shanghai. Many new apartment buildings there are built with individual heating systems for only the people living inside. The people in these buildings pay much more than people do in cities where the government provides heat.

## Heat Is Not Cheap

If you lived in Shanghai, you would pay about double the amount that someone pays in Beijing for the same level of heat. Since the government does not provide heat in Shanghai, residents have to use other expensive tools to warm their homes. They use individual gas boilers and electric heaters.

Tan, whose hometown was below the line, moved to Beijing in 2004. She is reluctant to go back to Shaoshan in the winter. She cannot deal with the "room temperature" inside the family's house since there is no heating system.

Now, she only spends Chinese New Year with her parents once every two years and stays with them for only a few days each of the visits. "It's really impossible for me to stand how cold it is indoors there," she said.
