Many have noted the historical parallels between the Syrians seeking refuge in the United States today and Jews fleeing Europe on the eve of World War II.

Among the many Jews who tried — and failed — to escape Nazi persecution were Otto Frank and his family, which included wife, Edith, and his daughters, Margot and Anne. And while the story of the family's desperate attempts may seem remarkable today, it's symbolic of what other Jews fleeing German-occupied territories experienced, according to American University history professor Richard Breitman. In 2007, he wrote about the discovery of documents chronicling the Franks' struggle to get U.S. visas.

Frank's efforts to get his family to the United States were thwarted by American immigration policies. These were "designed to protect national security and guard against an influx of foreigners during time of war," Breitman wrote. 

Some people make the same arguments against the Syrian refugees today and oppose a government plan to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees. Some Americans are worried that members of Islamic State, a violent group that has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria, could hide among the Syrian refugees.

The historian said the documents suggest "Anne Frank could be a 77-year-old woman living in Boston today -- a writer."

Instead, she died at the age of 15 at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.

## A Late Start To A Complex Process

Otto Frank tried relatively late to obtain visas to the United States. The complicated and ultimately doomed process was described in the nearly 80 pages of documents unearthed by the the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. Even Frank's high-level connections within American business and political circles weren't enough to secure safe passage for his family.

"The story seems to unfold in slow motion as the painstaking exchange of letters journeys across continents and from state to state, their information often outdated by the time they arrive," The New York Times wrote after reviewing the YIVO documents. "Each page adds a layer of sorrow as the tortuous process for gaining entry to the United States ... is laid out." These involved large sums of money, much paperwork and proof of how their entry would benefit America. "The moment the Franks and their American supporters overcame one administrative or logistical obstacle, another arose," the paper wrote.

By 1941, the Frank family had moved from Germany to the Netherlands. There, Otto Frank applied for U.S. visas.

## The Last Outpost Of Hope

"I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see U.S.A. is the only country we could go to," Frank wrote to his old college friend in the United States, Nathan Straus Jr., on April 30, 1941. "Perhaps you remember that we have two girls. It is for the sake of the children mainly that we have to care for. Our own fate is of less importance."

Frank asked his friend to potentially put up $5,000 to cover a deposit for the visas. "You are the only person I know that I can ask," he wrote.

Straus was well connected: son of a Macy's co-owner, head of the U.S. Housing Authority and, according to The Times, a friend of American first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Straus and his wife, Helen, appealed unsuccessfully to the State Department and the Migration Department at the National Refugee Service.

Edith Frank's brothers, who were in the United States, also tried to help.

Otto Frank may have been successful had he tried to leave sooner.

## Blackmail Attempt Spurred Family To Action

Before April 1941, Otto Frank's work was going well and his family was comfortable. Jews could not own businesses and work as government officials and Jewish children had to go to their own schools, but some of the worst moves made against Jews in the Netherlands hadn't yet been enacted. Frank preferred staying in the Netherlands under Nazi occupation to the insecurity of life as a refugee in a new country, wrote New York University professor of Holocaust studies David Engel.

A Nazi sympathizer attempted to blackmail Otto Frank. This triggered his efforts to get visas for his family.

But as the Frank family filed paperwork, immigration rules were changing. The American government was making it harder for foreigners to get into the country — and the Nazis were making it difficult for them to leave.

By early 1939, more than 300,000 names were on the waiting list to receive an immigration visa to the United States, Breitman wrote. By June 1941, most U.S. consulates in German-controlled countries had closed — meaning Otto Frank would have to have gone to Spain or Portugal, legally, to apply at consulates there.

Also, new U.S. immigration regulations meant the Franks couldn't get visas if they had any remaining close relatives in Germany. At the time, people believed that German authorities would use relatives to pressure refugees into spying in the United States.

## Family's Inescapable Fate

The Frank family went into hiding in 1942, a day after Margot Frank received a Nazi order deporting her to a labor camp in Eastern Europe. A month later, Anne Frank received a diary for her 13th birthday.

The family were eventually discovered and sent to concentration camps. Anne Frank and her sister, Margot, died of typhus, and their mother died of starvation. Otto Frank was the only family member to survive.

"It's difficult in times like these: ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality," Anne Frank wrote in 1944 in her diary before she knew the fate that awaited her. Her diary helped personalize the tragedies experienced by millions of Jews. "It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart."
