POWELL, Wyo. — On this moonlit autumn night, cars arrive at Wyoming's last drive-in theater. Pokey Heny is waiting there ready for another evening of entertainment in this small town.

Heny, 52, is the owner of the American Dream Drive-in. She collects $15 from each vehicle as they enter. She greets people by their first names, telling a 4-year-old girl she likes her stuffed hippo, named Martha. Then a mother and daughter roll up in an old truck. Heny lets them in for 10 bucks.

She looks out toward the big screen in the night. She sees families on top of cars, in lawn chairs and the backs of trucks. Dogs crouch between toddlers buried under wool blankets. And she smiles because she knows she's helping to preserve an important custom in this town. Powell is a town of ranchers and has just 6,000 people.

Heny's business first opened in 1949 as Wyoming's first drive-in. But, the future is in doubt as Heny battles Hollywood movie studios seeking to increase their profits. In the background lurks the shrinking popularity of drive-ins as they close one by one. Hers is the last one standing in Wyoming.

## Won't Let It Flicker Out

This year, Hollywood switches to a digital format, replacing film at drive-ins across the country. Old movies had film on rolls that were put onto projectors. That left Heny with a problem — buy a digital projector or close down.

The digital projector cost her $80,000. That's what she paid for the whole theater in 2004. At the first showing, the new machine stopped working. She had to tell 75 cars full of customers there would be no picture show that night.

But Heny sticks by her bet. "I'm investing in the town's future," she says. "So many businesses have closed, the bowling alley and video store. If I let this one go, it wasn't ever coming back."

Drive-ins have been failing for years. Since the top of their popularity in the 1950s, nine-tenths have closed. Their numbers have tumbled from a high of 4,063 to just 350 this year, says Kipp Sherer, who tracks the drive-in business on the website Drive-ins.com. Today, Alaska, Delaware and Louisiana have no drive-ins at all. Maryland, Rhode Island and Mississippi each have one. Wyoming once had 30.

Sherer says that for small communities it's one of the last places "where families can watch a movie and be themselves." It's an evening out "that doesn't break the bank."

## Holding Onto Yesterday

Heny wants to keep it that way. Though she updated to digital, she tries to keep everything else as it was when she was a child. She plays only family movies. She won't show slasher flicks because she doesn't want passing drivers to see bloody scenes on the big screen.

At the 7:15 p.m. start time for "Monsters University," a crowd waits outside the snack bar. Old records decorate the bar. Old style candy, such as Junior Mints, Dots and Hot Tamales, along with dill pickles on a stick, are for sale. There's bug spray to keep away hungry mosquitoes.

Suddenly, sound comes out of 1940s speakers that stand next to parking spaces. Two girls tell customers to tune to FM station 95.1 for sound. Some nights, bands of 6-year-olds cluster outside the projector shack. They make shadow puppets over the opening credits. "Just kids being kids," Heny says.

The nation's first outdoor movie theater opened in New Jersey. In 1933, Richard Hollingshead placed a Kodak projector on top of his car to play "Wives Beware," a movie about a no-good car salesman. The screen was nailed to two trees. A radio provided sound.

## Her Own American Dream

Years later, Paul's Drive-in opened on an old hay field in Wyoming. Besides movies, it offered pony rides along with boat rides in a small pond. A storm blew down the screen in 1955. But, the year after that the drive-in returned. The theater charged 50 cents for grownups and 9 cents for children back then.

In the 1970s, its name changed to the Vali Drive-in. The theater was the center of Powell's teen social life. "The girls came here because this is where the boys were," said Heny's sister Diana Fulton, who worked the snack bar as a youth. She now helps Heny run the business. "I met guys — that's why I worked here."

Then Heny took over the theater. In 2004, she changed the name to the American Dream Drive-in. "It really is the American dream to be your own boss," she said. "And there aren't that many female small-business owners in Wyoming." Most weekends she earns $3,000 which includes money made from the snack bar.

Like most nights, she's the last to leave, switching off the marquee out by the mural of the American flag. For a moment, she stands there, watching the lights dim on Wyoming's last drive-in theater.
