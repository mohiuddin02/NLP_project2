WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” U.S. first lady Michelle Obama announced a U.S. pledge of $70 million to help educate 200,000 adolescent girls in Pakistan.

Obama welcomed guests to the White House with the traditional Muslim greeting of "asalaam alaikum," or "peace be with you." She said the money will help Pakistani girls "fulfill their promise" to become the next generation of doctors, teachers and entrepreneurs. The money will help build more than a dozen schools, repair hundreds more and provide job training and college scholarships.

"These girls are all of our girls," Obama said. "I have passion for this issue because I cannot look into the eyes of young women and not see myself and not see my own daughters, and not want the best for them."

## Making A Difference For Girls And Women

Obama was accompanied Thursday by the Pakistan prime minister's wife, Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif. His daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who praised the first lady's global effort to educate girls, also attended the announcement.

Maryam Nawaz Sharif said Obama has inspired millions of girls around the world. Her daughters, Malia and Sasha, "could not have a better role model," Sharif said.

Joining hands with Obama at one point, Sharif said, "We shall see about making a difference and we shall not rest until every girl is learning and in school. We shall not rest until every mother is confident that her daughter will have a better life than what she had."

## More Than $800 Million In Pledges

The Muslim country recently promised to double spending on education, enroll more girls in school and provide more female teachers.

The first lady is leading a government effort to help more than 62 million teenage girls around the world enroll and stay in school.

Obama said in the past eight months, the United States has received pledges of more than $800 million for the Let Girls Learn initiative. It includes $350 million from Japan, $200 million from South Korea and $200 million in a partnership with the United Kingdom.

## Ripple Effects Help Communities

Susan Markham is the senior coordinator for gender equality and women's empowerment at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The agency delivers civilian foreign aid and works to end poverty worldwide. Markham said girls are less likely to attend primary, or elementary, school and are more likely to face barriers to get and complete an education. She said educating girls has ripple effects that go beyond helping just the individual.

"Empowering girls and ensuring them access to quality education has long-term transformational benefits for their future," Markham said before the announcement. It also helps their families, the communities and Pakistan's economic prosperity.

President Barack Obama and the first lady launched Let Girls Learn this year to help more than 62 million adolescent girls around the world who don't attend school. They have been urging world leaders to join the effort. Since March, the first lady has traveled to Japan, Cambodia and the United Kingdom to promote the program and recognize new partnerships.
