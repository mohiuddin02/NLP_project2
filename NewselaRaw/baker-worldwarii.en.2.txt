INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev. — Ernie Feld is still baking the same treats that once helped save his life.

Feld owns Ernie's International Pastries, a tiny pastry shop near Lake Tahoe, Nevada. He has been using the same recipes for years. Now he serves his treats to satisfied customers. During World War II, he was forced to serve them to Nazi officers who were holding him prisoner.

## Safe In The Kitchen

Feld spent the final years of the war as a prisoner in a Nazi camp. Because he was a gifted baker, the Nazis kept him in the kitchen. Meanwhile, other prisoners were forced to do hard labor or were sent to their deaths. Millions of Jews died in German camps, and Feld only narrowly escaped this fate.

Feld has a sweet, grandfatherly sense of humor, so you might not guess that he survived the Holocaust, one of the most horrific events in history. During World War II, Nazi soldiers killed approximately six million Jews. Feld survived, but more than 30 of his family members, including his beloved mother, Sara, were killed.

According to Feld, the only reason the Nazis didn't kill him as well was that they needed him to cook.

"Baking saved my life. If I wasn't a baker, I'd probably be dead," he said.

Feld was born in 1925 in Czechoslovakia, a country bordering Germany that later split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. His father died in an accident, and his mother supported their family by running a restaurant. Feld, who everyone called Ernie, grew up watching her bake, and soon he followed in her footsteps.

"When I was 14, I was always licking this and licking that," he remembered. "Mother would say, 'Are you eating again? I'm going to send you to baker's school.'"

For three years, Feld worked as an assistant baker while attending cooking classes at night. When war broke out, food prices soared. His bosses started sending him on bicycle trips into the countryside to try to buy eggs and flour, which had become hard to find.

## Strudel, Pasta And Pastries

In 1942, three years after the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, Nazi soldiers began rounding up the Jews and sending them to concentration camps, where millions were killed or forced into hard labor. Feld was just 17 years old. All his mother could do was watch as soldiers made him board a train taking him away from his home. He never saw her again.

Feld was taken to Hungary, where he began work as a cook at a farm camp. Then a Nazi leader heard he was a baker. He needed a good chef for an officers' club at an airport that the Germans were building. "He asked me, 'What can you cook?'" Feld recalled.

Feld was chosen for the job, and he wrote up a list of the ingredients he would need. The Nazis sent him into the city to shop, but made him wear a yellow armband signifying he was a Jew and sent a guard along to make sure he couldn't escape.

Over the following months, he prepared poppy-seed strudels, pasta with poppy seeds, pastries with frankfurters, and cannoli — which the Nazi officers said he cooked like an Italian.

Feld's cooking made him popular enough with the Nazis that they kept him in the kitchen. He enlisted other Jewish prisoners as kitchen helpers to spare them from having to do hard labor. He recalled how they used to stand around a huge table, rolling out their dough, feeling lucky to be alive.

## A Bittersweet Escape

By 1945, the war had turned against the Germans and they were on the run. Feld escaped and was saved by advancing Russian troops. When he made it back home, he learned that his mother and younger brother, Alex, had been killed. Cousins, aunts and uncles had died, too.

Feld eventually made his way to the San Francisco area, where he kept baking. Customers used to regularly ask about his original last name, Ehrenfeld, and he would be sucked into conversations about his past.

"By the time I finished telling people about my name, my pastries got burned," Feld joked. So he decided to change his name. "I told the judge I wanted to cut it in half," he said. Ernie Ehrenfeld became Ernie Feld.

Now, at age 90, Feld is slowing down. He sits at a table near the glass display case as his wife, Marika, does the baking, following recipes he taught her over their 22-year marriage. Since breaking his leg in a fall five months ago, he often uses a walker and wheelchair. "I used to give her instructions," he said. "Now she orders me around."

As Feld opened a box of photographs, faded images of his past, Marika whispered something to him in Hungarian. "She wants me to say that those Nazis are probably dead, but Ernie is still making his poppy-seed strudels," Feld translated, smiling.
