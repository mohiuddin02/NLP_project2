MIAMI â€” Yoani Sanchez is the author of the popular blog Generacion Y, which tells about life in Cuba. In a few weeks, she'll be running it as a full digital newspaper.

A dozen staffers of the online paper are getting last-minute training. But the Cuban government may not approve of the paper. Because of that, staffers are looking for original ways to distribute it through text messages, emails and digital memory devices.

She prefers to call her digital paper a "new media," Sanchez told the Hispanicize conference Tuesday in Miami. The paper will include the usual daily news. In addition, it will feature investigative reports, sports, and interviews.

Sanchez won't say the name of the newspaper. But, said she hopes it will launch in late April or early May. Releasing the newspaper's name could be risky in Cuba. Raul Castro runs the government, which controls all newspapers, radio and television stations.

## "Journalist On The Run"

"I am not a career journalist, but I have become a journalist on the run. That is my passion. I believe in the force for change that is information. I dream of working in a newsroom," Sanchez told a luncheon where she was awarded a prize.

The newspaper will be sent mainly through cellphones and emails, she said. Cubans have more cell phones than computers. Just 74 out every 1,000 Cubans owns a computer, says the government. Sanchez also plans to load the newspaper onto USB flash drives, DVDs and CDs.

She hopes the newspaper will be inserted into so-called Combos. These are DVDs and other large memory formats recorded with huge amounts of information such as movies and television shows. Cubans regularly pass them around hand-to-hand.

Sanchez's staff is also working on several backup ways of distributing the reports and getting around the government, she added. Some papers send their reports to supporters in other countries. Then, the supporters send them back to the island electronically.

Government officials will likely try to crack down on her digital newspaper, Sanchez said. The Cuban government may try block it from being sent around. She thinks the government may spread lies about the newspaper's workers or feed them false information.

Arresting the writers would be "clumsy," added Sanchez. Yet, several independent journalists have been charged under Law 88, known as the Gag Law. They've been accused of "publishing false news against world peace."

Sanchez noted that the Cuban government refuses to give work permits for independent journalists. Journalists who work for the state controlled media can get permits, however. She drew laughs when she said obtained a license for the closest type of work, typist.

## Tiny Private Businesses

Conference organizer Manny Ruiz introduced her as "a model for using her voice as a journalist and human being through the social media."

Cuba's parliament approved a new law over the weekend, which promises to make the country more open to business with other countries. However, the blogger said she doesn't trust the Cuban government. It has seized the properties of even politically friendly business leaders in the past.

This is a government that "does not respect" businesses, she said. Sanchez added, however, that people in other countries should support the growing area of tiny private businesses. Known as "self employment," these businesses can be as small as a single fruit seller.

Having the freedom to run your own business is equal to political freedom, she declared.

Venezuela is closely tied to Cuba. The Venezuelan government gives Cuba up to $10 billion a year in aid. Sanchez said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro appears to be following some of the Cuban government's ways of dealing with people who say things against the government. Venezuela refuses to recognize them and throws them in prison.

She added that some Cubans fear that the Maduro may lose control of Venezuela. Cubans worry that if Venezuelan aid were cut off, it might unleash a crisis.

Other Cubans believe that a change in Venezuela could force the Cuban government to open the country's doors further. It might open the country to businesses. Perhaps even political freedoms would be allowed, Sanchez said.
