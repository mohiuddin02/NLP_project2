As a child, Allison Adelle Hedge Coke had many problems. Her mother had a mental illness. She could not think or behave normally. She could not take care of her daughter, so Coke grew up in foster homes. She was also sick and fought cancer. "I really didn't believe I would make it through childhood," she says. "The act of writing brought me through."

Coke is now 56 years old and a poet. She has won many prizes for her writing. Coke teaches writing to make people feel better. Her students are cancer patients, young people, doctors and families.

Writing can help us think deeply, Coke says. It is a way to understand both the good and bad things that happen to us.

Reading also helps us to heal, she says.

## Reading Is Understanding Better

We learn through what happens to characters in books, Coke says. We feel what they are feeling. That is how we understand other people's lives.

Frank McCourt wrote a book called "Angela's Ashes." In it, he wrote about growing up poor in Ireland. Coke says reading books like that makes us feel a little less alone and sad.

Humans have always told stories to feel better. For example, fairy tales teach lessons about right and wrong. Holy books teach us about hope. Now doctors, and scientists who study the mind, are learning how reading and writing affect our health.

Raymond Mar teaches at York University in Toronto. He studied children and adults who have read stories their whole lives. He found that they were better at understanding other people's feelings. They understood other people's thoughts more.

Why? Because when people read stories, they imagine what it is like to be in the stories, Mar says.

## Talking About The Stories And Sharing

We try to understand characters in stories using our brain in the same way that helps us understand people in the real world. We put ourselves in their place. We imagine what they are going through. Then we are better able to treat others well, he says.

For adults, it doesn't matter what they read, Mar says.

With children, however, it is important to discuss what they are reading. Discussing the stories helps kids understand the story and share the character's feelings.

Mar says reading stories can help children and adults to talk about our troubles.

Some doctors think telling stories improves the health of our minds. Writing and reading stories can help doctors and patients to talk to each other.

## Writing, Listening And Letting Go

Dr. John Harper is a doctor at a hospital in Texas. He thinks telling stories and treating patients go together. He asks a writer to speak and teach writing classes to hospital workers each year.

Harper says doctors who read stories understand and care about their patients more. They become more willing to listen to their patients' stories.

Harper reads poems to his patients. He wants to show them and their families that he cares about them. Some of his patients could die from their illness. The poems show them that he understands their experience.

Writing is also healing, Harper says. He teaches other doctors to write about their experiences.

If you have an experience and you sit down and write about it, you can pour that feeling out, Harper says. You can let go of your feelings. Then you can move on with your life, he says.

That is the same message Coke teaches her writing students.

Writing it down lets us understand our life better.  We also learn to enjoy the fun parts more, she says.
