CUPERTINO, Calif. â€” Apple just got more flair. The giant tech company picked up extra swagger and song-picking savvy with its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics, a headphone and music streaming company founded by rapper Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, one of the first recording executives to roll with the hip-hop culture.

Wednesday's announcement came nearly three weeks after the press first reported that negotiations for a deal were underway. It's by far the most expensive purchase in Apple's 38-year history. It's a price that the company is paying to counter a threat posed to its iTunes store.

The price consists of $2.6 billion in cash and $400 million in Apple stock. The deal is expected to close before October.

With $1.1 billion in revenue last year, Beats is already making money. It will boost Apple's earnings starting in October, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview.

## Music Streaming Is A Big Deal

Iovine, 61, and Dre, 49, were the keys to the deal. They began working with Apple in the early days of its iTunes store and now will become key in Apple's music divisions, though Cook said their roles haven't been determined yet

"We have known these guys forever," Cook said of Iovine and Dre. "We've dated, we've gone steady and now we are getting married. This relationship started a decade ago, so we know there is an incredible cultural fit. These two guys have a very rare set of skills. It's like finding a particular grain of sand on the beach. It's that rare."

Cook indicated Beats' music streaming service was the main selling point in the deal. However, the headphone line also is expected to continue growing, too.

Although he regards most technology companies as "culturally inept," Iovine believes Apple will empower Beats to realize its goals. Beats is bent on improving the sound of digital music and creating playlists tailored for each subscriber.

"To complete our dream, we needed a company like (Apple)," Iovine said in an interview. "We couldn't finish this on our own."

## The Industry Keeps Changing

The growing popularity of music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify has been reducing sales of songs and albums. iTunes has dominated that business for the past decade. U.S. sales of downloaded songs slipped 1 percent last year to $2.8 billion while streaming music revenue surged 39 percent to $1.4 billion.

Although Apple broke into streaming with the launch of iTunes Radio last September, the service has not been as popular or as lucrative as the company expected, according to two people familiar with the matter. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.

ITunes Radio has 40 million listeners and will continue as a free service with ads while Beats Music will try to tap into the more than 800 million iTunes accounts to sell more subscriptions to its customized service. Beats Music currently has more than 250,000 subscribers, Cook said. That's well below the more than 10 million paying customers that Spotify's streaming service boasts.

Apple is counting on Beats to boost its cachet with teenagers and younger adults as it tries to remain a leader in digital music. That industry looks much different than when Apple reshaped the scene with the 2001 debut of the iPod.

## Who's Cool Now?

"Apple suddenly has regained its cool," said Sony Music CEO Doug Morris. He was one of the first recording executives to embrace iTunes at Iovine's urging more than a decade ago.

Beats was founded in 2008 by Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, and Iovine, a longtime recording industry executive. It now dominates the luxury headphone market. Its equipment is also a big seller in Apple's stores.

The purchase is the most clear sign that Apple CEO Tim Cook is leading the company in his own way. The previous CEO, Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011, favored smaller deals. He also didn't believe subscription music plans would be popular. Before Beats, Apple's biggest purchase had been its $400 million buy-out of NeXt Computer, a company that Jobs founded after being ousted from Apple in the 1980s.

Morris, who considers Iovine to be his best friend, believes Cook is making a smart move. He thinks it will give Apple even more credibility in the music industry.

"It's a game changer because Jimmy is that kind of guy who can change a game," Morris said. "I am not saying he is Steve Jobs, but he is a guy with new ideas and he really knows how to build the bridge between music and technology."

## Opposites Attract

But some analysts question whether Beats will be a good fit for Apple. The company makes most of its money selling hardware such as iPhones and iPads.

Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett says Apple would have been better off developing its own headphones in-house. It could have expanded into music subscriptions through iTunes, he said.

"It's hard to understand why Apple would have to spend $3 billion on a nascent streaming service and a line of bass-heavy headphones," Gillett says.

Yukari Iwatani Kane is the author of "Haunted Empire," an inside look at Apple since co-founder Jobs' death. She also sees it as strange.

"Culturally, Beats is the complete opposite of Apple," Kane says. "It's known for being loud and bold and in your face. It doesn't fit with Apple's understated, discerning brand."

## A Regular Guy In The Halls

Iovine has visited Apple regularly since he first met Jobs more than a decade ago. He said he has no worries about joining Apple.

"This is not a big company to us," Iovine said. "We can roller-skate in the halls here. Dre and I have been working together for 22 years. We are not about to go somewhere where we are going to fall."

Dre was calmer Wednesday than he was in a celebratory video posted online. It declared him as hip-hop's first billionaire after news of the Apple talks leaked earlier this month. "To be able to do something that could potentially change the world, I'm thrilled."
