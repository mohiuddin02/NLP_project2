LOS ANGELES â€” Airlines are trying to make more money by cramming more people onto planes.

The result is that some people are getting angry in the cramped quarters. In fact, some are getting into fights that have led to planes being forced to land before the trip is completed.

Amy Fine got into one of those arguments. She put her head on her tray table to take a nap on a Delta flight from New York to Palm Beach, Florida.

The passenger in front of her wanted to knit. She put her seat back and smacked Fine's head. A screaming match started. Flight attendants tried to calm Fine. She cursed at them in response. Then, she demanded that the plane land immediately. It did, in Jacksonville, Florida.

Two other quarrels caused planes to land early last week. A United Airlines flight was grounded when a passenger installed a plastic device called the Knee Defender. He wanted to prevent the flier in front from leaning the seat back. That started a fight.

## Smaller Seats, Bigger Crowds

Uncomfortable seats and shrinking legroom have become the things that travelers hate most.

Airlines have become more focused on making money, said frequent business traveler Alex Gerwer. "They don't realize you can't balance your budget on the back of passengers."

The tighter seating is made worse by increasingly crowded flights.

The airline industry does not apologize. Travelers who want more room can simply pay for roomier seats, said Jean Medina. She is a spokeswoman for Airlines for America. The group represents America's largest airlines.

"Planes are more full, a reflection of the fact that flying remains affordable," she said. "Fuller flights in turn help keep flying more affordable."

Not everyone sees value in less space on more crowded planes. Ira Goldman invented the Knee Defender. Goldman is 6 feet 3 inches tall. He needed something to protect what little legroom he had.

Airlines don't want to admit there is a problem, he said.

## Pay Less, Get Less Legroom

Airlines have also tried thinner seating materials. The thinner seats let them squeeze in more people.

Sometimes airlines use the extra space to add roomier seats. The seats go to first- and business-class passengers. Those passengers pay more money for their tickets.

But that can mean passengers who pay less get less legroom.

Spirit Airlines stuffs 178 seats on an Airbus 320. By comparison, United puts 138 seats in the same aircraft.

Airlines have also started charging passengers for extra legroom.

JetBlue's Even More Space seats offer 5 to 6 inches of extra legroom. They cost $10 to $65 more than the lowest-priced tickets. Spirit's Big Front Seat has 6 extra inches of legroom. It costs an extra $12 to $199 more.

Things are likely to get worse, said Jan Brueckner. He is a professor who studies the business of transportation.

Brueckner said he gets irritated when somebody leans the seat in front of him all the way back. "But I think people need to be more considerate in these tight cabins," he said.

## Flights Cut Short By Fights

Seth Kaplan, of Airline Weekly, predicts that passengers will continue to fly on airlines with tight seats. The reason is that the prices are so affordable.

Spirit Airlines, Kaplan noted, has the least legroom among all airlines. It also makes the most money on each dollar passengers spend.

But the crowding can prove too much for some passengers.

On Aug. 24, a traveler on a United flight from Newark to Denver found she could not lean back. The flier behind her had installed the Knee Defender. She threw a glass of water in the passenger's face and the flight was sent to Chicago, where the two passengers were removed.

On Aug. 27 on an American Airlines flight from Miami to Paris, passenger Edmund Alexandre reportedly began fighting with another traveler in front of him over a reclining seat. The argument got worse. Eventually Alexandre followed a crew member to the back of the plane and grabbed her arm, government lawyers said.

Federal air police on the plane put Alexandre in handcuffs and the plane landed in Boston. Alexandre could be charged with disrupting a flight.
