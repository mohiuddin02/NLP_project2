RIO DE JANEIRO â€” Before the World Cup started last week, [Brazil](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Brazil)'s streets were noisy with the bangs of construction work and the shouts of angry protesters.

Not now.

Now, it's the soccer that is making all the noise. The games have been packed full of goals and great moments.

Brazilian star Neymar kicked Brazil into gear. Then, the Netherlands' Robin van Persie soared and scored with an amazing header. On Sunday, Argentina wizard Lionel Messi conjured up a little left-footed magic.

On Monday, it kept coming. Thomas Mueller scored three goals for Germany in a shocking 4-0 thrashing of Portugal. Clint Dempsey scored just half a minute into the United States' World Cup match in an end-to-end 2-1 win over Ghana. And the first stage of the tournament isn't even done yet.

## All Teams Have Come Out Kicking

It's not just the big-name teams either. Costa Rica came back to win against a highly rated Uruguay. And then there was Switzerland's last-gasp winner over Ecuador.

"All the games we're watching, there's a lot of open play, there's a lot of beautiful goals. It's just wonderful to be here, isn't it?" Netherlands fan Paul Rolleman said.

Many people worried there would be unfinished stadiums and large street demonstrations. Instead, there have been a bunch of goals and no big protests. It could turn out to be the best World Cup in more than 50 years.

"High-scoring games, this is what fans are waiting for," U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. "They want to see goals."

And they have. From Sao Paulo to Salvador, the goals have flown in. The World Cup is averaging more than three a game. If this continues, it will be the highest-scoring tournament since 1958. In 1958, Brazil won the first of its record five titles.

In Brazil, soccer is known as "Jogo Bonito," Portuguese for "The Beautiful Game." Jogo Bonito is rubbing off on everyone, it seems. No one is playing defensively here.

"There's none of that. No game has been boring," German fan Andre Lien said.

## Play On!

The fans have reacted by filling stadiums and fan fests.

Of course, it's still the early days. Organizers can't let down their guard. There was a moment in Sao Paulo last week when Brazil's opening night seemed to be in trouble. One section of the floodlights flickered off, then on, then off again. Disaster loomed. Then the lights came back on and stayed on. And Neymar rescued Brazil with two goals. The home favorite came back from 1-0 down to beat Croatia 3-1.

There have been a few protests. Police clashed with protesters not far from Rio's Maracana stadium on Sunday night, while Argentina was playing Bosnia. In the northeastern city of Natal, torrential rain and flooding is threatening the World Cup experience.

But on the field, at least, the tournament has met the early challenge and more. Brazil's only worry there is if the goal-happy World Cup can keep up this breathtaking pace for a month.

"It's a big party," Netherlands supporter Rolleman said. "But I do need to get some sleep now."
