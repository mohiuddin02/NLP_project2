By now, Jeramey Winfield thought he would be working in downtown Chicago. He wanted to get his own apartment and start giving money to his family.

"I had this vision of helping my mom out, since she struggled to raise five of us. I wanted to give her some relief," said Winfield, who was the first in his family to go to college.

But more than a year after graduating from Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire, Winfield still does not have a full-time job. In fact, he said, he is rarely called back for an interview.

## They Did Everything Right

Unemployment is falling to its lowest level in years. However, recent college graduates across the country are struggling to find work. For young African-Americans with a four-year degree, the job search has been especially tough. According to a new study, they are having a harder time than whites finding a job. They also are more likely to be in a job that does not require a college degree and are being paid less than white workers with the same experience.

Even African-Americans who studied science, technology, engineering and math — winning fields in the job market — have had a hard time finding work, said John Schmitt. He is a senior economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research and co-authored the new report, "A College Degree is No Guarantee."

"We are looking at a group of people who did everything right," Schmitt said. "They graduated high school like they were told. They went to college and graduated. They entered the labor market, but they are more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts."

## Seeking That First Opportunity

Like Winfield, many of these graduates were the first in their family to attend college. They may face pressure from family and friends who expect them to be successful and help support the family. That has made their search for work all the more urgent, and their failure a greater hardship.

There are many reasons for the gap between whites and blacks. Black college graduates may not know people who can help them get interviews and jobs. More important, according to Schmitt, they can face discrimination.

Employers are more likely to offer a job to a white person than a black person, Schmitt said. Among recent black graduates ages 22 to 27, the jobless rate in 2013 was 12.4 percent, compared with 5.6 percent for whites.

"You have someone who went to the right school, worked really hard and was told they can be anything they want," said Robert Hawkins. He is an associate professor in poverty studies at New York University's Silver School of Social Work. "Then they realize that isn't true."

Anita Jenke is the executive director at the Career Transitions Center of Chicago. She said that some of the African-American gradates come from poor communities and their families rely on them to help with bills. They don't have the money to get to interviews. Sometimes they lack a working cellphone or Internet access.

"These kids have so much to give," Jenke said. "They are so motivated, so personable and committed to making it. They are accomplished and often they want to work helping to contribute to society. They just need an opportunity."

## Just Getting By

At Colby-Sawyer College, Winfield was a standout student who created the campus' first gospel choir.

"Jeramey is just a wonderful person who made our campus a better place," said the college's president, Tom Galligan, who became friends with Winfield.

His success in college, which he attended on a scholarship, is part of the reason Winfield cannot understand why he can't find a job.

"I feel like I'm a sharp and confident person," he said. "I've always gone above and beyond. It does make me think, 'Am I not good enough? What's wrong with me?'"

Now, Winfield scrapes by earning money from working with kids at his former high school. Occasionally, he will pick up substitute teaching jobs, which pay about $125 a day. The rest of the time, he volunteers as a youth leader at his church and searches for work. Winfield has an older brother who was shot and left paralyzed. His mother does not have much money and his siblings struggle to get by.

"Being rejected by the professional world has pushed me to go harder working at my high school and my church," he said. "Since I can't give what I learned to a professional environment, I know I can come back to where I came from and use it here. I'm still a success to the people here."
