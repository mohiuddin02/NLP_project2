WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama on Tuesday promised that more than $33 billion in public and private money would be directed to Africa. The United States, he said, wants to deliver business and development to the rapidly booming continent. At the same time, he wants to increase opportunities there for American companies.

Africa possesses many valuable natural resources, such as oil, minerals, metals, cotton and various foodstuffs. It is also a potentially enormous market for American goods.

Obama made the remarks as he addressed the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. The event was the first of its kind and the largest any American president has held with African leaders.

## Other Countries Also Want To Strike Deals

Countries including China have held similar events for years. All have sought entry to African markets  to obtain oil and other natural resources.

However the United States wants a different kind of relationship, Obama insisted.

"We don't look to Africa simply for its natural resources," Obama said. "We recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people." Africa's people are rich with talent and promise, he said.

Obama didn't mention any foreign competition. China, however, has been criticized for its behavior in Africa. Rather than developing businesses in Africa, critics say, it simply buys up raw materials like oil and minerals and processes them — treats and prepares them for use — in China. African countries do not get the expertise and greater profits that come with processing their own resources. In addition, Chinese companies in Africa rarely hire African workers, except for the lowest-level jobs.

"We don't simply want to extract minerals from the ground for our growth," Obama told the gathered African leaders. "We want to build genuine partnerships that create jobs and opportunity for all our peoples."

## Growth Opportunities Are Huge

To that end, Obama announced a $7 billion program to promote both U.S. exports to Africa, and the building of businesses there. U.S. companies have announced new deals in energy, aviation, banking and construction, he said. Together these are worth more than $14 billion.

In the past, critics have suggested the United States has been mistakenly ignoring Africa. Former President Bill Clinton, who preceded Obama in speaking, urged U.S. businesses to focus on Africa now.

"We are missing the boat," Clinton said. "This is a very important part of our future."

Speakers noted that six of the 10 fastest-growing countries in the world are in Africa. The continent's middle class is the fastest growing on Earth.

## "Hot Spots" Still Remain

Obama noted that the continent still faces "enormous challenges" in dealing with poverty, conflict, hunger and disease. However, he said, "a new Africa" is "emerging."

Tanzania President Jakaya Kikwete echoed Obama's remarks. Africa, he said, still has its "hot spots," but many of its 53 countries have changed over the past 10 years. Their leaders are now supporting strong economic and political policies.

"Democracy has taken root," Kikwete said. "There is stronger commitment now to fight vices, corruption, drug trafficking. There is more respect for human rights."

Nonetheless, Obama and other speakers pressed African leaders to crack down on corruption.

"People should be able to start a business and ship their goods without having to pay a bribe or hire somebody's cousin," Obama said.

Corruption in a number of countries hampers the United States to the benefit of countries like China, said Andrew Spalding, a law professor and expert on international business and corruption.

The United States aggressively enforces laws that prohibit U.S. companies from bribing foreign governments. Other exporters, particularly China, do not enforce such bans. They are thus at an advantage in countries where corruption is widespread.

## A More Favorable Approach

The push for stronger business ties with Africa comes at a favorable time. Many African countries are increasingly eager to process their natural resources inside their borders, rather than simply exporting their raw material.

The attention to Africa included a dinner at the White House late Tuesday night hosted by the president and first lady Michelle Obama. The menu included African dishes.

The U.S. approach to business in Africa "is almost the opposite of the Chinese approach," said Africa expert Witney Schneidman. He noted that when American companies like Microsoft, Procter &amp; Gamble or GE operate in Africa, they generally hire and train Africans. Their approach "has an incredible ripple effect," he said. "It helps to create skills, it helps to create this middle class."

Over the last 10 years, Chinese trade with Africa has grown more rapidly than U.S. trade with the continent, Schneidman said. However, "the African market is so large and there's such an opportunity there." There are, he said, "so many different needs that I think it's really about how do we get more U.S. companies into the continent."
