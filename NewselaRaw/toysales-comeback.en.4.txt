NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” The companies that make toys are very happy this year.

That is because people bought more toys in 2015. Sales went up more than they had in a long time. For several years, toy sales had not been very high. They were not going up very much from one year to the next, or were even going down.

So why are toy sales going up this year?

There are several reasons. Toys that match movies are becoming more and more popular. At the same time, new technology is making toys more advanced. Also, older kids are buying more toys than they used to.

## Movie Toys Are Very Popular

Movies have helped to sell huge numbers of toys. For example, there is the movie "Frozen." It came out in 2014. It tells the story of a princess who sets off to find her sister. "Frozen" was very popular, and so were the toys that were based on the movie. This helped last year's toy sales.

Movie-based toys are popular again this year. The new "Star Wars" movie comes out soon. Hundreds of "Star Wars" toys are being sold. Some are already selling out.

David Brandon is the head of the toy store Toys R Us. He hopes "Star Wars" will help to make people buy more.

## Toys Are Smarter Than They Used To Be

New technology is also helping toy sales. Toys are becoming more advanced.

For example, a new Barbie doll can talk to kids. "Smart Bear" is a talking teddy bear that helps kids learn.

Geoff Walker works at a large toy company. He said that technology can get kids more interested. That is harder to do these days. Many kids play games on smartphones. Toys have to be more interesting to keep up.

Toys are becoming more popular with tweens and preteens, too. They are kids between 8 and 12 years old.

New technologies are helping toys sell to preteens. The Meccano Meccanoid G15 is one of those techie toys. It is a 4-foot-tall robot, a machine that can walk and talk. Kids can build it themselves.

It is a toy that many kids might be interested in. Toy companies hope so. They want toy sales to keep going higher.
