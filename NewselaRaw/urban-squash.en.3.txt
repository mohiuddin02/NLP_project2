PHILADELPHIA â€” A funny thing happened to Sakora Miller when she was in seventh grade.

A group of strangers offered to teach her gym class a sport.

Everyone already knew how to play basketball, she remembered thinking. It was the most popular game in her poor Philadelphia neighborhood. What else is there?

"They were like, (it's) squash," she said. The game is played with a racquet, like racquetball or tennis. "And I was like, I'm not learning that. It's not for me."

Miller turned out to be pretty good at it. Now, she's the first former student hired full-time at SquashSmarts, the after-school program she joined in 2004.

## Squash, Tutoring And Travel

An inner city is not the usual place to find a squash program. Squash is often seen as a sport for the rich. Yet, SquashSmarts uses the game to help poor students through exercise and help with their school work. There are 15 inner-city squash clubs around the country

And interest is growing. The clubs serve about 1,400 city students in the U.S. That's not many. But they get tutoring and travel opportunities that most kids in their neighborhoods just dream about. Supporters hope to start four more programs this year.

The popularity of squash has really jumped in the U.S. The number of players grew from about 600,000 in 2007 to nearly 1.3 million in 2012.

Around the world, squash is a just regular game. It's played by millions of people in about 185 countries. But the sport took a different path here. In the U.S., squash is played mostly by wealthy fans in private sports clubs and schools.

Today, many squash lovers like that it's not just a game for the rich, said Tim Wyant. He is in charge of the New York-based National Urban Squash and Education Association.

## Began In Boston

The first inner city program was began by a former squash teacher in Boston in 1995. The program combined fitness with tutoring. Its goal was to keep at-risk students from dropping out of school. Over the next 10 years, the idea spread to Philadelphia and New York City.

The programs were helped by a lucky accident. U.S. squash clubs changed their rules. The new rules required them to build bigger courts. Squash is played inside in a court. And that left a lot of smaller courts, which weren't used anymore, said Kevin Klipstein. He serves as president of U.S. Squash, which is in charge of the sport.

In Philadelphia, about 120 students belong to SquashSmarts. They are in the fifth through 12th grades. The program provides kids with all their uniforms, equipment, snacks and tutoring.

SquashSmarts finds its players in public schools. The school district encourages students to play. This is because it doesn't have enough money to offer sports like squash, said Robert Coleman. He is in charge of athletics.

Students are still puzzled by squash when they first hear about it. But SquashSmarts gains new players all the same.

## "Change In A Community"

Joshua Smith, 13, was one of the doubters when SquashSmarts staff visited his middle school. His first thought was, "What is squash? That's stupid."

"And then I tried it," the eighth-grader said, "and I love it now."

SquashSmarts tracks players' heart health and grades. It also keeps track of whether students go to college. The school district has a high dropout rate. But everyone who stayed in the club for seven years has graduated and goes to college, said Stephen Gregg, who runs SquashSmarts.

Hiring Miller brings the program full circle, he said. Miller is now 23. She is finishing her degree from Penn State. She is the program's new squash director.

When a SquashSmarts student becomes one of the heads of the program that "is change in a community," Gregg said.
