MOJAVE NATIONAL PRESERVE — Out in the desert 14 miles south of Baker, Calif., molecular biologist and businessman J. Craig Venter is field-testing a new technology. It will, he says, completely change the search for extraterrestrial life.

Venter says the technology will discover and decode DNA — the basic building blocks of life — hiding in soil or water samples collected on other planets. Finding that DNA will prove once and for all that we are not alone in the universe.

Venter claims the technology also will be able to beam DNA sequences back to Earth. And he says scientists will then be able to do something simply amazing: They will be able to reconstruct living copies of alien lifeforms in a lab.

What he's talking about would work something like a fax machine: Transmit a message in the form of a DNA sequence; hit print; and presto: a living organism prints out.

## A Stand-In For Mars

"We can re-create the Martians in a P-4 spacesuit lab, if necessary," the 67-year-old says matter-of-factly.

It may sound outrageous, but Venter's idea has captured the attention of scientists at NASA's Ames Research Center. Half a dozen scientists from Ames are on hand to assist in the field test. They include experts in astrobiology, geology and planetary and environmental science.

The idea of building a device that could land on Mars, or one of Saturn's moons, and analyze samples without having to return to Earth is very appealing: Such a device would save billions of dollars. It also would get rid of the risk of bringing home alien diseases, said Ames Director Simon "Pete" Worden.

"The next mission to Mars will be in 2020," Worden said. "That mission may well have this (technology) on it."

The Mojave Desert has long been used for Mars exploration simulations.

Such was the case when a team from NASA and from Venter's lab trudged through the desert last weekend, flipping over rocks. They were, as Ames planetary scientist Chris McKay put it, in search of a bacteria with "super powers."

The bacteria they were looking for is a green crud called Chroococcidiopsis, which can be found covering the bottom of quartz rocks. Chroococcidiopsis is highly resistant to radiation and extreme temperatures. And the stuff refuses to die when deprived of air and water.

Scientists believe this is the sort of thing that may be hiding out on other worlds. For that reason, the team plan to use it in their Mojave test run.

"We're in love with this organism," McKay said. "It's the closest thing we have to Martians."

## Testing The Sending Unit

The game plan was to load samples of the bacteria into a DNA sequencer. This will determine the unique order of four repeating nucleotides, or chemical "letters," found in the bacteria. That sequence of "letters," its DNA sequence, represents the hereditary information or genetic code that makes this particular organism what it is.

Once that's accomplished, the bacteria's DNA sequence will be uploaded. Scientists at Venter's company, Synthetic Genomics, will then download it.

In the Mojave, all this work is taking place in a huge trailer. And it requires a team of scientists. If it's ever going to be used on Mars, the technology is going to have to be streamlined. It will have to be roboticized and shrunk to a fraction of its current size.

"It needs to be the size of a shoe box," McKay says.

The desert field experiment was a test of the unit that would send back information from Mars. As for the receiving technology, that already exists as well, Venter said. The device, which downloads a DNA sequence and prints out the corresponding nucleic acids, will be available for sale in 2014.

Venter says it ultimately will be the size of a computer printer.

This technology will have many uses on Earth, Venter said. For example, people will be able to "download" vaccines and produce insulin, among other medicines, at home.

The U.S. government could use it to identify biological weapons in the field — perhaps dropping a sequencing unit from an aircraft. Scientists would be able to identify the organisms in the safety of their lab thousands of miles away. Additionally, health agencies could use it during outbreaks of disease.

"We hope to sell a lot of these machines," Venter says.

## Life Out There In Space

As daylight faded and the scientists wrapped up their day's work, Venter and the others began to chat. The main topic of conversation: life elsewhere in the universe.

"They sent (NASA's Mars rover) Curiosity to the last place on Mars where they would find life," complained one scientist.

"And it has a tiny drill," lamented another.

Venter said the key to finding evidence of life on Mars would be digging deep into the planet, perhaps as deep as a kilometer or more. It is there, he feels, that water may exist.

"I would not bet on finding any microbes on or near the surface of Mars," he said.

But why stop with the Red Planet? A biological transporter should be sent to the Saturnian moons Titan or Enceladus, one expert argued. Enceladus is thought to have liquid water beneath its frozen surface, and it spews ice into space. That ice ultimately becomes part of Saturn's rings.

"I could think of a lot more interesting places to go than Mars," Venter said.

Scientists believe that every fifth star in our galaxy has a planet that might hold liquid water — a key ingredient for life. That means billions of planets in the Milky Way have the potential to be inhabited by living organisms.

In the face of such odds, Venter said, he's astounded that some people dismiss the idea of life beyond Earth.

Venter shook his head. "And people think I have a big ego," he said.
