WASHINGTON â€”For a national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner" is very hard to sing. Even some professional singers have forgotten the words.

The anthem is a musical symbol of the country sung before major sporting and government events. It stirs deep feelings among U.S. citizens.

The words were written by lawyer Francis Scott Key to honor the flag flying over Fort McHenry in Baltimore. It was written during the War of 1812, which was fought against the British.

The song is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year. The celebrations began on June 14, Flag Day, with a kickoff event at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. At the museum, the song's manuscript, or paper it was written on, has been placed together with the actual flag that inspired it for the first time.

## The Flag And The Lyrics Side By Side

"People sing the song all the time, but don't know anything about it," said Jennifer Jones, an expert on military history at the museum. "These words that we sing were inspired by this flag. Having them in the same place at the same time is exciting."

Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and others attended an event at the museum displaying the manuscript and the flag on June 14. There was a concert named "Anthem for America." The anthem was sung in more than 40 places nationwide at the same time.

The song has been the country's official national anthem since 1931. Until then, it was one of several patriotic melodies featured at official or military events.

The lyrics were written in 1814 by Key as a poem after he watched the Battle of Baltimore from a ship in the harbor. He saw the enormous flag "at dawn's early light." It was a reminder for the fighters about the young American democracy.

"Key was a gentleman poet," Laura Rodini, marketing director of the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore, said. The society owns the manuscript and is loaning it to the Smithsonian through July 6. "He wanted to capture the moment."

Key was on the ship to help release a doctor held by the British. He wrote the four verses on a single sheet in honor of the defenders of the fort. He called it "The Defence of Fort McHenry."

The verses were published in a newspaper and became popular quickly. Key's description of the flag as "The Star-Spangled Banner" became the name of the song. It also became the name of the giant flag made by Mary Pickersgill that Key saw that day.

## Those Tricky High Notes

But why is the song so hard to sing?

Because "it was written for a man who had an extremely high voice," said Loras John Schissel at the Library of Congress.

Many singers can't remember the words. That happened to pop star Christina Aguilera at the beginning of Super Bowl XLV in February 2011.

Others also have flubbed the lyrics or the tune. But this year was different because Super Bowl XLVIII organizers brought in an opera superstar to sing the song.

"She absolutely killed it," said BuzzFeed.

Historians want the melody, the words and the flag to all come together for the public during the celebrations.

The song has become much more than poetic words and popular music.

"We hope as a national museum, people will be inspired to learn more about history and to be part of history," Jones said.
