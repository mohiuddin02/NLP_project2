WASHINGTON, D.C. — Gay people in most states are now free to get married.

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court made a big decision. The decision cleared the way for gay people in more states to get married.

Five states went to the Supreme Court. They asked the Supreme Court to permit them to make same-sex marriage illegal. Same-sex marriage is when a man marries a man or a woman marries a woman.

The five states did not want to let gay couples get married within their borders. A gay person is attracted to a person of his or her own sex.

## The Highest Court In The Land

Lower courts had ruled that the states can't treat gay people unfairly. They must let gay people get married just like anyone else. If people disagree with a lower court's decision, they can take it to a higher court. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. Its decisions cannot be challenged.

On Monday, the head of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, began the court's new term. He did not say a word on the issue of same-sex marriage. His silence meant that the lower court decisions will become law in the five states. They are Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. Those states must now allow same-sex marriage.

Same-sex couples in six other states should be able to get married soon. The states are Colorado, Kansas, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming. All of these states tried to ban same-sex marriage. In each case, federal appeals court judges ruled that the states could not do that.

The Supreme Court's decision was not expected. It surprised people on both sides — both people who support gay marriage and people who oppose it. Same-sex marriage still isn't allowed in every state. However, gay people can now get married in 30 states and the District of Columbia.

Neither side is completely happy with the Supreme Court.

Evan Wolfson is the president of Freedom to Marry. The group is in favor of same-sex marriage. He said the Supreme Court should "finish the job." He said it should allow same-sex marriage in every state. Wolfson said it's unfair that gay people are allowed to marry in some states but not in others. He called it harmful and insulting that gay people are not allowed to get married in every state.

## Both Sides Wanted A Decision Once And For All

Ed Whelan is with the Ethics and Public Policy Center. The group is against same-sex marriage. He said the justices did not act responsibly. Whelan thinks the Supreme Court should have heard the case. Then, he said, it should have outlawed it across the country. So many states allow same-sex marriage it will be hard to stop it.

Both sides wanted the justices to decide the issue once and for all.

They said the Supreme Court should settle something this important. It should not have left the decision to lower court judges.

To hear a case, four of the nine justices must vote. To make a decision in a case, though, at least five justices must agree. No one knows how the justices voted. It's not known why they decided not to hear the case. There are some clues, though.

There are two groups on the court. Each group often votes in the same way. Justice Anthony Kennedy is more or less in the middle. It's possible that neither group really wanted to deal with gay marriage at this time. It also may be that Kennedy did not want to make a decision. He would likely be the tie-breaker.
