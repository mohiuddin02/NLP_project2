The United States wants to build a new top-secret warplane. The bombers could cost billions of dollars.

Two teams of airplane makers are competing to make them. The winner is expected to be chosen this spring.

Experts do not agree over whether the United States needs a new bomber or not. Some say the new warplane is necessary to protect the country. Others call it a big waste of money. It could wind up being one of the most expensive planes the government ever built.

"You're talking about a $2 billion airplane by the time they build it," said Thomas Christie. He was an expert at the government's Department of Defense for more than 30 years. "It's a disaster waiting to happen."

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is the head of the Defense Department. "I think the Long-Range Strike Bomber is absolutely essential," he said last month.

## Building Jobs Too

Air Force officials say they need the new plane. It would be so secret when it flies that it would not show up on enemy radar. They said the stealth bomber would eventually be able to carry nuclear weapons. They also want to fly it with remote controls as a drone.

Other details are a closely guarded secret.

For elected officials, however, the bomber means one thing. It means more jobs. They want to know what their state will get out of the deal.

Workers in the Palmdale, California, area have built many of the country's airplanes. The towns lost many jobs in the last few years as companies stopped making as many airplanes. The towns are struggling.

The project is secret. None of the airplane makers can talk about it, said Palmdale Mayor James Ledford. "But we can."

The competing teams are led by Northrop Grumman and Boeing Company. If Northrop wins, it would build most of the bomber parts in Palmdale, Ledford said. It would bring about 1,500 jobs to the area.

Lockheed Martin Corporation would work with Boeing. If that Boeing-Lockheed team wins, they would create about 700 jobs, Ledford said.

"It would be the answer to all our prayers," said R. Rex Parris, mayor of neighboring Lancaster, California. Many people in his town do not have jobs.

## The Price Could Go Higher

The U.S. Air Force will make the final decision.

The military has promised not to spend more than $550 million per bomber. The Air Force plans to order as many as 100 of the new planes as soon as late spring.

Boeing, Northrup and Lockheed have all built planes for the government. They all ended up costing far more than expected.

Northrop developed the first B-2 stealth bomber. It was black and shaped like a boomerang. The original B-2 bomber cost so much to make that the government built just 21 of them. It originally wanted to build 132. Each one cost more than $2 billion.

Todd Harrison is an expert on warplanes. He thinks the new stealth bomber program would actually cost $90 billion. That comes to about $900 million for each plane.

Congress' staff members have often said the new bomber is not necessary. In 2013, they said the government should wait 10 years until technology improves.

Lancaster Mayor Parris really wants the bomber to be built. It would bring jobs to the area, including at restaurants, stores and other companies. From his point of view, jobs are what is important.

"It would be so great," Parris said, "to see it all come back."
