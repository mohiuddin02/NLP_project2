LONDON — British teenagers won't be studying "To Kill A Mockingbird" and other American literature for a major high school exam anymore. Michael Gove, the country's education minister, called for more British works to be studied.

New guidelines are almost exclusively focused on writers from Britain and Ireland.

Some readers and professors are outraged. And some educators fear that could lead to the narrowing of British minds.

"The idea of cutting out American books because they are not British is crazy," said John Carey, a professor at Oxford University.

## Off With Their Literary Heads

Exam boards in England and Wales set school syllabuses in line with government rules. On Friday, they finished releasing their new book lists for the English Literature GCSE. GCSEs are exams taken by 16-year-olds after a two-year course of study.

John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" and Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" are no longer on the lists. Neither is Arthur Miller's play "The Crucible." African and Asian writers including Haruki Murakami and Chinua Achebe have also been dropped.

The exam boards dropped the books by Americans and others in an attempt to make the school syllabus harder.

New government rules say GCSE pupils must study high quality and intellectually challenging works. These include a 19th-century book, a selection of poetry, a play by William Shakespeare and a book written after 1914 "from the British Isles."

Previous rules mentioned modern writers, but didn't say they had to be British. The previous rules also said students must study authors from different countries. The new rules do not.

Gove strongly denied that his goal was to shut out non-British authors.

"I have not banned anything," he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper. "All we are doing is asking exam boards to broaden — not narrow — the books young people study for GCSE."

## Who Made The New List

The education department says the guidelines just say what students are required to learn to pass the exam. Those who read more widely will do better on the exams, the department says. It also says pupils are required to study important world literature between the ages of 11 and 14.

Gove has been education secretary in Britain's government since 2010. He has faced strong opposition to his plans before. Many professors condemned his plan for history lessons to teach students more about British history. A Cambridge professor said Gove's changes to primary education took schools back to Victorian times.

The new book lists include a wide sample of modern British literature. They range from George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and William Golding's "Lord of the Flies" to Kazuo Ishiguro's book "Never Let Me Go," and Alan Bennett's play "The History Boys."

The 19th-century books on the lists include "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens and "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley.

## "#Mockingbird" Trends On Twitter

But debate on the changes has mostly been about the loss of "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Of Mice and Men." Several generations of Britons remember those two books from their school days.

Few commentators had anything bad to say about "To Kill A Mockingbird," Harper Lee's book about a girl learning about racism and justice in the American South. Outraged fans of the book even got the hashtag "#Mockingbird" trending on Twitter after Gove's changes were announced.

But not everyone was upset about the loss of "Of Mice and Men." Janice Turner, an opinion writer, welcomed the dropping of Steinbeck's book. She said it was studied for all the wrong reasons: "because it is short, simple and has a moralizing 'message': bullying is bad."

Carey, the professor, said he could relate to Gove's efforts to get students reading literature. But he was upset about the loss of the two American books.

"It's true ... 'Of Mice and Men' is set just because it's short, but it is nonetheless a marvelous book for teaching," Carey said. "It's a wonderful book, deeply human." And reading "To Kill A Mockingbird, he said, can change the way you think.
