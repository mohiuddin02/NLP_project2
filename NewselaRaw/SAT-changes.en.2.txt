LOS ANGELES — Students taking the SAT college entrance exam will no longer be required to write an essay as of 2016, it was announced Wednesday. The change is one of many being made to the test by the College Board, the owner of the SAT.

However, an optional essay-writing section still will be offered. Many colleges may demand that students take it and submit the score.

The main SAT will be cut to two sections from the current three. The top score possible will be 1,600 which it was for many years.

The present 2,400-point top score was introduced with the start of the required essay seven years ago. The new optional essay test will be graded separately, said officials of the College Board.

## "More Focused And Useful"

The shifts are part of wider effort. The goal is to make the test more of a reflection of what students learn in high school and will need in college. It is also meant to minimize the advantages students may gain from expensive private tutoring.

For example, the revised sections in reading will drop their most unusual vocabulary words. It will instead "focus on words students will use over and over again," said College Board President David Coleman. The math problems will be more linked to real-life questions.

"We commit today that the redesigned SAT will be more focused and useful, more clear and open than ever before," Coleman said.

The College Board long had argued that coaching does not help students significantly. But Coleman admitted that many people believe students who can afford tutoring have an advantage.

To help address that issue, the College Board is starting a partnership with the online Khan Academy. It will offer a free series of practice exams and videos about good test-taking practices. Khan Academy has become one of the most popular online-education sites.

Analysts said the steps arise from both the College Board's self-interest and public interest.

## SAT Apes ACT

Two years ago, the rival ACT — which most colleges also accept — surpassed the SAT in the number of test takers across the nation. About 1.6 million students took the SAT last year. More than 1.7 million took the ACT. Some take both to be on the safe side.

In some ways, the new SAT will become more like the ACT. The rival test has an optional writing section that many colleges require. The SAT also will switch to the ACT model of grading, in which only correct answers are counted. The SAT currently deducts points for wrong answers.

Critics have argued for years that the SAT is not fair to some low-income and minority students. Critics also say that high school grades are a much better predictor of how well a student will do in college. Some colleges no longer require any exam at all.

The new exam appears to be aimed at representing the interests of ordinary people. It is more connected to the new federal [Common Core](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Common+Core) teaching standards, which test critical thinking and close reading. Without the essay, it is also less time consuming.

Many colleges could have a problem with the essay being dropped. The University of California system is the single-largest customer of the SAT. UC administrators 10 years ago pushed for and won a set of reforms in the SAT. The addition of the essay was one of them.

Stephen Handel works in undergraduate admissions for the UC system. He said it was too soon to say whether UC will continue to require the essay.

But he and other UC administrators noted that the system requires essays from possible students. The SAT writing sample is just one part of a much wider set of grades and personal achievements. The SAT essay, he said, "has a place, but a limited place."

## Optional Essay Criticized

Coleman said Wednesday that college admissions officers were divided over the value of the essay.

The new optional essay will be more closely linked to the texts presented to students.

However, some experts said making the essay optional sends a bad message.

"I'm not sure it is a good signal to kids in schools about the importance of writing," said Katy Murphy. She is president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The change also will confuse high school seniors who may be unsure how to fulfill testing standards that will be different for different colleges, said Murphy.

In one area, the College Board will be making it potentially more difficult for students. Now test takers are allowed to use calculators throughout the math questions. But starting in two years, calculators will be banned during some of the math testing.

Another change will be that the SAT will start to be offered online as well as in the traditional paper form.
