SAVANNAH, Mo. — Gary Silverglat loves animals.

About 13 years ago, Gary started Angels Vet Expresscare. The clinic gives medical care to animals. Now it treats 100,000 animals each year. It does not charge much.

Veterinarians are animal doctors. They want to know his secret.

Gary is happy to tell them. He wants everyone to know. Angels Vet cares for many animals, Gary said. So the clinic can charge less for each one.

He wants people to know something else. Angels Vet takes care of all animals. It never turns away an animal. It does not matter if their owners cannot pay.

## Vet Care Can Cost A Lot

People in the United States love their pets. They spend much money on vet care. In 2014, Americans spent $15 billion for vets. The number comes from the American Pet Products Association.

Vet care can cost a lot of money. The clinic helps poor families with pets. These families do not have much money for pet care. The clinic treats their pets very cheaply. Angels Vet also treats rescued animals. These animals do not have an owner.

Gary and his wife moved to the area more than 30 years ago. Her name is Lisa. They saw many animals without a home. People did not want these animals any more. They just left their pets someplace.

## A Way To Help More Animals

Gary decided that he and Lisa needed to take action. They started an animal rescue group. The rescue group gave the animals a home. Soon, Gary and Lisa realized something else. They could help even more animals by giving them vet care.

Seven veterinarians work for Angels Vet. The clinic also has some volunteers. They help out for free.

Angels Vet treats about 60,000 pets each year. It treats 40,000 rescue animals. Many of them are treated for free.

Running Angels Vet is not easy, Gary said. It takes a lot of money. He has spent millions of his own money. He is also thankful for the help he gets.
