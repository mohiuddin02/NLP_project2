Jake Olson is blind. He also loves football.

Olson dreams of playing football with the Trojans. The Trojans are the football team of the University of Southern California (USC). Olson has loved the Trojans for years.

Olson lost his sight when he was 12.

## Losing His Sight, Keeping His Dream

Olson is now a high school student. He is in his last year at Orange Lutheran High School.

Olson never stopped wanting to play football. It seemed impossible because he is blind.

Then he thought of a way. He would become a long snapper. Long snappers do not need to see the ball or other players.

A long snapper passes the ball to a player behind him. Another player then kicks it forward. He tries to score a field goal.

Olson spoke to Orange Lutheran Coach Chuck Petersen. He asked Coach Petersen if he could join the team.

## Working Hard To Make The Team

Petersen said he would give Olson a try.

Things were hard for Olson at first. He had to practice over and over. Olson got much better over time. Eventually he made the team.

Teammates guide Olson onto the field. Then they help him line up with the ball. Olson is no different from any other player except for that.

"We didn't see him as a blind person," kicker Jerry Fitschen said. "We saw him as a football player."

## The Kick Is Good!

Olson had an exciting moment last season. His team was playing against Servite High. The score was 25–22.

The game was almost over. Olson came on for the snap. "Everything kind of got quieter," he said. "Well this is pretty cool," he thought to himself.

The snap and the kick were both perfect. Orange Lutheran tied the score!

## Another Challenge

Olson is starting classes at USC in the fall. He is excited to be at the home of the Trojans.

Olson has not been picked for the team yet. He may be called out onto the field one day, though.

Steve Sarkisian is USC's football coach.

"Someday, he's going to snap in a game for us," Sarkisian said of Olson. "When? I don't know — but it will happen."

He added, "When that day comes, it will be awesome."

Olson is not expecting special treatment.

He said all he wants is the chance "to prove myself."
