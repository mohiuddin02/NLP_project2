Who is the first person you think of when you hear the word genius? For many people, the answer would be physicist Albert Einstein. Now it turns out there was something special about his brain: He had an enormous corpus callosum.

The corpus callosum is made up of neural fibers. These are a bit like electrical wires. But instead of electricity, they carry messages from the brain.

The corpus callosum runs the length of the brain, right down the middle. It carries electrical signals between the brain's two halves. These are known as cerebral hemispheres. Signals between them make the brain's different parts work together.

Einstein may have been a genius because of his large corpus callosum.

## Key To His Mathematical Genius

After Einstein died in 1955 his brain was removed for scientific study. Many slides were made of slices of the brain.

Some of those slides still exist. But many have been lost or stolen. This meant scientists didn't have a complete picture of Einstein's brain. That made it hard for scientists to find a reason for his genius.

In 2010, anthropologist Dean Falk started asking about some images she had once seen. The photos were found with things that belonged to Dr. Thomas Harvey. He was the man who removed Einstein's brain in 1955.

Falk and a Chinese scientist named Weiwei Men carefully studied Harvey's photos. Last year, they published a first report. This looked at the brain's surface. A number of regions turned out to be unusually large. These regions were probably key to Einstein's mathematical genius.

The photos even showed evidence of Einstein's love of playing the violin. A large "knob" was found on the surface of the primary motor cortex. This is the region that controls the left hand.

## A Super Fast-Thinking Brain

The researchers' new study is based on the same photos.

The pictures show Einstein's corpus callosum very clearly. One part of it is particularly large: the splenium. That region helps three parts of the brain "talk" to each other. Two of those parts are key to mathematical thinking.

Einstein was 76 when he died. The two researchers decided to compare his brain with the brains of both old and young men.

Einstein's corpus callosum was much thicker than those of 15 men his age. Compared to 52 young men, it was thicker in five important spots.

So Einstein's large corpus callosum may explain his genius. It may have helped the two sides of his brain communicate faster than usual.

## Brain Exercises May Have Helped Too

But scientist Peter U. Tse thinks there may be another explanation. As people age, their brains usually get weaker. But this doesn't always happen if someone exercises their brain a lot by with activities that involve lots of thinking. Einstein's corpus callosum was in much better shape than those of the older men. It was a little more developed than those of the young men.

This might be because Einstein continued to exercise his brain heavily.

"It might just be that Einstein's brain was more like a young person's brain," Tse said. "The brain is like a muscle." It's more likely to stay fit if we use it a lot.

Einstein may not have been a genius because of his large corpus callosum, he said. In fact, his brain might not have been that way when he was born. Perhaps those areas grew larger because he exercised them so much.
