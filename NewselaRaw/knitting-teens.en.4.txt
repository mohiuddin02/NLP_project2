CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Knitting is not just for grandmothers. It is keeping Chicago students safe.

Four years ago, Mary Visconti got free yarn and knitting needles. A shop gave them to her. Then she hired an art teacher to  teach students how to knit. Soon, the KnitLAB program began.

The students live in poor areas with a lot of crime. It is hard for them to grow up there.

"I thought that knitting would offer some peace and quiet," said Visconti. She runs the Better Boys Foundation. The group helps boys and girls in poor areas. "Students can create things together and be peaceful, calm and safe."

Visconti said the teenage knitters have become a team.

## Creativity And Ca$h

Ariana Trimuel, age 15, is one of the knitters. "My friends think it's pretty cool," she said. "They're always asking me to make scarves for them. It makes me feel really good to be able to do that."

Shukurieya McClennon, age 13, is another knitter. She said knitting has made her open to new ideas.

KnitLAB is run like a business. Students are paid $325 for 10 weeks of work. They knit small things like hats and scarves. They even knit rugs and quilts. Each student gets to keep one thing they make. The rest are sold. KnitLab's last winter sale earned $500, Visconti said.

The students are treated like workers. If they call in sick, they have to make the time up.

## "Knit Bomb" Keeps Boredom At Bay

KnitLAB has about 15 kids at a time. Students learned to dye yarn with Kool-Aid. They weave rugs with strips of old T-shirts. They also "knit bomb." This means they knit around objects like chairs and bike racks.

One afternoon, the students gathered around a table. There were boxes of yarn in a rainbow of colors. Knitting needles were stuffed in vases and cups.

"I thought this would probably be boring," said Akenna Mack. She is 13. "You think of a grandma sitting in her front room knitting with all her cats."

"Yeah, we all love it here," added Artreuna Dotson. Artreuna is 14. She said it feels good to wear something she made herself.

Boys knit, too.

Michael King is 13. He was knitting a skinny yellow scarf.

"I really like it," said Michael.
