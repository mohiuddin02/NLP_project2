WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama said the U.S. military can drop bombs on Islamic fighters in northern Iraq. The airstrikes are intended to save Iraqis surrounded by the fighters. The Iraqis are called Yazidi. They are a group of people with a different religious belief. Tens of thousands of Yazidi are stranded on a mountain.

The president also wants to help protect Americans in the area.

Obama said American military planes already had dropped food and water to the Yazidis. They could be killed by the Islamic fighters if they come down from the mountain. They could also die without the food and water.

"Today America is coming to help," the president declared.

## A Dangerous Choice

The United States withdrew its troops from Iraq in 2011. It has not gotten this involved in Iraq since then. Obama has counted on being remembered as the president who ended what he has called the "dumb war" in Iraq.

Most Iraqis believe in Islam. But the Yazidis follow an older religion. It has ties to a faith that originated in what is now Iran.

The Islamic State group ordered the Yazidis to make a choice. They could join Islam, pay a religious fine, flee their homes or face death. The Yazidis fled up the mountain.

Obama said the Iraqi government requested the food and water. The Islamic State fighters started a war against the governments of Iraq and Syria. They want to take control of both countries and create a religious government.

Obama said that new U.S. military action in Iraq would worry Americans. He vowed not to put American troops back on the ground in Iraq.

Even so, the president explained that airstrikes might be needed if the Islamic State fighters attack Irbil. The city is in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. U.S. troops and the officials representing the U.S. government are based there.

"When the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action," Obama said. "That's my responsibility as commander in chief."

He said he had also approved attacks if necessary to help the Iraqi military protect people.

## Ready With More Food, Water

The Pentagon said planes already had dropped food and water in the area. The planes brought 72 bundles of food and water.

The planes delivered 5,300 gallons of fresh drinking water. They also dropped 8,000 prepackaged meals. They were over the drop area for less than 15 minutes at a low height.

The president described the mission as part of America's duty. The country must use its special strengths to help prevent a lot of people from being killed, he said.

Officials said the United States was prepared to make more airdrops if necessary. They did not say how quickly those missions could happen.

White House officials said the Iraqi government asked the United States to take military action. For that reason, they do not believe Washington is breaking international law by launching the attacks. They also said the U.S. Constitution gives Obama the power to act on his own to protect American citizens.

Obama sent about 800 U.S. forces to Iraq earlier this year. Those troops are largely split between Baghdad and Irbil. More than half are protecting the U.S. embassy and U.S. government workers. The embassy is where U.S. officials work.

## The Situation Is Getting Worse

Officials said the United States was flying over Irbil with both traditional aircraft and drones — planes that fly with no pilots. They were trying to gather information and monitor the worsening situation.

It's all but certain that Obama will launch the strikes without an OK from Congress. Lawmakers left Washington last week for a five-week recess. There was no sign that Congress was being called back.

However, officials said the White House was in contact with some lawmakers. They included the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, and Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate.

Some Republicans have specifically called for the president to take action. They have said he does not need the approval of lawmakers.
