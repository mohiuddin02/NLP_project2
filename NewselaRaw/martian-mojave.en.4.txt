MOJAVE NATIONAL PRESERVE â€” Out in the California desert, scientist J. Craig Venter is testing a new technology. He says it will help find life on other planets.

Venter claims his technology will discover DNA in soil or water found on other planets. DNA is the building block for any living thing. Finding it on another planet will prove that we are not alone in the universe.

And Venter says his technology will be able to find DNA and decode it. It will then send the information back to Earth.

And finally, he says, scientists will be able to do something amazing: They will be able to build living copies of alien lifeforms in a lab.

## Mission Impossible?

What he's talking about would work something like a fax machine: Feed in a message encoded in DNA; hit print; and presto: a living thing prints out.

"We can re-create the Martians in a P-4 spacesuit lab, if necessary," the 67-year-old says.

It sounds impossible. But scientists at NASA think Venter's crazy idea might work. Half a dozen NASA scientists are on hand to help with the test.

A device that could study samples on other planets without having to return to Earth would be very useful. It would save billions of dollars. And it would get rid of the danger of bringing home outer-space diseases.

"The next mission to Mars will be in 2020," NASA scientist Simon "Pete" Worden said. "That mission may well have this (technology) on it."

## A Test Run For Mars

The Mojave Desert has long been used as a substitute for Mars.

Last weekend, a team of scientists hiked through the Mojave, flipping over rocks. They were looking for a special bacteria: one with "super powers."

That bacteria is called Chroococcidiopsis. It can be found covering the bottom of quartz rocks. Chroococcidiopsis can can take very cold and very hot temperatures. And it can live without air and water.

Scientists believe this is the sort of thing that might be found on other worlds. So the team plans to use it in their Mojave test run.

"We're in love with this organism," McKay said. "It's the closest thing we have to Martians."

The scientists planned to load bits of the bacteria into a DNA sequencer. This sequencer will show them the order of four repeating nucleotides, or chemical "letters," found in the bacteria. That order or sequence of "letters" makes up the bacteria's DNA. It is the genetic code that makes it what it is.

Once found, the bacteria's DNA sequence will be uploaded. Scientists at Venter's company, Synthetic Genomics, will then download the sequence.

## "The Size Of A Shoe Box"

In the Mojave, all this work is taking place in a huge trailer. And it needs a team of scientists. If it's ever going to be used on Mars, the technology will need to run itself. And it will have to be a lot smaller.

"It needs to be the size of a shoe box," McKay says.

The desert experiment was a test of the unit that would send back information from Mars. But how will that information be received? That technology already exists as well, Venter said. The device downloads a DNA message. It then prints out molecules described in the message. It will be available for sale in 2014.

Venter says it will be the size of a computer printer at some point.

This technology will have many uses on Earth, Venter said. For example, people will be able to "download" and "print out" medicines at home.

"We hope to sell a lot of these machines," Venter says.
