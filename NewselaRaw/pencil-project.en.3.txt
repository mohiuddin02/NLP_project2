WAYNE, N.J. â€” Here in the United States, people throw out pencils without thinking. Many are simply never used. Pencils roll around classroom floors and lie forgotten in drawers and backpacks.

Yet a single pencil can be a rare and treasured thing elsewhere in the world.

Kyle VanDerVelden is a 16-year-old junior at Wayne Hills High School. One day he noticed school janitors sweeping up dropped pencils. He knew kids in some parts of the world were very poor. Having something as simple as a pencil could help them start to get an education. He decided he wanted to get pencils and pens to the kids who needed them.

"I just decided there was definitely something that I could do," he said.

## Pencil Collection Boxes Are Full!

Kyle began looking for groups that he could volunteer with. He found Kim Oppenheimer. She runs the group Right-to-Write, which sends pens and pencils to people around the world. With her help, Kyle's pencils have reached people in countries like Ethiopia, Panama and Haiti.

Kyle collects unused pencils and pens, then works with Oppenheimer to send them where they are needed. So far he has received thousands of writing tools from schools, businesses and churches. Some are used, but most are new.

Earlier this month, Kyle went to collect pens and pencils from an elementary school near him. He carried out boxes crammed with pens, pencils, crayons and magic markers. The month-long pencil collection was a big success. Altogether, he collected 3,790 writing tools.

"Children giving to children is really valuable," Oppenheimer said.

## Bags Of Pencils Travel The World

The idea behind Oppenheimer's group is simple. People learn about what she's doing from her website, and mail pencils to her or even bring them to her. She packs around 200 pencils into a bag. Then she gives the bags to travelers heading to poor countries. The travelers deliver the bags of pencils to the people who need them.

Oppenheimer has sent pencils to schools, hospitals and orphanages. Mexico, Brazil, Liberia, Namibia, India and Vietnam are among the countries she has sent packages to.

"It's a simple idea, and works so easily," Oppenheimer said. "When any traveler is going overseas, for the most part, you can fit that bag into your suitcase."

She said she came up with the idea when she traveled to Peru in 2005. She had taken a suitcase of clothing to give away but saw that people really wanted her pen. "Even the nurses wanted my pen as I walked around the hallway," Oppenheimer said.

"I figured if I hadn't realized there was such a need, that many other people hadn't as well," she said. The group began three years after her Peru trip. So far, she has collected more than 80,000 pencils.

## A Lesson In Giving

Kyle contacted Oppenheimer last summer. He was "super interested" in helping, Oppenheimer said.

The teen collects pencils from businesses, churches and schools. Kyle visits schools and tells kids that students just like them need pencils.

The kids who gave pencils learned a lot. They realized that a common, everyday thing like a pencil can be badly needed by other children around the world.

Christopher Bacchioni is a fifth-grader at the school. He said he gave pencils to "help people in need."

He can imagine children "being happy because they can write now, that they don't have just one pencil to use all year," he said. "They can have a few."
