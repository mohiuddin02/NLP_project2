Motorcycle thefts are on the decline overall, but Harley-Davidson owners should not let down their guard. Out of five major brands, Harley was the only one that saw an uptick in the number of stolen bikes in 2013, new data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau show.

It's hard to say why more Harleys continue to be stolen, but some speculate the riders are too trusting. Many leave their bikes unlocked and unattended because most fellow riders won't mess with them.

There were 3,907 Harley-Davidsons stolen in the United States last year, up 4 percent from 2012. By contrast, the percentage of stolen Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Suzuki motorcycles fell, ranging from 2.1 percent for Kawasaki to 9.1 percent for Suzuki.

Overall, there were 45,367 motorcycle thefts reported in the United States in 2013. That was down 1.5 percent compared with the previous year, even as bike sales increased.

## Parking Lots Are Easy Picking For Thieves

The thefts were highest in California, followed by Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Indiana.

Nationwide, Honda was the bike stolen most often, followed by Yamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Harley-Davidson.

At least one motorcycle theft ring has in the past targeted motels along the routes of biker rallies, stealing bikes from parking lots.

Harley rider Jim Bidwell's customized 2007 Ultra Glide was stolen this spring from the parking lot at Pete's Garage Bar in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

The bike, which Bidwell valued at $45,000, was stolen on a Sunday afternoon in May.

The bar was packed with people, Bidwell said, and he had just shown the bike to some of them three minutes earlier.

"We parked right in front of the bar — I was 15 feet" away from the bike, he said.

No one reported seeing the theft take place, Bidwell said. The bike was unlocked and could be started without a key.

## Has Anyone Seen My Bike?

Bidwell has since published a plea on Facebook seeking information about the theft.

"We are not going to give up until she is home," the plea says.

Thousands of people have viewed the posting, and some of them swore they saw the bike in various places.

"Someone said they thought they saw it near Nashville (Tennessee)," Bidwell said. The bike had $29,340 in accessories and had won nine custom motorcycle competitions.

"My word to everybody is 'lock up your bike' — I cannot stress that enough," he said.

There have been similar bold thefts of motorcycles in Wisconsin's Fox Valley this spring. In one case, a bike was stolen from the parking lot of a movie theater.

Generally, there aren't many motorcycle thefts at biker rallies.

"People are very trusting. It's a Harley brotherhood, and under no circumstances do you touch somebody else's bike without their permission," Bidwell said.

## They Disappear Fast

There's an unwritten honor code among motorcycle enthusiasts, but unfortunately it's not enough to stop thieves, said Menasha (Wisconsin) Police Officer Aaron Zemlock.

Officer Zemlock recently investigated the theft of a Harley-Davidson from a parking lot of the Graphic Packaging Corp. in the middle of the day.

The bike was in plain view of the street and the packaging plant. The thief, still not caught, can be seen on video driving away and nearly causing an accident.

"It looked like he was dropped off by another vehicle, walked up to the bike, and was there for less than two minutes," Zemlock said.

"It was bold, absolutely," he added.

## Bits And Pieces

Thirty-seven percent of the motorcycles reported stolen in the United States in 2013 were recovered.

"In some cases, fairly rare bikes have been recovered, including a 1953 Triumph that was returned to its rightful owner 53 years later. He is 73 years old now," said insurer Roger Morris.

Often, bikes are cut up and sold for parts. The parts, or whole motorcycles, are sometimes shipped overseas where they are worth much more and can't be easily traced.

"We have found barrels of motorcycle parts being shipped out of the country," Morris said.

Locks, alarms and parking your motorcycle in a secure location are still the best ways to prevent theft. A bike can be stolen in seconds.

"Have good insurance. You would be surprised at how many people don't have theft coverage," Morris said.
