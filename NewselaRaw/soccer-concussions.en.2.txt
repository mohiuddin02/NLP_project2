LOS ANGELES—Heading the ball is a key soccer skill. But a new study finds that players who headed the ball frequently were more likely to suffer brain injuries and damage their memory than players who used their head a little less.

Sports like American football and ice hockey get most of the attention when it comes to [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) and other forms of serious brain injury. But soccer is a very physical sport and in it the head can be as important as the foot.

Still research has not linked heading to concussions. So players, coaches and doctors have generally paid little attention to the health risks.

"For many people, it's beyond belief that minor injuries could be a problem," said Dr. Michael Lipton, of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. He studies brain images and wrote a report about the issue.

## Adult Soccer Players Tested

Lipton said he hasn't headed a ball himself since he played youth soccer. But he is very interested in how the effects of repeated brain injuries add up. Soccer was a good sport for his research. People are going to head the ball, and the researchers can measure how many times they do it.

Lipton and his colleagues interviewed 37 adult league soccer players from New York City and took high-tech pictures of their brains. They asked the players how often they played soccer and approximately how often they headed the ball. They also gave the players a number of  tests of how various parts of the brain function.

They divided the players into three groups – low heading, medium heading and high heading. They found that players who headed the ball the most had the lowest scores on memory tests. They also had the lowest average scores for a something called fractional anisotropy, or FA. That is a measure of the health of the brain's white matter. White matter are the billions of nerve fibers that connect different parts of the brain. Low FA scores have also been found in people who have suffered concussions.

Whether a player had a history of concussions, how old they were or other factors were controlled for in the study.

The researchers found no link between heading and players' attention, ability to follow things with their eyes or ability to do complex thinking tasks.

## Keeping A "Head Count" Suggested

The relationship between heading and traumatic brain injury was not simply a matter of more heading leading to more injury. Instead, the researchers discovered that players could safely head the ball 885 to 1,550 times a year without experiencing FA problems. It took almost 1,800 headers for players to have trouble with their memory.

There were some players below those levels who showed FA and memory problems. So some people may be more sensitive to heading the ball.

However, Lipton cautioned players not to dismiss the potential risks of heading the ball too many times.

Lipton suggests that soccer start keeping a "head count" to monitor the number of headers players use in a given game. The head count would be similar to the "pitch count" in baseball. Teams use that to make sure that pitchers do not throw too many pitches in one game.

Practice is also important to consider, Lipton said. The number of headers is usually greater in practice than in games, although they are made at lower speed.

American football probably is the sport that most people think about when they think of concussions. The National Football League has been sued by former players who have suffered concussion-related diseases.  The league has been looking at different helmet designs to help prevent concussions.

## More Research On The Way

So should soccer's David Beckham have been wearing a helmet during his years with Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Los Angeles Galaxy? Not so fast, Lipton cautioned.

So far, scientists cannot say there is a direct cause and effect between heading the ball a lot and having brain and memory problems, he said. The study was based on a small sample size. Most of the people involved were male -- 28 men, nine women. Also, the data were collected at a single point in time. There is more studying to be done.

And more research is on the way. Lipton's team recently was given a $3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to extend the work.

In the meantime, if you're worried about heading the ball too much, try out for goalie.
