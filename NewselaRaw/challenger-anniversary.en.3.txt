ORLANDO, Fla. — The year was 1986\. Space shuttle Challenger had just taken off with a roar from Kennedy Space Center. 

Less than two minutes later, Challenger was ripped apart. A rubber seal separating parts of the spacecraft had failed. Rocket flames burst through and set a giant gas tank on fire.

Challenger blew up 30 years ago this Thursday. Seven astronauts were killed, among them teacher Christa McAuliffe.

Soon after that, President Ronald Reagan spoke to the nation.

"We will never forget them," Reagan said. "The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them."

## Many Are Too Young To Remember

However, today nearly half the country is too young to remember what happened. There is also much less interest in exploring space.

Howard Lieb remembers, though. A New Yorker, Lieb lives part of each year in Florida. He has not forgotten the faces of McAuliffe's parents in news photos.

Back then, Americans wanted to try again and do better, he said. Many were inspired by Reagan's promise that "nothing ends here. Our hopes and our journeys continue."

Over the past 30 years things have changed, Lieb said. Today, many people think space shuttles are just too dangerous.

The shuttle program was run by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Over the years NASA got less and less money from the government. In 2011, the program was ended.

## New Companies Now Aim For Space

However, that does not mean the U.S. will stop exploring space. New companies have formed to take NASA's place. They are paying for their own space flights.

Not everyone has forgotten Challenger, of course. At the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, the accident is far from forgotten. The center wants to make sure all Americans remember what happened. It also does not want Americans to give up on exploring space.

The center was founded in 1986 by the families of the astronauts who died. Since then its programs have spread to more than 40 schools and museums.

Lance Bush is the group's president. All of those Challenger Center places "have pictures of the crew on the walls," he said. When children visit, they are told about these heroes.

So far, more than 4 million students have visited the centers. 

## Families Support Learning Centers

Seventeen years after Challenger blew up, NASA had another terrible accident. In 2003, space shuttle Columbia came apart as it was landing. Seven astronauts were killed. 

Their families strongly support the Challenger Center program. 

"It's important to have programs like this," said Laura Husband. She is the daughter of Rick Husband, commander of Columbia's doomed 2003 flight.

NASA and others have tried to figure out what caused both accidents.

Bob Crippen was a shuttle flight commander. He thinks the problem was that NASA did not pay enough attention to early warnings.

Scientists had noticed that some rocket parts were damaged during earlier spaceflights, he said. But he thinks NASA did not do enough to figure out what went wrong.

## Learning From Past Mistakes

Instead, NASA went ahead without having really solved the problem. He hopes workers on future shuttle flights will learn from those mistakes.

Mike Ciannilli runs the Kennedy Space Center visitors' area. He said he often hears stories from people who visit. They remember exactly where they were when the Challenger exploded. 

Some were at school, while others were at home watching television with family. Some say they were outside, watching the Challenger rising.

Ciannilli says the terrible moment does not belong only to NASA. It had a huge effect on many who saw it, he said.

It is a very important event in their lives, Ciannilli said.
