EATONVILLE, Wash. — Mount Rainier looms over Puget Sound, wooing climbers and testing their skills. Its icy peak beckons – but it also kills.

Now, Rainier has claimed six more victims.

More than 14,000 feet high, Rainier is the fifth-tallest mountain in the continental United States. The glacier-covered volcano rises alone near Seattle, beckoning local outdoorsy types.

"There is a draw, but I can't explain it," said Len Throop, who has climbed Rainier many times but never reached the summit. "From the first time I ever saw it, I felt a connection. Even if you can't see it, you know it's there. And it's dangerous. (Last) week is one example, and it's not even the worst."

## Mountain Guides Among Dead

The worst accident came in June 1981 when 11 climbers died under giant chunks of ice.

The six climbers who died last week included two experienced mountain guides. Both worked for Alpine Ascents International.

The six victims are believed to have fallen thousands of feet down a sheer, icy cliff.

The names of the dead have not yet been officially released. However, Alpine Ascents said that the lead guide was Matt Hegeman, who had scaled Rainier more than 50 times. A family member identified one of the other climbers as Mark Mahaney, 26, of St. Paul, Minn.

"All indications point toward a fall of 3,300 feet from near the parties' last known location at 12,800 feet," a Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman said. There was no realistic "chance of survival from such a fall. At this point, there are no plans to put people on the ground at the site because of the ongoing hazards."

Climbing Rainier is never easy, said mountaineering expert Martinique Grigg.

"Only 50 percent of the people who try it, make it, any given year," said Grigg. "It's a tough mountain. You need to be in good physical condition, and you need to have training to be safe in the mountains. You need to know how to travel over a glacier, how to rescue your climbing partners."

## Scaling Liberty Ridge Is Difficult

Rainier's challenging terrain requires skill, endurance and special equipment. Climbers must attach spikes to their boots to keep from sliding, and they carry ice axes that help stop them if they do slip down the mountain. They are often tied to their climbing mates for safety.

"It's like being on a stair stepper at a steep angle for 10 hours, and that's for just a normal route," Grigg said. Liberty Ridge, the route the doomed climbers took last week, "is one of the most difficult on the mountain."

Eric Linxweiler, who has scaled Rainier several times, said climbers on the peak hear rocks crashing down the mountain.

"We do almost all of our climbing in the middle of the night when everything is frozen," Linxweiler said. "As the days get longer, every day the snow gets softer. As you're walking uphill, you're sliding. It's much safer to be on the mountain when the mountain is frozen."

He added, "Everyone leaves at midnight or 1 a.m. when they're doing ascending work. You put a headlamp on and you go."

Unlike Linxweiler and Grigg, who have not climbed Liberty Ridge, Mike Maude has made the difficult ascent several times. In the past, he has both rescued climbers and helped recover the bodies of the dead.

"That ridge is steep enough and long enough that, once you get started falling, unless you can stop immediately, there's no stopping," Maude said.

## "I Want To Climb That"

Gary Harrington of Alpine Ascents said it was not possible at this point to know what caused the deaths. But he said that among the possible problems climbers face are "rock fall, avalanche, a mixture of everything in between."

The ground search for the six climbers' bodies was called off because it was too dangerous.

"To continue searching there puts everybody at risk," Grigg said. "The sad fact (is), sometimes bodies are not recovered." If an avalanche slid over them, "they could be covered 30 to 40 feet or more."

But climbing experts said Sunday that, although last week's accident could make people think twice about safety, it probably would not keep them off Mount Rainier. The peak is just too attractive to climbers.

"We moved here six years ago," Grigg said. "I would see that mountain and think, 'I want to climb that one day.' We talk about it as magical. You can't see it sometimes," when the weather is bad. "And then, all of a sudden, it's just there on the landscape. That makes it compelling and curious. That's what made it compelling to me."
