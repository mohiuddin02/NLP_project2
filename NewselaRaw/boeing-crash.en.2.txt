LOS ANGELES â€” The type of aircraft that crash-landed at San Francisco on Saturday has long been seen as one of the safest planes.

Boeing rolled out its first 777 to a huge crowd at its factory in Everett, Wash., in 1994. Since then, more than 1,100 have been built. Only one had been in a major accident, with no deaths.

That record ended on Saturday when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed after touching down on a runway at San Francisco International Airport. The aircraft had taken off from Seoul, South Korea. Two passengers were killed and dozens were injured.

The airline website Seatguru shows the plane has 295 seats in economy class. There are also 24 business-class sleeper seats.

## Asiana One Of The Top Airlines

Asiana Airlines is South Korea's second-largest carrier. It is ranked as one of the top airlines in the world in terms of service and safety.

The airline started in 1988 with a single plane flying short hops to cities within South Korea. It operates 12 Boeing 777-200ER aircraft.

Asiana Airlines' pilots have a reputation for being "cowboys," says one aviation expert. Many of the pilots trained in the South Korean military.

Boeing made a statement Saturday, saying it "extends its concern for the safety" of those aboard the aircraft.

"Boeing is preparing to provide technical assistance to the National Transportation Safety Board as it investigates the accident," the statement said. The NTSB is the U.S. government agency that investigates all plane crashes. It also investigates major incidents occurring on U.S. highways, railways, waterways and pipelines.

## First Deaths In Three Years

Tom Captain studies aviation for the company Deloitte. He said it was the first time in three years that passengers have died on a commercial airliner.

The last time a major U.S. airline lost a plane in a fatal crash was an American Airlines Airbus A300 taking off from JFK in 2001.

Smaller airlines have had crashes since then. The last fatal U.S. crash was a Continental Express flight operated by Colgan Air, which crashed into a house near Buffalo, N.Y., on Feb. 12, 2009, according to the AP. The crash killed all 49 people on board and one man in the house.

Captain said the safety record for commercial flight is "something like 40 times" safer than driving.

The Boeing 777 has been seen as one of the safest aircraft in the skies today.

## Remarkable Level Of Reliability

Nearly all of the world's most important airlines fly 777s on long-range routes. It has been a major workhorse for carriers flying from the U.S. to Europe and Asia.  More than 1,1000 are in service.

"It has a remarkable level of reliability," said Richard Aboulafia, who studies aerospace for the Teal Group Corp. "With its track record, it's as good as it gets when it comes to aircraft design."

However, it has not been entirely accident-free. In 2008, a 777 operated by British Airways crash-landed in England at Heathrow Airport with 152 on board. An investigation into the crash found the plane had lost power because a buildup of ice had restricted fuel flowing into the engines.

Images of Saturday's wreckage suggest the Asiana Airlines 777 may have had the same problem, said Robert Herbst, a retired American Airlines 767 pilot. Herbst now works in South Carolina as a consultant to companies in the aviation business.

"This is very obvious what happened," Herbst said. "They landed short of the runway. They were too low for the flight path and the tail of the aircraft hit the sea wall."

## "Tail Hit The Sea Wall"

When approaching the runway, Herbst said, "the nose is pretty high up in the air just before touchdown. They weren't high enough and the tail hit the sea wall."

Jet fuel in the wings of the 777 then likely caught fire, said Herbst, who flew commercial airliners for 41 years.

Last May, Boeing notified airlines operating 777s of a problem. A faulty part was causing an automatic shutdown in the 777's engines. General Electric Co. manufactured the engines. In a span of about four months, there were two incidents in which engines shut down in midflight.

There were 26 airplanes in service with the GE engines. It was not immediately clear whether Asiana Airlines, which operates nine of the planes, was one of the affected airlines.

Boeing makes six versions of the twin-aisle, twin-engine aircraft. The 777 involved in the incident in San Francisco, a 777-200ER, costs around $260 million. It made its first passenger flight in 2006.

"It could very easily have the safest record for that size of aircraft," Herbst said.
