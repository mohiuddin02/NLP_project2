For the first time, the mysterious dwarf planet Ceres is about to be explored up close. NASA's Dawn mission will enter its orbit on March 6 and will then begin to carefully map the icy world's surface.

Ceres is the largest resident of the debris belt between Mars and Jupiter. Discovered in 1801 by the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, it was initially thought to be a full-fledged planet. However, astronomers soon decided it was too small to be considered a planet, so it was reclassified as an asteroid. In 2006 it received a minor upgrade to "dwarf planet."

## Interesting, Strange, Texas-Sized

Whatever you call it, Ceres is one of the most geologically interesting and strange objects in the solar system. It is round, roughly the size of Texas and at least 20 percent water ice. Other than blurry Hubble Space Telescope images from 2004, its surface had scarcely been glimpsed until Dawn's approach. As Dawn draws closer, the dwarf planet's features are coming into focus and practically every new image is revealing tantalizing details.

In the latest images, taken from around 28,000 miles away, Dawn has sharpened its view of mysterious bright spots dotting Ceres' crater-pocked surface, some of which were previously seen in the Hubble images. What used to appear as Ceres' brightest blotch now appears to be two blotches: a brighter, larger spot next to a smaller, dimmer one, both in the same crater.

Nothing on Ceres is truly "bright" though. All the bright spots are actually quite dark but still far brighter than the rest of Ceres, which is blacker than coal.

## Cryovolcanoes? Probably Not ...

No one knows what the bright spots are but guesses abound: Perhaps they are scars from recent meteor impacts or minerals deposited by active geysers or water ice erupted by ice volcanoes known as "cryovolcanoes." In 2014 the Herschel space telescope spied plumes of water vapor near the white spots in Hubble images.

Chris Russell, Dawn's principal investigator, says "this may be pointing to a volcanolike origin of the spots."

The white spots would seem to be exposed ice. However, observations of Ceres with ground-based telescopes don't show any evidence of ice at the bright spots' locations.

According to planetary scientist Andy Rivkin, ice should not be stable at Ceres' surface. "So," he says, "its presence there would mean it's only gotten there recently." The most likely explanation for its presence, Rivkin says, is that buried ice has been exposed by the impact of meteors hitting the dwarf planet's surface. "I suppose cryovolcanism could also bring it to the surface," he added, "but impacts would be the safer bet."

## Not Just A Dead Potato

All anyone really knows for sure right now is that the spots are getting brighter as Dawn's view sharpens, says Mark Sykes, a Dawn mission scientist. The brighter they become "the more interesting they get," Sykes says, because it is becoming increasingly likely that they are patches of water ice.

"If we discover something like cryovolcanism on Ceres, that would be spectacular because it would be an indicator that there are subsurface reservoirs of water," Sykes says. "This isn't what you normally think of as an asteroid, a dead potato just being smacked around by its neighbors out in space. There is a lot happening on this object."

If Ceres does prove to have reservoirs of water, that would make it a possible home for extraterrestrial life and well worthy of further investigation.

## Any Dead Bugs?

"This raises the possibility that we could send another spacecraft there in the near future," Sykes says. Such a spacecraft could "go down to one of these spots, scoop up soil, take a look and ask whether there are any dead bugs in there."

Such a mission would be relatively inexpensive, Sykes says, because Ceres is relatively close by and is not a "nasty radiation environment" like, for example, Jupiter's moon Europa. In addition, "it's got low gravity so it doesn't require lots of energy to land on! It's too early to say whether this stuff is there, but the prospect is very exciting."

Dawn is still in the earliest phases of investigating Ceres, and the best images and scientific data are yet to come. It will eventually swing down to within around 250 miles of the dwarf planet's surface to study its composition and to generate high-resolution maps.

The spacecraft will spend at least the next 16 months studying Ceres. Because the dwarf planet could potentially have life below its surface, Dawn will not be crashed into it once its mission ends, as is the usual procedure. Instead, it will be left in orbit, and will become a tiny mechanical moon circling round Ceres.
