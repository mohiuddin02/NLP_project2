Scientists say that some energy drinks could be bad for a person's heart. They tested a drink called Rockstar. It is a drink made of caffeine and sugar and other things. Caffeine is made from plants and can make people feel more awake. It is in coffee and Coca-Cola.

Scientists found that one can of Rockstar makes blood flow faster. The change happens in 30 minutes. It also increases one kind of hormone. Hormones are a part of blood that helps the body work. The hormone Rockstar increases can make people feel like they are scared. They want to fight or run away.

Scientists did the tests at a famous hospital in Minnesota.

## What Is This Drink?

The scientists worked with a group of 25 people. All of the people were healthy. Most of them were 29 years old. Each person drank a can of Rockstar with no food. They had to finish the drink in five minutes.

The same group of people had a drink that tasted just like Rockstar. It was a placebo drink. A placebo looks and tastes the same but has nothing extra in it. It is used in tests to fool people. The group did not know which drink they were given.

Scientists tested the heartbeats of the people before they drank. They also tested their blood. They gave the tests again after the drinks were finished.

## Testing Blood And Hormones

All of the people had good heart beats before the drinks. Their blood moved at a good speed. People's blood moved faster after they drank Rockstar.

Those who drank the placebo also had faster moving blood. It was not as fast as with Rockstar, though. Scientists worry about people with fast moving blood. They have a bigger chance of having heart problems.

The biggest difference was in the hormone. It makes blood pump faster. It also makes the heart pound. There was much more of the hormone in people's blood after drinking Rockstar.

## Worried About Hearts

Scientists wanted to see if Rockstar would be different in people who were not comfortable. They asked the group to answer math questions. They also had them squeeze something with their hand. Some even had to put a hand into ice water. There was no change with those tests.

Scientists still worry about the blood moving faster and the hormone. They wrote a paper about it. It says that Rockstar energy drink could hurt some people's hearts.
