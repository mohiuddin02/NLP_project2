WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” President Barack Obama made a big announcement Friday. He said he will not allow the Keystone XL pipeline.

Pipelines carry oil. The pipeline would have brought Canadian oil into the United States. It would have begun in the north of Canada. From there it would have run all the way to the state of Louisiana.

Many people were against the pipeline. They got together and tried to stop it.

## Scientists Say World Is Heating Up

The pipeline would have carried tar sand oil. Tar sand oil is oil that is trapped in sand. The sand has to be heated enough for the oil to melt out. Many people say doing that is bad for the air and water. It can hurt animals and people too.

Many people also believe the United States should be using less oil. They are not just thinking of tar sand oil. All kinds of oil are bad for the planet, they think.

Scientists say the world is getting hotter. They call this global warming. They believe global warming is causing very serious problems. For example, water is drying up. Fires are becoming more common. The sea is rising.

## Hurting Nature, But Helping Create Jobs

Scientists believe oil is the biggest cause of global warming. When oil is burned it gives off gasses. The gasses stay in the air and trap heat. Over time the planet gets hotter.

The pipeline would have carried a lot of oil. It would have moved more than 800,000 barrels a day.

The pipeline was thought up 10 years ago. Since then people have been arguing about it.

Those against it warned nature would be hurt.

Those for it said the pipeline would help the United States. It would bring many good new jobs, they said.

## Jobs Would Not Last Long

The government says that idea is wrong. Most of the new jobs would not last long. They would end once the pipeline was built. After that, only 35 workers would still be be needed. They would keep the pipeline running.

Obama said stopping the pipeline is important. It shows the United States is serious about fighting global warming.

Obama said the United States should set a good example. World leaders need to start fighting global warming, he said. Some oil will just have to stay in the ground.
