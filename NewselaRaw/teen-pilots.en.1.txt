CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Whenever she was having a tough day, Selena Berry would look to the sky and imagine herself soaring high in the clouds above her troubled neighborhood and challenging middle school.

Thinking of being in the sky brought the 17-year-old some relief from her day-to-day life.

"Flying makes you feel big," Berry said. "You are on top of everything. Untouchable. You look down and all you see is the view, the beauty."

This summer, Berry and seven other African-American students from the Chicago area are enrolled in a program to learn how to fly. The program is new and is rigorous for participants. At the end, successful students will graduate with a private pilot's license.

## Following The Tuskegee Airmen In Flight

The unique program is called Tuskegee Next. It is a special effort to increase the number of African-Americans who can work as pilots, said Stephen L. Davis, who owns a lighting company in Wheaton, Illinois, and founded the organization.

The main mission of the group is to help students follow in the footsteps of the country's first black military pilots, called the Tuskegee Airmen. Once the students earn certificates to fly private airplanes, they are on a path to learn how to fly commercial airliners.

For much of his life, Davis wanted to become a pilot. But growing up, he could not afford the expensive schooling. By the time he could afford lessons, he had a wife and children and did not want to take the risk. He is now the first African-American to serve as chairman of the DuPage County Airport Authority Board.

"When you don't see black pilots, you don't think you can do it," he said. "Even if these kids don't become pilots, learning to fly will give them confidence to do other great things."

## Program Benefits Reach Beyond Flying

It costs about $25,000 to take the lessons and pay for the flying time, officials said. But it is free for these students. Davis donates his own money and raises funds to cover the tuition costs.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, fewer than 2 percent of all the licensed pilots in the United States are African-American. This lack of exposure may discourage young African-Americans from going into the profession.

For youths from rough communities, the benefits of learning to fly are greater than getting a job in the airline industry. They escape the harsh realities of their communities, learn discipline and build confidence.

"Flying an airplane is not necessarily as difficult as some of the other decisions these kids will have to make," Davis said. "It's good for them to learn how to fly. But we also have to mentor them so they can make good life decisions and make it to 18 safely."

## Long Training Days

Other pilot camps and mentoring projects across the country encourage African-Americans to consider careers in aviation. Tuskegee Next is different as it targets teenagers from troubled communities who might never have such an opportunity and pays for all of their lessons.

Some of the students in Tuskegee Next receive a small stipend as an incentive to participate. This money makes up for the summer jobs they would have had otherwise. They live on the campuses of local colleges so they will not be distracted by regular life. Their days of training include fitness drills and time in the classroom doing coursework.

All eight of the students have passed the written exam. Now they are spending hours piloting a Cessna aircraft with an instructor.

Some are already flying the planes alone.

## "I Know I'm A Pilot"

On a recent sunny afternoon, 20-year-old Quiana White spent about an hour alone in a Cessna airplane practicing turns. This was her first solo flight and her peers celebrated after she landed.

Marcellus Freeman, 18, grew up in the far South Side. He became familiar with flying because his father worked at an airport as a ramp agent guiding planes to their gates and his family traveled frequently. Ever since, he knew he wanted to work in the sky.

"You're not the same person once you go up on your own," he said. "No matter what happens, I know I'm a pilot."
