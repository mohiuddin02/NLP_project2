WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama on Monday launched a non-government program to promote opportunities for men and boys of color. The program won't be paid for by the government, and instead will bring together former elected officials, pro athletes, celebrities and business leaders to find solutions.

In starting the program, Obama condemned the "sense of unfairness and of powerlessness" that leads to such violent eruptions as the Baltimore riots. He also promised to make equality a cause for the rest of his lifetime.

## Building On My Brother's Keeper

The nonprofit organization, My Brother's Keeper Alliance, is built on a program Obama started last year to highlight and close the gap between minority students and their peers. The goal is to improve minority students' academic performance and help them on their career paths.

"We are in this for the long haul," Obama told a crowd at New York's Lehman College in the Bronx. "Sometimes there won't be a lot of fanfare. I notice we don't always get a lot of reporting on this issue when there's not a crisis in some neighborhood.

"But we're just going to keep on plugging away," he said. "This will remain a mission for me and for Michelle, not just for the rest of my presidency, but for the rest of my life."

The alliance is a spinoff of the My Brother's Keeper program. It shows Obama using the power of his office to assemble community and business leaders to work on social problems. It's a strategy he has turned to repeatedly as his presidency winds down, to make up for his inability to start new government programs or win funding from Congress.

## Working On Solutions After Baltimore

Monday's pledge came just days after Obama spoke with clear frustration about the circumstances that led to the rioting in Baltimore. He denounced not just the fatal injury to a young black man in police custody, but the larger issues of poverty and lack of opportunity that affect inner cities around the country.

They are problems for whole communities to solve, he said, and it will take a continuous effort to make a difference.

Many of the presidents who preceded Obama left the White House with a desire to make changes they couldn't accomplish from the Oval Office. President Jimmy Carter set a new standard of activism with his Habitat for Humanity, which builds affordable housing, and global peace work. President George H.W. Bush runs the world's largest organization devoted to volunteer public service, the Points of Light.

In their footsteps, President Bill Clinton dedicated his Clinton Global Initiative to projects he began in office. They include the fight against climate change and the campaign to improve health care worldwide.

## Taking On Racism And Poverty

James A. Thurber, a professor of government and director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, says there's a strong impulse on the part of former presidents to finish the work they couldn't do in office.

"Rather than just establishing a library that shows what they did, they want to continue the work," Thurber said.

Obama, he said, might be more effective on his chosen cause after he leaves office.

"He can address racism and poverty, two things that are very closely linked, in a very effective way," Thurber said. "These are big problems in America, and he is in a special position to get people talking about them."

Thurber added, "He's likely to be more effective in that way than by trying to pass legislation in trying to deal with them."

## Paying Attention To Minority Men And Boys

Obama has been gearing up his effort for years, said Joshua DuBois, the former head of Obama's Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Obama worked on healthy families and fatherhood measures in the Senate and started a fatherhood program shortly after becoming president.

Obama's concern for men and boys of color "started long before he was in the White House and will last long after he's closed the doors to that building for the last time," DuBois said.

The effort took on more urgency after the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer. That's when Obama began to talk publicly about the importance of helping men and boys of color thrive.

In conversations with staffers, Obama has repeatedly returned to the idea that the real problems require a serious, lasting effort, DuBois said.

"He talks about how we tend to ignore these communities unless it's a time of crisis," DuBois said. "This is the opposite of that. This is him paying attention to those issues not just in the moment but in a sustained way."

## Closing The Education And Work Gap

The new organization aims to build "a national ecosystem" to help boys and young men of color. It plans to do this primarily through educational and intervention programs designed to close what Obama called the "opportunity gap," boosting education and employment rates that lag behind those of their peers.

On Monday, Obama argued that most Americans share the belief that everyone deserves an equal shot.

"There's a tragic history in this country that has made it tougher for some," he said. "And folks living in those communities, and especially young people living in those communities, could use some help to change those odds."
