EARLYSVILLE, Va. â€” Last year, Chris and Annie Newman quit their jobs and became farmers. They are trying a new approach to farming. It has not been easy, though.

The hens on their farm run free. They lay their eggs anywhere they please. As a result, the Newmans have to play a kind of farmer hide-and-go-seek.

They squat and squint, reach and grab for those hidden brown eggs.

Chris is 32 years old and Annie is 28. They put $27,000 of their life savings into their farm. Their farm is organic, and more. They are trying to treat animals well, help the environment and people's health.

Farming newbies like the Newmans face many challenges. Most did not grow up on a family farm. For young people like them, it is difficult to find affordable land. Years ago, you could buy cheap land in the countryside.

## Many Ways Young Farmers Can Be Helped

Young farmers often find themselves trying to buy the same land as rich companies. And borrowing money is not easy. Young college graduates often have big student loans to pay off. It is especially hard for them to get a loan to buy land.

Some states recognize these problems. They have added programs to help farmers get skills and land.

Missouri, Maryland and Virginia are some of the states that help new farmers find land. Massachusetts, Minnesota and Delaware offer help with money for farmers who are just starting out.

The future of young farmers is important for states. Farmers help make sure we have a supply of food and strengthen communities, said Holly Rippon-Butler. She is a member of a national group of young farmers.

Rippon-Butler is worried about what will happen if young farmers cannot get started. Who will older farmers sell their land to when they are too old to work?

"We will lose the ability to produce our own food," she said.

## Family Farms Versus Big Companies

For years, small family farms have been shutting down. A lot of farming is now done by large companies, such as Monsanto and Perdue.

Every week, about 330 farmers leave their farms for good. Today, fewer than one out of every 100 Americans are farmers.

Most of the young farmers are new to farming. They are trying to earn a living on small farms. Most did not grow up on a farm.

For new farmers, getting land is very difficult. Seven out of 10 farmers under the age of 30 have to rent farmland. It is much better for farmers older than 30. Just four in 10 of them rent. Also, farmers who were raised on a farm are much more likely to own land.

More than two-thirds of American farmland is worked by people age 55 and older. Over the next 20 years they will become too old to farm.

## "You've Got To Be Smart"

Another problem is that farmland sells quickly. Most young farmers cannot get the money together quickly enough. Between 2000 and 2010, U.S. land prices doubled. Now, a simple farm can cost more than $1 million.

Chris Newman is a Piscataway Indian. He wants to farm as his ancestors once did.

He said he and his wife were very lucky to get their land.

Annie's parents had a house on 26 acres of land here in Virginia. They were going to sell the land. But they agreed to let the young couple use it for a year or so.

At some point, the Newmans hope to find another property.

"Farming's not simple. You've got to be smart to do it," Chris said. "When the pigs escape or you're killing a chicken and you get poop in your mustache, you say, 'Well, people really appreciate what we're doing.'"
