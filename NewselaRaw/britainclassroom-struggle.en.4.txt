LONDON â€” British teenagers will not be studying American books for an important high school exam anymore. The country's education minister wants them to study more British books.

Some readers are angry that Michael Gove is trying to put Britishness back into schools. Gove is in charge of Britain's education laws.

Readers are especially upset about two books. "Of Mice and Men" and "To Kill A Mockingbird" are not on the test's syllabus anymore. These American books were studied by British teens for years.

"The idea of cutting out American books because they are not British is crazy," said John Carey. He is a professor at Oxford University, a famous British school.

Some teachers are worried. They think that not reading these books will narrow their students' horizons.

## Broaden Your Reading, Just Keep It Local

Exam boards in England and Wales pick books that are in line with government rules. They recently released their new book lists for the English Literature GCSE. The GCSEs are important exams taken by 16-year-olds.

Arthur Miller's play "The Crucible" was also cut from the syllabus. African and Asian writers were also dropped.

The new government rules say students must study high quality and difficult books. They must study a 19th-century book and a play by William Shakespeare. They must also study a modern book "from the British Isles."

The old rules did not say the modern books had to be British. The old rules also said students must study writers from different countries.

Gove said his goal was not to shut out non-British writers.

"I have not banned anything," he wrote in a newspaper. "All we are doing is asking exam boards to broaden the books young people study for GCSE."

## Books Can Change The Way We Think

The government says the rules are just what students have to read to pass the exam. It says students who read more widely will do better on the exam.  In addition, it says, students have to study world literature between the ages of 11 and 14.

The new book lists include lots of different kinds of modern British books.

The 19th-century books include "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens and  "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley.

Most people are talking about "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Of Mice and Men." British parents and grandparents remember those books from their own school days. On the day the new lists came out, many angry fans tweeted about it. The word "Mockingbird" even trended on Twitter.

Not everyone was upset that "Of Mice and Men" was cut, though. Janice Turner, a newspaper writer,  said the book was studied for the wrong reasons. She said it was studied because it is short, simple and has a preachy "message": bullying is bad.

Carey, the professor, said he was sad these two American books were cut.

"It's true ... 'Of Mice and Men' is set just because it's short, but it is nonetheless a marvelous book for teaching," Carey said. "It's a wonderful book, deeply human." And reading "To Kill A Mockingbird," he said, can change the way you think.
