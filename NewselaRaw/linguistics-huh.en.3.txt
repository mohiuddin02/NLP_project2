LOS ANGELES â€” Humans speak many languages, and can have a hard time understanding each other. But we may express how we don't understand things in much the same way. A new study examined languages from around the world and discovered what could be a global word: "Huh?"

Scientists traveled to cities and tiny villages on five continents. They visited people who spoke 10 very different languages. Their nearly 200 recordings of casual conversations showed that there are forms of "Huh?" in every language they studied. They word even sounds nearly the same.

The word "Huh?" may not even seem like a word. But the team discovered that it is the glue that holds a broken conversation together. Their findings were published Friday in the journal PLOS ONE. The fact that the word appears over and over reveals a remarkable case of languages developing independently, but in much the same way, they added.

## An Ignored Word

"Huh?" is a not a well-respected word in English. It's seen as filler. But it plays an important part in conversations, said Herbert Clark, who teaches language studies at Stanford University.

When a person misses a bit of information, understanding can break down. There needs to be a quick way to fix it, he said.

"You can't have a conversation without the ability to make repairs," said Clark. He wasn't involved in the study.

For this study, scientists from the Netherlands planned to show that "Huh?" is a true word. They also wanted to see whether other languages had a word like it that filled the same purpose.

The problem is that "Huh?" often seems like such an unimportant part of language. So it's not well recorded, said Nick Enfield. He worked on the report and studies how language affects people's lives.

The word doesn't show up much in the study of language. Scientists who record speakers of distant languages often ignore filler words like "Huh?"

## "Huh?" All Over The World

The scientists went to faraway villages in Ecuador, Laos, Ghana and Australia and spent weeks getting to know the people there. First, they had to gain people's trust. Then they could record casual conversations. They hoped to catch a few instances of  people saying "Huh?" in its natural setting.

"The kind of conversations we collected were just the kind of conversations you and I would have," Enfield said.

The scientists also visited families in Italy, Russia and Taiwan as well as laboratories in Spain and the Netherlands. They studied languages including Cha'palaa in Ecuador, Siwu in Ghana and Murriny Patha in Australia. They also studied Dutch, Icelandic, Italian, Lao, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Spanish. English wasn't included in the study.

They found a remarkable closeness among the "Huhs?" in all the languages. All the words had a single syllable. Typically, they had an "ah" or "eh" sound.

## Different Sounds For "Huh?"

It started with an H in all 10 languages. For instance, the Dutch form is "Heh?" Sometimes, it would start with  the sound in the middle of the English language's "uh-oh."

But, words with the same meaning often sound very different in different languages. Why wouldn't "Huh?" also sound completely different from one language to another?

The Dutch scientists think it's because the word developed in a particular place for a particular need. The point is to quickly fix a broken conversation. The "Huh?" gets the speaker to fill in the listener's blank.

Saying "ah" or "eh" involves little effort. So, speakers can very quickly signal that they missed a bit of information and ask for it again. Sounds such as "ee" or "oo" need more effort. That's probably why they weren't chosen for such a common word.

Just as sharks and dolphins have some of the same moves in the water even though they're very different, all languages have developed a "Huh?" That's because it's so useful for solving a particular problem, scientists said.

"'Huh?' has almost certainly been independently invented many, many, times," said Mark Pagel. He teaches about how language develops at the University of Reading in England. "And that is why it appears universal."
