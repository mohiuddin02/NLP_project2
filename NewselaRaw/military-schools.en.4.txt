EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. â€” Damian Rattler's school has a water leak.

There are cracks on the playground. School chairs are held together by tape.

"We need new stuff," Damian said. He is a sixth-grader at Irving L. Branch Elementary School. The school is on the Edwards Air Face Base in California. It does not just need new stuff, as Damian said. It is also unsafe.

School officials would like to replace the roof. They would like to buy new playground equipment and new doors for classrooms and offices. Air conditioning and better lights are also on their list.

## The Buildings Are Crumbling

Branch is one of 10 California schools on military bases in terrible condition. The United States Department of Defense is responsible for the schools. The California schools are among the most broken-down schools on military bases in the country. Branch is the eighth-worst out of 160 schools on the Defense Department's list.

Congress has given $945 million to fix up schools on bases. However, local school districts or states must pay part of the cost. The money can be hard to find.

Mark Wright is a Defense Department spokesman. California is the only state that has not found money for the repairs, he said.

At Branch, more than half of the students' parents are soldiers.

"It's just sad to think that somebody is out there protecting our country," said Dennison Winchell. He is the principal of the school. "At home, their kids are going to a school with great teachers, but with awful" buildings.

## Districts Are Out Of Money

The repairs needed at Branch will cost nearly $28 million. The government would cover $22 million. However, the school district, Muroc Joint Unified, would have to pay $5.5 million.

The district does not have the money, said Trevor Walker. He is with Muroc Joint Unified.

"We've tried pretty much anything we can think of," Walker said. "We've come up short, sadly."

Public school districts usually pay for major repairs with money from property taxes. Property owners pay taxes on their houses and land. Part of the tax money goes to schools. Military base schools are on government land, which is not taxed. These schools do not receive any money from property taxes.

State Senator Jean Fuller from Bakersfield is a state lawmaker. She wants California to help pay for the repairs.

"We cannot let this stand," Fuller said.

## Schools Should Be Safe

Sierra Sands is located about 70 miles from Edwards Air Force Base. The district has two schools high on the list of those needing to be fixed. Murray Middle School is ranked fourth. Burroughs High School is ranked 10th. Murray was built in the 1940s on the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. It is in such bad shape it cannot be repaired.

The district is struggling to find the money to build a new school, said Ernie Bell. He is the district superintendent.

Muroc Unified is also struggling to find money to fix Branch Elementary. There is not enough money to even start.

Sammy Rattler's wife is in the Air Force. She has been sent overseas five times. They have a child attending Branch. The school, he said, needs more money.

Parents in the military want the best opportunities for their children when they are on a mission out of the country, Rattler said. Parents want them to go to a school that is safe.
