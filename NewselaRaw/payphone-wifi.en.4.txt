NEW YORK, N.Y. — New York is turning its old payphones into a Wi-Fi network. The network will let people use the Internet for free. It is supposed to be the biggest public Wi-Fi network in any city in the world. It is also meant to be the fastest.

There will be about 7,500 hot spots. A hot spot is where people can get Internet service. The hot spots will be in booths called kiosks. The kiosks are tall and thin. Every hot spot will also have a phone that can be used for free. There will also be chargers for cellphones.

## It Seems Good, But Is It Safe?

New York says it will democratize data. That means it will let everybody freely use the Internet. Many people like the idea.

When a person uses a cellphone to go online, they use data. People buy data from a cellphone company. Wi-Fi helps to cut how much data a person uses.

Others are worried. They think it is not safe to use public Wi-Fi. The city said data will be coded. This will keep it safe. No one should be able to read what other people do on their cellphones.

## Goodbye Payphones, Hello Free Wi-Fi

Payphones might seem old-fashioned. Most Americans own cellphones today. There are still about 8,200 payphones on New York streets. They are not used much. They were tested last year. More than 1-in-3 did not work.

The new Wi-Fi plan is called "LinkNYC."

A group of companies will pay to build the network. It will cost them about $200 million. The companies will be paid back with half of the money made from advertising at the hot spots. Advertising at the hot spots is expected to provide $1 billion in 12 years. The city will get the other half of the advertising money.

The service is expected to be super fast. It will be about 20 times faster than home Internet service.

## Other Cities Want Fast Wi-Fi Too

Most Americans carry a cellphone. The New York network can help people use less data, said Erik Stallman. He is a lawyer for a group that supports Internet rights. The Wi-Fi plan can also help cellular networks that are being used a lot, Stallman said. When the networks are used too much they can run slowly.

Some people do not like LinkNYC. A payphone company is taking the city to court. It said it is unfair that only one group of companies can offer the Wi-Fi service. The city has said the plan is fair.

Other cities are trying to set up free Wi-Fi. Boston is one.
