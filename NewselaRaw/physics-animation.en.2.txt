In a small office in Glendale, California, Ron Henderson was jotting down equations on a whiteboard.

Henderson is a physicist — a scientist who studies matter, energy, force and motion. The equations he was writing out were Isaac Newton's Three Laws of Motion.

Newton's laws, Henderson explained, would prove to be the mathematical building blocks for the task at hand: constructing a three-dimensional, bubble-like sphere.

Henderson could easily have been preparing a lesson at Caltech, where he once taught. Instead, he was at DreamWorks Animation's campus, doing his part to bridge the divide between art and science.

## Pencils And Paper Have Been Replaced

Animated films — movie-length cartoons — used to be drawn entirely by hand. Now artists create them on a computer. For complicated effects, understanding the science behind it is very helpful.

Artists working on the upcoming movie "Home" will have to create a lot of soap bubbles. In the film, these are inhabited by a race of tiny aliens called the Boov. What Henderson was explaining was the math underlying a program that will be used to make those bubbles look realistic.

Henderson and his team began preparing by studying drawings and photos of soap bubbles. Last year, Henderson invited a fellow physicist, Alejandro Garcia, to give a lecture titled "Bubble Science."

"He did cool things that we're not doing, like what happens when you make a soap bubble out of hydrogen and set it on fire?" Henderson said, chuckling. "What does that look like?" The bubble made a loud boom and burst into a fireball when an assistant took a Tiki torch to it.

That's the kind of thing that happens when scientists make the move to the movies.

"What we're doing here is creating tools for artists," Henderson said. "I think it's going to be a success."

## Science Behind Filmmaking Is Exciting

Henderson, 47, is one of a growing number of high-level physicists, engineers and other scientists who have left their old careers to work in the movie business.

Demand for their services has grown as animated movies push the boundaries of what can be created on a computer screen. Artists at DreamWorks, Pixar and other studios increasingly rely on the services of people such as Henderson. The scientists use their expertise to help artists create realistic-looking water, fire, dust and other elements.

"The physics behind what's happening in these movies is incredibly complicated," said computer scientist Paul Debevec. "You need real scientists to understand what's going on."

Although they typically get paid more in the film business, Henderson says money isn't the main draw. For most, it's the excitement of working on movies and the challenge of finding solutions to technical problems.

DreamWorks has one of the largest groups of scientists, around 120 in all. Nearly a dozen of them are former employees of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The studio has even hired biologists. They are there to advise animators on how to correctly illustrate such things as the branch structure of a tree.

Henderson finds working at DreamWorks fulfilling on a personal level.

"Science can be a very lonely activity," he said. "I wanted to use my background in computational physics, but I wanted to have the experience of working with people and being able to see the results of what I did."

## It Started With "Shrek"

Henderson first became interested in working in computer animation after seeing the movie "Shrek." The film aroused his scientific curiosity — he wanted to know how it was possible to achieve what he saw.

"What astonished me was how much detail and motion there was in every frame, the motion of the trees, the grass and all the other elements," he said. "I didn't think it was possible."

Much of Henderson's focus at DreamWorks is on figuring out how to do things faster. Even computer animation can be very slow, simply because there are so many shots in a single movie. One film, for example, might have 700 scenes with fire. Henderson and his team spend much of their time trying to come up with more efficient ways of creating effects.

Then there is the technical challenge of creating something visually unique for each film: for example, the frost in "Rise of the Guardians," the cannon fire in "Kung Fu Panda 2" or the ice-breathing dragon in "How to Train Your Dragon 2."

## Bubbles Can Be Complicated

His latest challenge was creating those bubble-like spheres in "Home," which are both dwellings and spaceships for the aliens.

Turns out, creating a computer animation image of a bubble on a flat surface is one thing. Wrapping that image around a floating soccer-ball-like sphere is a much trickier problem of math and physics.

Henderson's solution drew on his physicist's knowledge of how fluids behave in different situations. It is based on a computer program used to predict weather patterns.

The fact that few moviegoers will appreciate his technical achievement doesn't bother Henderson — the work is its own reward.

"Doing something where you can clearly see the results of your work, and where you feel you are providing a unique benefit to the artists — that's what keeps me coming here every day," he said.
