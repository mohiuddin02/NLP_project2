Look at a dog that is being petted and you'll know right away: dogs love physical contact. They are a species that enjoys being touched.

Studies show that dogs aren't the only ones who feel better after being close to a human. Positive interactions between people and dogs can actually make both species happier. After activities such as petting, play or talking, both dogs and humans feel a rush of chemicals in their bodies. The chemicals are called endorphins. The endorphins lead to happy feelings in our brains.

A new study shows that eye contact may help dogs and humans feel close to one another. When you and your dog look at each other it can raise endorphin levels. Higher endorphin levels make both species feel good.

## Feeling Deeply Connected

The new study was done by Miho Nagasawa and her team of scientists. They are from Azabu University in Japan. The team studied the levels of endorphins in humans and dogs. They found that owners and dogs who shared a long gaze had more oxytocin in their bodies. Oxytocin is an endorphin. It is sometimes called the "cuddle hormone." It has an important job in human bonding. A mother's body releases oxytocin after she has a baby. It helps her feel close to her newborn. Gazing between dogs and owners has a similar effect.

The longer the dog and human looked at each other, the more oxytocin their bodies released. In other words, the longer the dog and human stared at one another, the more connected they felt to each other.

Dogs and humans can have deep relationships. The study may help explain why.

Once Nagasawa studied the dogs, she had another question. She wanted to know if other animals connected with humans the same way. So her team also did an experiment with wolves. The study was similar to the dog study. The wolves had been raised by humans. However, there was a big difference between the dogs and wolves.

## For Wolves, Not So Much

The wolves could not hold gazes with the humans for more than a few moments. The researchers believe this is because wolves do not know how to stare. As pets, dogs have learned to communicate with humans. Dogs connect with humans in special ways, like staring. Staring is a form of communication. Wolves may not have learned the skill since they are not pets.

When scientists study animals like this, it is important to understand the difference between the species. For example, there are differences between wolves and dogs. This may help explain why the wolves acted the way they did.

Also, the study may be different. The wolves may have been in a new environment. They may not have been used to the area where the study took place. The wolves may have been exploring a new setting. Or they could have been trying to escape. These are possible reasons why the wolves could not stare at the humans for a long time.

Science has proven something that many humans already feel about dogs. Dogs and humans have a special connection.
