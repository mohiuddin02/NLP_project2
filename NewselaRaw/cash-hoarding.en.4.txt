NEW YORK — In 2008 a major U.S. bank collapsed. Others followed. People lost their homes. Money was tight all over the world. It was called a financial crisis.

Five years later, families are holding on tightly to their money. Not just in the U.S., but in other countries too. It doesn't matter if there are lots of jobs, or unemployment. People everywhere are nervous about spending and investing. The fear of losing what they have is deeper than the wish to get more.

An Associated Press study shows that families in the 10 richest countries are spending carefully. They have pulled billions of dollars out of the stock market. That money is going into savings accounts, for instance. They are safer but their money will hardly grow.

Economist Ian Bright said it doesn't take very much to make people afraid about losing their money. But it does takes a lot for them to take chances again. People's feelings about risk have changed.

## Too Careful With Their Money?

The meaning of this is huge: Not owing money and spending less can be good for a family. But when hundreds of millions of people are too careful with their money, the entire world suffers. Spending creates a need for goods. That leads to more jobs and helps the economy. All the wealth in a country and everything it makes add up to the economy.

A slow-growing economy means that salaries in the United States will not rise quickly. Right now, unemployment in parts of Europe is higher than ever. In several countries, more than a third of young people are out of work.

This means fewer people have extra money to spend. But even people with good jobs are being careful.

"It's safety, safety, safety," said Arne Holzhausen, an economist based in Munich.

The Associated Press studied what people did with their money five years before and after the crisis began. It focused on the world's 10 richest countries. They are: the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Brazil, Russia, Italy and India.

## Spending And Borrowing A Lot Less

Here are the main points from the report:

— RETREAT FROM STOCKS: People sold stocks and put their money into bonds, which are considered safer.

— AVOIDING DEBT: The amount of money people owed increased a lot in the five years before the economic crisis. When the crisis hit, people stopped borrowing so freely. And they have been very slow to begin borrowing again, says Jack Ablin. He is a banker at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.

— CASHING OUT: In the five years after the crisis, households in the six richest countries kept much more of their money in cash. People also put money into bank accounts. They earned little to no interest but felt safer.

— SPENDING SLUMP: Being careful with money by cutting debt and saving more may be good in the long run. But this means people stop spending as much. After the crisis, people's rate of spending slowed down a lot.

— DEVELOPING WORLD NOT HELPING ENOUGH: The richest countries have expected countries with growing economies to help global growth. Brazil, Russia, India and China recovered quickly from the crisis. But this year, their economies are hurting.

## Hoarding Cash For 5 More Years

People will begin spending money again. But few economists expect them to spend like they did before.

Experts say the years before the crisis were not normal either. Families did not earn more. Instead, they borrowed too much money.

More importantly, economists say that people are "scarred" by the crisis. Scarring is the fear of losing money. It doesn't go away so quickly after the economy recovers.

Many Americans suffered through the Great Depression in the 1930s. They remained careful about money even 20 or 30 years later. This was true even after the U.S. economy grew strong.

Now, it may take a while before people begin spending normally again.  Some economists say it may take as many as five years.
