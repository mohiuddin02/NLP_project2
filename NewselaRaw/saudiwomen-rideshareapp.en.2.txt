RIYADH, Saudi Arabia â€” Hala Radwan returned to Saudi Arabia from France with a business degree and found a job at a large international company. She also found she had a unique problem: she did not know how she would get to and from work.

Women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia offers few choices in public transportation and hiring a driver was very expensive. She also did not want to deal with the rude comments she would face if she tried to hail a cab. A woman using public transportation on her own is often seen as lacking morals in this society.

"It was a nightmare," she said.

Friends tipped her off to a solution: Uber and a local company called Careem.

## Rides Are Convenient, But Expensive

Smartphone apps for ride services are becoming very popular in Saudi Arabia's major cities and a large number of young people who are familiar with technology use them. Customers include foreign businessmen who do not want to deal with the country's confusing taxi system. However, more than 80 percent of individual users are women, the app companies say.

The apps have helped women move about freely and become more independent. Otherwise they have to rely on a male relative to ferry them around in the country that believes in a strict form of Islam. However, with the prices starting at about $5 a ride, even supporters of the apps admit that the rides are not cheap.

Radwan, 29, spends nearly $700 a month on rides from Careem.

The cost is slightly higher than for a taxi, but she finds that she can depend on the apps. They are also safer since both Uber and Careem use GPS technology to track their cars. With a few taps, she can see who will be driving her, the type of vehicle he uses and his customer ratings.

Better still, no one can tell she is not using a private car.

## Apps Keep Growing

At least four ride-booking apps are available for download in Saudi Arabia, with more planned. The technology is the same as that used in the United States or Europe, but there are some important differences.

None of the companies work with drivers who use their personal cars, as is the case in other countries. The practice in the United States or Europe allows the companies to carry passengers for cheaper than a taxi or limousine service. Yet, in other countries this practice has created conflict with taxi companies. In Saudi Arabia, they say, the companies get their cars and drivers from licensed businesses.

"We're trying to be good citizens and stay within the rules and offer a better quality of service," Careem's founder, Mudassir Sheikha, said.

His company, which has its headquarters in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, was one of the first to enter the Saudi market in summer 2013. It now has nearly 100,000 users in the kingdom, a figure growing at about 40 percent per month, he said.

"There are some (women) that take five to 10 trips with us every day," Sheikha said. "We don't see that kind of traffic anywhere."

## Few Choices For Women To Get Around

Uber, which has its headquarters in San Francisco, operates in more than 300 cities in 56 countries around the world. It entered the Saudi market a year ago and has also seen fast growth.

There is no actual law banning women from driving in Saudi Arabia. However, as a result of fatwas, or religious orders from traditional Muslim clerics, the government will not grant women driving licenses.

Families who can afford it will hire a driver to take female members to work, school, out shopping or to friends' houses, but even that choice does not always work.

"I have a driver, but sometimes he is too busy bringing my sisters from school," said Gamar al-Douh, age 24. She comes from a family of three girls with no brothers to help with the driving. "If I don't have someone to take me, I use Uber."

## Getting A Ride Can Be Stressful

Radwan and her husband considered a driver, but decided against it. The couple got married two years ago and are trying to save money to buy a house and raise a family.

Her husband could give her a ride to work, but that would take him out of his way.

She and her friends used to always exchange phone numbers for good drivers, but she said they were not always available.

"If you can't find a driver, you have to wait for your husband. If not your husband, then your brother. And you know sometimes everyone is just so busy that going from point A to point B is really difficult," she said. "You can't even walk because (often) there's no sidewalk, so you're afraid of getting hit by a car."

But now the conversation with her friends has changed. If one of them needs a driver, they tell her, "Why don't you take Uber or Careem?"
