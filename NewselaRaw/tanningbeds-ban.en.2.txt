WASHINGTON, D.C. — The federal government is proposing that anyone under the age of 18 be barred from using indoor tanning equipment. The goal is to help reduce skin cancer linked to the devices. Skin cancer can be a very serious and even deadly disease.

The Food and Drug Administration, the government agency responsible for protecting the public's health, also wants to require tanning bed users to sign consent forms. These would acknowledge the risks of the machines, which give off radiation that can cause cancer. Tanning salons and other businesses would have to collect the forms from customers before their first tanning session. Customers would have to sign them again every six months.  

## Skin Cancer On The Rise

For years, dermatologists and medical groups have called for stronger restrictions on indoor tanning. They've pointed to the rising rates of skin cancer among teens and people in their 20s. Women are especially at risk. The leading professional group for skin doctors applauded Friday's news.

"Indoor tanning is the cigarette of this generation, it is so clearly carcinogenic," said Dr. Mark Lebwohl, president of the American Academy of Dermatology. "It is long overdue and a historic victory in our fight to eradicate skin cancer that the FDA has come out with a proposal to restrict indoor tanning."

Twenty three states already have laws banning minors from using indoor tanning equipment. The federal proposal would ban minors from using the beds in all 50 states.

## Warning Labels Not Enough?

Last year the FDA required tanning beds and sun lamps to carry new warnings. These advise that the beds should not be used by anyone under age 18. The FDA has regulated, or controlled, tanning machines for over 30 years. Until this new proposal, it had taken little action to limit their use.

"Despite available information about its adverse effects, many high schoolers continue to use indoor tanning devices," the FDA's Dr. Vasum Peiris said. "Now we're taking further steps."

The FDA would be able to seize machines and fine businesses that don't follow the rules, said Peiris. He is a chief medical officer in the agency's device center. 

## Should Parents Decide?

The Indoor Tanning Association said decisions about tanning should be left to parents, not the government. The group represents makers of tanning beds and related products.

Nearly 74,000 new cases of melanoma are expected to be diagnosed this year. This is the deadliest form of skin cancer. The American Cancer Society, a group that's dedicated to eliminating cancer, also says the disease is expected to cause nearly 10,000 deaths. Most cases are diagnosed in people in their 40s and 50s. However, the disease is linked to sun exposure at a young age.

## More Radiation Than The Sun

Indoor tanning beds deliver between 10 to 15 times more ultraviolet radiation than the midday sun. This type of radiation is a major risk factor for most skin cancers. Experts say people who use indoor tanning equipment face a 59 percent higher risk of melanoma than those who do not.

About 1.6 million U.S. teenagers tan indoors each year. The FDA says more than 33,000 businesses around the country offer tanning beds and sun lamps.

A second proposal from the agency would require manufacturers of tanning equipment to make additional changes to their machines. These would include bolder, easier-to-read warnings and an emergency shut off switch.

The FDA will take public comments on its proposals for 90 days before beginning work to finalize them. There is no deadline for putting them in place.
