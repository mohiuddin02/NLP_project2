BALTIMORE — Real estate agents like to tell everybody about how far they will go to sell a home. These days, some of them will go as high as the sky.

A growing number of agents have started to use [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), unmanned planes, to sell properties. The small machines take pictures and videos of country homes, waterfront land and suburban houses.

Robert McArtor, an agent with Re/Max Components in Fallston, Md., is using a drone to help with his work.

McArtor´s drone looks like a small helicopter with four sets of blades and carries a camera mounted on its belly. It can loop around a house and go as high as 50 feet. He had to practice for more than 20 hours to learn how to fly it, even crashing the aircraft a couple of times.

He says his clients have been really impressed with the images.

"We have created the 'wow' factor," he said.

## There Are Rules For Flying Drones

But not many agents want to talk about the drones. The reason is that using a drone to sell things is not allowed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The FAA regulates the U.S. airspace. It has been working since 2008 on rules for drones and other small flying machines. People flying drones as a hobby are allowed to fly them up to 400 feet in the air.

The National Association of Realtors has advised its members not to use the drones until the FAA issues final regulations. But the group asked the FAA in April to come out with the new rules as soon it can.

Ben Gielow is a lawyer for the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, an industry trade group. He said the FAA is taking so long to write the rules on drones, that it will be more difficult for people to stop using them.

"This industry is starting to form itself," he said. "The longer the FAA waits to write the rules, the more difficult it's going to be to get the horse back in the barn."

The FAA said it expects to publish the rules this year. Its original deadline was 2011.

## Drones Could Start Selling Fast

The agency has issued at least 12 orders for people using drones commercially to stop, said spokesman Les Dorr. The FAA spends most of its time answering questions about drones.

Dorr said the FAA needs to write safety regulations that will protect people and property. But the rules can´t be too hard to follow or it will be difficult for the number of drones to increase.

The FAA says that 7,500 commercial drones may have a license to fly by 2018. But a study by Gielow's group says sales may reach 160,000 units per year by 2020.

In the Mid-Atlantic region, the number of drones used to sell homes is still small. But it is growing.

A study by the MRIS listing service published in March found that only 1.3 percent had used drones to sell properties.

But 13 percent of the 1,300 agents surveyed said they were thinking about using drones in the next 12 months.

Andrew Strauch, a vice president at MRIS, said he has seen drones being used to sell properties on the West Coast. He said it could make buying and selling more efficient.

"We're visual people," he said.

## Drones Don't Coast As Much Money

The drones are very helpful when real estate agents are selling large properties. Buyers benefit from having a complete view of the area, said Ron Howard, who leads one office for Re/Max Preferred. He hired a drone photography company to take pictures when he was selling a large Baltimore County home in 2012.

The company is called Elevated Element and offers real estate photo packages. The price it charges for the service starts at $199. Hiring a photographer and a plane is more expensive. It can cost about $350.

It was a cheaper alternative to using a plane and allowed closer images, Howard said. Most of the houses he is selling are in the city. For those places, he uses images found on Google.

Back in Baltimore, McArtor said more agents will need training on how to use the drones. He is working on a safety course he hopes to one day sell to other agents.

He is not worried about the FAA rules. His wish is that more people will use the drones in the future to sell all kinds of properties.
