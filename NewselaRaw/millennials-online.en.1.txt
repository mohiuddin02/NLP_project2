WASHINGTON, D.C. — A new poll finds African-American millennials say they are just as engaged in getting news online as white millennials. The study further disproves a long-held belief that people of color are at risk of being left behind technologically.

In general, 64 percent of millennials — those 18-34 years old — say they read and watch news online regularly, according to the poll, conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the American Press Institute. Sixty-six percent of African-American millennials say they keep up with the news online, while 65 percent of whites and 53 percent of Hispanics do the same.

The findings suggest that millennials are clearly getting news from social media like Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. They rely less on traditional sources for news, like newspapers.

## Digital Fluency Regardless Of Race

Overall, 57 percent of millennials say they get news and information from Facebook at least once a day. Eighty-one percent say they get it from Facebook at least once a week. And the poll found that Hispanics and African-Americans are just as likely as any millennials to have a paid news subscription.

"People of color are very wired and just as adept in using technology," said Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, which funded the study. He also said millennials are good at finding topics they're interested in through sharing.

In the 1990s, policy makers and advocacy groups expressed concern that minorities would be adversely affected by a so-called "digital divide." They worried that minorities wouldn't have the same access to technology as whites. Over time, however, minorities emerged among the biggest users of certain forms of technology, such as smartphones.

The AP-NORC study found no evidence to suggest that African-Americans and Hispanics lag behind in terms of technology use. It found that nearly all millennials across racial and ethnic groups use a smartphone, and half use a tablet.

## African-American Fans Of Facebook News

There was little differentiation between racial groups in terms of getting news from Facebook, the poll found.

There were differences in how groups used Facebook, however. About half of African-American millennials said they comment on news stories posted to Facebook, compared with about 3 in 10 whites and Hispanics.

African-Americans are also more likely to use Facebook for keeping up with what's "trending" on social media. Forty-one percent of African-Americans used Facebook for this purpose, compared with 29 percent of whites and 24 percent of Hispanics.

## YouTube Rocks Their World

Hispanics and African-Americans are more likely than white millennials to get news and information from YouTube and Instagram.

According to Rosenstiel, YouTube's popularity partially stems from users' ability to produce content without monitors.

"We see topics that aren't mainstream finding a big audience — a lot of gamers, comedy, news commentary. As something goes mainstream, young people look for new channels to exercise some control," he said.

Streaming music, TV, or movies is the most popular online activity among African-Americans, while keeping up with what their friends are doing is the most popular online activity among Hispanics. For white millennials, checking and sending email was most common.

## For Millennials, More "Common Ground"

The study discovered that millennials have much more in common in terms of how they use technology to stay informed than anyone had thought.

"What we've seen is millennials' similarities are much greater than the differences people thought that there were going to be," Rosenstiel said of the online experience. "We've created new common ground."

The survey of 1,045 young adults, including 163 non-Hispanic African-Americans and 162 Hispanics, was conducted from Jan. 5 through Feb. 2, 2015. It was conducted by the Media Insight Project, a partnership between the AP-NORC Center and the American Press Institute, which funded the study.

The survey was conducted using online interviews in English and Spanish done with a random sample of adults age 18-34 who were initially recruited and screened to take part in the survey over the phone. Results from the survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. If a particular number from the study was 50 percent, for instance, it could be as high as 53.8 perfect or as low as 46.2 percent. The margin of error is higher for subgroups.
