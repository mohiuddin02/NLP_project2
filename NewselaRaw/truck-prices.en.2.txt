DETROIT — Raising prices may sound like a strange way to boost pickup truck sales, but General Motors is doing exactly that.

The automaker thinks this will help it win in the red-hot U.S. pickup truck market.

GM is boosting the price tag of the basic version of its 2014 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck by $2,199. That's 8.5 percent higher than it cost in the spring when the pickup arrived in car dealer showrooms. GM is also raising the cost of fancier versions of the Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks by about the same percentage.

## Making Customers Feel Like They're Getting A Deal

Industry analysts suspect that GM's price increase is just one step in a plan meant to increase sales. They expect GM to raise incentives starting next month so dealers who sell its trucks can advertise big discounts. Incentives are deals that lower the price a customer pays. A car maker, for instance, may offer $2,000 off a certain vehicle or a car loan at a very low interest rate.

With incentives, customers will feel like they are getting a deal. Whether they actually do or not depends on the size of the discount.

The move comes after GM's pickup truck sales fell 8 percent in September. Meanwhile, its two biggest competitors' sales rose. Sales of Ford's F-Series, the best-selling pickups in the United States, rose 10 percent. Chrysler's Ram posted an 8 percent increase. The Detroit Three –– as GM, Ford and Chrysler are called –– dominate U.S. full-size pickup truck sales. Between them, the three automakers share 90 percent of the market. The Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan have the remaining 10 percent.

## Auto Pricing Websites Pressure Dealers To Offer Bargains

GM didn't offer the sweet deals Ford and Chrysler did last month, said Jesse Toprak. Toprak is an analyst for the TrueCar.com auto pricing website. Raising prices and then adding incentives to cut the final price is common in the auto business. Truck buyers especially like to get deals, Toprak said.

GM's change in truck pricing is really just a tactic for dealers to sell more cars, he said. The increase covers trucks built after Oct. 7. Pickups now on dealer lots will not be affected.

GM officials may also be counting on a change in buying habits. Shoppers now pay less attention to the sticker price. The sticker price is the listed price on a sticker pasted in a car's window. Toprak says most buyers now research their cars and trucks online before buying. Many independent auto websites suggest prices that are below the sticker price, he said.

Smart customers know how to get a good deal, he said.

## Other Companies Cutting Prices, Not Raising Them

In May, Nissan Motor Co. did the opposite of GM. The Japanese automaker cut prices and incentives. Its cars showed up high in Internet searches by buyers looking for cheaper cars. Nissan sales are up 13 percent since then.

GM spokesman Jim Cain would not say whether the company would increase discounts. Its current round of incentives ends Oct. 31. But he said that incentives give dealers flexibility to increase sales. Some car companies give buyers money back –– called a rebate –– as an incentive. That money can be used as the down payment if a buyer uses a loan to get a truck. The down payment is money customers pay when they get the truck. The rest of the loan is paid over time.

"That does help customers purchase a vehicle from time to time if they've got no money down," said Tom Kool. Kool runs a small Chevrolet dealership in Sturgis, Mich.

Last month, GM spent about nearly 20 percent less on pickup discounts than the previous year. Both Chrysler and Ford offered bigger discounts on their 2013 models last month.

Under GM's new plan, the sticker price on the basic Silverado will rise from $24,585 to $26,670. This includes shipping, according to GM's website. A basic crew cab, which has the biggest interior, will go from $33,195 to $35,095.

When the trucks were introduced, GM kept prices the same as on 2013 models. The increase has been planned for a long time, Cain said.

The Silverado now will cost $1,780 more than Chrysler's Ram Truck and $1,605 more than Ford's F-150. Cain says GM can charge higher prices because it has the newest truck in the market. The Silverado also has the most features, including increased gas mileage.
