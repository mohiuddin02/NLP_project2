Tasty food gets students to eat more healthy lunches, a new study says.

A group of scientists did an experiment. The scientists were from Harvard University in Massachusetts. They studied what more than 2,600 students ate for lunch. The kids were in third grade to sixth grade. The schools were in poor areas.

Chefs were sent to some of the schools. These chefs had been to cooking school. They learned how to make food look good and taste good.

## Lunch Tastes Much Better!

The results were not surprising. When kids were offered better-tasting food, they ate more, said Juliana Cohen. She is one of the Harvard scientists.

Children "are going to like the foods," Cohen said. When they like the foods, "they're going to eat the foods."

This is a big deal. About 30 million children eat meals at school each day. It matters what they eat. Eating junk food for lunch makes too many children overweight. Almost 1 out of every 3 children in the United States has too much body fat. That is not healthy.

At first, the tastier food did not make much of a difference. The children did not choose more fruits and vegetables. But after seven months they did. Scientists also put fruit where kids could really see it. They discovered this made students choose more fruit.

## Chefs Were Helpful

Schools should be patient, Cohen said. They should keep trying. Eventually, students will start eating more fruits and vegetables.

Plain milk was the only failure. Scientists could not get kids to choose plain milk over chocolate. Cohen said schools may have to stop offering chocolate milk.

Chefs can cost a lot of money to hire. But Cohen said they actually saved money for the schools. In cooking school, the chefs learn how much food to order. They learn how to avoid wasting food. That helps the schools.
