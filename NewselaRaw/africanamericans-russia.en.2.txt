MOSCOW — Growing up in Russia — then part of the Soviet Union — Emilia Tynes-Mensah did the same things other children did. She read the books of Alexander Pushkin and listened to the music of Peter Tchaikovsky.

In her home, though, there was also American jazz and Thanksgiving celebrations. There were stories of the struggles facing blacks in the United States. Soul food sometimes replaced Russian beet soup.

That's because her father, George Tynes, was an African-American agricultural expert from Virginia. He had moved to Russia back in 1931.

## Escaping Racism

Tynes was among hundreds of blacks who traveled to the Soviet Union during the first 20 years after the 1917 Russian Revolution. The revolution brought the Communist Party to power. It also led to the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), or Soviet Union, a group of republics with Russia at its head.

Some of the African-Americans who traveled to Russia were Communists, but others were simply curious adventurers.

"My father didn't know anything about this country. He didn't know what to expect," Tynes-Mensah, 73, said as she sat in her Moscow apartment.

"Everybody who would come to the Soviet Union from America, my father would tell them, 'Please don't forget to bring me some records,'" Tynes-Mensah said. "He loved Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Paul Robeson. But he also loved classical music and opera and ballet."

Most of the African-Americans who came to Russia were seeking a better life, said historian Allison Blakely.

They were hoping to escape the racism that made life so difficult in the United States, Blakely said.

## Russia Offered Special Treatment

Today, fewer than 50 descendants of these African-Americans are believed to still live in Russia. In all, their numbers in the former Soviet republics could be somewhere between 100 and 200.

Soviet officials actively recruited skilled foreigners, Blakely said. About 18,000 Americans answered the call to work in the Soviet Union during the 1930s, he said. Among them were several hundred African-Americans. Dozens of them lived in the Soviet Union for 10 years or so, Blakely said.

The African-Americans who came to the Soviet Union included engineers, teachers, entertainers, journalists and lawyers.

The Soviets gave them special treatment. They received fat paychecks, low-cost housing and free vacations.

"My father felt the USSR treated him better than America," Tynes-Mensah said. "He was happy here."

Tynes, a graduate of Wilberforce University in Ohio, was an agricultural expert. Nonetheless, back in America he could only find work washing dishes in a restaurant, his daughter recalled. So he jumped at the opportunity to go to Russia, although he never joined the Communist Party.

## No Longer Welcome

The experience of African-Americans who traveled to or settled in Russia was overwhelmingly positive, descendants said. In turn, they made valuable contributions to Soviet society, said Blakely, the professor. African-American agricultural experts helped come up with different uses for materials, such as rope made from hemp. They also helped develop plant species that were cheaper to grow.

Tynes was sent to various Soviet republics to teach people how to raise ducks and other waterfowl. He became a nationally recognized expert on poultry.

African-Americans in the Soviet Union had an influence far beyond their numbers, Blakely said. "They were very much in the public eye."

Within years, however, such attention was unwelcome. After the dictator Josef Stalin came to power, foreigners were no longer trusted. People who were not citizens of the Soviet Union were ordered to leave the country.

## War Of Words

African-Americans still living in the Soviet Union were shunned during the Cold War, which began in 1947 and lasted 45 years. During this period, the United States and the Soviet Union became bitter enemies. Their conflict was known as the Cold War because there was no actual military fighting between the two, just a war of words.

During the Cold War, African-Americans in Russia were shunned because they were foreigners, not because they were black.

Tynes-Mensah, whose mother was Russian-Ukrainian, said she was keenly aware when she was growing up that she was different.

"I was afraid to go out in public," said Tynes-Mensah, who has light brown skin and a short Afro. "People used to stare — but it was curiosity. They were not angry."

Today Russia has a racism problem, as many people have moved to the country from Africa.

Tynes-Mensah was born in Russia, became a chemistry teacher, and today runs a group helping mixed-race children in Russia, most of whose fathers came to Russia from Africa. She lives mainly in the United States nowadays, but still spends summers in Russia.
