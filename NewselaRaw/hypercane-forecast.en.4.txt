A new scientific study shows that hurricanes in the future could be terrible. They could be worse than we have ever seen. Ten years ago, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Louisiana, and other Gulf Coast states. It was the worst U.S. hurricane ever. Hurricanes in the future could be even worse.

Scientists used a new computer program for the study. It looked at how hurricanes happen. It also looked at global warming. Global warming is when Earth's climate gets hotter. The computer made a model. It showed possible storms in the future.

The hurricane study was done by two scientists. Their names are Ning Lin and Kerry Emanuel.

## Scientists Say People Should See What Storms Can Do

The chance of these hurricanes happening is very small. They might never happen. Still, Emanuel said it was important to do the study. The scientists wanted people to know what a really bad hurricane would look like.

Emanuel spoke about the worst hurricanes. He said a hurricane with winds near 500 miles an hour is possible. It could happen if an asteroid hits the Earth. Hurricanes start over hot water. An asteroid would really heat up the ocean. Emanuel called this storm a "hypercane."

The scientists looked at possible hurricanes in Tampa, Florida. Tampa has not been hit by a serious hurricane since 1921. That storm caused 10- to 11-foot floods. The floods are called a storm surge.

## Shallow Water Puts Florida Bay In Danger

There is a reason bad hurricanes can hit Tampa. Water is deep east of Florida. It is shallow to the west. Storm surges from shallow water can be much larger, Emanuel said.

The computer program showed an even worse storm is possible in Tampa.

It could happen in under a hundred years. Terrible global warming would be needed for the huge hurricane. Global warming could make hurricanes worse, the study showed. The storm could cause surges of 37 feet if it happened.

## Hurricane Could Also Hit Persian Gulf

The study also showed that a big hurricane could hit the Persian Gulf. It would be in Dubai, United Emirates. There has never been a hurricane in the Persian Gulf.

The waters in the Persian Gulf are very hot. Hurricanes pick up energy from steamy water. The energy makes a hurricane stronger. The atmosphere there is normally too dry for hurricanes, Emanuel explained. Still, one could happen.

The hurricane could have winds of over 250 miles an hour. It would be stronger than any hurricane ever.
