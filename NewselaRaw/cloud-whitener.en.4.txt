Planet Earth is getting hotter. The climate is changing. Scientists around the world are trying to find ways to stop this. It is a very hard problem to fix. If the Earth keeps getting hotter, it may change how plants, animals and humans live.

## Inventing A "Cloud Whitener"

Scientists in California are working together on a new machine. The team is made up of retired scientists. They range in age from 60 to 79 years old. They are trying to do something that has never been done before. The scientists are building a "cloud whitener."

The "cloud whitener" might help cool down the planet. The machine would shoot tiny drops of water into the sky. The drops would make clouds or fog. Clouds and fog protect the Earth from the heat of the sun.

Not all scientists think this is a good idea. Some think it might be unsafe to change the weather.

## Will It Work?

Scientists have another worry. If the cloud whitener works, people may not change the things that are warming the planet. They want people to burn less coal, oil and natural gas. These emit carbon dioxide into the air. This helps cause global warming.

Stephen Gardiner is a professor in Washington. He thinks the world is not ready for this technology. Gardiner says it needs to be studied more first.

The scientists in California do not agree with Gardiner. They think Earth is running out of time. We need to test this technology, said Armand Neukermans. He is 74 years old and is the leader of the team.

## A Cooler World For Their Grandchildren?

Jack Foster is another one of the scientists in the group. He is 79 years old. He says they do not want to use the cloud-whitener unless they have to.

None of the men in the group will be alive for the large changes in climate. Their new machine may not be used while they are alive. They do not care. All of them "have children or grandchildren," Neukermans said. They are doing it for them.

The cloud-whitener could be used to help cool down forests and coral reefs too.

The scientists say they will be very happy if their new tool succeeds. Still, they think it would be even better to have no global warming at all.
