PHILADELPHIA, Pa. — "Hope" was a scrawny German shepherd picked up as a stray this summer in York County, Pennsylvania. With protruding ribs and a thinning coat, she didn't look like much.

But she had spunk and a drive that Carol Skaziak believed might make her an ideal police dog.

Thus began a nine-week rehabilitation project of taking a stray of unknown origins and giving her a future with purpose. The undertaking offered no guarantee of success.

## Rescue Group Takes A Gamble

Throw Away Dogs Project, a Huntingdon Valley, Pa. nonprofit, rescues shelter dogs and donates them to small agencies in need. It was co-founded by Skaziak and Jason Walters, a police officer and K-9 handler with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. Skaziak and Walters didn't know much about Hope, including how long she had been on her own. But they decided to give the undaunted tail-wagger a second chance.

Skaziak renamed her Rousey. She is named after the popular mixed martial arts fighter Ronda Rousey.

It feels great to save a dog's life, give them a job and help police officers, Skaziak said.

From local police to the U.S. Department of Defense, many different organizations use working dogs. Dogs also provide protection for corporations and individuals. 

## Often, Police Cannot Afford Dogs

The stakes are high for law enforcement agencies when looking for working dogs. A patrol dog who can not perform in a violent encounter is unacceptable.  

Law enforcement dogs often come from elite European breeders and cost between $6,000 to $30,000. Many police departments cannot afford them.

Throw Away Dogs intends to fill that need — even if it is, for now, one dog at a time.

Skaziak met Hope at the Char-Will German Shepherd Rescue. Later, she returned with Walters so he could meet her, too. Inside a huge training building, skinny Hope displayed her strong hunt drive by fetching tennis balls and sniffing out hidden objects. She walked by a kennel with menacing barking dogs without flinching. 

"I don't think she has any fears," Walters said.

Skaziak took Hope home. 

## Trainers Test Rousey's Bite

There were weeks of daily training with a foster family. Then, in early September, the most important test came for the newly renamed Rousey.

She was taken to an empty field where she worked with trainers. One of the trainers, Steve Primavera, was familiar with Schutzhund, a traditional German sport used to evaluate dogs for police work. The trainers were there to test Rousey's bite.

Primavera wore a padded bite sleeve. He drew Rousey's attention by swatting the sleeve with a stick.

Rousey reared up on her hind legs and started barking ferociously. Then, she bit the padded sleeve and refused to let go.

Primavera smiled.

"Exactly what we wanted to see," he said.

## "This Is What Fulfills This Dog"

He continued with the bite tests. He kept raising the stick in a mock threat and then hitting Rousey's leash.

Rousey refused to yield.

"This is what fulfills this dog," trainer Pat Harvey said. "This dog wants to be in a working situation."

Skaziak was excited to learn about Rousey's bite ability. It was a chance for her nonprofit to produce a dog that could do many things. Not only could she sniff out bombs or drugs, but she could also patrol and apprehend, or catch, suspects.

Throw Away Dogs has already provided dogs to several law enforcement agencies. Skaziak dreams of building a Throw Away Dogs ranch someday. 

## Passing The Courage Test

In October, Skaziak and Walters delivered Rousey to the Winchester Police Department in Virginia. She had weighed 50 pounds at Char-Will. Now she was at 70 pounds, and her coat was thick and even.

For Rousey's evaluation, she was first tied to a tree. A stranger wearing a gray hoodie emerged and menaced her, pretending to strike her with a raised arm.

Sergeant Brian King, head of the department's K-9 unit, told Skaziak that was a "courage test" to see how Rousey would react. Skaziak, Walters, and other members of the Winchester police were kept away.

King said Rousey was staring at the stranger — "she's got her ears up, paying good attention."

Then Rousey started barking.

## Fearless And Ready To Join The Force

After a few moments, the stranger revealed himself to be police detective Steven Spaid, a K-9 trainer. Spaid brought Rousey back.

"She ain't scared at all," he said.

The next test was fetching balls in tall grass. Rousey retrieved the ball each time, even after trainers spun her around to see if she would be disoriented.

Spaid then tested Rousey on a bite sleeve. Rousey barked excitedly and bit hard.

The testing was done.

"She'll work," Spaid said. 

It was time for Skaziak and Walters to let Rousey go.

Skaziak teared up.

"Please take care of her," she said.
