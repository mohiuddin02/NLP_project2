MIAMI â€” Christina Morua sat in the children's section of her local library. She was waiting for her fourth-grader to get on a library computer and start her homework.

"We don't have any Internet at home," Morua said. Her 11-year-old son was working on a laptop. Her 9-year-old daughter, Alina, asked for a desktop. She had to wait over an hour to use it.

More and more schools are giving homework online. Yet many kids, like Morua's, cannot get on the Internet at home. They go to the library to use the Internet. However, they find that many libraries do not have enough computers for everyone.

"The laptops we do have, the batteries aren't working," said Patricia Readon. She is a children's librarian. "The sad part is, if you don't have a computer, you can't do your homework."

Pauline Theobolds has a computer at home. It does not work properly with her 12-year-old son's school Internet connection. They need to leave the library by 6:30 p.m. so she can go to her job as a nurse. "The other night was tight because they didn't have any computers," she said.

## Lots Of Money, But Not For Computers

Miami-Dade's libraries have an extra $4 million to spend this year. The money is needed to pay workers, buy new children's books and do online tutoring. There is no money left over to buy more computers, said Gia Arbogast. She is in charge of the library system.

There is a bright side, Arbogast said. Older laptops have been replaced with new tablets.

Still, more computers are needed, Arbogast said.

Silvia Diaz is an official in the Miami-Dade school system. Diaz said eventually every student will have a tablet or computer and Internet access at home.

"Unfortunately, so many of our kids are poor," she said. The school system is trying to find ways for students to have free or cheap home Internet. For now, teachers should give online homework only if the whole class can use the Internet at home, she said.

"We really shouldn't be requiring kids to go to the library to complete assignments," Diaz said. "A project or something special is OK." Daily online homework is not OK, she said.

## Many Homes Do Not Have Computers

Isaiah Goulbourne is a junior at Miami Norland Senior High School. Most of his school books are online. But he uses a real book for English. It never leaves the classroom. "We're not allowed to take them home because there aren't enough for everyone," he said.

Goulbourne said he needs the library to do schoolwork. His family does not have Internet use at home. Internet is especially popular at the library in Miami Gardens. One in 5 people who live there are poor.

In 2011, young people at libraries were asked about the Internet. Nearly half of them said they did not have the Internet at home. In the whole country, 1 out of 5 children live in a home without Internet access.

Leaving the house to do homework every night makes it harder to succeed in school, experts say.

Michele Stiles runs the South Dade Library. She said there are long waits for computers at many libraries. Some students do not finish their homework because they cannot get on a computer.

When that happens, Stiles said, librarians give "excuse notes" for teachers.
