PITTSBURGH — Over the past decade, the Carnegie Science Center (CSC) has worked to be a leader in offering science education for girls. The museum has created programs such as science sleepovers and visits to science labs. Its website, CanTEEN, engages tween and teen girls in science through contests, exhibits and workshops.

So CSC was quite surprised to come under attack for its sole offering for the Girl Scouts. The program, called "Science With a Sparkle," teaches girls how to become a "cosmetic chemist."

The controversy began after part of a page from one of the museum's brochures appeared online. The page showed a long list of serious science programs for Boy Scouts, such as robotics, engineering and astronomy. Its only offering for Girl Scouts was the workshop on how to create your own makeup.

## Criticism Came Quickly

The next day, websites and blogs such as Jezebel and Wonkette, wrote about it angrily. "Marie Curie may very well rise from her grave to gnash her teeth," Jezebel wrote. Curie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics.

One of the biggest topics in education is how to make science interesting to girls, and careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) more attractive. Wonkette said despite that goal, "you're offering MAKEUP?" The blog added that the course was too old-fashioned and stuck in a different time period, such as the 1950s.

Comments appeared on the Science Center's Facebook page as well, calling the museum "shameful" and "ridiculous."

The Science Center responded last week with long posts explaining the thinking behind the program. It had tried other programs to appeal to Girl Scouts in the past, such as engineering, chemistry and robotics. However, few Girl Scouts signed up for them. The only programs the Science Center could fill were museum sleepovers and Science With a Sparkle.

## Let's Get The Conversation Started

The Girl Scouts also responded through social media. It noted that Science With a Sparkle was not created by the Girl Scouts. The Science Center just offers the program to Girl Scouts, as well as other organizations.

Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania does currently run STEM programs.  Program topics include "It's Your Planet — Love It." It also has partnerships with local groups, such as The Phipps Conservancy, a botanical garden in Pittsburgh, said Melissa Cooper. She is the regional Girl Scouts vice president.

The Girl Scouts and the Carnegie Museum are now working together to create programs for girls, she said.

"A tremendous opportunity exists, and this got a conversation started, to say the least," Cooper said.

## Sparking The Girls' Interest

As for Science With a Sparkle, the program has been around for about five years, said Linda Ortenzo, director of STEM programs at the Science Center. It was actually named years ago when different choices were presented to a group of girls, and they picked that one, she said.

Ortenzo defended the program. She said Science With a Sparkle teaches real chemistry, using makeup as the entry point to get girls interested.

"Really, it's a larger discussion about what we offer for girls, and what we know works," she said. "With girls, presenting them with real-world problems is a natural way to get them interested in STEM."

Furthermore, she said, Science With a Sparkle was just one program among many. The bottom of the brochure page, which did not appear online, featured the "Tour Your Future" program. It takes girls to businesses such as Schell Games, an educational game company, and Valspar, which makes paints. Popular Science Center programs, such as camps and after-school activities, are also open to girls.

"There is not one particular avenue for engaging people in STEM — there are many," she said. "The most important thing is that girls get the message early that STEM is for them."

## Commitment To Science Is There

Heather Arnet is the head of the Women &amp; Girls Foundation of Western Pennsylvania. She has worked with the Science Center for years on programs for girls. She said she was surprised by how angry people were with the science museum. It has a "long historical commitment to the issue of engaging girls in STEM," she said.

But in all the negative words directed toward the Center, she also saw a silver lining.

"What I think was really great was the parent response all over social media," she said. Mothers and fathers were engaged in the conversation about the need for girls to have good STEM classes and get interested in science.

"That's a good thing for everyone," she said.
