Workers at fast-food restaurants are accusing some employers of wage theft. They say the restaurants failed to pay them what they're owed.

They are going to court to get back their wages. Lawsuits have been filed in three states. States have also gotten employers to pay big money to settle such cases.

On Thursday, workers protested in front of three McDonald's and Burger King restaurants in Kansas City, Mo. Some of their signs said "wage theft" and "stolen wages." The protest was organized by the StandUpKC coalition. Fast-food workers and religious leaders were there. Members of labor unions also protested. Unions represent groups of workers to help fight for better pay and rights.

McDonald's and Burger King said wage theft is against company rules. They say that they investigate if employees say they were cheated.

## Examples Of Wage Theft

Burger King said Thursday that the company "respects the rights of all workers." The company said most of its restaurants are owned by independent "franchisees." These franchisees do not work for Burger King. They own their own Burger King restaurants. They pay the Burger King company so they can open their own Burger King restaurant, called a franchise. Burger King said it does not make decisions for the franchisees.

McDonald's says that it takes all complaints seriously.

There were many wage theft protests in the U.S. in March. The protests come as President Obama and others in Washington push for an increase in the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage). The minimum wage is the lowest amount an employer is allowed to pay a worker.

Employers can take wages in many ways, the workers said.

The employers may change records to lower the number of hours workers put in. This is often done to avoid paying overtime hours. Sometimes workers are asked to work more hours in a week than usual. Employers often have to pay workers more for each extra hour they work when this happens.

They may also charge workers for uniforms. Or they can make the workers pay for other things that would bring their pay below the minimum wage.

An employer can also incorrectly say a worker is not supposed to get overtime. Or, a company could demand work be done without paying workers for their time. This is called "off-clock" work.

A survey company spoke with more than 1,000 fast-food workers. Nine in 10 said they had experienced some form of wage theft.

## Wage Abuses Hard To Stop

Michael Saltsman is a spokesman for the Employment Policies Institute. His group generally supports the owners of restaurants. He said his group doesn't take such surveys very seriously. Some wage theft surely exists, he said. But people think it happens more because the supporters of workers unions push the idea, he said.

But labor supporters said the problems are widespread. Lawsuits have been filed against McDonald's and some of its franchisees in California, Michigan and New York. In general, they say workers were forced to clock out as if they were done with their day. But, they had to keep working. They also say that overtime wasn't paid. Another claim is that the companies charged employees too much for uniforms.

One McDonald's franchisee in New York paid $500,000 to end a wage theft case. Workers were supposed to be paid back for the costs of cleaning their uniforms. The restaurant owner supposedly did not pay them back.

There was another case, too. Owners of 23 Domino's pizza places in New York agreed to pay $448,000 to workers who claimed they were paid less than the minimum wage. A Domino's spokesman said the case involved franchisees. Those franchisees are "independent business owners," the spokesman said. They are responsible for how they treat their workers.

Labor supporters say wage abuses are hard to stop because the U.S. Department of Labor doesn't have enough money or workers to really investigate wage theft. The Labor Department is in charge of making sure work laws are followed.

"There just aren't enough people to enforce the laws," said Catherine Ruckelshaus. She is a lawyer at the National Employment Law Project. Workers have to tell their stories to make the system work, she said. "And that's really hard."
