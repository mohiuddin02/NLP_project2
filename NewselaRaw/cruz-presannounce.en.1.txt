LYNCHBURG, Va. — Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, announced — again — his candidacy for president on Monday. The senator made his announcement at Liberty University, a symbol of the American evangelical Christian movement.

"Today, I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States," Cruz said in a speech to students. "Ted! Ted!" students yelled.

"It is the time for truth. It is the time for liberty. It is the time to reclaim the Constitution of the United States," Cruz said.

## Setting The Campaign Tone

Cruz's speech had the feel of a sermon at a megachurch, with the candidate wearing a wireless microphone and walking around a stage while delivering his remarks. He discussed the humble background of his parents and how his wife is the daughter of missionaries. He pointed out that he had to borrow $100,000 to attend college and that he only paid it off a few years ago. He talked about the power of the American dream and rallying average people to propel his campaign forward.

The speech spoke to many different groups within the Republican Party. Cruz embraced the goals of Christian conservatives, military supporters and members of the tea party, who want a smaller government. The location of the announcement, at an evangelical college, showed that Cruz hopes to get young people involved in his campaign.

An adviser to Cruz said the speech was meant to highlight Cruz's optimistic side, which often gets lost amid his reputation as someone in the Senate who tries to block legislation in Congress. It is an approach that Cruz will continue on the campaign trail. He plans to emphasize a positive message of moving America forward and uniting conservatives behind his campaign. At the same time he will continue to show he is willing to take on both parties and will not budge in his beliefs. Cruz has pushed for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the health care law nicknamed Obamacare. He has also called the abolition of Common Core education standards and has expressed doubts about the reality of climate change, or global warming.

## It Started With A Tweet

Cruz had already announced his candidacy with a tweet Monday morning. Cruz decided to declare it again here at Liberty, to make it clear that he is courting young people and evangelicals and conservatives who are frustrated with Republicans in Washington.

"I'm running for president, and I hope to earn your support!" he wrote early Monday. That made Cruz, who has been in the Senate since 2013, the first major candidate to formally declare himself running in 2016. A large field of other Republican hopefuls have been jockeying unofficially for a spot as the front-runner, including Cruz.

On Monday, Cruz said it again, in person, at the ceremony at Liberty University, which was a required event for students there.

"We stand together for liberty!" Cruz said. "This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington ... (It will come) when the American people stand together, and say, 'We will get back to the principles that made this country great.'"

## Family Background

Cruz began his speech by discussing his parents. He described his mother's childhood in Delaware and his father's escape from Cuba. He drew from their stories lessons about the power of Christianity — which Cruz said convinced his father to return after abandoning his family — and about American freedom. His father's experience in Cuba, Cruz said, had taught him "how fragile liberty is."

The student audience cheered like a concert crowd. Cruz got loud applause when he mentioned the historic Virginian Patrick Henry, or his own student loans, or the idea of abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, the government agency that collects taxes.

They booed loudly when Cruz mentioned President Barack Obama's health care law, which was signed five years ago today.

## A Call To Imagery

Cruz moved around the stage, urging students to imagine scenarios in which conservative ideals prevailed in Washington. Imagine no "Obamacare." Imagine no Common Core.

"Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life, and to uphold the sacrament of marriage," he said, focusing on evangelical priorities as well as non-religious conservative ones. "Instead of a government that works to undermine our Second Amendment rights — that seeks to ban our ammunition – imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law-abiding Americans."

Cruz drew parallels with moments in American history: the American Revolution, the Great Depression, the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. He said Reagan helped win the Cold War and revive the American economy.

"Compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the IRS ain't all that tough," Cruz said.

## Taking Hold Of The Race

Earlier, Cruz showed that he understands how modern media works. He managed to make the announcement of something entirely unsurprising — that he is running for president — into four separate news events.

First, his campaign announced a major speech. Then, his team leaked the news that the speech was, indeed, his announcement. Then came the tweet. Now, for television, he will go through the familiar ritual of a candidacy launch: a speech, a crowd, his family, American flags.

Cruz's official entry seems likely to throw the 2016 presidential race into high gear. By announcing early, Cruz intends to seize the attention of big donors and voters who favor the tea party, a group that supports low taxes and small government. He has managed to beat conservative rivals like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and neurosurgeon Ben Carson to the punch. By announcing at a evangelical Christian site like Liberty, Cruz is also hoping to attract evangelical voters who might also be interested in possible candidates like former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.

## Infamous Filibuster

The Harvard and Princeton-educated lawyer, 44, was elected to the Senate in 2012. He is best known for trying to block Obama's health care law from going into effect in 2013. His efforts included a 21-hour filibuster on the Senate floor — a crusade that helped lead to a 16-day government shutdown.

Cruz's campaign is looking to raise $40 million to $50 million for the primary race. The campaign is also buying digital advertising early so it can give Cruz greater name recognition before primary voting.

He has talked about harnessing small-dollar grassroots donations, and draw from a base of conservatives nationwide as well as a few rich donors.

Cruz supports fewer restrictions on campaign spending. "Money absolutely can be speech," he said last week, referring to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that found the government cannot prohibit corporations or other organizations from donating to elections because it would violate the right to free speech as outlined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Cruz lives in Houston with his wife and two young daughters. His wife, Heidi, works for Goldman Sachs, a large investment bank. She will take a leave of absence to campaign with her husband.
