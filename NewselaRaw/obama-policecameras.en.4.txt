WASHINGTON â€” In August, an African-American teenager named Michael Brown was shot. He was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. He was 18 years old. People in the community were upset. They held protests. They wanted a change in how police treat the people of their town.

They held up signs, marched and shouted. They felt Brown's death was not right.

To keep the protests calm, police departments sent officers. The police had armored cars, large guns and body armor. They looked more like soldiers than police. Their weapons made some people more upset.

Now, President Barack Obama is ordering new rules. He wants to help fix the relationship between police forces and the communities they protect. Some people do not trust the police.

## Obama's Plans

Obama has two plans to fix the problem. He wants to control how police get military weapons. He also wants police officers to wear cameras.

The president is offering to spend $263 million over three years to train police officers. This will also pay for body cameras. These cameras record when the police deal with the public. The money could help buy as many as 50,000 cameras.

Cameras like these could tell people more about Brown's death. Last week, a grand jury in Missouri made a decision. They found that the officer who shot Brown should not be brought to trial. The officer said Brown was attacking him, while witnesses said different things. Video could have shown what happened.

Video could protect police officers from threats for doing their job. It could also hold officers responsible if they break any rules.

## No Clear Rules

The White House is also looking at how police get military equipment. They get guns and armored cars through "surplus" programs. The programs give local police departments weapons and other equipment used by the military.

The White House looked into the programs and found they did not have clear rules. They found police did not have to be trained to use the military equipment.

Police in Ferguson have been using the military equipment at the protests.

Now, Obama's staff has to come up with a list of allowed military gear. They will list equipment that police have a real need for. This will make sure it can be used safely by local police forces.

The new rules will also change how local police departments buy guns and other tools. Communities will know about any new tools bought by local police. Police will also have to be specially trained to use the new tools.

Obama is also forming a group that will come up with ideas for fighting crime while building more trust in police.
