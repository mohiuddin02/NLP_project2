On Friday, hunters will begin arriving at the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. Loxahatchee is a vast sweep of swamp and forest. It stretches between Boca Raton and Wellington.

A refuge is a safe place for wildlife to live away from humans.

At this refuge though, the hunters are coming with one purpose in mind: to kill some of the alligators.

Eleven hunters were awarded permits to kill two alligators each. A total of 1,203 people had applied for permits. The winners were selected by chance, in a drawing.

## "Bloody, Unnecessary"

The hunters will mostly work at night. They will be allowed to kill alligators in various ways. Some will use sticks with sharp knives at the end called harpoons. Others will use spear guns, crossbows or a "bang stick." The bang stick is a pole that shoots a bullet into the alligator's brain.

The hunt will run through October.

When the first hunters arrive Friday, they will be greeted by protesters from the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida. The group is one of several opposed to the hunt.

"It's not a refuge if there's state-sponsored animal killing going on there," said Don Anthony, spokesman for the group. "These animals are harpooned, stabbed or hooked and never die a quick or painless death." Not only is the hunt "bloody," he said, it's also "unnecessary."

## Plenty Of Alligators

Rolf Olson, project leader at Loxahatchee, defended the hunt. He pointed out that hunting has been traditional at wildlife refuges since the time of President Theodore Roosevelt. The president established the nation's first national wildlife refuge in 1903. He was also a hunter himself.

What's more, Olson said, hunting is not new to Loxahatchee. The refuge has long allowed duck hunting.

Olson said the alligator population at Loxahatchee is large. A survey at one water way in the hunt area, he added, found 134 of them.

The refuge, he said, has plenty of alligators. The hunt, he insisted, shouldn't have any real effect on "the total alligator population."

Olson said the protesters were welcome to express their opinions at the refuge. They will not be permitted to try to stop the hunt, though.

They have a "right" to protest, he said. "They will be able to protest and speak their minds." As long as they don't break the law, "they're allowed to be in the area."

## Hunting At Night

Olson said the protesters will not be hidden away and any hunters arriving will see them.

The protest is planned at the refuge's south entrance, not at the visitor's entrance.

The refuge has said the hunt may be expanded if all goes smoothly.

Law enforcement officers will oversee the hunt, Olson said. Although only 11 people were issued permits, they are free to bring helpers.

The hunt is timed so that few if any visitors to the refuge will see any hunters, Olson said. It will take place only on Friday and Saturday nights. Hunters will be allowed in from an hour before sunset until an hour after sunrise.

Most of the hunters "will be there when no one else is out there," he said.
