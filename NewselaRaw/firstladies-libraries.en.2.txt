<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140918_Pres_LIBRARIES.jpg" />CHICAGO â€” When a president leaves office, a library is built to preserve documents and historical materials from his time in the White House. These presidential libraries gather the records of each president and put them on display for thousands of visitors each year.

Modern presidential libraries are not just concerned with presidents, however. They also showcase the work and lives of presidents' wives, traditionally known as "first ladies."

Richard Norton Smith, a presidential scholar, explained that first ladies have become more prominently featured in presidential libraries. Their accomplishments are now being exhibited alongside their husbands'. That way, Smith said, libraries can capture the partnership between the president and first lady.

## Careful Planning And Preparation

Libraries are also doing more to recognize the important roles that first ladies play. Many of the women have taken on major national projects. For example, recent first ladies have led public campaigns to improve education and health.

It makes sense that presidential libraries document first ladies' lives and work. Many first ladies actually lead the way in planning and constructing the libraries.

The current first lady, Michelle Obama, is a good example. As her husband's time in office winds down, she will help coordinate the planning of his presidential library. This will require choosing where the library will go, raising money to build it, and deciding what it will look like after it is completed.

The library will also include records of Michelle Obama's work as first lady. A spokeswoman for the Obama foundation said her public service "will be prominently featured in the library."

## Highlighting Individual Efforts

Some first ladies help oversee the planning of presidential libraries, but not all of them do. It depends on the first lady. Likewise, some presidential libraries feature first ladies more prominently than others.

Hillary Rodham Clinton did not play a large role in planning the library of her husband, President Bill Clinton. She was busy as a U.S. senator at the time. She is featured in at least two exhibits in her husband's presidential library, however. An exhibit called "Putting People First" highlights her efforts to reform health care. Another exhibit focusing on education includes several awards that she received.

First lady Laura Bush was a driving force behind President George W. Bush's library. As a former librarian, she was well-prepared to oversee the project. She helped choose the library's location and oversee its design.

Not only that, she also helped plan out the library's exhibitions. For example, she thought it was a bad idea to have a section on education go straight into an exhibit focusing on the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, especially for children. As a solution, she added a reading nook stocked with some of her favorite books so that children could stay behind and read as their parents went through.

## Sarah Polk Got The Ball Rolling

Michelle Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Laura Bush are among a long line of first ladies who have helped put together presidential libraries. In fact, it was first lady Sarah Polk who set up the first-ever presidential library.

In 1849, President James Polk left office because of his failing health. He died soon after, and his wife, Sarah, collected his historical objects, paintings and papers. She put them in a small room where they could be viewed by the public.

First lady Lucretia Garfield took it a step further. She added a wing to her home that included a fireproof research room and a vault to hold her late husband's presidential papers.

Many other first ladies, including Nancy Reagan, Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson, were involved with their husband's libraries. Jacqueline Kennedy, however, may have had the most direct role of all of them.

President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. After his sudden death, the entire job of establishing his library fell to his wife, Jacqueline.

"She was responsible for fundraising, choosing the architect, developing the exhibits and choosing which of the president's personal objects would go on display," said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a historian at the National First Ladies' Library.

## Preserving History

Today, first ladies continue to play large roles in overseeing presidential libraries. They have been active in other areas, too. First ladies have helped presidents shape and communicate their policies. Some have served as examples of good character for the American people. Others have fought for a cause they believe in.

Presidential libraries, in other words, are just some of the many projects that first ladies work on. In turn, these libraries help preserve their places in history as well.
