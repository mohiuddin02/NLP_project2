### PRO: World cup started great conversations

VIENNA, Va. — Although in the past Americans have ignored soccer, this year's World Cup soccer has been a hot topic of conversation in the United States.

Games involving Team USA had as many viewers as the NBA finals. They had even more than baseball's World Series. "Watch Parties" drew tens of thousands of people nationwide.

This time around, America embraced the "beautiful game." We were gripped by the stunning goals and puzzling offsides, joyous patriotism and fake dives and flops. Our new love of soccer was due to several reasons:

Convenient starting times: First-round group games from Brazil began at noon, with another contest to follow. The final match was on in the early evening on the East Coast. Matches became a great reason to leave work early.

## These Got Our Attention Too

Short matches: The games take 2 1/2 hours to play. Less than three hours to watch a sporting event? It makes you realize what time wasters baseball, football and basketball are with their commercial breaks and nonstop timeouts.

Shaky goaltenders: Few keepers could save a game for their team by themselves. Any shot became a good shot in Brazil. That's quite different from hockey's Stanley Cup playoffs, for example. Sometimes you wonder if anybody is going to score in the Stanley Cup.

Upsets galore: After the dust settled in Week One, reigning champion Spain and always powerful England had already been knocked out. That left the door open for such countries as Colombia, Costa Rica, Algeria and Chile to show their stuff.

"USA, USA:" America was placed in the same division with such heavyweights as Germany, Ghana and Portugal. Even so, the U.S. made it out of the first round. The team took Belgium to overtime before being bounced out in the next round.

## Team USA Rocked!

To his credit, American coach Jurgen Klinsmann urged his team to fight it out with the traditional soccer powers. He didn't want them to just defend. Thanks to scoring from their stars like Clint Dempsey, that often happened. That's much different from American teams in past World Cups.

Team USA may be out of this year's tournament, but it didn't go quietly. That could make all the difference in the years ahead.

For years, kids in this country, as in the rest of the world, have grown up playing soccer.

Until now, that's where it ended. Once kids stopped playing the game, they watched football, baseball and basketball like everyone else.

Yet this time around, more Americans checked out the World Cup than ever before and they liked what they saw. Once you give the beautiful game a long look it's difficult to turn away. It's especially hard when you're cheering a team that refuses to back down.

### CON: Soccer can end in a scoreless tie. This is fun?

WASHINGTON - Soccer is easy to make fun of.  In what other sport can we put together a scorecard of the number of fake "injuries"? Or the time the supposedly injured players spent squirming on the ground?

How about when "injured" players are regularly carried off on stretchers and then return to the game seconds later? When's the last time you saw that in any American sport?

I am not here to make fun of soccer. I've tried to like it.

Let me set the stage. It is the summer of 1994 and I am a student living in London. Each summer, the campus housing where I lived had some visiting Italian students who nicely insisted that I watch the World Cup with them.

## In The Name Of Sportsmanship, We Watched

I did so, game in and game out. And, to the joy of my newfound friends, Italy progressed all the way to the final against mighty Brazil.

So we watched what I was told would be sports at its best. For 90 minutes we watched and no one scored. We watched through extra time. Still, no one scored.

At last, the game was settled through a shootout where players kick at the goal. The goalie must guess at which side of the goal the player will kick the ball. He only has enough time to dive in one direction.

During the game, Italy's goalie guessed wrong and Brazil walked off the World Cup champions. A coin flip would have been pretty much the same.

This helps explain why soccer may be the world's sport, but not yet America's. I'm not against anyone's love of soccer. I'll admit that baseball is pretty dull.

## Where Is Soccer's Craftiness?

Soccer is a fine game. However, American football and basketball are a battle, based on craftiness, drive and the repeated attack on the other team's weaknesses.

A football or basketball coach searches for gaps in the opposing team's strategy - or plan. He'll look for when players aren't matched up equally. When he finds a weakness, the coach will take advantage of it again and again. And his team will score points as a result.

And an error by coaches or a major playing mistake by athletes on the field will almost always cost that team on the scoreboard.

Sure, a basketball or American football game can be decided by a lucky play or a bad call, if it's very close.  But in the most popular U.S. sports it's easier to score. High scores make it very unlikely that the better team will lose the game. This isn't true in soccer. It is filled with fine plays that go unrewarded and terrible mistakes that go unpunished.

At the end of the day, sports are entertainment.

If millions of people like watching a bunch of men kick a ball around for 90-plus minutes for it to end in a scoreless tie, then that's OK by me.
