Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee announced plans to run for president on Tuesday.

Huckabee made his announcement at his boyhood home in Hope, Arkansas. He is the sixth Republican candidate to officially enter the race. On Monday, Dr. Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina announced plans to seek the White House. They joined three Republican senators who already joined in the race. These are Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida.

Huckabee faces several problems. His main problem is rivals who appeal to the same voters as Huckabee.

## Now People Know Him

Huckabee, 59, is a favorite of traditional and evangelical Christian voters. In 2008, he had many loyal supporters for president. But this time, he may be competing against more rivals who are also stronger candidates. Huckabee, a preacher, has remained in the public eye and in voters' living rooms through hosting a Fox News show. However, he has been out of elected office for more than eight years.

His rivals also can raise a lot of money, which is necessary to pay for campaign ads. Fundraising is a skill Huckabee lacked in the 2008 campaign, when he raised just $16 million. In contrast, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney had more than $100 million to spend in the early voting.

In 2008, Huckabee was not able to raise much money and people thought it was OK because many people did not know who he was, said Bob Vander Plaats. In 2008, Vander Plaats helped run Huckabee's campaign in Iowa. "Now everyone knows who (Huckabee) is."

## Looking For Voter Support

In 2008, Huckabee was not regarded as a serious White House candidate. Then he did better than experts thought. His success was partly due to the lack of serious competition.

However, now there many more Republican candidates. The competition is also stronger. Several of them, such as Cruz and Governor Scott Walker, are also popular with religious conservatives and people who hold traditional values.

Several other possible candidates appeal to religious conservative voters. They include former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. Paul is also trying to get the support of religious voters.

Vander Plaats said that choosing a candidate is like shopping for a new car. He is the president of Family Leader, an Iowa-based Christian conservative group. "So people are going to want to take a test drive, kick the tires, and sit inside all the new cars, look at all the new candidates and see if that's the direction they want to go," he said.

## "They Held Out Hope"

Vander Plaats said that Huckabee hopes that his supporters will take a look at other candidates. Then, they will come back and vote for him.

A poll released Monday, however, was not so certain. It showed that just over half of Republican voters said they could see themselves voting for Huckabee. Rubio, Walker and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush all received much more support.

Huckabee's core supporters remain devoted to him.

"It's kind of like first love," said Craig Robinson. He created the Iowa Republican website. Robinson said that Huckabee's supporters are not the type to be interested in another candidate. "They held out hope he would run in 2012," he said. "They're the kind of people who never even shopped the field because Mike Huckabee is their guy."

## He Has Been Criticized

Huckabee connected with working-class voters by pointing to his poor upbringing. He was the first male in his father's family to graduate from high school. He was also one generation removed on his mother's side from dirt floors and outdoor toilets.

Some people complained that Huckabee does not always follow the Republican Party's position. He was criticized for supporting some tax increases when he was governor. He supported the closure of the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which holds people suspected of making war on the United States. He also changed his mind on supporting immigration and the ban against trading with Cuba.

His rivals are likely to bring up all of these issues.

"The field is so strong this time, it's going to be extremely difficult for Huckabee," said Sam Clovis. He a professor at Morningside College in Iowa and an influential former radio host.
