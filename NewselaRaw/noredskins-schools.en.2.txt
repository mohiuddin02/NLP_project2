LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” Cheering for the Redskins at four California high schools will be coming to an end. All of the schools currently identify their sports teams as the Redskins, but that name has been outlawed by the state. The schools will have to pick a new mascot.

California Governor Jerry Brown recently signed a law that makes California the first state in the country to bar public schools from using the Redskins name for their sports teams.

The mascot law will prevent public schools from using a word that many Native Americans consider to be an insult. The word dates back to 1699. It is listed in the Merriam Webster dictionary as a "usually offensive" term for a Native American.

## Schools Will Follow The Law

In California, only four public schools still use the name, and Tulare Union High is one. Sarah Koligian is the superintendent of the district. She said officials were disappointed by Brown's decision, but they will change their team name. "We will adhere to the law as it is written," Koligian said.

The Chowchilla Union High School District also uses the mascot. They plan to ask the public to help come up with a new name. Superintendent Ronald V. Seals said Chowchilla has used a Redskins mascot and logo since 1928. "You don't pick a mascot that you don't respect, dignify, love, honor," he said. "It's just taking away something that's so near and dear to their hearts ... and by people who don't even live here."

Two other California schools, Gustine High School in Merced County, and Calaveras High in Calaveras County, are known as the Redskins. They will also have to come up with a new name.

## "Change The Mascot"

A National Football League (NFL) team is facing similar pressure to change its name. Some Native American groups have been protesting the use of the Redskins name in their dispute with the Washington Redskins. The groups consider the Washington, D.C., team's name to be racist.

This year, a court ruled that the Washington Redskins will lose its trademark. The team is fighting that decision.

Ray Halbritter is an Oneida Native American. He is a member of a group called Change The Mascot. Halbritter sees a clear connection between the California mascot ruling and the NFL's Washington Redskins battle.

"This landmark legislation eliminating the R-word in California schools clearly demonstrates that this issue is not going away, and that opposition to the Washington team on this issue is only intensifying. The NFL should act immediately to press the team to change the name," Halbritter said.

## Strike Three For Smokeless Tobacco In Ballparks

In addition to the state law on the Redskins name, the California governor signed two other sports-related laws. One measure rules that players and coaches cannot use smokeless tobacco at professional baseball parks. The other recognizes competitive cheerleading as a high school sport.

The smokeless tobacco measure applies to players and coaches at all professional ballparks in California. They cannot have smokeless tobacco products on the playing field.

Smokeless - or chewing - tobacco is a form of cured tobacco. There are two main types most commonly available in the United States. Both are used by placing the tobacco between the cheek or lip, and the gum.

Major League Baseball teams use the parks. The MLB has said that it supports getting rid of smokeless tobacco. The minor leagues already have gotten rid of it during games.

Public health officials say fewer young people are smoking cigarettes. However, more are using smokeless tobacco. They say smokeless tobacco still contributes to cancer of the mouth, throat and pancreas.

The California cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles already do not allow smokeless tobacco in ballparks.

## Competitive Cheerleading Is Official

The governor also signed a third bill into law. Competitive cheerleading will now be an official sport in public schools.

Competitive cheerleading is when cheer squads compete against each other. Teams perform routines with music that include stunts, jumps and tumbling.

"The formal recognition will give cheerleading the respect and safety standards that athletes deserve," said Lorena Gonzalez. She is the Democratic Assemblywoman who introduced the bill. Gonzalez is a former high school and college cheerleader from San Diego. She said that eight other states already treat competitive cheerleading as a sport.

The Redskins mascot law will take effect in 2017. The competitive cheerleading law will begin then as well. Smokeless tobacco will be outlawed on professional ball fields before next season.
