MOSCOW, Russia â€” Somewhere in the thousands of apartment buildings that ring the Russian capital of Moscow, Edward Snowden remains in hiding. He cannot come home.

Two years ago, he angered the American government by disclosing that it was collecting the cellphone calls of millions of ordinary U.S. citizens.

Snowden also released classified, or secret, files he took from his job with the National Security Agency, a government department that gathers information to protect the United States from enemies. Snowden's leaks triggered a global debate on government interference with its citizens' right to privacy. They also led to last month's decision by Congress to stop collecting the telephone records. That was the first major restriction on spy agency powers in decades.

## Charged With Spying

After taking the information, Snowden passed it on to journalists, who have received the highest honor of their profession. Laura Poitras, the director of a film about Snowden called "CitizenFour," has won an Academy Award.

But Snowden has gained little from the leaks beyond the sense of accomplishment he is said to feel. In rare interviews, he has said he would like to return to America, but not to prison.

Snowden, 32, who has been charged with espionage, or spying, seems to believe he can set the terms for his return to the United States. The problem is that he may think he is more popular than he actually is.

Although many younger Americans applaud what he did, a majority of U.S. citizens dislike him for it. In a U.S. News &amp; World Report poll in April, 64 percent said they held a negative view of him.

## "An Act Of Conscience"

Even those helping him try to get home say that he does not have a good chance of avoiding prison.

"Edward loves America and he would definitely like to return home," said Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden's Moscow lawyer. Kucherena said that as long as politicians are still talking about him, he will not be able to go back to America.

Kucherena said Snowden will not talk with the American government about returning without making a deal "that he won't go to jail for 100 years."

The Russian lawyer points out that what Snowden did could have been worse. He did not give up his American citizenship and switch his allegiance to Russia. He also did not give the secret material to Russian intelligence agents.

"It is 1,000 percent true that he did this as an act of conscience," Kucherena insisted. He noted that Snowden has said that he took the information because he wanted people to know that the American government was listening in on their phone calls.

## Stranded In Russia

Intelligence and security experts say what Snowden did was treason and that he deserves the charges against him.

"Whether he intended to become a foreign agent, he has become one," said Kori Schake. She is a former National Security Council member and is now with Stanford's Hoover Institution.

She worries that more of the secret information he stole could be made public by Snowden or others.

If what Snowden did wasn't spying, "I can't imagine what would be," Schake said.

Snowden never set out to stay permanently in Russia. He was reportedly attempting to fly through Moscow to a Latin American country. However, the American government canceled Snowden's passport, leaving him stranded at the Moscow airport.

Sergei Markov, a Russian government adviser, said Snowden needed Russia's protection.

"We can't send him back just because America demands it," Markov said.

## "After Snowden"

Ronald Goldfarb, a former attorney who represented the United States, put together a book on security versus privacy in the Information Age titled "After Snowden."

"He has raised profoundly important issues," Goldfarb said.

Goldfarb said it is important to determine what information Snowden stole and whether it fell into the hands of hostile governments. It's also not known whether the information did actual damage other than embarrassing intelligence officials who lied about how closely they were observing ordinary Americans, Goldfarb said.

Even if Snowden was willing to return to the United States and go on trial, that may not be possible if he waits too long.

Any deal could become a hot button issue in the presidential campaign. It seems unlikely that candidates with a serious chance of winning would risk standing up for the man responsible for one of the biggest thefts of classified information in history.

"This is the wrong time for the politics of it," Goldfarb said.

## Two Choices

Ben Wizner, a lawyer representing Snowden, acknowledges that his client is not likely to be going home soon.

"Right now he has two choices. Stay indefinitely there or report to a U.S. prison," Wizner said, referring to the espionage charges that could bring a 30-year prison sentence.
