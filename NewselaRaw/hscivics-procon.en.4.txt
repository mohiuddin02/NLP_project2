### PRO: Study the documents and thinkers of American history

American high school students do not understand important ideas that make our government what it is. America was founded on ideas of freedom and equality — that everyone should be treated the same. Students need to learn them before they become adults.

Many people blame teachers for problems in America's schools. I disagree.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress is the biggest test of what American students know. It has shown that many students don't know much about U.S. history and government.

The most recent NAEP U.S. history exam was in 2010. It found just 12 percent of all U.S. high-school seniors are "proficient." This is the level showing solid understanding of the questions. Only about 12 in 100 students know enough history.

## Unfair To Blame Teachers

American students perform worse on American history tests than any other subject.

Then there's civics — the subject of U.S. government. The test scores there were a little better. Still, only about one-fourth of all high school seniors are "proficient" in civics.

It's unfair to blame America's 125,000 social studies teachers, however. I've been with the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University in Ashbrook, Ohio, for 17 years. In that time, about 8,000 teachers from across the country have participated in our educational programs. I've met many teachers. I know they're not the problem.

The problem is the way teachers are trained. Teachers spend too much time learning how to teach. They don't spend enough time learning what to teach.

There needs to be a major change in how teachers are taught. If not, things will get worse. Generations of students will not understand what it means to be an American. These kids will think freedom of speech is the right to take "selfies." Our Founding Fathers are already thought of as dead old white men. Someday people may think they're completely unimportant.

They also may end up thinking Washington and Lincoln just have something to do with Presidents Day, a holiday for shopping. Or the Fourth of July is just a day for fireworks and a cookout.

## Understanding Our Documents

Teaching government and history is more than just teaching names, dates and events. Teachers need a deep understanding of America's important documents. They need to really know the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights in the Constitution and the Emancipation Proclamation which freed slaves.

U.S. history and government teachers should rely less on textbooks. Instead they should rely more on the writings and thinking of people who shaped our country.

Think about civil rights. America changed its mind, heart and laws over time on the subject of racial equality. It didn't happen by accident. Important people helped change the way Americans think. That's why teachers should read the writings of those people.

This would include, for example, Frederick Douglass' 1852 speech, "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" It would also include Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment, which ended slavery. It would also include the texts of U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Two key court decisions led to desegregation, ending the separation of black and white people. Teachers should also closely study Martin Luther King's 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech.

Teachers who understand the importance of such documents and use them in the classroom will be better teachers. Their students will learn more. And they'll be better citizens as adults.

### CON: We don't need more history classes

Every citizen in a democracy must be knowledgeable in civics and history. It's necessary to understand what's happening in our nation and around the world.

However, high school schedules are already crowded with classes. Stuffing in more American history and civics classes won't fix anything. Civics is the study of how government works.

Beefing up those areas in high schools could mean forcing even more information upon our kids. The U.S. Department of Education and state education departments already do a bad job deciding what students must learn.

Teaching teenagers to be better citizens should be left to parents and local schools. Even community groups such as the Boy or Girl Scouts of America and the Rotary Club would do a better job than government agencies.

## A System Of Government

Instead, history and government courses are too often taught in public schools as a series of crimes by the U.S. They'll describe what the government has done to Native Americans, Mexicans, African-Americans, immigrants and women.

Don't get me wrong. Schools should teach about the mistakes our government makes. But we should also recognize that our founders were wise men.

They created a system of government that corrects its mistakes. Sometimes it is late to do it, but our country has continued to correct past mistakes over its 239-year history. It leads to a better nation.

Our students are already restless. Forcing more American history and civics classes on them will probably make things worse. If they're developed by our leaders in Washington then they'll be even worse.

One example is the community service required of students in most public school districts.

The requirement violates our right of individual freedom in the Constitution. It forces students to spend many hours each month away from the classroom. They have to do public service projects like recycling and cleaning up trash in poor neighborhoods. Some even are being made to attend re-education classes to make sure they are learning liberal ideas.

## Making Things Worse

Now there's even a push to make all high school seniors take the same citizenship test immigrants take. But why? Nearly all high school students spend a semester studying civics. In addition, most spend a year studying American history.

Peter Levine of Boston's Tufts University believes that making students take a citizenship exam will reduce the amount of civic education in our schools. He also believes it will make civics classes worse.

We already teach enough civics. "The problem is that civics is often viewed as a set of disconnected facts," he said. It is not taught as "a challenging and inspiring subject that will continue to interest us after high school."

He's right. And that's exactly why school programs for American history should be created locally. It should be decided in towns and cities, not by our national government.

I live in the Baltimore area. Our local history is even more fascinating when linked to the nation's history.

Consider just a few famous Baltimore events: the discovery of Chesapeake Bay by Captain John Smith; the building of the Baltimore railroad that allowed pioneers to head west; the bombardment of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812 that inspired the National Anthem; and the part Baltimore played in the Civil War. And on and on.

Used across the U.S., this approach can make history come alive.
