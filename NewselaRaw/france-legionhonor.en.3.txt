PARIS, France â€” Three Americans and a Briton received France's highest honor on Monday. The four men risked their lives to stop an attack.

The attack happened onboard a crowded train headed for Paris. A man with a gun began shooting at passengers.

The medal the men received is known as the "Legion d'Honneur," or Legion of Honor. It was presented to them by France's president, Francois Hollande.

President Hollande said the men "gave a lesson in courage."

## Americans Were Unarmed

Two of the Americans who tackled the gunman are soldiers. However, they were not on duty at the time. They were out of uniform and were not carrying a gun when the attack occurred. Nobody died in the attack.

"On Friday you were simply passengers," Hollande said on Monday. "You behaved as soldiers but also as responsible men."

Hollande then pinned medals on U.S. Airman Spencer Stone and National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos. Their longtime friend Anthony Sadler also received a medal. All three tackled the gunman as he moved through the train with a rifle.

After the struggle began, British businessman Chris Norman jumped in to help. He also was given a medal on Monday.

## Medals Given At French Palace

The medals were awarded at the Elysee Palace, the home of France's president. The proud mothers of Stone and Skarlatos were there to see their sons honored.

President Hollande read out the men's names one by one. Then, he pinned a medal on each man's chest. The president then kissed each man on both cheeks, as the French do.

Of the four men, Stone was the most badly hurt. On Monday, the 23-year-old's eye was still bruised and one of his arms was in a sling.

Stone said he was coming out of a deep sleep when the gunman appeared.

His friend Skarlatos "just hit me on the shoulder and said 'Let's go,'" Stone said.

Hollande said the men's courage and quick thinking prevented many deaths. Amazingly, the men managed to stop the gun-carrying attacker with nothing but their "bare hands," he said.

## "World Admires Your Courage"

"Since Friday, the entire world admires your courage," he said. "This must be an example for all."

The gunman is a 26-year-old Moroccan named Ayoub El-Khazzani. He has been arrested and is being questioned by French police.

Sophie David is El-Khazzani's lawyer. She said the gunman told her he only wanted to rob the train and not to kill anyone. El-Khazzani claims he found his gun by chance. He said it was lying in a garden near the train station.

A French passenger was the first to try to stop the attacker, though he did not succeed. He was also honored by President Hollande on Monday. However, that passenger does not want his name publicly known. He did not show up at the palace.

Hollande said another passenger also tried to stop the attacker. He is French-American citizen Mark Moogalian.

Moogalian is now hospitalized with a gunshot wound from the attack. On Monday his wife said that he, too, "is among the heroes in this story."

Isabella Risacher-Moogalian described hiding from the attacker behind train seats. She then saw her husband wounded. "He looked at me and said 'I'm hit, I'm hit.' He thought it was over and he was going to die," she said.
