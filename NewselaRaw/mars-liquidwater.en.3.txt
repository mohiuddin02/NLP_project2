Future astronauts on a mission to Mars might be able to drink the water there instead of bringing their own. That is what NASA, the U.S. space agency, said the other day when it announced there is new evidence of liquid water on the Red Planet.

Besides Earth, Mars is now the only planet in our solar system to show that there might be liquid water on the surface. Other planets have water in oceans that are under the surface. The water can also exist as a gas in the air. Mars has the first evidence of water in liquid form.

## Water Discovery Is A Big Step

Lujendra Ojha is a student at Georgia Tech university. He led the discovery research. Liquid water is a popular topic to study, he said.

It would be a big step to suggest that Mars might have forms of life on it. The liquid water discovery at least makes life possible.

The new study adds to the research from last year. Scientists using information from the Curiosity rover said that the planet might have had liquid water. The Curiosity rover is a robotic machine that explored Mars. Scientists found that water on Mars evaporated very quickly.

A type of salt called perchlorates was found on Mars. These salts keep the water from evaporating into a gas. Perchlorates help the water stay as a liquid. Scientists think that there could be liquid, perchlorate-filled water on Mars.

This water may be forming wet-looking streaks on the planet. They are called recurring slope lineae (RSL).

## Strange Wet Streaks Up There

In the new research with Ojha, the scientists studied the RSL. They found high levels of the perchlorate salts. It seems like the salts have been getting water, too.

Ojha and his team used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to study the wet- looking streaks. The MRO is a spacecraft used for exploring Mars from high up in the orbit. They used a method called spectroscopy. The method keeps track of what type of light an object absorbs. They can find out its composition, or what the object is made out of. This way, scientists can identify glass, ice and other substances from miles above the surface.

The scientists studied where they thought they were seeing water. They also found perchlorates there, Ojha said. The salts seem to disappear in areas where the wet-looking streaks were not forming anymore.

Ojha's work shows that the liquid saltwater may help form the RSL wet streaks on Mars. However, there is more work to do to prove that water is really there. Eventually, the hope is that a rover can take a closer look at the streaks.

## Future Space Travel Thoughts

There is strong evidence that liquid is forming on the surface of Mars because of the salts. Still, the liquid water turns into gas easily. However, it could make parts of the Red Planet able to support tiny forms of life.

It might be possible for astronauts in the future to use the water on a trip to Mars. Perchlorates can be useful in other ways too. They can be used to make rocket fuel.

If humans ever go to Mars, they could probably use the perchlorates, Ojha said. "We wouldn't have to bring tons of water."
