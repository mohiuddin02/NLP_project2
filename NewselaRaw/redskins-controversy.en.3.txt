NEW YORK â€” The Oneida Indian Nation thinks the Washington Redskins team nickname is an insult. It has been trying to get the nickname changed.

Oneida leaders met with NFL officials on Wednesday to talk about it. But they said the meeting was disappointing.

Now they want to meet with all 32 NFL owners during the week of the Super Bowl. They want NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to be there, too.

The Oneidas want to get them to push Redskins owner Daniel Snyder to drop the nickname.

## Dictionary Defines Redskin As Offensive

Ray Halbritter, an Oneida representative, said the meeting on Wednesday did not go like he wanted it to. "It became somewhat evident they were defending the continued use of the name. Of course, we're disappointed." Halbritter is also leader of the Change the Mascot Campaign.

The Oneida Indian Nation has approximately 1,000 enrolled members. It is one of 566 federally recognized independent [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) nations, according to the U.S. government.

The Oneidas consider the term "redskins" a racial epithet, or insult. Halbritter says it is defined like that in the dictionary.

The Oneidas asked Goodell and Snyder to "visit our homelands." They also sought a change to league rules. Owners would not be able to name a team with any term that is a racial epithet.

Halbritter's group said that maybe the league should punish Snyder if he kept using the name.

Goodell did not attend the Wednesday meeting. The league's lawyer and other officials did.

## Many For, Many Against, Name Change

The league issued a statement after the meeting. "We listened and respectfully discussed the views of Mr. Halbritter" and others who came with him, the league said.

They also discussed "the sharply differing views of many other Native Americans and fans in general," the league said. "The meeting was part of an ongoing" discussion, it said.

Many of the Oneidas' requests were contained in a letter handed to the NFL representatives at the meeting.

President Barack Obama recently said he would "think about changing" the name if he owned the team. Since then, many fans have taken up the cause. And many more have rallied around the name. They see the name Redskins as a tradition or a tribute.

Halbritter sees it as an insult.

In a letter to Goodell, he referred to the team name as the "R-word." He said the Change the Mascot Campaign wanted to halt the destructive effects of the word "on our people and Native peoples everywhere."

## Oneidas Sponsor Bills And Packers

Halbritter also said the Oneida Indian Nation pays to support the league. That would make it a sponsor. The Oneidas are concerned that the league's use of the name hurts the NFL.

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the Oneida Indian Nation is not a league sponsor. The Oneida Indian Nation sponsors the Buffalo Bills team. The Wisconsin tribe of the Oneida nation has a sponsorship deal with the Green Bay Packers.

Also on Wednesday, the San Francisco Chronicle said it will stop using the term "Redskins" when referring to the team.

Managing Editor Audrey Cooper said the newspaper's style committee made the decision. The reason was to get rid of the term because of a long-standing rule against using racial insults.

"Not everyone has to be personally offended by a word" for it to be an insult, Cooper said in a statement. It was titled "A name unfit for print. Make no mistake, 'redskin' is a patently racist term."

The Chronicle joins several others that have made the same decision over the years. Those include the Kansas City Star, Slate.com, and the Portland Oregonian, which dropped the term more than twenty years ago.
