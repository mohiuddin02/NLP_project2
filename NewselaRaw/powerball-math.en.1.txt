An Arkansas rapper claimed to solve American poverty with the simple post of a Facebook meme on Monday.

"Powerball 1.3 billion ÷ U.S. pop 300 million," it reads. "Everyone receives 4.33 mil. Poverty solved!!"

The amount of the lottery rose to $1.6 billion on Wednesday and the winning numbers were picked by three people.

## Nice Try, But Check Your Math

The math behind the equation, however is wrong. As people have pointed out across the Internet, $1.3 billion divided by 300 million is actually a measly $4.33\. Also, not to nitpick here, but the U.S. population was 308.7 million as of the 2010 census - and only 234.6 million, if you exclude children under age 18.

So, why have 1.3 million people reshared the meme on Facebook, and why have hundreds of thousands liked it? Some are doubtlessly mocking the meme's bad math. But others agree strongly with the general idea of a man named Philipe Andolini, who made up the equation.

His "math was incorrect but I get it," wrote Livesosa, the rapper whose post made the meme go viral. "Point (he) was attempting to make it simple. There's enough money to feed the people."

## Can Non-Winners Benefit?

In other words, this is a meme less about Powerball and more about distribution: How is it - Andolini seems to be arguing - that one person can, in a stroke of unthinkable fortune win $1.3 billion when other people have next to nothing? Isn't there some way to distribute Powerball's proceeds a little more evenly?

Powerball does sort of redistribute money back to "the people," although not in the form of 300 million personal checks, and not at all fairly. Case in point: Low-income people are the biggest players of the lottery, leading many economists to argue that it is a tax on the poor.

Powerball is run by the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), a nonprofit based in Iowa. It basically operates several monster games across 36 states and Washington, D.C. When you buy a Powerball ticket, roughly 50 to 65 percent of your $2 - depending where you are - goes to the pot of prize money. A small portion, less than a dime, goes to running the lottery. Something like 12 or 14 cents also goes to the store that sold the ticket.

## Funding State Programs

But the rest? That goes straight back to the state where you bought your ticket, and your state government decides what to do with it. This varies wildly by state, of course, but the MUSL tracks how the states use their lottery money.

In Arizona, for instance, some $625 million has gone to local transportation funds since 1982\. Indiana spent $637 million on teachers' retirement funds. in Washington state, the lottery has helped build CenturyLink Field, the Seattle Mariners' baseball stadium.

At its heart, Andolini's meme seems to argue that more Powerball money should go to programs that directly address and reduce poverty. They include things like literacy and early childhood reading programs, to which Kentucky's devoted $30 million, or meals and transportation for low-income seniors. In Pennsylvania, nearly $25 billion has gone to these kind of senior programs.

His meme argues that the Powerball pot should be spent more responsibly, not less. And while his method and math are undeniably wrong, reforms to the way the states spend their lottery money make lots of sense.

This idea, however, doesn't read quite as well as a Facebook meme.
