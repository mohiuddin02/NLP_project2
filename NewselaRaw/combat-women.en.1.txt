American women will soon be free to fight on the front lines of battle and they will go with the public's support.

The Defense Department announced it was ending a ban on women serving in combat jobs. Most Americans support the decision and don't believe it will hurt the military's effectiveness, a new poll shows.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained the decision last week at the Pentagon, the military's headquarters. He pointed out that women have already risked life and limb in wars of the past decade.

Women make up 14 percent of the active duty military. The Pentagon says 152 female troops have been killed while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

## Ban Hurts Career Advancement

All branches of the military have been open to women since the 1970s or earlier. However, many units, especially those in the Army and Marines, are for men only. For example, women cannot join heavy weapons and tank units. The military said it expects to start opening up many jobs to women as early as this year.

Servicewomen complained that the ban was limiting their career opportunities. Serving in a combat unit is a stepping-stone to higher rank and leadership positions.

Major Mary Jennings Hegar was rescuing wounded soldiers in Afghanistan when her helicopter was attacked. She was shot in the arm and thigh. Despite her wounds, she fired back and held back the enemy until the wounded could be transferred to another helicopter.

The Air Force awarded Hegar the Purple Heart for her injuries and another medal for bravery and heroism. But medals were not enough; she wanted a promotion. However, she was not able to compete for a combat leadership role because the Air Force did not consider her experience as official combat.

## In Modern Warfare, No One's Safe

Military experts say the line between combat and non-combat is getting blurry. In past centuries, opposing armies met on the field of battle. Infantry units went to fight, while support units stayed behind. Nowadays, the U.S. military is fighting a new kind of enemy: small groups of fighters who plant roadside bombs, disguise themselves as civilians and attack non-military targets. Soldiers who drive fuel trucks, provide medical support or even sort mail can come under fire in this kind of modern warfare.

Linda Brashears was serving in an Army postal unit in Iraq that came under attack. She survived with a brain injury. The retired staff sergeant said she wouldn't have been interested in a combat job, but believes other women will welcome the opportunity.

"A lot of people think we should still be sitting behind a desk, but the world is changing," Brashears told USA Today.

In fact, not many people do think female troops should be confined to desk jobs.

Sixty-six percent of people polled by the Pew Research Center said women should be allowed to serve in fighting units. Just 26 percent said they were opposed. Both women and men were equally supportive of the change, but older Americans were less in favor of women serving in combat than were younger Americans.

Nearly half of those surveyed said the decision would make no difference in the effectiveness of the military. Twenty-nine percent said it would make the military more effective. Only 15 percent of survey respondents said women in combat roles would hurt military effectiveness.

## Counting Pushups

Opponents of the change say that women don't have the physical strength to qualify for the combat jobs. They warn that lowering the fitness requirements will only help the enemy.

Senator John McCain, a Vietnam War veteran, supports Panetta's decision but he had some concerns.

"It is critical that we maintain the same high standards that have made the American military the most feared and admired fighting force in the world," McCain said.

Army Staff Sergeant Jennifer Hunt was injured in 2007 when an improvised explosive device (IED) blew up her Humvee. "Right before the IED went off, it didn't ask me how many pushups or situps I could do," Hunt told The Wall Street Journal. "Right now, the women who are serving are being engaged in combat, so their physical restrictions aren't a barrier."

According to The New York Times, the Pentagon does not plan to lower its fitness requirements. Men and women must do the same number of situps in the Army to pass a fitness test. Female soldiers can pass with fewer pullups and a slower 2-mile run than male soldiers.

Some critics say that women will be too distracting for the men in combat units. But female soldiers and their supporters say that including more women will help end harassment and discrimination of female troops, which has been a problem in the military.

## What's The Fuss?

Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth lost both legs serving in Iraq as an Army helicopter pilot. She told National Public Radio that the ban on women in combat units reminds her of the past. She pointed out that black soldiers used to be forbidden from serving alongside whites and that Japanese-Americans were once segregated into their own battalions.

"That was the thought in World War II, that you couldn't integrate the military," Duckworth said. "So I think, you know, down the road, we're going to look back in the distance and say boy, that was a lot of fuss over nothing."
