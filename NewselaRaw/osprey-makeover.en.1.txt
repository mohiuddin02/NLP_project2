CAMP BASTION, Afghanistan—Almost four years after the MV-22 Osprey arrived in Afghanistan with a reputation as dangerous and hard to maintain, the U.S. Marine Corps finally has had an opportunity to test the hybrid aircraft in a war zone.

The reviews are startlingly positive.

"This is an ugly duckling that turned into a swan," said Richard Whittle, the author of _The Dream Machine: The Untold History of the Notorious V-22 Osprey_.  It is still probably more expensive than it should be, and more expensive to operate. But "it now has probably the best safety record of any rotorcraft that the military flies."

The odd aircraft, which takes off and lands like a helicopter but rotates its engines forward to fly like an airplane, had a star-crossed development period. It took more than two decades to get it right, it cost much more than expected and crashes have claimed 30 lives. The Government Accountability Office, an agency assigned to keep an eye on Washington spending, criticized its use in Iraq's Anbar province from 2007 to 2009, where it mainly transported people and cargo, as fighting dropped off.

In Afghanistan, however, the Marines have been able to use it more widely. They fly it for everything from freight to hundreds of assaults, where it has carried loads of Marines into or out of landing zones, often under intense fire. It is twice as fast as the helicopter it replaces, has substantially greater range, and can carry more cargo and more than twice as many troops. The Marines are learning how to maintain it in a harsh environment.

Whittle, once an Osprey skeptic, has become a fan. "The Osprey has proven itself in Afghanistan in a way it did not in Iraq," he said. "Partly that was because it didn't get the chance in Iraq. Also, it was new, and the military is conservative with new equipment, but once they see it gives them a significant leap in capability like this, they are quick to take advantage of it."

## Dusty, Stained And Smudged

The MV-22 Ospreys here now are dusty, stained and smudged from hot exhaust. At least five have returned to base with bullet holes, including – twice – the one flown by Lt. Col. Douglas C. Sanders, the commander of the Marine squadron that is flying the Osprey in Afghanistan. The Osprey's many back-up systems work well, said Maj. Matthew McSorley, a pilot and the operations officer for the squadron. McSorley was hit by a different kind of fire while flying a mission on Valentine's Day: a massive bolt of lightning.

"It was one of those days where the airplane itself just totally wins over your heart," he said. "It bounced right back, and I flew it all the way back, and within a week I was flying the same plane again."

Among the recent missions the squadron has flown was one in which the Osprey showed its strengths: a Marine with a head wound at a distant base needed to be moved for quick treatment.

The crew dashed for the Osprey and zoomed north some 40 miles. They picked up the wounded man and flew another 75 miles or so east to the massive military base in Kandahar, all in less than an hour from the moment they got the call.

A conventional helicopter would have been hard-pressed to do the same, even without the 40-mile run, Sanders said.

## Sneaking Up On The Taliban

A more typical use for the Osprey is to take advantage of the aircraft's speed and range to hook around behind a target for an assault, coming in from an unexpected direction. This is how the Marines avoid the Taliban's crude air-warning system, which often is just a line of watchers with cellphones.

That capability has made it a favored platform for special operations strikes here, Marines said. The current version of the Osprey also is far safer than earlier ones. It is now among the safest rotary-wing aircraft in the military.

The rate for Class A flight mishaps  - those that involve death or permanent disability and/or more than $2 million in damage - is 1.48 per 100,000 hours of flying time since the aircraft was declared operational in 2007, according to Marine Corps spokesman Capt. Richard Ulsh.

That is slightly worse than the rate for the CH-46 medium-lift helicopter, but Whittle said it compared well, pointing out that in the last decade, the military has lost about 420 helicopters and more than 600 people in them, while the Osprey has had three fatal crashes since 2001, killing six.

Two of those were blamed on the pilots. The third crash occurred last year in Afghanistan and involved the U.S. Air Force's version of the Osprey. The accident resulted in a dispute between two generals involved in the investigation over whether the cause was an engine problem or pilot error.

Ulsh noted that last month the first of 12 Ospreys joined the fleet of aircraft used for presidential travel. a meaningful stamp of approval for the aircraft. They'll be used to transport the president's staff and journalists, though not the commander in chief.

Even if it is safer, the Osprey is still expensive. They cost $122.5 million each, according to Sen. John McCain, a longtime critic. It also is not cheap to repair, particularly in harsh operating environments such as the wildly dusty south of Afghanistan.

In a speech in December 2011, McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Osprey engines had been lasting just over 200 hours each, well below the 500 to 600 hours the Marines had expected. That, McCain said, more than doubled the cost per hour of flight, compared with about $4,600 for the CH-46.

Osprey defenders say the aircraft's greater capabilities make up for that additional cost. They note that it can carry 24 passengers, versus 10 for the CH-46, and it flies twice as fast. Plus it can perform missions helicopters cannot.
