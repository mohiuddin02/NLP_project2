BEKAA, Lebanon â€” A makeshift bucket brigade hauled 14 pails of mud and slush from the tent that Um Mahmoud shares with a dozen other Syrian refugees in a settlement here in the Bekaa Valley. The snow that blankets the area gives an alpine appearance to the rugged stretch of land that extends to the Syrian border.

Holiday-makers from Beirut hastened to the hills with sleds and toboggans, piling souvenir snow onto their vehicles for the drive home. But there was nothing merry about the weekend blizzard for the multitudes of Syrians living rough in makeshift camps scattered throughout the region.

"It was like a sea here yesterday," Um Mahmoud, a mother of 10, said with an easy smile Sunday as she and other women showed visitors the interior of their mud-floor tent, damp and disheveled after the storm. "How can we cook in such a mess?" she said, pulling back a curtain to show a bare kitchen stocked with meager provisions and subject to rat attacks.

The sun was shining Sunday in the Bekaa, exposing a landscape of white-capped peaks and snow-dusted plains. The views were of little comfort to displaced Syrians, many of whom were found in their improvised enclaves clearing out the snow, slush and mud that had made an already difficult life more grueling.

## Facing Grim Prospects

The next storm cannot be far off. The weekend's blizzard was but a preview. Another muddy aftermath is certain to be seen again.

Tiny Lebanon is now home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, officials say; that means that about 1 in 5 residents of the country is a Syrian. They have fled the civil war in their country, where rebels are fighting against troops loyal to Syria's president.

Aid groups have applauded Lebanon's generosity in permitting the entry of so many. But Lebanon has no established refugee camps, like those found in several of Syria's other neighbors, notably Turkey, Jordan and Iraq. Refugee camps are not allowed here.

Lebanese officials are wary of any settlements that might turn into permanent communities. Palestinian camps set up there played a role in detonating their own country's civil war a generation ago. Lebanon is a nation where political power is carefully parceled out among Christians, Druze, Sunni Muslims and Shiite Muslims. Refugees could alter the balance.

As the Syrian war enters its third winter, desperate refugees in Lebanon who cannot afford apartments or don't have loved ones to host them face grim prospects. Scores of provisional camps have sprung up to provide for basic needs. But they are far from reliable. Aid arrives irregularly, and in haphazard fashion, refugees say, despite the work of United Nations relief teams and charitable agencies. Many tents have heating stoves, but fuel has been in short supply.

"It has been freezing cold here and fuel was like gold," said Ahmad Awadh, a resident of another camp in the Bekaa area.

Awadh's site is slightly more upscale than the abandoned factory grounds that host Um Mahmoud and others, mostly from the northeast Syrian province of Raqqa. The camp has 39 tents with concrete floors and blue plastic sheeting. The plastic provides some insulation from the rain and snow.

## Hard, But Not Life-Threatening

About 500 people live in the camp. Most appeared to be from the embattled suburbs of Damascus, the Syrian capital. A majority of the tents appear to have both portable heaters and stoves and some have electrical connections. Various aid groups provided the stoves and heaters. Still, residents complain that delivery of aid comes randomly, enrolling children in schools is next to impossible, and finding a job is a fantasy.

As the sun shone, residents cleared debris out of their tents. They hung their wet clothes to dry and gathered firewood. For many this is not their first winter away from home. Their predicament is difficult, they say, but not life-threatening. Their thoughts remain with loved ones back in Syria, where so many in besieged, rubble-strewn communities face daily explosions and clashes, as well as being cut off from regular supplies of food, fuel and water.

"We watch the news, and we hope something will happen, but in truth we have no confidence," said Um Ammar, a mother who, like others interviewed, preferred to be identified by a nickname for security reasons. "People are laughing at us."

Back in the suburbs of Damascus, she has been told, desperate residents are burning school desks and clothing for heat. The situation is dire. Yet Syrians here seem to want to go back as soon as possible.

Many ask foreign visitors about the prospects for peace. Will there be United Nations negotiations in Geneva next month, they ask. They are keen for any sign of progress in the war.

Given the dire situation in Syria, many reckoned they were lucky to be in Lebanon.

"We cannot complain too much," said Um Mahmoud. "After all, we escaped from death."
