COLUMBIA, Mo. â€” The president of the University of Missouri said he will give up his job. He made his announcement Monday.

Students at the school had been very angry at President Tim Wolfe. They said he did not do enough after black students were called racist names and felt unsafe.

The recent trouble began in September after the student government president said that people in a passing pickup truck shouted racist names at him. The student president is black.

In early October, several other black students said they also were called racist names. They said a white student who appeared to be drunk began shouting at them.

Also, a swastika was drawn in a school bathroom. The swastika has long been used as a symbol of white power. It was first widely used by the German Nazi group, which killed millions of people during World War II.

## Leaders Didn't Listen, Students Say

Soon, many students at the school began protesting. They called on school leaders to do something to make black students feel safer.

On Oct. 10, black protesters blocked Wolfe's car during a parade, demanding that he talk to them. They were angered when Wolfe would not get out and speak with them. Instead, the protesters were removed by police.

On Nov. 2, a black student named Jonathan Butler began a hunger strike. He declared he would not eat until Wolfe stepped down.

On Monday, at least 30 black football players joined the protests. They announced they would stop playing football until the president was gone.

The Tigers' next game is Saturday against Brigham Young University. If the game is not played, the school will have to pay out more than a million dollars.

## Coaches Support Players' Protest

Head football coach Gary Pinkel said he supported his players. He posted a picture online showing the team and coaches locking arms. Pinkel said the team's coaches stand "as one. We are united. We are behind our players."

Sunday night, at least 150 student protesters gathered on the school's plaza. Many planned to camp there overnight, even though temperatures had dropped into the upper 30s.

Black students said things had gotten worse at the school after last year's shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer during a struggle. He was only 18 and was not carrying a weapon.

Brown's death helped lead to the founding of the "Black Lives Matter" movement. The movement has challenged police treatment of blacks and Latinos, which it says is very unfair.

Black students say the "Black Lives Matter" movement may have made some whites angry. They think some white students and others are picking on them just because they are black.

## Many White Students Agreed

Black students felt that Wolfe and the university were ignoring the problem. Many white students agreed with them. The student government declared that Wolfe "has undeniably failed us and the students that we represent."

Black student Abigail Hollis took part in the protest Sunday night. She said the school is "unhealthy and unsafe for us." White students at the school are treated much better than black students, she said. "It's time to stop that. It's 2015."

Perhaps things will get better at the school now that Wolfe has stepped down.

Wolfe said students were right to believe that something should be done to bring change to the school. However, he said they went about things the wrong way.

"This is not the way change comes about," he said about the student protests. "We stopped listening to each other."

Wolfe urged students, teachers and school leaders to come together now that he is leaving. He called on them "to start talking again to make the changes necessary."

After Wolfe's announcement, Butler said his hunger strike was over. Most likely, the school's football players will now turn up for the big game on Saturday.
