BERLIN, Germany â€” Thousands of children are traveling through Europe without parents. They are escaping from war in Syria. The country in the Middle East is dangerous right now. There is war and violence there.

In Germany, children from Syria wait at a crowded train station. A boy looks carefully around. Nearby is a little girl. Her hair has not been brushed for days. Close to her, a group of teens is gathered around a phone. There are no parents in sight.

Germany is a wealthy country in Europe. Many of the children are trying to get there. German officials say that it will take in up to 1 million refugee children this year. A refugee is someone seeking safety in another country.

## Families Send Children Away For Safety

Rimas is just 9 years old. Her uncle brought her and a cousin from Syria to Germany. They are escaping war in their home country. Rimas sometimes cried for her mother, her uncle said.

Her uncle is named Abdel Rahman Koweifi. He said her crying sometimes broke his heart. He felt worse when the two children were too scared to cry. During their journey, their boat overturned in the sea. They were near the shore and were rescued.

Aid workers help the refugees. There are special problems in helping kids without parents. Their journeys can be very dangerous. The children can be attacked or robbed.

## Some Youngsters Expected To Send Money Back Home

Kids also may feel much pressure. Some families hope the children will work and send back money. Others hope that the children will be allowed to stay in the other country. Then, the family can join them.

Michael Bochenek is an expert on children's rights. He works for Human Rights Watch in London. It is a human rights group. The children are desperate to find safety, he said. It is the reason they make the dangerous journey.

In Berlin, Koweifi was happy. He and the children are together in a refugee camp. The children call or text their parents each day.

## Refugees Hoping For A Fresh Start, Family Reunion

Koweifi has asked to stay in Germany. It will be some time before he knows the answer.

Koweifi remembered the sad goodbyes in Syria. He promised his brothers he would take good care of the children.

He said it is hard to believe they are all safe. He hopes the families will be together again one day.
