LONDON — The National Football League (NFL) may soon have a new football team — in London, England. The team would be treated like any other. It would play against U.S. teams.

A new study looked at what a London team could mean.

It found that a new team would be very good for British businesses. It could earn them an extra $252 million a year.

However, there is one problem: It would be difficult to have a successful Super Bowl in London. U.S. football fans might not be happy with the idea of a Super Bowl there.

Since 2007, U.S. teams have played a few games a year in London. The games are part of the NFL's International Series. This season, two games were played at London's famous Wembley Stadium. The third and final game at Wembley will be next Sunday.

## People Would Buy Things At Home Games

The London games have been very successful. The teams travel from the United States for their games. The popularity of their games led to an idea. Wouldn't it make sense for London to have its own team?

A London team would mean more football games there. It would also bring in money for London businesses.

Suppose the team played eight home games a season. People would go to London to see the games. They would spend money on food, souvenirs and hotels. London businesses might make as much as $165 million more a year.

Other towns would benefit too. For example, people might buy train tickets to go sight-seeing. In all, British businesses could earn an extra $252 million each football season.

## Super Bowl Should Stay In U.S.

Holding the Super Bowl in London could be a problem, however.

The hardest thing would be choosing a good kickoff time. Starting the game when it was 4 p.m. on the East Coast in the United States would mean beginning it at 9 p.m. in London. It would finish very late for Londoners.

Starting the Super Bowl at 6 p.m. in London would cause problems, too. It would make it hard for TV viewers on the West Coast of the United States. At that time, it would be only 10 a.m.

Another problem is that it is expensive to travel from the United States to London. Many U.S. fans would be unable to make the trip for the Super Bowl. Without them, the game might feel less exciting.

## Let's Consider More Options

Even without a new London team, football can still bring more money to Britain. The NFL could increase the number of International Series games held in London.

In 2013, two International Series games were held in London. They made businesses there an extra $52 million. A switch to four games a year would make a big difference. It could bring in another $42 million, for a total of $94 million.
