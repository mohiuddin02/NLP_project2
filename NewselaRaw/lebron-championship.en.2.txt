In 1910, a year after leaving the White House, Theodore Roosevelt delivered a timeless speech in Paris, France.

The former president said that many people like to criticize, but it is better to try and fail than never try at all.

"It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better," Roosevelt said. "The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood â€¦ If he fails, at least (he) fails while daring greatly."

Basketball superstar LeBron James used Roosevelt's speech as a map to guide his way back home to Ohio.

## Where He Got His Start

On July 12, James, who had been playing for the Miami Heat, signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team where he got his start. James, who is 29, was quickly back in in his familiar No. 23 Cavaliers basketball jersey.

James thought about Roosevelt's words during and after the 2010-2011 basketball season, his first in Miami, where he was heavily criticized for joining the team. In Miami, James posted them on his locker in large letters. Basketball insiders believe James went back to help get the Cavaliers their first championship.

"He left (Cleveland) to win a championship and he won multiple championships," said James Jones, one of James' closest basketball allies. "He left to compete on the highest level." The Miami team went on to win two National Basketball Association (NBA) championships. The only thing missing for him, Jones said, was the chance to win a championship in his hometown.

"LeBron is very driven and he takes that challenge seriously," Jones said. "He feels that he's equipped and he's in this place, in this time, to be able to do it. He's taking it on. Even if it's not what other people thought or expected, he expects to be the guy to bring a championship to Cleveland."

James, who was born in Akron, Ohio, said he purposefully sacrificed success in Miami for the hope of success in Cleveland. While he was playing for Miami, the team won two championships. Cleveland has never won even one.

## Sports Fans In City Celebrate

"What's funny is the team was a small [part] of me coming back," James said. "It had nothing much to do with the team. It was more about these fans and the city and the people here and the people who watched me grow from when I first picked up a basketball at age 8 to now at 29."

Roosevelt was one of the most powerful and influential leaders of the early 20th century. James is one of the most powerful and best known players of the 21st century sports world. In Cleveland, the Cavaliers sold out of season tickets the same day he announced his return.

On July 11, James released an essay announcing his intention to return to the Cavaliers. Immediately, the sleepy lunch crowd inside Harry Buffalo sports bar exploded. They celebrated as if the Cavs had already won a championship.

The night James left Cleveland, "people in here were running into the streets crying and screaming," Harry Buffalo General Manager Caitlin Cassidy said. "When he announced he was coming back, people did not go back to work."

"There are not many players who can come in that young and understand the (importance) of what he stands for and what he brings" to the team and the city, said Dallas Mavericks basketball player Tyson Chandler. He won a gold medal in basketball with James during the 2012 London Olympics. "With that comes a lot of responsibility and he's never (avoided) it."

Some players don't like to play for their hometown team, but James is embracing it.

"It takes a special player to be able to do that," said Milwaukee Bucks coach Jason Kidd. "But if there is someone who can do it, he can."

## "The Hardest Thing You Can Ever Do"

There was a time when James was obsessed with winning a title and foolishly proclaimed the Heat would win "not five, not six, not seven" championships. That was before he truly understood how difficult it was to win just one.

"It's the hardest thing you can ever do in your basketball career," James says now.

James stopped caring how others viewed his career about the time he started listening to the words of Roosevelt's speech.

"I know deep down he really wants to bring a championship back to his hometown," Chandler said.

"I'm pretty sure that's why he came back. He felt like it was the right thing to do and clearly that's what he's chasing," he said.

To use Roosevelt's words, the dust is on James' face, and the sweat is on his brow. The most powerful man in the NBA will soon discover whether he's strong enough to carry his hometown team to glory.
