LOS ANGELES — Theme park designer Edward Marks and his team have dreamed up some of the most thrilling rides in the United States. They have invented high-tech rides, glow-in-the-dark parades and 3-D simulators filled with mummies, aliens and crazy clowns.

But to cash in on China's theme park boom, Marks is learning that they need more than a creative vision. His team must become experts on local folklore and cultural superstitions. The also need an ample supply of patience.

## Another Culture Of Fun

"We've had to flip entire buildings, move attractions and change elements because of feng shui reasons," said Marks. He is the chief executive of the Producers Group, a theme park design and construction firm near Los Angeles. Feng shui means wind-water in Chinese. According to feng shui, buildings must face in certain directions to ensure good luck and ward off evil spirits.

Buildings with four roof peaks? Don't even think about building one in China. The number 4 — which sounds like the word for "death" in Chinese — is considered bad luck, Marks said.

These are welcome challenges for Marks and others in Southern California's thriving theme park industry. An increase in theme park construction in China — 59 projects are in the pipeline — has led to a huge demand for designers.

## Artists, Designers, Technicians Needed

The popularity of theme parks overseas is also leading to more jobs here. Design firms do not have enough artists, designers and technicians to keep up with the demand. Marks anticipates his team of 45 could grow to 70 by year's end.

American design firms can make $500,000 to $7 million to plan an amusement park. More detailed construction plans cost up to $15 million, industry experts estimate.

In 2013 alone, Chinese developers spent nearly $24 billion on building theme parks, according to a study by engineering firm AECOM. In contrast, in 2011, China spent just $9 billion on them.

Gary Goddard is the founder of Gary Goddard Entertainment, which designs theme parks, attractions and upscale resorts. He estimated that about half his work in the last few years has been in Asia and the Middle East. He's hired nearly 60 additional temporary workers to help his staff of 25 meet the extra demand.

## When Does 2 Look Like 8?

Goddard said his team is designing projects in China that are sensitive to the local culture.

A resort casino in Macau features a double Ferris wheel that resembles the number 8.

"That was a very deliberate move to make the number 8, because that is considered a lucky number over there," he said.

China's demand for theme parks has been caused by several factors. China's growing middle class is one of them. People have money to spend but few options for leisure activities. A recent move by the Chinese government to ease up on building permits for theme parks has also encouraged development.

By 2020, AECOM predicts that theme parks in China will have more visitors than those in the United States. Parks operated by OCT Parks China already attract more than 26 million visitors a year. Only Walt Disney Attractions, Merlin Entertainment Group, and Universal Parks and Resorts draw more people, according to the AECOM study.

## Here Comes Mickey Mouse

Looking for a piece of the action, United States theme park giants are investing heavily in Asia.

The $4 billion Shanghai Disney resort is expected to open late this year. The $1.8 billion Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005.

Universal Studios and Six Flags plan to build and operate parks in China over the next decade.

In China, the parks draw on themes and stories from Chinese history or fairy tales. Parks in the United States and Europe uses themes from movies and books.

United States theme park designers say they are adjusting to the expectations of Chinese developers.

Chinese developers, for example, don't realize it takes years to dream up, design and build a theme park. Many are in a rush to complete the projects to they can start making money.

## Planning Takes Time

"A lot of them have never done this before," Goddard said. "China doesn't have a 50-year history of theme park operations."

But many projects will never be built. Some Chinese developers don't understand how much it costs to build and maintain a theme park, American designers say.

"Until you know how the sausage is made, you don't know how expensive it is to make that sausage," said Josh Updike. He is the creative director of Rethink Leisure &amp; Entertainment. The company is working on several projects in China and elsewhere in Asia.

Regardless, it's paying off for the Californian theme park industry.

"Everyone I know in town is busy," Updike said.

And the extra work means designers are spending a lot of time on international flights to Asia. Goddard has racked up 3 million miles on American Airlines. Updike said he has logged more than 200,000 air miles last year alone.
