NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” The government is taking a stand on smoking in public housing buildings. It wants to ban smoking in these buildings across the United States.

Some people support it. But others do not like the idea of the government telling them what they can do inside their home homes.

Public housing buildings are managed by the federal government. Families who make below a certain amount of money may live there for a discount. Smoking is already banned in some of these buildings. And soon the ban might include all of the units across the country. That is the plan of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

"I would not like that. And other residents wouldn't like that, either," said smoker Dana Jones. She lives in an apartment in Atlanta. She did say the rules would probably help her break the habit.

## Protecting Children

HUD said a nationwide ban would have a big impact. They think it would protect more than 760,000 children. It would also save money. About $153 million is spent a year on health care costs, repairs and fires from smoking.

The rule would ban lit tobacco products. That includes cigarettes, cigars and pipes. They would not be allowed in apartments, homes, indoor common areas and offices. Smoking also would be not be allowed outdoors within 25 feet of buildings. Some electronic cigarettes would still be allowed.

The public now has 60 days to comment on the idea. The ban would start 18 months after the rule becomes final.

The policy will probably become part of apartment leases. A lease is an agreement that residents must sign. By signing, they are saying they agree to obey the rules.

There would be real consequences if you were found smoking. HUD said that tenants who smoke could be kicked out of the building. Still, HUD says the point is not to force people to stop smoking. Instead, it is about safety. The ban could make buildings safer for everyone.

## Some For It, Others Against It

Luis Torres does not support the idea. He is 64 years old. Torres has lived in New York public housing for 44 years. He has been ticketed for smoking in the hallway, which is illegal. He doesn't smoke in his apartment because his son has asthma. He is upset about the ban. He doesn't want to be told what to do inside his own home.

"That's private. You can do everything you want in your apartment," Torres said.

The idea of smoke-free buildings is not new. HUD began encouraging buildings to ban smoking starting in 2009.

Michael Siegel, a professor, thinks the rules make sense. Many offices and restaurants already ban smoking, he said. Siegel works at Boston University.

But professor Jamila Michener disagreed. HUD should help people to stop smoking, said Michener, who works at Cornell University.

Philip Morris USA is a major cigarette company. The company released a statement about the ban. It agreed that people should be able to avoid secondhand smoke in public places and at work. However, homeowners should be able to smoke in their own homes, the company said.
