NEW YORK â€” This year U.S. Thanksgiving is happening at the same time as Hanukkah. The rare event has created much excitement. Some people have even combined the two names into Thanksgivukkah.

The last time it happened was 1888. By one calculation, the next time the two holidays meet on the calendar may be 79,043 years from now.

There is money to be made from Thanksgivukkah. In New York, a 9-year-old boy created the menurkey. It is a menorah in the shape of a turkey. A menorah holds candles that are lit during Hanukkah. The boy has already trademarked the name. That means he owns the use of it. He raised more than $48,000 to make his menurkey.

T-shirts inspired by the 1969 Woodstock festival show a turkey on a guitar and read "8 Days of Light, Liberty &amp; Latkes." The shirts don't say if they are pumpkin latkes though. The creators of it own the trademark to "Thanksgivukkah."

## Calendars Cause Confusion

Songs have been written about the day. "The Ballad of Thanksgivukkah" goes "Imagine Judah Maccabee, sitting down to roast turkey and passing the potatoes to Squanto..."

Rabbi David Paskin helped write the song. He also helps runs a school in Massachusetts. He proudly says his Jewish day school is the closest one to Plymouth Rock. That is believed to be the place where the Pilgrims landed when coming to America. It is important in the Thanksgiving story.

He says it is amazing that we can have religious and non-religious celebrations at the same time in this country. "There are a lot of places in the world where we would not be able to do that," Paskin said.

The Jewish calendar makes Hanukkah and other religious holidays appear to drift slightly from year to year. That is different than the U.S., or Gregorian, calendar. But much of the interest over the timing of Hanukkah this year comes from the history of Thanksgiving itself. Interestingly, Thanksgiving has not always been fixed on the same day. That caused some confusion over Thanksgivukkah.

## Let's Get This Thursday Thing Straight

In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln declared Thanksgiving to be held on the last Thursday in November. The holiday remained there until President Franklin D. Roosevelt fixed it as the fourth Thursday of the month, even if there happened to be a fifth Thursday. That began in 1942.

Hanukkah lasts for eight days. On each day a candle is lit. Jewish practice calls for the first candle to be lit the night before Thanksgiving Day this year. So, Thanksgivukkah falls on the "second candle" night.

And then there is Texas. Before 1863, each state decided on its own date for Thanksgiving. As late as 1956, Texans were still chowing down on turkey a week later than everyone else. So Jews in the state might have also been lighting their first Hanukkah candle in 1945 and 1956 at the Thanksgiving table.

Jonathan Mizrahi is a scientist in New Mexico. He did the math showing how often the two holidays have met. He wrote a post that more than 100,000 people saw on the Internet. Some visitors questioned his calculations. That made him write a couple of changes to clear things up.

The interest, Mizrahi said, "has truly blown me away."

## And Don't Forget About The Comet

While the whole thing is fun, is there anything bigger happening?

Well, there's Comet ISON, which is scheduled to pass close by the sun on Thanksgiving this year. It may provide a nice show. You might even be able to see it during daylight. Or not, since comets cannot always be counted on.

Dana Gitell is a mother of two who lives near Boston. She is creating and selling T-shirts, cards and a poster about Thanksgivukkah. She sees it as something that happened by chance. But, it is a happy and meaningful event. She is donating one-tenth of what she sells to a Jewish group that helps people who need food.

"It's just a day when Jews and the rest of America are celebrating on the same day," she said. "It's an opportunity for us to really celebrate the Jewish American experience, and to give thanks in America for the religious freedom we enjoy here."
