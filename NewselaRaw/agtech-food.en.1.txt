TRACY, Calif. — The people behind the newest industries in technology are meeting the world's oldest — farming. Investors and entrepreneurs are putting their money and technology talents into farming and they have an ambitious agenda: to make sure there is enough food for the 10 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by 2100, do it without destroying the world — and make a load of cash along the way.

Silicon Valley is pushing its way into every stage of the food-growing process. There are tech tycoons buying up farmland, new startup companies selling robots that work the fields, and "hackathon" competitions dedicated to building the next farming app.

## "Let's Change It"

"The food sector is wasteful and inefficient," said Ali Partovi, a San Francisco Bay Area investor with large stakes in sustainable agriculture startups. "Silicon Valley has a hubris that says, 'That's stupid. Let's change it.'"

The so-called "ag-tech" sector has seen booming activity. The sector's growth is measured in the number of new startups, as well as investments by venture capital companies into those startups during their early stages. Experts predict that ag-tech's growth will outpace today's hottest technologies in another five years or so.

In the third quarter of this year, venture capitalists and private equity firms invested $269 million into 41 deals in agriculture and food startups. It was the highest dollar amount ever in that sector and double the amount invested during the same period last year, according to data from Cleantech Group. Since 2009, investments into this sector have grown an average 63 percent every year.

"It's going to be bigger than cloud software, it's going to be bigger than Big Data, because everybody eats," said Paul Matteucci, founder of Feeding 10 Billion, a nonprofit center to help ag-tech entrepreneurs.

Dozens of companies are creating technology to make farmland more productive and farming more efficient. They have designed robots to trim lettuce and software to calculate grass production for cattle grazing. Others are tapping technology to find substitutes for meat, cheese and eggs. These fake animal products will mean less land is used to raise livestock, fewer trucks emitting greenhouse gases, and fewer animals subject to inhumane slaughter. Venture capitalists have propped up startups such as Hampton Creek, which sells mayonnaise and cookies that use plant products instead of eggs. Another company, Impossible Foods, makes hamburgers and cheese without meat or dairy products.

Silicon Valley isn't just making technology for farms. Some of its highest-profile investors are buying farmland. They want to affect how farmers work their fields and influence the type of food that's available for future generations. Farmland LP buys farms and converts them into organic pastures that crop farmers and cattle and sheep ranchers can share. The company has attracted some of Silicon Valley's wealthiest investors. But the draw is more than a happy vision of free-roaming cows. Many investors see farmland as a safe investment to balance their risky tech investments.

## Tech-Minded Farmers

Farmers, for the most part, have welcomed Silicon Valley techies into their world of planting seasons and water woes. From Salinas to Fresno to Tracy, California farmers are increasingly tech-minded. They are running their fields from iPads and tracking soil moisture and nitrogen levels with cloud software programs. Farmers are hungry for more tech solutions that will increase their land's productivity and the money in their bank accounts.

"There is a kind of renaissance in technology in agriculture right now," said Ryan Jacobsen, a farmer and executive director of the Fresno County Farm Bureau. "It's an exciting time to be a farmer right now."

In many ways, agriculture is an industry ripe for Silicon Valley — farms were historically on the forefront of manufacturing innovation, and farmers have long embraced new technology. But farmers and tech startups live in separate worlds. Only recently have they seen each other as a benefit. They came together through a number of economic, tech and social factors.

During the recession, California agriculture remained one of the only bright spots in the state's floundering economy. While housing prices tanked, farmland value increased — and investors noticed. There was heightened attention to the state's three-year drought, climate change and the world's swelling population. The prospect of food shortages became a more immediate problem, grabbing the attention of entrepreneurs who want to build something other than yet another social media app. Meanwhile, technology got cheaper so more small- and medium-size farmers could buy it.

It became clear that farmers and tech startups could serve each other well. Blue River Technology in Sunnyvale has created a machine for farmers. According to Jorge Heraud, the CEO and co-founder of the company, the machine uses digital imaging and powerful software to trim lettuce 100 times faster than people.

## Costs Vs. Benefits

Because these machines have replaced human labor, some workers will have to find new jobs. That's one of the pitfalls — as more technology is introduced to farming, jobs will be cut. It could discourage immigration to places like the Central Valley, which makes much of the nation's food on the backs of migrant workers and has already seen a labor shortage due to U.S. economic problems and the crackdown on undocumented workers.

"The task of automation has always been about doing the jobs that humans do," Heraud said. "There will be jobs cost (but) society generally benefits when productivity is increased."
