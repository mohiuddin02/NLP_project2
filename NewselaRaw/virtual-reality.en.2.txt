LAS VEGAS — "Virtual reality" is the term for a three-dimensional world created by computers. It is a sort of imaginary world that users feel they are inside of.

Although virtual reality (VR) could someday have many uses, it is still mostly for video or computer games. Put on a helmet where VR systems are being demonstrated, and chances are you will be inside a video game. You might find yourself in a spaceship cockpit, or driving a racing car or running from bullets.

All that sounds like fun, but virtual reality still has a long way to go. Helmets remain big and clunky, and fast-action VR games make too many people sick to their stomachs.

Virtual reality headset makers like the company Oculus are trying to fix those problems. At the same time, they are also exploring other uses for virtual reality. They do not want it to only be used for games.

## Firms Get To Show Their Stuff

An electronics show held in Las Vegas this week allowed VR makers to show what they have been up to. Users who wore the new Oculus Rift headset, which looks like a pair of ski goggles, were transported to an imaginary world where a menacing T-Rex awaited. If they leaned in, they could almost feel its breath on them.

In the same demonstration, people were virtually lifted to the top of a tall building; if they walked to the edge and leaned over, they could see bustling traffic hundreds of feet below. The effect triggered the fear of heights in more than one show attendee.

In another demonstration, a fight scene between two robots played out in a 360-degree video. Users following the action were able to look left, right and from behind the robots.

Oculus's presentation was designed to demonstrate the range of what VR can do.

Nate Mitchell, an Oculus vice president, said his company will continue to work on video games. However, he said, "it may well end up being that VR is more about film than games."

## Hollywood, Others Exploring

Most Hollywood studios are deeply involved in exploring the possible uses of VR. The Sundance Film Festival, which will be held this month, will screen at least 13 short VR movies.

The VR maker Jaunt has developed a camera that allows users to make their own VR films. The company has already released two concert videos that give users a 360-degree view of the concert stage.

Other companies are exploring uses of VR that have nothing to do with movies.

AltspaceVR is focusing on using VR to help people in different locations attend meetings together. When group meetings are held by phone, people can't tell if someone is listening, and often they accidentally talk over one another. In AltspaceVR's app, the users appear as an avatar — or an image that represents them. Each person attending a meeting wears their own headset. When they look or move in a certain direction, the figure representing them moves the same way.

Meeting attendees can tell if someone wants to talk to them in particular, or if someone is busy. As a result, people are able to interact in a more natural way than they can when meetings are held by phone. The app even allows users to hear someone better if that person's avatar is closer. Getting really close to someone's avatar lets users whisper.

## It's Still Early

Another VR headset maker, Sulon Technologies, has developed software that allows users to walk around a life-sized virtual engine. Dhan Balachand, who is the head of Sulon, said it could change the way product-design teams work. They would be able to see products and parts without having to manufacture them first.

The company also believes that its Cortex headset will change the way people buy cars. If customers put the headset on, the image of a car appears in front of them. They are able to change its color and to add or remove features.

VR may also soon be used by the military for training. Police, firefighters and medical emergency teams may begin using it for natural disaster drills.

As for virtual reality and the movies, there is still one big problem. With so few people owning headsets, it is difficult to get anyone to make VR movies.

Mitchell isn't worried, though.

"Obviously, it's way too early for a $50 million blockbuster VR film because there's no way to sell it to people yet," he said. "But I think in the next few years we'll get there. It's still early days."
