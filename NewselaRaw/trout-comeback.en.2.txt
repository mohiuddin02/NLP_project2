PYRAMID LAKE, Nev. - Brian Dunn flicked his fly line into the azure water. Before long, it straightened and a smile spread on his face. A 6-pound, 25-inch-long cutthroat trout was soon splashing in the net.

What made his catch special was a yellow ID tag near its dorsal fin. This was no ordinary fish, but one that scientists once thought was extinct: the Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroat, the largest inland trout in North America.

"It's a great day when you can bring back a species from extinction," said Dunn. "It's kind of sad these events are so rare."

The torpedo-shaped trout with orange-red cheeks and sparkling rose-pink stripes can grow as large as salmon. It lived in the desert lake near Reno when Pyramid was part of a much larger body of water called Lake Lahontan, tens of thousands of years ago. From near extinction to stunning recovery, its comeback is a rare win for threatened and [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). Its story is a decades-long saga of natural risk and scientific discovery. It was only made possible by the rare commitment of a fisheries biologist working in one of the most remote corners of the West.

## The Return Of The One That Got Away

At Pyramid Lake, where the fish was reintroduced in 2006, whoppers are being landed weighing more than 20 pounds. There is talk that a new world record may be on the horizon (the current one is a 41-pounder caught in 1925). Another reintroduction at Fallen Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe in California in 2002 also is paying off. Last year, Lahontan cutthroats laid eggs there in a stream for the first time in more than 70 years.

"This is such an exciting story because this was such a unique fish," said Mary Peacock, a biology professor at the University of Nevada. "You can see pictures from the early part of the 1900s with people holding really large trout out of Tahoe or Pyramid. We thought those fish were gone. This puts this fish back into people's imagination."

## A Lost Fish Is Found

By the 1920s and '30s, overfishing was hurting the fish's numbers, but there were still plenty. The killer blow was the construction of a dam south of the lake on the Truckee River. The dam sent large amounts of water to nearby farmers. Snowmelt that once gushed into Pyramid Lake each spring shrank sharply. The lake level dropped until, finally, trout no longer could reach the Truckee River to lay eggs.

"The last known run left the lake during the high-water year of 1938," scientists Terry Hickman and Robert Behnke wrote in 1979. "No water was available in later years and ... this magnificent trout was believed to be extinct." But they added: "There is the possibility that an introduction of the original Pyramid Lake cutthroat may have persisted in some remote, unknown waters."

Few streams are more remote than Morrison Creek, which tumbles 2 to 3 miles into the Great Salt Lake desert from Pilot Peak on the Nevada-Utah border. That's where Don Duff found himself in the mid-1970s.

Duff was a government biologist at the time searching for a trout native to the Great Salt Lake region: the Bonneville cutthroat. But the fish he caught in the creek didn't look like a Bonneville. He sent samples to Behnke, the region's top cutthroat expert. Behnke examined the fish and compared it with the historical descriptions. He said the fish appeared to be Lahontan cutthroats from Pyramid Lake. But he couldn't prove it.

## Lahontan Life-Support

The fish's discovery did not guarantee its recovery, though. Fewer than 400 fish were thought to live in Morrison Creek. Turning them into larger numbers in a hatchery was a challenge no agency wanted to take on. "It was something that everybody fought, that nobody would believe," said Bryce Nielson, then a biologist working for the state of Utah. "Nobody really wanted to bother with it." But that wasn't good enough for Nielson. He began supplying Lahontan life-support on his own. With little official help, he built a small fish hatchery at the base of Morrison Creek on a ranch owned by a fish-friendly landowner. Often, eggs didn't hatch. Those that did rarely survived. But he, the landowner, and another friend kept trying.

In 1995, the first eggs from Nielson's facility were shipped across Nevada to the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery Complex, where Pilot Peak cutthroats are now breeding in the hundreds of thousands. But did they really come from Pyramid Lake? Only a DNA test could say for sure. And with the old giants gone from the lake - replaced by a different strain of Lahontan - where would the genetic material come from?

## Verifying Ancient DNA

The answer came in the 2000s with a Jurassic Park-like breakthrough that gave researchers a way to take DNA from museum specimens that were preserved in a chemical called formaldehyde.

"Formaldehyde binds to DNA and breaks it up. That was problematic," Peacock said. "We didn't have a way of dealing with bits and pieces of DNA. But now we can." She tracked down tissue samples from the original Pyramid Lake cutthroats in museums across America. She compared their DNA with the DNA of more than four dozen other Lahontan populations in Nevada, California, Oregon and the Pilot Peak cutthroats. What she discovered rocked the fishing community: No DNA more closely matched the museum samples than the cutthroat from Pilot Peak. A lost legend had been found.

"These are the descendants of the original strain," Peacock said.
