SEATTLE â€” Students who skip too many days of schools have a much lower chance of graduating high school. Even missing as few as 10 days a year makes a big difference in how a kid does in school.

These findings were a bombshell for researcher Bob Balfanz. He has spent most of his career trying to understand why 1 million American students drop out of high school each year.

After tracking 13,000 middle-schoolers in Philadelphia, Balfanz figured out what the kids, who later failed to graduate on time, have in common. They all have a history of poor school attendance. Sixth-graders who missed 20 days of class had, at best, a 20 percent chance of graduating from high school on time.

More surprising still, school attendance averages are highly misleading. A district may have an attendance rate of 90 percent. But hundreds of students may still be missing weeks of school. The attendance numbers hide the fact that different students are absent on different days.

## "Attendance Really Does Matter"

"That's when the sheer magnitude hit us," said Balfanz, referring to the number of student absences. He is based at John Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Other researchers have found a similar tie between poor attendance and low school performance.

"That has been proven for all kids," Balfanz said.

To get kids to stay in school and do well, just improve attendance, Balfanz found.

This finding inspired Balfanz to create the anti-dropout program Diplomas Now. The program sends recent college graduates into middle schools to focus on attendance and tutoring.

Denny International and Aki Kurose in Seattle have both struggled with student discipline and poor test scores. At both schools, Diplomas Now is making a big difference.

In 2010, more than half of the 590 students at Aki Kurose missed at least 10 days of class. In math, where understanding the basics is essential, 62 percent of students tested below grade level.

According to Balfanz, about 200 of these students were high school dropouts in the making.

"Attendance really does matter," said Principal Mia Williams. "I mean, if you're not here, how are you going to pass your classes?"

## Cheering Students On

There is no magic to Diplomas Now. It builds on the basic truth that kids respond to relationships.

Every day at 7:20 a.m., in dark rain or cutting cold, a group of City Year staff line up outside the schools. They cheer sleepy pupils as they trudge to class. The nonprofit City Year is an arm of AmeriCorps. It is working with Diplomas Now.

The City Year staffers provide in-class tutoring and after-school instruction. Since they began, there has been a 15 percent decrease in the number of students with attendance problems. The schools are also seeing a 79 percent drop in those failing English, and a 96 percent fall in the number failing math.

At Aki Kurose, each City Year staff member is responsible for tracking 10 students. They call parents about absences.

Late students must explain themselves and walk to class with a City Year escort.

"A lot of these kids were flying under the radar," said Katrina Hunt, the Diplomas Now coordinator at Aki Kurose. "We never had any single person following them."

One eighth-grader had already missed weeks of class when he came to Hunt's attention. The youngest of seven children, the boy never realized that it mattered to anyone if he showed up.

No one woke him up in the morning, Hunt learned. He showed up at Aki Kurose only 80 percent of the time, or else wandered in around fourth period.

"In his family, that was the culture," she said. "But we became close, and that's what made him want to come."

The success of Diplomas Now hinges on those special connections,

## A Meeting With A Problem Student

Diplomas Now is at work in 41 schools across the country. The federal government is backing a $30 million study to see if the program really works.

Every Friday, a handful of teachers and City Year staffers squeeze into student desks at Denny to discuss students who need more help.

A month into the year, one eighth-grader had already missed seven days of class, while another had been late 14 times. A boy appeared so depressed that teachers couldn't even get him to doodle on a notebook.

Jonathan Barajas, 14, was failing English and arrived late to all of his classes. On a recent day, he slumped into a meeting with the Diplomas Now coordinator, Roxana Amaral.

"Why are you late to class?" Amaral began, her dark eyes steady.

"I don't know. I don't want to go," answered the boy. His attitude is better than it was sixth grade. Then, he walked out of class, taunted teachers and got suspended. His mother believes much of the change is due to Diplomas Now.

"I think he finally understands that teachers are not the bad guys," his mother said. "I think it's helping him to grow up."

Still, Jonathan looked as though he might collapse when his English teacher urged him to read five pages a day.

"Jonathan, please," begged his mother, her voice trembling. "I want to go to your eighth-grade graduation."

"This is your last chance to show us you can move on to high school," said Amaral.

Finally, he turned back toward his mother and choked out, "OK, yes."
