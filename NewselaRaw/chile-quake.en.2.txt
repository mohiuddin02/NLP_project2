ILLAPEL, Chile — A powerful earthquake destroyed homes in the small Chilean city of Illapel on Wednesday. Thousands of people were forced to sleep outside the day after.

The earthquake lasted for three minutes and caused buildings to shake as far away as the capital city of Santiago. At least 10 people were killed.

## High Magnitude, Serious Damage

Earthquakes are measured according to their magnitude, or strength. A 2.5-magnitude earthquake, for example, is weak enough that it would hardly be felt. Anything above magnitude 8 can cause very serious damage, particularly near the epicenter, where the force of the earthquake is strongest. Wednesday's earthquake was measured at magnitude 8.3.

Such powerful earthquakes often cause tsunamis — long, high sea waves that can themselves cause a lot of damage. Following Wednesday's earthquake authorities issue a tsunami warning for the country's entire Pacific coast. People sought safety in the streets of inland cities. Others along the shore took to their cars to race to higher ground.

## Tsunami Waves Flood Towns

Several coastal towns were indeed flooded by small tsunami waves. Across the country more than 1 million people temporarily fled to safer areas.

The earthquake shook the Earth so strongly that rumbles were felt across South America.

"I thought it was the end of the world and we were going to die," said teary-eyed Manuel Moya, 38, outside his destroyed home in Illapel, 34 miles east of the earthquake's epicenter. The town and surrounding areas have about 35,000 inhabitants.

Moya said he and his wife were in bed and watching television when the earthquake hit. Fearing they would be killed if they remained inside, they ran outside in their underwear. By the end of the shaking, their home, made of concrete, had been reduced to rubble. Neighbors later brought them some clothes to wear.

## Another "Powerful Blow From Nature"

"They said it was a magnitude 8 but it felt like a 10," Moya said.

Speaking to the nation late Wednesday, President Michelle Bachelet urged people who had been relocated to stay on high ground until the danger was over. Officials said schools would be closed in most of the country Thursday.

In the past year, Chile has endured devastating floods, wildfires and two volcano eruptions.

"Once again we must confront a powerful blow from nature," said Bachelet.

Authorities said 10 people had been killed, from causes ranging from a collapsed adobe house to heart attacks. Most were near the earthquake's epicenter. Emergency crews have not yet reached several hard-hit areas, so the death toll may still rise.

Throughout the country, 1 million people were forced out of their homes. Electrical power was cut off to 240,000 households. Many people had returned home by Thursday afternoon, after the tsunami warning was lifted.

Dozens of aftershocks shook the region after the initial earthquake, ranging from magnitude 6 to magnitude 7.

## Chile Prepared For Bad Quakes

The initial earthquake was the strongest the country has seen since a magnitude-8.8 earthquake in 2010. The 2010 earthquake and the tsunami it caused killed hundreds and flattened part of the city of Concepcion.

Wednesday's earthquake seems to have caused much less damage and death than the one in 2010. In part this was because since 2010 Chile has worked hard at being better prepared for major earthquakes.

American scientist Susan Hough said Chile is now ahead of most of the world when it comes to earthquake preparedness. The country's careful planning and safety measures probably made this earthquake much less damaging than it could have been, she said.

## Felt All Over South America

The earthquake was so strong that people in Buenos Aires, Argentina, felt it. People in Peru and Brazil also reported feeling the shakes, though no injuries were reported outside of Chile.

Claudio Moreno was in a Santiago bar when the earthquake hit. The shaking was powerful, but more worrisome was how long it lasted, he said.

"We went out in the street when we felt it was going on too long," he said. "It was more than a minute."

## Chile Prone To Earthquakes

The 2010 earthquake killed more than 500 people. It destroyed 220,000 homes, and washed away docks, riverfronts and seaside resorts.

The 2010 earthquake led Chile to improve its alert systems for both earthquakes and tsunamis.

Chile is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries. The strongest earthquake ever recorded anywhere in the world happened there in 1960. It measured in at magnitude 9.5 and killed more than 5,000 people.
