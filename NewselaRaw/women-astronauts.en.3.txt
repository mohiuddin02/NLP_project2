CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — You can ask astronauts Samantha Cristoforetti and Yelena Serova about their years of space training. Just don't ask them about their hair and makeup.

Cristoforetti is Italy's first female astronaut. She is set to rocket into space this weekend to the International Space Station. She will join Serova of Russia who went up in September. Serova is one of her homeland's few women cosmonauts.

The International Space Station has been orbiting the Earth for 16 years. This will be just the second time that two women will be part of its crew. Just six people live on the space station at a time.

## Good Hair Day In Space

Cristoforetti is a fighter pilot in the Italian air force. She has avoided most questions about being a female astronaut.

Serova tried to do the same. Before she climbed aboard a rocket to the space station, Russian reporters asked if she was bringing makeup. They also wondered how she would wear her hair during her mission.

Serova ignored the makeup question. As for her hair, she shot back: "I have a question for you — why don't you ask the question about Alexander's hair, for example." Crewmate Alexander Samokutyaev was seated next to her at the time.

"Space is what I do for work, and that's what I think about it. It's my work," Serova said. She is an engineer.

In 1983, Sally Ride became the first American woman in space. She also got asked silly questions about hair and makeup before her space flight.

## Russian Women Were First

Serova and Cristoforetti will spend six months aboard the space station. It orbits 260 miles above Earth.

Cristoforetti is the first woman sent on a long space station mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). Last month, the ESA landed the first spacecraft on a comet.

Serova is the first Russian woman to live at the space station. In 1963, Russia launched the world's first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova. In 1984, another Russian became the first woman to walk in space.

Serova looked up to those two Russian spacewomen.

"If somebody wants to achieve something they can do it," Serova said.

## Getting Ready For Mars

In the United States, scientists are studying the differences between men and women in space. Space station missions last six months. Astronauts will be spending far longer in space when trips go to Mars. NASA wants to make sure all astronauts stay safe and healthy. NASA is the U.S. space agency.

Scientists have found some differences between men and women. Women feel more faint when trying to stand after returning to Earth. They also are dizzier. Women seem to lose more plasma during spaceflight. Plasma is the liquid part of blood. Male astronauts suffer more vision problems while in orbit. However, there are very few astronauts to test. Scientists do not think the differences mean much.

Scientists also have questions about space radiation and weightlessness. They wonder whether they would make it harder for astronauts to have children.

## Small Differences Are Important

"Understanding small differences is especially important," Dr. Saralyn Mark said. She is a government space expert. There is no air in space and it is very cold. "Even small differences in how the body adapts" can be very important to know.

Mark and others say more women should fly in space. Also, more astronauts, both male and female, should take part in scientific studies.

That will be a challenge. More of the astronauts are men. Of NASA's 43 current astronauts, just 11 are women.

NASA plans to learn more from a yearlong mission by two astronauts — an American and a Russian. The mission is set to begin at the space station in March. Both astronauts are men.
