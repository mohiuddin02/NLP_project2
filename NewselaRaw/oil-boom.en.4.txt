CASPER, Wyo. â€” These are rich times in the Cowboy State. It is all thanks to the oil business.

Good jobs in the oil fields of Wyoming are as common as pickup trucks here. And the amount of people out of work is far below the national average.

But some people worry that Wyoming depends too much on oil.

Wyoming's oil business failed in the mid-1980s. If that happens again, more people could lose their jobs. Many teenagers around here skip college or drop out of high school. The high pay in the oil fields tempts them. And many don't have a plan if things go bad.

## Good Pay But Dangerous Work

Tyrel Wellmaker is one of them. He has a high school diploma. He left the Army for an oil job. Few skills were needed to do the work. But it paid better than jobs for college graduates.

He worked in the oil fields during his early 20s. With a salary of more than $100,000 he bought his own house and drove a cool pickup.

But he grew tired of the dangerous conditions. On one job he shared a trailer with other workers. One winter day in 2008, the toilet in the trailer froze. He just walked away.

He soon filed for bankruptcy. The house went into foreclosure. He couldn't afford his pickup truck. At 26, he moved back in with his father. He regrets his decision to skip college.

"I felt I had made the biggest mistake of my life," said Wellmaker, now 31.

## Grab It While You Can

But who could blame him? For most high school graduates, the quickest way to achieve the American dream is to attend college. Not so in Wyoming.

Between 2009 and 2011, the average U.S. salary for college graduates was $48,997. The average high school graduate made just $26,957. The average salary for high school dropout was $19,013.

Compare that with Wyoming: In 2011, in the $60,000-$75,000 pay range, there were more people with only high school educations than those with college degrees.

Wyoming has deep ties to the energy business. More than two-thirds of the state's money comes from coal, gas and uranium. Some say the state has no choice.

"You have to pursue the opportunity while all those good-paying jobs are there," said Mark Perry. He's an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint. He specializes in the energy business.

He thinks the oil boom will last for a long time. "Young people should grab some of this oil money. They can always go back to school," he said.

## Bust Always Follows Boom

But some say oil money has prevented new jobs in other areas.

"We're in a boom cycle now, but the bust will come," said Sissy Goodwin. She teaches power technology at a college.  "We need our politicians to look for the non-energy jobs of the future."

Jobs for unskilled workers are easy to get. But those for college graduates are not.

Last year, almost one-sixth of Wyoming's 288,000 jobs required a college degree. That's according to Wyoming state figures. By comparison, more than two-thirds required only a high school education.

Jim Rose directs the Wyoming Community College Commission. He says colleges can't train students for jobs that aren't there. "If Wyoming started training people to work in the automobile or aircraft industry, we'd just be buying them a ticket to leave the state," he said.

Jonathan Odlin is training for a new job. He was in the military, but then he took a job in the Wyoming oil fields in 2006. He had a high school degree, and the pay was good. But he hated that the hours weren't steady.

Odlin, 30, will soon earn a degree in power plant technology. He struggles to support five children. "The oil fields may mean quick bucks, but for low-level workers like me, they're not the place to be." he said.
