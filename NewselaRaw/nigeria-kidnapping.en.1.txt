WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama said Tuesday that the U.S. will do everything it can to help Nigeria find nearly [300 teenage girls](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian+schoolgirls). The girls have been missing since they were kidnapped from school three weeks ago by a terror organization that has threatened to sell them into slavery.

Obama said the Nigerian government has accepted help from the U.S., and a team of experts will be sent immediately to the African nation.

The immediate priority is finding the girls, Obama said, but that the extremist group, Boko Haram, must also be dealt with.

"In the short term our goal is obviously is to help the international community, and the Nigerian government, as a team to do everything we can to recover these young ladies," Obama said. He spoke in an interview with NBC's "Today" show. They were some of his first public comments about what he called a "terrible situation" in the West African nation.

"But we're also going to have to deal with the broader problem of organizations like this that ... can cause such havoc in people's day-to-day lives," Obama said of Boko Haram.

## 276 Girls In Captivity

The brazen April 15 kidnapping has sparked international outrage. There also have been increasing demands for Nigeria to spare no effort to find and free the girls before they can be sold into slavery or harmed.

Nigeria's police have said more than 300 girls were taken by force from their high school in the country's remote northeast. Of that number, 276 remain in captivity and 53 managed to escape.

Obama said he was glad the Nigerian government was accepting help from U.S. military and law enforcement advisers.

"Obviously, what's happening is awful, and, as a father of two girls, I can't imagine what their parents are going through," he told CBS News in an interview. Obama's daughter's, Malia and Natasha, are aged 15 and 13.

Obama said the U.S. has long sought to work with Nigeria to stop Boko Haram. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sinful," is an Islamist extremist group that believes in a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. It forbids anything Western, including voting in elections and a secular, non-religious education, and doesn't believe girls should go to school at all.

"You've got one of the worst regional or local terrorist organizations in Boko Haram in Nigeria. They've been killing people ruthlessly for many years now and we've already been seeking greater cooperation with the Nigerians," Obama said.

## U.S. Sending Experts To Nigeria

The Nigeria government has been unable to rescue the girls. And that "may be the event that helps to mobilize the entire international community to finally do something against this horrendous organization that's perpetrated such a terrible crime," Obama said.

The U.S. is sending experts who are skilled in intelligence, investigations, hostage negotiations, information sharing and victim assistance. It will also send officials with expertise in other areas, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

No U.S. armed forces are being sent, Carney noted.

Obama made his comments during a series of television interviews conducted in the White House Rose Garden. He spoke shortly after the Senate passed a resolution urging the girls' safe and immediate return. Some lawmakers also observed a moment of silence on the Capitol steps calling for their release, and dozens of people also protested outside the Nigerian Embassy in Washington.

All 20 female senators urged Obama in a letter to pursue severe international sanctions, or punishments, against Boko Haram. A smaller group of mostly male senators urged Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to address the root causes of unrest in his country.

## "A Greater Effort" Needed

Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. had been in touch with Nigeria "from day one" of the crisis. But repeated offers of U.S. assistance were ignored until Kerry got on the phone Tuesday with Jonathan.

Kerry said Nigeria apparently did not want outside help, but now realizes that more needs to be done than it is able to do.

"I think now the complications that have arisen have convinced everybody that there needs to be a greater effort," Kerry said at a State Department news conference. "And it will begin immediately. I mean, literally, immediately."

A statement from Jonathan's office said the U.S. will send "security (experts) to work with their Nigerian counterparts in the search and rescue operation." The statement added that Nigeria's security forces are working at "full capacity" to find the girls and welcomes the addition of American anti-terrorist "know-how and expertise."

Nigeria's Islamic extremist leader, Abubakar Shekau, has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and has threatened to sell the girls. Shekau also warned that Boko Haram will attack more schools and abduct more girls.

The State Department on Tuesday warned U.S. citizens against traveling to Nigeria.
