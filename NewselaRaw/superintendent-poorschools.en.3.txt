JENNINGS, Mo. — In Jennings, Missouri, the school district is different from schools in other places. The school leaders provide food, clothing, shelter and more for their students.

Many of the people in Jennings are poor and African-American families. When students are hungry or do not have a place to sleep for that night, it can make it hard for them to do well in school.

Tiffany Anderson is superintendent of the school district and in charge of all the schools. She has brought in many changes.

Students in Jennings have not been doing well in school for a long time. Anderson said that schools can do more to help poor students. She thinks that helping students with things like housing, food and clothes will help them to do well in school.

## More Students Finish School Now

Since Anderson came to Jennings, more students have been doing better in school. She has helped more kids to graduate from high school than before.

Gwen McDile is a homeless 17-year-old in Jennings. This fall, she missed so much school that she might not have been able to graduate. 

That changed when she was invited to move into Hope House. Hope House is a shelter opened by the school system. It is meant to give students like her a home.

She arrived a few days after Thanksgiving. In Hope House, Gwen has her own bedroom. The kitchen is full of healthy food.

Gwen is no longer hungry. She has been making it to class, and thinks she will graduate on time.

## Music, Dance Classes Offered

The classes in Jennings are improving, too. Anderson started Saturday school. Saturday school offers advanced classes for older students. It helps students take college classes in high school.

Anderson has found money to pay for music and dance classes in Jennings. She closed two half-empty schools and accepted donations to pay for the classes.

This Thanksgiving, the school district handed out canned goods, fresh vegetables and turkeys.

## Schools Hire Their Own Graduates

Samuel Brown Jr. helped hand out the holiday food. He graduated from Jennings High in 2015, and works as a janitor for the schools. He was one of 10 graduates who did not find work elsewhere. Anderson hired all of them. 

"I've learned how it feels to be getting your own," Brown said of his first job. It pays $9.50 an hour. "I've learned how it feels to be free."

In 2015, almost all of the high school students in Jennings graduated on time. 

The schools in Jennings still have more work to do, though. Most students are not where they should be in math and reading. Less than half of the graduating class of 2015 was ready for college, according to the state. 

The school system is getting plenty of help from kind people and businesses. However, Anderson is a big help. Many people in Jennings say they could not do it without her.

"We just needed someone who believed in us," said Jeff Arnold, an art teacher in the district for the past 23 years. "She's the best thing that's happened to us in a very long time."
