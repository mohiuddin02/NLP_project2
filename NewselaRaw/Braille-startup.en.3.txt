His dad told him to "Google it."

So Shubham did. With a few Internet searches he learned about Braille, the writing system used by the blind. Braille is printed with raised dots on paper. Blind people read the dots with their fingers. He also learned about Braille printers. To the middle schooler's shock, he discovered they cost thousands of dollars.

He decided to make his own. Using Lego pieces, he created a cheap Braille printer for his school's science fair.

## He Is A Businessman At 13

Today, Shubham has started his own company. Its name is Braigo Labs, a combination of Braille and Legos. Shubham's company wants to be the first maker of low-cost, small Braille printers.

Shubham has been invited to the White House and has won many awards. On Tuesday, Intel announced that it is investing money in Shubham's company. Intel is one of the world's largest makers of computer chips. The money from Intel will let Shubham hire people to design his printer. That way he can concentrate on school.

"It was curiosity," Shubham explained. He is now 13 and an eighth-grader at Champion School in San Jose, California. "I'm always thinking up something. If you think it can be done, then it can probably be done."

Braigo Labs is a family business. Shubham's mom, Malini Banerjee, is the company president. His dad, Neil Banerjee, who works for Intel, also helps run the company and drives Shubham around. He goes with Shubham to press events, interviews and business meetings.

## Now More Kids Can Print And Read

Intel will not say how much money it is giving Shubham's company.

The money from Intel has earned Shubham a place in history. He is the youngest person to get money from a big company to start a tech business. Nick D'Aloisio was two years older when he received startup money for his company, Summly, in 2011. Yahoo later bought Summly for $30 million. Summly is a news reading app.

Groups for the blind are excited about a cheap Braille printer. They say it could help blind people read more books and news. It would also increase the number of people who can read Braille. Just 5,100 of the 60,000 blind schoolchildren in the United States can read Braille, says the American Printing House for the Blind.

"There is absolutely a need," said Gary Mudd. He works for the Printing House. "Being blind is sometimes very expensive."

Braille printers cost from $2,000 to $10,000 and more. Braigo plans to sell its printer for about $350.

"We had no idea that someone could reinvent a Braille printer and bring the cost down" by so much, said Mike Bell. He is an Intel vice president. The printer will help a lot of people, he said.

## He Never Gave Up

The biggest challenge facing Braigo may be whether enough people will buy the printers. Only about one out of every 10 people read Braille. Also, some cellphones have electronic Braille screens. Apps can read words out loud. Some experts say technology will make Braille printers less needed.

Even if the printers do not sell, Shubham has had a great experience.

For a while, Shubham's mother worried he was wasting his time. She remembers when her son stayed up until 2 a.m. trying to get his invention to work. She would urge him to give up and go to bed.

"He would keep building and breaking things," she said. She became discouraged.

Now she tells every mom, "Believe in your child."
