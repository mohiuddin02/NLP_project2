YANGON, Myanmar â€” Linn Naing rides his black bicycle like a cowboy on horseback, with his bamboo hat strapped under his chin and his feet in flip-flops. He fixes the red cushions on his sidecar and rides off in search of a day's work.

Linn Naing is dressed in a blue wrap called a lungyi, with a cellphone in his breast pocket. He bikes past old colonial buildings with faded paint, billboards for toothpaste and Mercedes-Benz cars, and an Internet cafe called Google.

## Hustle And Bustle In Ex-Burma

Myanmar, which used to be called Burma, was a colony controlled by the British until 1948. After that year, it was ruled by a military dictatorship until 2011, and it is still developing as a democracy. Many countries that avoided Myanmar during the dictatorship, when the military committed human rights abuses, are starting to do business there again.

Down the road, shiny new apartment towers rise toward the sky. They are monuments to the quickly transforming Yangon, a city of 7.4 million that is the largest in Myanmar. Fleets of small, new white taxis swarm around lumbering old buses, a sign of increasingly prosperous times.

## Scorpions: Sidecar Men's Best Friends

But even in 2015, there is still room on the roads for bicycle sidecar taxis like Linn Naing's. Buses are cheap, but hot, and taxis are cool, but they are expensive, he says. Linn Naing has been at his job for eight years, and business is still good, he said. In fact, he said with the traffic jams nowadays, it is often faster to take a sidecar, so people prefer it.

In many cities in Southeast Asia, bicycle taxis and sidecars have been replaced by cheap motorbikes. Chinese and Japanese motorcycles and scooters zoom around, clogging city streets and beeping noisily.

But the military in Myanmar outlawed any motorbikes in central Yangon more than a decade ago. Legend has it the ban was imposed after a motorcycle gang called the Scorpions interfered with the motorcade of a general. But even as the country moves to a more democratic government, the authorities have shown no intention to lift the restrictions.

That is good news for Linn Naing and the thousands of other sidecar drivers in this city, Myanmar's business capital. With fares ranging from 20 cents to 50 cents, sidecars are still a budget alternative to taxis for short trips. Linn Naing makes about $10 a day taking women home from the market, children to school and tourists to temples. That is a decent wage in a country where the average person makes about $1,000 a year.

Still, getting into the business is not cheap, as a bicycle and a sidecar can cost about $200 and a license is $300. Unlike many drivers, Linn Naing owns his sidecar, which means he does not have to pay a $2 to $3 daily fee to rent his ride.

## Bikes On Old Maps Above Mandalay

The design of the sidecars is about 85 years old. According to the story, a mechanic wanted to create a cheaper form of transport to compete with trains. Burmese sidecars are made by hand out of wood and have two seats, one facing forward and one facing the rear, so passengers sit back to back alongside the driver. A heavy metal bracket hooks the sidecar to the bicycle frame. A light and a shiny bell typically adorn the handlebars and a metal license plate flies like a flag above the front fender.

Zaw Zaw Co, a Yangon artist, began putting bicycles in his paintings in 2011. He shows the bikes and their passengers floating above old maps of famous areas of Myanmar, like the city of Mandalay, which used to be home of the kings of Burma.

The artist said he wanted to paint something that showed working class people. Many drivers are uneducated and do not have many choices, he said.

Zaw Zaw Co likes sidecars because they are practical and sentimental. He said they are useful to get home from the store or to go somewhere like a small street where buses don't go. The sidecars will survive, because there will always be people who need them, he said.
