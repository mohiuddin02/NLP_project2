Milly Wu marched through the J. Paul Getty Museum's galleries of 19th-century European paintings. She stopped to take pictures of Monets, Manets and, of course, Vincent Van Gogh's "Irises."

Works of art became souvenirs to share with her friends back home in Hangzhou, China.

But when she got to a gallery filled with French furnishings from the 17th century, the 11-year-old just looked around.

"Wah," she gasped â€” Chinese for "wow."

"It's very beautiful," said her dad, Will Wu, an information technology professional who used to work for Hewlett-Packard and speaks some English. "Mr. Getty had a great eye for this type of item."

## Becoming A Magnet

The Getty and other Los Angeles museums have their eyes on people like the Wus. They show the increase in tourism from mainland China, as the country becomes richer and more Chinese can afford to travel. The Getty is trying to attract these new Chinese tourists with things like free admission, its beautiful garden, and a tram ride to the hilltop the museum sits on in Brentwood with beautiful views of the city.

Experts from China are working with the Getty. They are helping it establish a presence on the leading social media sites for mainland China. It also piggybacks on the Los Angeles tourism board's efforts to promote LA destinations for visitors interested in art and culture.

The Getty has taken advantage of a program called "China Ready." The Los Angeles tourism board launched this program last year to help businesses of all kinds become magnets for Chinese vacationers.

Those that complete the program are labeled "China Ready." This is a seal of approval that they can use in proposals to potential visitors from China.

## Drawing Students

Unfortunately, the Getty probably won't be a top destination for group tours, which send travelers through Southern California on tour buses. In 2008, the Getty Center became the first Los Angeles museum to host a group from China after its government ended restrictions on Chinese visiting the United States. However, the main attractions in Los Angeles continue to be theme parks, Hollywood, trips to Vegas and Yosemite, and shopping trips.

"The Getty is impressive, it's beautiful," said Harry Chen, owner of Joy Holiday, a San Francisco company that regularly runs tours of Los Angeles. He thinks it's a shame the Getty is not featured in the tours right now. But he says not many people are going to be interested in going to a museum. Most people "love to be at the most popular places, taking pictures."

Daniel Shen, president of Lion Tours in Los Angeles, said that it's different for student groups that mainly come in the summer. "Every one of them that I handle from Asia requests the Getty Museum," he said. Students typically come for longer stays and have time to explore Los Angeles in greater depth. This makes a museum visit a natural choice, he said.

A new agreement with China is expected to generate many return trips. Instead of visas having to be renewed each year, visas from China to the U.S. are now good for 10 years.

Visitors "will have time on their hands to discover places that fit whatever their interests are," said Chen, of the San Francisco tour company. The longer visas will benefit places like the Getty Museum, he added.

## "She Likes The Irises"

According to figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce, visits from mainland China to Los Angeles rose 20 percent in 2014. The numbers are expected to continue growing by at least 10 percent annually.

Becoming "China Ready" involves launching a Web page in Mandarin, giving out Mandarin maps and guidebooks, and accepting China UnionPay, Chinese travelers' favored credit card. It helps to have staffers who speak Chinese, but it's not required. Providing museum audio tours in Chinese and adding Chinese dishes to menus at cafes are also helpful. At the Getty's cafeteria, visitors can get a menu in Chinese, and it usually will include a Chinese dish.

Will Wu asked a Chinese friend who lives in Los Angeles to recommend an art museum. Milly, the 11-year-old who took photos of the paintings, takes painting classes back home. This was a chance to foster her interest in art.

"My girl loves to see a lot of famous paintings, and my friend told me in the Getty Center there are a lot of famous paintings," Wu said.

Which did Milly like best? Her face, which had been firm and intense while she moved through the galleries, rounded into a big smile as she answered in Chinese.

"She says she likes the irises," her father said.
