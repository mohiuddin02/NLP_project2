SEATTLE — When Lynne Rodgers Miller and her husband, Daniel J. Miller, saw the news of the mudslide in Washington state on Saturday, they knew immediately where the land had given way.

On Saturday, at least 24 people died on a hillside when a square-mile area in Snohomish County, an hour north of Seattle, was buried in up to 40 feet of mud after a landslide.

In 1999, the Millers wrote a report filed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, warning of "the potential for a large catastrophic failure" on the hill.

"We've known it would happen at some point," said Daniel Miller, a geomorphologist who studies how landscapes form and tries to predict their changes. "We just didn't know when."

## An Unstable Hillside

Daniel Miller also documented the hill's landslide conditions in a report written in 1997 for the Washington Department of Ecology and local Native American tribes. He knows the hill's history, having a half-dozen folders stuffed with maps, slides, models and drawings done since the 1950s. They all tell the story of an unstable hillside that has defied efforts to shore it up.

That is why he could not believe what he saw in 2006, when he returned to the hill within weeks of a landslide that plugged the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, creating a new channel that threatened homes on Steelhead Drive where Saturday's mudslide occurred. Instead of seeing homes being vacated, he saw carpenters building new ones.

"Frankly, I was shocked that the county permitted any building across from the river," he said.

"We've known that it's been failing," he said of the hill. "It's not unknown that this hazard exists."

Daniel Miller believes officials should have understand the danger of a massive landslide, but his view stands in contrast to what John Pennington, head of Snohomish County's Department of Emergency Management, said at a news conference Monday. "It was considered very safe," Pennington said. "This was a completely unforeseen slide. This came out of nowhere."

At least five homes were built in 2006 on Steelhead Drive, the year of another slide, according to Snohomish County records, and another home was built in the neighborhood in 2009.

"They didn't even stop pounding nails," said Tracy Drury, an environmental engineer who studied the area with Miller soon after the 2006 slide. "We were surprised."

Snohomish County Executive John Lovick and Public Works Director Steve Thomsen said Monday night that they were not aware of the 1999 report. "A slide of this magnitude is very difficult to predict," Thomsen said. "There was no indication, no indication at all."

## 5 Landslides Since The 1940s

Irvin Wood and his wife, Judith, owned the last home allowed to be built in the slide zone.

The Woods used the property as a weekend getaway. But they were not there on Saturday when the mudslide wiped out their mobile home and swept away neighbors who are now missing and presumed dead.

Wood said nobody was warned about the likelihood of a massive landslide, but he thought it was not realistic for people to think the government could prevent the disaster.

"That's like saying the river is going to flood," Wood said. "If the hillsides were going to (slide) away, they were going to (slide) away. That's kind of what happens around here."

There have been at least five landslides in the area since the 1940s.

A slide in 1949 was nearly 1,000 feet long and took out about 2,600 feet of the river bank, according to a report that was commissioned by the state. The scarp — the face of the cliff where the slide broke away — was 70 feet tall in places.

According to the report, a main cause of the slides is the river eroding, or slowly washing away, the "toe" left behind by a previous slide. The "toe" supports the millions of tons of dirt behind it, like someone with their back against a bulging door. Eventually, the toe would fail from too much erosion, and weight and gravity would pull the mountain down again.

Saturday's monster slide left a scarp of nearly 600 feet, about nine times taller than the 1949 slide and four times taller than a slide in 1967.

"We always thought there was a possibility that a catastrophic event could come," said Pat Stevenson, the environmental manager of the Stillaguamish Tribe, a local Native American tribe. "We were hoping that wouldn't happen."

## "They Are In Mourning"

There were discussions over the years about whether to buy out the property owners in the area to keep anyone from living there, but nothing came of them.

"I think we did the best that we could" given the reality "that nobody wanted to sell their property and move," Drury said.

Stevenson said county officials who approved the homes seemed more focused on whether they were in flood areas than on the risk of a landslide.

Ron and Gail Thompson moved into a one-bedroom cabin on five acres on Steelhead Drive in 2003, said their daughter, Jennifer Johnson, of Arlington.

"I had conversations with the Army Corps of Engineers the last time this happened. They showed me a map and said mom and dad's house would be safe," she said Monday. "When we moved them in there, I never in a million years, never in a billion years, thought about (a mudslide). Dad was like, 'We're going to be fine,' and I just believed him."

Johnson's parents and 85-year-old grandmother left their house eight minutes before the slide hit on Saturday morning for a shopping trip to Costco, Johnson said. The couple lost everything they had.

"They are in mourning. They're in shock," she said. "They're heartbroken for their neighbors."
