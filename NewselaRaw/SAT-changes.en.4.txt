LOS ANGELES â€” The SAT is an important test. High school students take it if they want to get into college.

The company that owns the SAT is making changes to the test. It will stop making students write an essay. The change will happen in 2016.

The test will still offer an essay section. Some colleges may still tell students to write the essay.

The main SAT will be cut to two sections from the current three. The top score possible will be 1,600. That was the top score for years before the essay was added. With the essay section the current top score is 2,400.

## New Reading Sections

The College Board is the company that owns the test. It's making other changes to the test as well.

The goal is to make the test be more about what students learn in high school. The exam is also supposed to test things they will need in college.

Some students prepare for the test with private tutoring. The tutoring costs a lot of money. The new test is supposed to limit the benefits people get when they pay for tutoring. Some people have argued that the current SAT is harder for poor people and minorities.

The test will have new reading sections. Students will no longer be tested on unusual words. Instead, it will test them "on words students will use over and over again," said College Board President David Coleman. The math problems will be more linked to real-life questions.

The College Board is starting to work together with Khan Academy. Khan teaches online courses. It will offer a free series of practice exams and videos about good test-taking skills. The College Board hopes the practice exams will help poorer students.

## ACT Scores More Test Takers

Some experts said the College Board is looking out for what's good for students. But, they also say that it is looking out for its own interests.

There is another test that colleges accept instead of the SAT. It is called the ACT. A different company owns that test. Two years ago, the rival ACT went past the SAT in the number of test takers across the nation. About 1.6 million students took the SAT last year. More than 1.7 million took the ACT. Some students take both exams to be safe.

The new SAT will become more like the ACT. The ACT has an optional writing section that many colleges require. The SAT also will switch to the way the ACT grades tests. Only correct answers will be counted. The SAT has been subtracting points for wrong answers.

People have argued for years about the SAT. Some say school grades show more about how a student will do in college than test taking.

Some colleges do not make you take any exam. But many colleges could have a problem with the essay being cut. The University of California system is the largest customer of the SAT. University administrators fought for changes to the SAT 10 years ago. Adding the essay was one of the changes.

## SAT To Go Online

Stephen Handel works for the UC system. He said it was too soon to say whether UC will continue to require the essay.

Some people already do not like the change. They said making the essay optional sends a bad message. It might make students think that writing is not important.

The College Board will be making one thing harder. Test takers are allowed to use calculators on the math questions now. But starting in two years, they will not be able to use calculators on some of the math problems.

Another change will be that the SAT will start to be offered online. Right now it can only be taken on paper.
