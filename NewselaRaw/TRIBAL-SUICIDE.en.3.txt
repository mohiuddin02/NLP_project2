SEATTLE - Suicide haunts Indian Country. More native youth take their own lives than in any other population. And not only in Washington state. Nationally, too.

The state of Washington studied the number of native youth ages 10 to 24 who killed themselves. It found the rate was more than double that of any other ethnic group.

Tribes are fighting back.

Tribal leaders in the Lummi Nation started a youth suicide prevention program last year. The Colville, Spokane and Yakama tribes are using prevention grants and training through the Native Aspirations Program. The program has helped 65 tribes across the country combat suicide for the past five years.

Suicide is the second-biggest killer of native youth after accidents. Still, experts say there may be even more suicides than they are counting.

"The car accident, the gun death, the overdose, there are a lot of suicides that are not reported as such," said Victoria Wagner. She heads the Youth Suicide Prevention Program in Seattle. It works with schools and parent groups to teach the warning signs of suicide and ways to stop it.

The poverty and isolation that is common in Indian Country raise the risk of suicide. Making matters worse are the shortage of mental health services. Drug and alcohol addiction and family problems have an effect, too, Wagner said. "There is this feeling of being trapped, and having nowhere to go."

## Positives Over Negatives

Students at the Lummi Youth Academy gathered recently for a suicide prevention class. They were focusing on the positive.

"How do we make life less to do with pain, and more to do with beauty?" asked Shasta Cano-Martin. She heads the Academy. Two youth coaches led the kids in writing lists of things that built their self-esteem. They also asked the kids to name things that could lead to risky behavior.

"No support," offered one teenager. "Feeling like you don't belong," said another. "Abuse," said another. "Failure," came a tiny voice. She seemed too young to know the feeling, but clearly did.

But the kids were also quick with long lists of things that lead to self-worth and confidence. Succeeding on tests. Nailing a basket on the court. Hugs. Doing something nice for someone else. Beating drugs and alcohol. Having the urge to try, and succeeding beyond expectations.

## Familiar Struggles

Kyla Frajman, 21, said suicide was no stranger. "I thought about it a lot, but always fought my way through it," said Frajman. She is a member of the Cowichan First Nation in British Columbia. "I don't do it myself," she said of suicide, "because I don't want the younger kids to think it's allowed."

But she has a friend going through a rough patch. "When I don't hear from him, I worry about it."

Experts who track the problem of native youth suicide fear it will get worse. Back in Washington D.C., Congress is fighting over spending. The dispute has triggered automatic cuts to many agencies. Tribes will not get the same funding as usual. And mental health services were already hard for [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) to find.

Indian Health Services pays for health care services for tribes. Today it covers just over half of the needed care. Mental-health needs are going unmet, said Erin Bailey, director of the Center for Native American Youth.

The suicide rate among native youth nationally is 2-1/2 times that of any other youth population. "It is definitely a national problem, a national emergency," Bailey said. "This is weighing especially hard on our hearts at this time, with native communities facing cuts for native health care."

## Top Priority

Patricia Whitefoot directs Indian Education for the Toppenish School District. She said her students' parents said suicide prevention is a top priority. Native students took a wellness walk last Friday to focus on how their culture can play a positive role, she said.

It's just one step in what will have to be a longer journey, she said. "Teachers are so busy paying attention to test scores, how much time is there for addressing these major health issues in our community? And, as teachers, that has not been their training."

Vanessa Smartlowit is in the Yakama Nation's behavioral health department. She said the tribe is seeking to help its youth. They're trying everything from pep talks to dealing with bullying. Even simple things. Talking circles. Bead-working classes. Cultural activities. "Just something for them to learn and keep busy," she said, can help.

Suicide is a danger that has to be talked about, Wagner said. The topic is no longer off-limits. "You are not planting the idea," Wagner said. "It is already there."
