VATICAN CITY — Mother Teresa, the tiny nun who cared for the poorest of the poor, will be declared a saint next year.

The Catholic Church on Friday set no date for the canonization, the ceremony in which a person is made a saint.

For Catholics and some other Christian groups, a saint is a holy figure. He or she is someone who lived a good life that can be an example to others.

It is widely believed the ceremony will take place in the first week of September. The week marks the 19th anniversary of Mother Teresa's death. It also falls during what Pope Francis is calling his Holy Year of Mercy.

## A Miracle Attributed To Mother Teresa

"With her work, she was always the symbol of mercy, not just with words but with her actions," said the Reverend Sebastian Vazhakala. He is the superior general, or the head, of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.

The Catholic Church said Francis approved a decree attributing a miracle to Mother Teresa. He did this on Thursday, his 79th birthday.

The miracle was the cure of a Brazilian man. He was suffering from a brain infection, and by Dec. 9, 2008, he was dying.

## Man's Wife Prayed For Him

The Reverend Brian Kolodiejchuk is the priest who led the effort to make Mother Teresa a saint. He said Friday that 30 minutes after the man was due to have surgery, he sat up, awake and without pain. The surgery did not take place.

When the man sat up, the man's wife was in church praying alongside her pastor. The Catholic Church later said the man was cured because Mother Teresa performed a miracle.

"This is fantastic news. We are very happy," said Sunita Kumar, a spokeswoman for the Missionaries of Charity. The group is in the eastern city of Kolkata, in India, which was earlier called Calcutta, and was where Mother Teresa lived and worked.

## Meeting Needs Of The Poorest Of The Poor

Born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu on Aug. 26, 1910, in Skopje, Macedonia, Mother Teresa joined the Loreto order of nuns in 1928. In 1946, while traveling by train in India, she was inspired to found the Missionaries of Charity order.

The order began four years later. It has since opened more than 130 houses worldwide to provide comfort and care for the needy, sick and "poorest of the poor."

Mother Teresa won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work with Calcutta's poor and ill. She continued this work even after she herself became sick.

"The poor give us much more than we give them," Mother Teresa said in 1977. "They're such strong people, living day to day with no food. And they never curse, never complain."

She died on Sept. 5, 1997, at age 87.

## Mother Teresa Had Some Critics

At the time, her Missionaries of Charity order had nearly 4,000 nuns. It ran about 600 orphanages, soup kitchens, homeless shelters and medical clinics around the world.

While Mother Teresa is known and admired by many around the world, she was not beloved by all. She was criticized for the sometimes bad quality of care in her clinics. She was also criticized for taking donations from a Haitian dictator and an American banker who spent time in jail for financial crimes.

Pope Francis was an admirer. He is dedicated to caring for the poor just as Mother Teresa did. During his September 2014 visit to Albania, Francis said he was not only impressed by her courage and toughness, but in some ways he feared it.

## "The Best Christmas Gift"

As if to underscore his connection to Mother Teresa, Francis on Friday celebrated Mass at a Caritas charity soup kitchen in Rome. There, during the Catholic religious ceremony, he told homeless people and volunteers that their way is the path to heaven, not that of the wealthy or powerful.

Normally, it takes five years to start on the road to sainthood. Pope John Paul II, one of Mother Teresa's greatest champions, began the process a year after she died, convinced of her saintliness.

Thomas D'Souza is the Archbishop of Kolkata, the city's Catholic leader. He said the news of the Catholic Church's decision about Mother Teresa was "the best Christmas gift one can get."

"We are grateful to God and we are extremely happy," he said.
