King Richard III of England died in battle more than 500 years ago. On Thursday, his remains will be re-buried with great ceremony at Leicester Cathedral.

No one knew where the king's remains were until 2012, when his bones were discovered under a parking lot in Leicester.

## Killed In A Famous Battle

Richard III was slain in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth Field. His killing was described by the great playwright William Shakespeare in his play "Richard III."

In one of the play's most famous scenes, the cornered king senses he is in mortal danger. Seeking to escape his killers on horseback, he cries out, "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse."

Richard did not manage to get away and was killed by the soldiers of his rival, Henry Tudor.

His death was particularly cruel. His body was battered and pierced in many places, from his head to his hips.

## Arguments Won't Die

Richard's reburial in a new tomb in Leicester's cathedral will finally let him rest in peace and dignity. However, it will not end the arguments over what sort of ruler he really was.

Before he was king, Richard III was a loyal supporter of his brother, Edward IV. When Edward died, his 12-year-old son, Edward V, was expected to become king. However, Richard soon declared that the young boy was not the rightful king and took the throne instead.

Both Edward V and his young brother were kept at the Tower of London, the national prison. Later, both boys disappeared without explanation.

Many believe that Richard III murdered his two young nephews, to keep either from ever becoming king. The idea that he was a cruel murderer who stole the throne has lasted to this day.

## An Evil Monster?

Shakespeare played a big part in making the king's bad reputation permanent. The playwright presents Richard as a completely evil monster.

Richard III does have his defenders these days, though. They say there is no real proof that he was responsible for the deaths of the two princes, and that Edward V was too young to rule England. They also claim that Richard introduced important reforms during his two short years as king.

Phil Stone heads the Richard III Society, which is trying to overturn the king's bad reputation. Richard III's important achievements have been overlooked, he said. They have been "overshadowed by historical myths" and by Shakespeare's description of him as a complete monster.

## An Age Of Warlords

Whether or not Richard III murdered his nephews, he was most likely a hard and cruel man. Most powerful men in his time were. He was another warlord in an age of warlords.

In Richard III's world power was won on the battlefield, said Cardinal Vincent Nichols. It was grabbed and held on to by "force, at times with astonishing brutality."

Richard III was probably more like a character from "Game of Thrones" than the sort of king most would admire. His reburial will not change that, however grand it is.
