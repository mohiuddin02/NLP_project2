BERLIN â€” Where does Winnie-the-Pooh live?

If you said the Hundred Acre Wood, you are right. If you answered New York City, you are right too.

"Winnie-the-Pooh" is a book by A.A. Milne. It was written in 1926. In the stories, Pooh lives in a forest with his friends. Sometimes they are visited by their friend Christopher Robin.

Christopher Robin was a real boy. He grew up in England. He was A.A. Milne's son. Pooh and the others were real, too. They were the real Christopher Robin's stuffed animals.

Those stuffed animals are very old now. They are almost 100 years old. You can still see them. They live at the New York Public Library.

## Pooh Could Have Two Homes

Pooh's story is a long one.

A.A. Milne bought the bear for his son Christopher Robin in 1921. He wrote stories about Pooh and his friends. Winnie-the-Pooh became famous.

His son kept Pooh until 1947. Christopher Robin said he was too old for stuffed animals. He gave the bear to a friend in the United States. Pooh changed owners a few times. He finally ended up at the library in New York in 1987. He has been there ever since. He and his friends are in a special Children's Corner.

Some people think this is unfair. They think that Pooh should return to England. After all, that is where Pooh is from.

Some people even want to build a Winnie-the-Pooh museum. Pooh and the other animals could live there. It would be near the forest where the real-life Christopher Robin used to play with the stuffed animals.

Not everyone thinks this is a good idea. Some people think Pooh should stay in New York.

## Lots Of People Care About Pooh

Why are grown-ups arguing about a stuffed animal?

Well, grown-ups used to be kids, too. Many of them grew up with Pooh and love him. Maybe that is why they care about where the stuffed bear should be.

What do you think? Should Pooh stay in New York or go back to England?

Unfortunately, we cannot just ask Pooh where he wants to live. Unlike the Winnie-the-Pooh from the stories, this Pooh does not talk.
