SAN FRANCISCO â€” In 2011, a Nevada public elementary school decided that all students must wear a uniform. The unusual part of this uniform is the shirt. Written across it is the school's motto, "Tomorrow's Leaders." The words are above a drawing of the school mascot, a gopher.

One parent objected to the uniforms. Eventually, she sued. She claimed that the writing on the uniforms was against the First Amendment of the Constitution. That amendment protects the right to free speech, so people can say what they want. It also means they cannot be forced to say something they do not want to, in speech or writing.

In a ruling this Friday, three judges from a court agreed with her. They declared that the words "Tomorrow's Leaders" could harm students' right to free speech. The uniform should not be required, the judges said.

The school's uniform rule "compels speech," Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen wrote. That means it forces students to "say" something they may not agree with. They are not just being forced to wear a shirt. They are being made to support an idea: that their school is making "Tomorrow's Leaders."

## Ruling Affects Western States

The judges also objected to another action by the school. Some students do not have to wear the uniform. Students in national youth groups like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts are permitted to wear their own uniforms on meeting days.

The court called that unfair. It "favors the uniforms of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts over all other uniforms."

The lawsuit was filed against Roy Gomm Elementary School in Reno, Nevada. But the ruling doesn't just affect schools in Nevada. It also applies to those in California and other Western states.

Law professor Eugene Volokh represented the mother in court. Public schools are allowed to have dress codes, he said. But they cannot make people wear clothing with messages. It does not matter that those messages do not seem likely to upset anyone.

Different people are upset by different things, Volokh said. "You can't be compelled to become a moving billboard."

## "Our First Amendment Rights"

Volokh said the school motto could be seen as promoting the idea of becoming a leader. It could also suggest that "the school is producing leaders."

He said the school could still encourage students to wear the uniform. But they would have to permit clothing without the motto. And they would have to allow the uniforms of many groups, not just the Scouts.

Mary Frudden is the mother who filed the lawsuit. She is a lawyer herself. It is "important to protect our First Amendment rights," she said.

"I believe we should consider the best interest of every child," she said. Schools should encourage students to think for themselves. Kids must not be made to all think alike, she said. That would be bad for "our children and our society."
