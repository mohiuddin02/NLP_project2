CHICAGOâ€” There isn't much to see on East Garfield Boulevard. Many of the stores have gone out of business. The streets feel empty.

This neighborhood is not doing well. People who live there are hoping that will change. They hope that President Barack Obama will build his presidential library in their area.

Each president traditionally builds a presidential library after leaving the White House. It is more than a normal library. It is also like a museum.

A presidential library holds documents and souvenirs from a president's time in office. They are often built in a president's home town. They can become major tourist attractions.

## Chicago Connections

Obama was born in Hawaii, but many believe that he will build his library in Chicago. He and first lady Michelle Obama both lived and worked there. They have many connections to the city. Other possible sites include Hawaii and New York City.

The site of the library will be announced in early 2015.

Groups all over Chicago are hoping the library will be built near them. They believe it will bring culture and new businesses.

Chicago sociologist Carol Adams sees the library bringing many benefits to a poor neighborhood.

"Kids could just be passing by and stop in. They wouldn't have to wait on school trips, with a presidential library just down the street from where they live," she said.

But building the library in a poor neighborhood has risks, too. No presidential library has been built in a  low-income area before.

One expert on presidential libraries is reminding people to be careful.

"There could be a risk of crime, poverty or reputation," said Curt Smith. "You have to make sure you don't damage the library as a whole and end up not helping anyone."

## The Clinton Library

Presidential libraries have helped cities and neighborhoods before.

President Bill Clinton built his library in Little Rock, Ark.

The library helped to energize downtown Little Rock, said James "Skip" Rutherford. He is a friend of Clinton's who helped plan the library.

Choosing the right spot wasn't easy. At first, groups around the city suggested 40 possible sites. City officials chose five finalists.

Rutherford was part of a team who visited each site. They looked for many qualities.

They wanted a site that was easy to get to, with space for parking. They also wanted hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions nearby.

Clinton eventually chose an area of downtown Little Rock near the Arkansas River.

Rutherford said the site has helped spread wealth around the whole city.

The area now attracts more than 300,000 visitors a year. Aside from the library, it has other attractions such as museums and theaters.

## Students Study Sites

A good location is very important, said professor Marshall Brown. He teaches architecture, the study of building design. Brown said a presidential library can attract people, but it will do better it if has other interesting things around it.

Brown had his architecture students study the possible sites for the library in Chicago. He also asked them to design their own plans for the library.

Brown pointed to President John F. Kennedy's library in Boston as an example. That library sits by itself on a peninsula sticking out into a bay.

"The (Kennedy) library has attracted very little energy," Brown said.
