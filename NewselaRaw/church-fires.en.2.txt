Thousands of people are tweeting the same question. They want to know who is setting fire to black churches.

Six black churches in the South have burned over the last 10 days. The fires have stirred fears that racial violence against houses of worship is again on the rise. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150701_Church_fires.jpg" />

## Confederate Flag Worries

Many wonder if the fires may have been set because of criticism of the Confederate flag. Last month, a white supremacist, who thinks white people are superior to blacks, was charged with murdering nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.  The man was shown in a photo holding the flag, a symbol of the Confederacy that fought the Civil War to keep slavery in the American South.

The fires also set off an online army of activists who came together during the street protests in Ferguson, Missouri last summer. The protests began after a white police officer there killed an unarmed black teen.

This week, the activists have focused on church fires. Yet investigators say that so far, they have determined that only two of the six blazes were deliberately set. They say they have no evidence that the churches were targeted because the churchgoers were black. Also, the fires are not connected, said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is the government department looking into the fires.

## Is Black America Under Attack?

Fires happen often at churches, so the number of church fires may not be that unusual — but law enforcement officers are still taking a close look at each one.

"Fires aren't 'breaking out' at black churches. Black churches are being set on fire," one person tweeted.

"At what point are we allowed to say black America is under attack?" tweeted another.

"If the government watched the KKK as hard as they do #BlackLivesMatter, maybe we would know #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches," tweeted a third. The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is a white supremacist organization.

Each remark was retweeted hundreds of times.

Their concerns were backed by the NAACP's president, Cornell William Brooks. The NAACP stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and is a major black civil rights organization.

## Keeping Churchgoers Safe

"The spike in church burnings in Southern states over the past few days requires our" attention, he said.

After the deaths at the Charleston church, the church burnings must not be ignored, he said.

Brooks said the NAACP will work with local churches and police to make sure that churches and churchgoers are kept safe.

In the 1990s, a surge of church arsons — especially against black churches in the South — led to tougher arson laws. An arson is a fire that was set on purpose. The fires also led to a church arson investigation group made up of federal and local officials.

## Church Arson Task Force

The National Church Arson Task Force examined 827 arsons, bombings or attempted bombings at religious buildings between 1995 and 1999. It found that at least 269 involved black churches, with 185 of them being in the South.

That ugly time remained fresh in the mind of Greeleyville, South Carolina, Mayor Jessie Parker. On Wednesday, he visited the smoking remains of the city's Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church. A fire had destroyed the church the night before.

Twenty years ago, members of the Ku Klux Klan burned the church. Then-President Bill Clinton toured the church after it was rebuilt. He said, "We cannot let someone come into our democratic home, the home of our faith, and start torching our houses of worship."

## "All Those Old Memories"

On Wednesday, Parker urged patience as investigators worked to determine the cause of the fire. "It gives you an ill feeling," he told reporters. "It brought back all those old memories."

Church fires happen all the time, according to the National Fire Protection Association. The group said there were as many as five fires at churches or funeral homes each day across America in 2011, about half as many as in 1980.

Sometimes, the churches are old and not maintained well. Also steeples can be struck by lightning, and stoves can start fires if they are left on overnight.

In 2011, there were about five arsons a week at churches, including funeral homes, according to the fire protection association.

## Looking For Attention?

Most of the time, teenagers set the fires, which were small, said Marty Ahrens, who is with the fire protection association.

So are the recent black church fires a trend or are the news media just paying more attention?

"It's hard to know," Ahrens said, adding reporters may contribute to the problem.

"Right now, I am afraid that there is the potential for copycats," he said. "I understand that you need to tell stories and publicize news, but there is a type of individual that can be motivated by doing something that gets wide coverage."
