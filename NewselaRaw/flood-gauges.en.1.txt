WASHINGTON â€“ Spring is off to a deadly start in the Midwest, where floodwaters have killed at least four people and driven thousands from their homes.

Forecasters said that even more people could have died if it were not for a system of gauges that helps quickly track U.S. rivers that have spilled over their banks.

But that 8,000-gauge network, called the National Streamflow Information Program, may shrink due to paralysis in Congress.

As many as 375 gauges could shut down in the coming months, unless Congress passes a budget to undo major spending cuts. That's according to the U.S. Geological Research Survey (USGS), the agency that oversees the gauge network. The budget cuts that are threatening the gauges are known as sequestration.

## Devastating Results

The network is already shrinking. States and local governments help the federal government to pay for the gauges. But they have had to cut back on their contributions.

The stations each cost about $15,500 a year to keep running. But as [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) raises the chance of extreme droughts and floods, experts say shutting the stations could lead to disaster.

The USGS says 145 stations have recently been shut down. Florida had the most closures. Meanwhile funding has not been renewed for 508 other stations. Many of those are in the Northeast. The agency also does not expect to find funding for another 29. Those do not include gauges hit by sequestration.

The cutbacks could delay flood warnings and hurt the work of people who use the data for other things, like studying water quality and building dams or bridges.

"All of these gauges -- in one way or another  -- are used for the (protection) of life and property," said Michael Norris, the network's coordinator. "They're used for so many things, and the public doesn't even know what they are."

The need for water levels was brought up Tuesday at the U.S. Supreme Court, where Texas and Oklahoma are fighting over water in the Red River Basin. Attorney Lisa Blatt, for Oklahoma, said the lack of gauges in the basin makes it nearly impossible to tell how much water each state is drawing, and whether they are sticking to a four-state agreement.

## Life And Death

When it comes to flooding, emergency officials say the water level information can be a life-or-death matter.

When presidents declare disasters, three-fourths of the time it is because of a flood. In recent years, floods have caused billions of dollars of property damage. The deaths can be especially great in the case of flash floods, which are caused by sudden, heavy rains. That type of flood killed at least 26 people in May 2010 in Tennessee and Kentucky.

Warnings can save lives and money, studies by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Service (NOAA) have found. Just one hour's warning can reduce damage by 10 percent. Longer-term flood preparation, such as building levees, can save about $163 million each year.

"Data was absolutely critical" earlier this month when the Grand River's surge forced 1,700 people to flee their homes in Kent County, Michigan, said Mark Walton, manager of the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Grand Rapids. "Without it, we would have basically been flying blind," he said. Several forecasters and water experts repeated that phrase.

## Disaster Avoided

Though there was serious property damage, no injuries have been reported. Streamflow gauges were a big reason why, particularly in Grand Rapids, where the river peaked at a record height, he said. "If we would have had gauges go down there," he said, " ... that would have been catastrophic."

Last year, Michigan was at risk of losing several gauges. That included those near cities with a lot of people. But the USGS was able get enough local support to keep them running -- for now, at least. New York recently faced the threat of dozens of shutdowns, including many gauges in the Susquehanna River Basin, one area of the country most at risk of flooding. But after a strong push from Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, NOAA last month set aside $215,000 in disaster relief to keep some of them running.

Susan Obleski, of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, said she was glad the money came through, but it will only last four months. "For something that's as critical as stream gauges, that's not sustainable."

Norris, the network's coordinator, agreed. He said program-wide funding is needed, not a regional patchwork of last-minute efforts, because much of the nation's water system is interconnected. "The flows in New York are affected by what happens in Pennsylvania and Vermont," he said.

President Barack Obama has proposed increasing the program's budget about 25 percent. Though the proposed budget has a slim chance -- if any -- to wriggle through Congress, Norris takes it as a sign that politicians, even those trying to pinch pennies, see the value of the gauges. "It's a no-brainer," he said. "Like motherhood and apple pie."
