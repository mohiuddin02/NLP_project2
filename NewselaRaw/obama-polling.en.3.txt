WASHINGTON – The American public feels unusually bad about the direction of the country. They're increasingly fed up with how politicians in Washington can't get along and make decisions. That bad feeling can be seen in President Barack Obama's approval rating, which is at its lowest ever.

People gave elected officials unusually low grades, according to a new McClatchy-Marist survey. About a third rated them "D" and about another third gave them an "F."

"The lack of confidence in Washington to right itself is showing up," said Lee Miringoff. He is the head of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York, which worked on the survey.

## More Disapproval Than Ever Before

More than half the people said they don't like the job Obama is doing. It's his highest rate of disapproval since he became president.

The government is split into two parties – Democrats and Republicans. President Obama is a Democrat. Not surprisingly, three of every four other Democrats thought he's doing a good job. But nine of 10 Republicans did not like his work.

Congress is viewed even worse than Obama. Three out of four voters said they don't like the job the Republicans are doing, which is the highest since the question was first asked in April 2011.

People soured on Democrats in Congress, too. About six out of 10 people did not like the job they are dong. A lot more people said they don't like how both Republicans and Democrats are doing than the last time the survey was done, in July.

The key reason for the low ratings is how people are feeling about getting jobs and being able to pay their bills. Things are getting better, but people aren't feeling it yet.

## Is The Country Going In The Right Direction?

Democrats felt much better about how things are going. More than half thought the country is going in the right direction, but nine out of 10 Republicans said the country is moving the wrong way.

Obama got low marks for making sure that people have jobs and can afford what they need. More than half did not like how he's doing, while four out of 10 did. More people, though, blamed Republicans for the mess. Almost half said it's their fault while four out of 10 blamed Obama.

Obama suffered in two other areas where he had done well before. One is working with other countries and the other is whether people like him as a person.

Voters had mixed views about what all this will mean in next year's elections. Equal numbers said they would vote for a Republican or a Democratic candidate.
