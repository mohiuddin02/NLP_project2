WASHINGTON — Congress passed legislation Wednesday to avoid a threatened national default and end a 16-day partial government shutdown, concluding an epic political drama that placed the U.S. economy at risk.

The Senate approved the legislation in a bipartisan 81-18 vote and the Republican-controlled House followed with a 285-144 vote, clearing it for President Barack Obama's signature. The battle ended along the strict terms set by President Barack Obama when the twin crises began.

"We fought the good fight. We just didn't win," conceded House Speaker John Boehner as lawmakers lined up to vote on a bill that includes nothing for Republicans demanding to get rid of or scale back Obama's signature health care overhaul.

The legislation permits the Treasury to borrow normally through Feb. 7 or perhaps a month longer. It also funds the government through Jan. 15. More than 2 million federal workers — those who had remained on the job and those who had been furloughed — will be paid under the agreement.

## "The Brink Of Disaster"

"The compromise we reached will provide our economy with the stability it desperately needs," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. The nation "came to the brink of disaster" before sealing an agreement, he added.

After weeks of gridlock, the measure had support from the White House, most if not all Democrats in Congress and many Republicans fearful of the economic impact of a default.

Obama hailed the Senate's vote and looked forward to being able to sign the bill. "We'll begin reopening our government immediately and we can begin to lift this cloud of uncertainty from our businesses and the American people."

The agreement came a day before the deadline when Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the Treasury would reach the current $16.7 trillion debt limit. After that, it could no longer borrow to pay the country's bills.

Tea party-aligned lawmakers who triggered the shutdown that began on Oct. 1 said they would vote against the legislation. Significantly, though, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others agreed not to use the Senate's cumbersome 18th-century rules to slow the bill's progress.

In remarks on the Senate floor, Cruz said the measure was "a terrible deal" and criticized fellow Republicans for lining up behind it.

## Republicans Divided

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell negotiated the deal with Reid. He emphasized that it preserved a round of spending cuts negotiated two years ago with Obama and Democrats.

McConnell made no mention of the polls showing that the shutdown and flirtation with default have sent Republicans' public approval plummeting and have left the party badly split nationally as well as in his home state of Kentucky. He received a prompt reminder, though.

"When the stakes are highest Mitch McConnell can always be counted on to sell out conservatives," said Matt Bevin. He is challenging the party leader from the right in a 2014 election primary.

More broadly, national tea party groups and their allies underscored the internal divide. The Club for Growth urged lawmakers to vote against the congressional measure. It also said the vote would factor in the organization's decision when it decides which candidates to support in midterm elections next year.

"There are no significant changes to Obamacare, nothing on the other major entitlements that are racked with trillions in unfunded liabilities, and no meaningful spending cuts either. If this bill passes, Congress will kick the can down the road, yet again," the group said.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out in favor of the bill.

## Obamacare Demands Fall Flat

There was next to nothing in the agreement beyond authorization for the Treasury to resume borrowing and funding for the government to reopen.

House and Senate negotiators are to meet this fall to see if progress is possible on a broad deficit-reduction compromise.

Additionally, the government has to show it is capable of verifying the incomes of individuals who apply for federal subsidies under the health care law known as Obamacare.

Other issues fell by the wayside in a final deal.

The gradual withering of Republicans' Obamacare-related demands defined the arc of the struggle that has occupied virtually all of Congress' time for the past three weeks.

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Cruz and his tea party allies in the House demanded the defunding of the health care law as a trade for providing essential government funding.

Obama and Reid refused, then refused again and again as Boehner gradually scaled back Republican demands.

## Widespread Inconvenience From Shutdown

The shutdown initially idled about 800,000 workers. That soon fell to about 350,000 after Congress agreed to let furloughed Pentagon employees return to work. There was widespread inconvenience. But the mail was delivered, Medicare continued to pay doctors who treated seniors and there was no interruption in Social Security benefits.

Still, national parks were closed, government research scientists were sent home and Food and Drug Administration inspectors worked only sporadically.

Obama and Boehner both came to the same conclusion — that they would allow the shutdown to persist for two weeks, until it became politically possible to reopen government and address the threat of default at the same time.

As Republican polls sank, Boehner refused to let the House vote on legislation to reopen the entire government. He insisted on a piecemeal approach that the White House and Reid rejected as insufficient.

As the Oct. 17 debt-limit deadline approached, there were warnings from European officials as well as Cabinet members and bankers in this country that failure to raise the debt limit invited an economic disaster far worse than the near-meltdown of 2008.

On Tuesday, the Fitch credit rating agency said it was reviewing its AAA rating on U.S. government debt for possible downgrade because of the debt-limit crisis.
