WASHINGTON — On his first day of teaching Chinese in a Florida middle school, Xu Dou showed his students the old forms of Chinese characters. He wanted to show them how the writing has changed over the years.

"Most of the students love the language. They think the language is amazing," Xu said.

He said he'd explained to his class that Chinese characters were a central part of Chinese tradition. "I tell them if you want to learn real Chinese, you have to learn how to write Chinese characters."

That will take a lot of memorization and practice, but Xu's students already have a good start. Many began learning Chinese two years earlier as students at Wakeland Elementary School. Li Meng, another newly arrived teacher, is working there this year.

## Chinese Called An Essential Language For U.S.

Xu and Li are part of a group of 129 teachers from China in the largest Chinese guest-teacher program. It is supported by the College Board and the Confucius Institute Headquarters/Hanban, a public institution affiliated with China's Ministry of Education. Hanban promotes the study of Chinese language and culture.

Started in 2007, the Chinese guest-teacher program is in 30 states today. The largest concentrations are in Utah, North Carolina and Ohio, places with statewide Chinese programs.

U.S. government officials say Chinese is one of the languages that is essential for U.S. economic and strategic interests. But the federal government has stopped most of its spending on language classes in kindergarten through high school.

"Technically, the department has no specific funding for K-12 language instruction," Education Department spokesman Stephen Spector said. Most of the $63 million for international education this year goes to higher education programs, he said.

Last year, Congress eliminated grants under the Foreign Language Assistance Program. Elementary and secondary schools had used the grants to create or expand foreign language classes.

One in four elementary schools offered language classes in 2008. One one in three offered the classes in 1997. And a lack of foreign language instructors often prevents schools from hiring teachers, according to Education Secretary Arne Duncan.

## Teaching Chinese And Tai Chi

Xu and Li are fluent English speakers who learned the language in China, where all students learn English beginning in elementary school. This is their first trip to the United States.

Xu, 30, grew up, went to university and teaches high school English in north-central China. He plans to return there after the school year to rejoin his wife and 7-month-old son.

Li teaches 570 students, from kindergarteners to fifth-graders. Students see her once a week for class. The older ones have a Chinese club that learns tai chi exercises with her on Fridays.

Li, 31, has been teaching high school English for seven years in eastern China. She said she already liked Bradenton because it shared some similarities with Qingdao, her hometown. "I love sunshine, the beach and the sea," she said.

Farther north, the University of North Carolina's Center for International Understanding is in its fourth year of promoting the guest teacher program. China is North Carolina's No. 2 trading partner, and the state's exports to China are growing.

The center would like to switch to hiring teachers from the United States, but there is a shortage, spokeswoman Stephanie Caplan said.

The Chinese government pays $13,000 of each teacher's salary, said Matt Friedrick, the director of the center's K-12 education program. The government also pays for their travel.

"They're coming over here to help us out and to have a great experience, and learn a lot more about American education and how we teach," Friedrick said. "They learn a lot about North Carolina and go back with a whole new set of friends and experiences."

## U.S. Faces Shortage Of Language Teachers

Desa Dawson is the president of the National Council of State Supervisors for Languages. The Council helped interview and select the guest teachers. Dawson said there were "critical shortages of language teachers in all languages" everywhere in the United States.

School districts are giving up language programs because they can't find teachers, she said. As a result, it's difficult to say how many more language teachers are needed, because the classes are disappearing.

The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages says learning a language gives students many of the skills they'll need in life. These include practice in how to understand others and communicate ideas. Learning a language strengthens the ability to be at ease in unfamiliar situations and gives a better understanding of other cultural viewpoints.

The College Board is the not-for-profit organization that runs the SAT and AP tests. It helped start the Chinese guest-teacher program in 2007. That same year, it rolled out its AP program in Chinese language and culture, which is similar to second-year college-level Chinese. The guest teacher program helps prepare students who want to take the AP course.

The number of students who take the AP Chinese exam grew from 3,261 in 2007 to 9,357 in 2012.

But in language learning as a whole, the United States is far from filling the need, Dawson said.

"With all the emphasis on 21st-century skills with the globalization of the economy, with the world becoming smaller because of technology, we have so many opportunities out there, and I think we're behind — really, we're behind most nations — in teaching second languages," she said.
