Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee has entered the 2016 presidential race.

A favorite of conservative and evangelical Christian voters, Huckabee, 59, had many loyal supporters when he ran for president in 2008. But in this race, he likely faces more rivals, who are also stronger candidates. Through his Fox News show, Huckabee has remained in the public eye and in voters' living rooms. However, Huckabee has been out of elected office for more than eight years.

Huckabee announced his presidential bid in his boyhood home of Hope, Arkansas, on Tuesday. He is the sixth Republican candidate to officially enter the race. On Monday, Dr. Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina announced plans to seek the White House. They joined three Republican senators who previously declared their candidacies. These are Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida.

## It Costs Money To Campaign

Huckabee faces several obstacles. Among them are rivals who appeal to the same voters as Huckabee. These rivals also are proven fundraisers, a skill Huckabee lacked in the 2008 campaign, when he raised just $16 million. In contrast, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney had more than $100 million to spend.

"In 2007 and 2008, people gave him a pass for not being able to raise a lot of money because no one knew who he was. Now everyone knows who he is," Bob Vander Plaats said, speaking about Huckabee. In 2008, Vander Plaats served as Huckabee's Iowa co-chairman. Now, Vander Plaats does not know whom he will support. He also wondered whether Huckabee could raise enough money to run a successful campaign.

In 2008, Huckabee was not considered to be a serious White House candidate. He did better than many experts thought he would, partly due to the lack of serious competition.

However, now there are potentially nearly two dozen Republican candidates and the competition is more serious. Several of them are also popular with religious conservatives, including Cruz and Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin.

Several other possible candidates appeal to evangelical Christians. They include former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. Paul is also trying to get the support of religious voters.

## Shopping For A Candidate

Vander Plaats said that choosing a candidate is like shopping for a new car.

"People, just by nature, are kind of drawn to the new car smell," he said. Vander Plaats is the president of Family Leader, an Iowa-based Christian conservative group. "So people are going to want to take a test drive, kick the tires, and sit inside all the new cars, look at all the new candidates and see if that's the direction they want to go,"

Vander Plaats said that Huckabee hopes that his supporters will take a look at other candidates and then vote for him.

A poll released Monday, however, was not so certain. It showed that just over half of Republican voters said they could see themselves voting for Huckabee. Rubio, Walker and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush received far more support.

Huckabee's campaign sees Iowa and South Carolina as key states to winning the election. Both are dominated by evangelical voters and hold two of the first nominating contests in the nation. Immediately after announcing his presidential bid, Huckabee planned to travel to both states.

## Strengths Are On Display

Huckabee's greatest strength is his skill as a campaigner, and his roots as a Baptist preacher are clearly on display.

Among Huckabee's core supporters, the devotion remains.

"It's kind of like first love," said Craig Robinson, founder of the Iowa Republican website. "They're not the type of people who are trying to be wooed by some other campaign. They held out hope he would run in 2012. They're the kind of people who never even shopped the field because Mike Huckabee is their guy."

Huckabee connected with working-class voters by pointing to his poor upbringing well before this was popular with Republican candidates. He was the first male in his father's line to graduate from high school. He was also one generation removed on his mother's side from dirt floors and outdoor toilets.

## Partly On His Own Path

Some people complained that Huckabee does not always follow the Republican Party position. He was criticized for supporting some tax increases when he was governor. He supported the closure of the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which detains extremists suspected of waging war on the United States. He also changed his mind on supporting immigration and the ban against trading with Cuba.

His rivals are likely to bring up all of these issues.

"The field is so strong this time, it's going to be extremely difficult for Huckabee," said Sam Clovis. He a professor at Morningside College in Iowa and an influential conservative former radio host.
