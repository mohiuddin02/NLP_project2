The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3 Orion, one of the world's premiere research planes, was there to study how lower sea ice levels could affect the weather.

The flights revealed critical information that might explain why an increasing number of tropical storms seem to be taking irregular paths.

Nick Bond, a scientist at the University of Washington, was a passenger on the plane during its first Arctic mission.

Flying out of Alaska, Bond and other scientists studied polar ice formations in the Arctic seas, at times flying well north of the Arctic Circle.

"While we couldn't have spit on the North Pole, it wasn't that far away," Bond said.

## Heat Released As Ice Builds Up

Scientists like Bond are trying to determine how much heat is released into the atmosphere when Arctic ice builds up in autumn.

Bond said the faster the Arctic ice builds up, the more heat is released into the atmosphere.

"We could see and feel the tremendous amount of heat coming out of the ocean," Bond said. "That's what it takes to make ice, to lose heat like crazy."

That heat release is believed to shift the jet stream to the south. A jet stream is a fast-moving, high altitude river of air.

Shifting the jet stream south might be causing some serious weather changes. Scientists think the movement to the south might be slowing down or even stalling tropical systems before they can head east and out to sea.

Kevin Wood works at the University of Washington too. He's a research scientist, who was also aboard the plane. He said the Arctic heat release might trigger other extreme weather such as flooding or severe snowstorms.

"That's far from proven," he said. "But it's one of things we're interested in understanding better."

## Storms Heading North, Not East

Primarily, however, scientists hope the variety of sensors on board the WP-3 Orion might help them understand why Superstorm Sandy plowed into the U.S. East Coast last year. And why eight other storm systems headed toward Canada or the U.S. Northeast in the past three years.

"The very unusual path that Sandy took last year was definitely due to disruptions in the global circulation, and maybe that was related to changes in the Arctic," said Bond.

In October 2012, Sandy emerged in the Caribbean as a tropical storm. It then grew into a hurricane. Initially, Sandy began to curve northeast on a path that would have taken it toward the North Atlantic.

But instead, Sandy curved northwest toward the New Jersey coastline and collided with a winter system. It then swamped much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with a powerful storm surge, even though it had been downgraded to a post-tropical system just before landfall.

Some other hurricanes aimed north instead of heading east in recent years. Earl hit Nova Scotia, Canada, and Igor brushed Newfoundland, Canada, both in September 2010. Irene hit the Northeast as a tropical storm in August 2011. Ophelia hit Newfoundland as a tropical storm in October 2011.

In addition to boosting the understanding of hurricane paths, the heat release study provided insight on why polar ice is melting faster, a primary reason for sea level rise and a critical issue in low-lying Florida.

## "Weather Station On Steroids"

Equipped with more sensors than a fleet of satellites, the NOAA aircraft collected a wide range of data from sea ice thickness to solar heating. Much as they do when investigating tropical storms, scientists dropped probes out of the plane to better understand the atmosphere. The devices measure temperature, wind direction and barometric pressure.

Scientists praised the WP-3 Orion's versatility.

"You can liken it to a weather station on steroids; you can take it anywhere," Bond said. "It allows unique measurements that you can't get any other way."

One reason the plane, normally based at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., made the Arctic trip was because the hurricane season in the Atlantic had been remarkably slow. The scientists hope next year's season will be as calm so they can hop another flight over the Arctic.

"We know we obtained data that was unique and important," Bond said. "We're greedy, and we want more."
