PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti â€” College Catts Pressoir is known as one of the best schools in Haiti. The Caribbean country has suffered disasters and poverty. Most schools don't have experienced teachers.

But Catts Pressoir is known for its science classes and well-trained teachers. Students fixed traffic lights in science class a few years ago. Another class made a security camera for the police.

Now the principal is a finalist for a prize for the world's best teacher. Guy Etienne is also the school's chemistry teacher. He beat thousands of teachers from 127 countries to become one of 10 finalists. He could win $1 million.

Difficulties can inspire students, Etienne said. He wants to teach them to solve problems and not say they can't because it is hard.

## Bringing Honor To Haiti

Etienne said being a finalist for the prize is a big honor for him and the country. It makes him proud that other Haitians identify with his place in the top 10. He said a lot of parents did not agree with him over the years, but they do now. This keeps him going, he said.

Etienne has won many prizes for his teaching in the past few years.

## LEGO And A Love Of Learning

Soon, he will pick up another prize. The LEGO Foundation named Catts Pressoir one of 10 winners in a learning challenge. The prize honors the school for making the community better.

Haiti's education minister, Nesmy Manigat, called Etienne a role model. Manigat is trying to fix Haiti's schools by improving the courses offered and the way the material is taught. Half the students who were graduating last year failed their final exams.

Manigat said he wished other teachers would follow Etienne's example. He picked Etienne to join a group working on new class plans.

## He Lives To Teach

When he isn't teaching, Etienne is in his office. It is on the second floor, looking over the basketball court. His walls are decorated with awards and students' photos.

Etienne said it has always been his dream to make Haiti famous with his teaching. He could have made more money working as an engineer. But Etienne says teaching is his life.

## Science Lessons To Help Haiti

It hasn't always been easy. Many parents were against the changes Etienne made when he became principal. The schools then were teaching the history of Haiti and grammar. Students learned by memorizing and repeating facts.

Etienne changed the lessons to teach more science. Everything students learn now applies to helping communities in Haiti. Etienne said he did not want to teach children subjects they could not use.

Today, parents like the school's modern ways and small class sizes. Classes have 20 to 39 students. The school admits only 700 students. It is as good as an American or French school, Haitian writer Gary Victor said, as he dropped off his children.

## Putting Students First

It's hard to keep the school open. Etienne said it has to keep borrowing money. Students in chemistry class share books. The shelves are full of worn books with pages that are falling apart. The school's third floor is missing since an earthquake hit the country in 2010.

Etienne wants to use the prize money to help more students take online classes at the school. He hopes to buy a tablet personal computer for each student. But the money is not important, he said.

"The money comes in and it must go out so that we can improve the education we are giving the students."
