OROSI, Calif. —  For a 17-year-old, Emilio Isazaga has already gone through many struggles. His mother was forced to leave the United States because she had come to the country illegally so he lives with his grandmother and younger sister. He recently broke the law and is now under tight  supervision. Emilio says he hopes education will help him "out of the struggle" so he and his family can lead better lives.

Emilio takes part in an after-school program called Tech Connect in Orosi. He learns how to repair computers and do community service. He also learns how to help people pay their taxes. 

For many, the class is a chance at a brighter future. Every high school senior in Tech Connect has gone on to college. It's a very good success rate. According to a 2013 survey, more than half of the adults living in Orosi and the nearby town of Cutler did not finish high school.

## Creating Equal Opportunities

Miguel Castañeda started Tech Connect in 2009. It was inspired by a similar program in San Francisco. Castañeda grew up in the rural community of Delano, California. He believes students who live out in the country should have the same opportunities as those in wealthier areas.

"It's hard out here," he says of Cutler-Orosi. Many people in the region get paid very little to work as laborers on farms, and there are many gangs.

More than 100 high school students usually sign up for 30 spaces in his yearlong Tech Connect class. Castañeda doesn't always pick students with the best grades. He looks for students who really want, and need, to learn.

## Staying Out Of The Sirens

Emilio is one of those young people. Even with his troubles, Emilio graduated from high school two years early at age 16. One of the reasons Emilio loves Tech Connect is that Castañeda has become like a father to him.

Not long ago, Emilio sat in his classroom. Sirens screamed in the distance outside.

"Right now, it's helping me stay out of those sirens, right? It will help me build some character, help out my people, you know? I feel like it's a good choice, to help out."

## A Great Leader

Tech Connect students are required to do community service. They clean up graffiti around town, feed the homeless and teach adults how to use computers. Soon, students will once again volunteer helping poor people figure out how to pay their taxes. Each year, all of Castañeda's students have earned their certificates in tax preparation.

Castañeda also takes students on field trips to colleges and offers tutoring. He helps them find jobs in the community, too.

Adylene Saucedo, 15, says Castañeda is a great leader. "He will do whatever he can to help you out."

Elizabeth Gonzalez writes grants asking the government for money to help pay for the program. Not long ago, she watched Castañeda teach students about computer parts. "This subject could be really boring, but as you can see, the kids are really engaged," she said. 

## Moving Beyond A Rough Past

Many of Emilio's classmates agree that Castañeda is a great role model. 

"My family is so unstable right now," says Sara Rabadan, 17. "He doesn't give up on people. He literally told us ... he's not going to give up – even if we put up the struggles. That's nice 'cuz there are parents that give up on you, ya know."

Castañeda had a rough past and grew up around bad people. Still, he found a way to help himself and others succeed, says Christian Salacup, 15. "He teaches us to help your community, help other people," Salacup said.

Emilio says he will likely attend a community college, then transfer to a four-year college. He said he believes the skills he's learned through Tech Connect will help him.

"Hopefully I get to get out of my struggle too, ya know, and will learn a little something along the way. And do some good for a change, right?"
