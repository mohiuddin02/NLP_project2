COMBINED LOCKS, Wis. — Glen Martin's pumpkins are huge. Gigantic even.

It's almost Halloween, so he put a couple of his pumpkins in his front yard. Strangers drive by and stare at them.

Martin's pumpkins weigh more than 1,700 pounds each.

Martin is president of Wisconsin Giant Pumpkin Growers. His group shares seeds and tips on growing the huge fruit. They have contests to see who can grow the biggest one.

Growing a giant pumpkin is like raising a cow, Martin said. Wisconsin is famous for raising milk cows.

"It's like taking care of a calf — you have to take care of it every day," Martin said.

## Let's Start A Pumpkin Club

The pumpkin growers group began 20 years ago. It started with just 14 members. It began with a couple of guys bragging. Each thought they could grow the biggest pumpkin.

Now the group has 120 members.

Growing a huge pumpkin "is not a simple thing," said Irwin Goldman. He is a professor. He studies the science of growing plants. Goldman has also tried growing giant pumpkins. His only get to be 400 pounds.

Growing a giant pumpkin begins with a seed. Growers want seeds from only the biggest pumpkins. Many growers trade or share their seeds.

Pumpkin growing season starts in April. The seeds are planted in small pots. They grow indoors for two weeks. Then they are put into the ground.

## Watch It Grow

Pumpkin plants grow fast. A pumpkin vine can grow 6 inches in one day. In one hour, a giant pumpkin can grow 2 pounds.

Pumpkin growers remove all the flowers but one from a vine. They want to make sure it only makes one big pumpkin, not many little ones. They also give the plants a lot of water and fertilizer.

Just about every year, a new record is set for the biggest pumpkin. This year, a man from Switzerland set it. His pumpkin weighed 2,096 pounds.

Scientists wanted to know why pumpkins kept getting bigger each year.

## Amazing, Giant Pumpkins

One reason is the seeds. Choosing seeds from the biggest pumpkins leads to even larger pumpkins.

They also found that Wisconsin is perfect for growing pumpkins. It has many lakes and is very wet.

Growing the biggest pumpkin can be a big deal. Growers win prize money and get to brag about it. But they say that is not why they do it.

They love to see the looks on people's faces when they see a giant pumpkin. Eyes open wide. Mouths drop open.

"People think it's just absolutely amazing," Chris Stevens said. He grows big pumpkins too.
