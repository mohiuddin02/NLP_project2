Lawrence Peter "Yogi" Berra, the Baseball Hall of Fame catcher, died Tuesday of natural causes at the age of 90.

He was known by many for such malaprops as "90 percent of the game is half-mental." Or, in referring to a once-popular restaurant, he said, "Nobody goes there any more. It's too crowded."

But some of the "Yogi-isms" continue to ring true, like "It ain't over till it's over."

## A Championship Ring For Every Finger

What should not be overshadowed, though, is that Berra had a World Series ring for every finger. He played in 14 World Series, including a record 10 world championship teams with the New York Yankees. He was a team manager in two other World Series, one each with the Yankees and the New York Mets.

Berra, who had 358 regular-season home runs, hit 12 homers in 14 World Series. But the most famous image of him was in a World Series when he jumped into the arms of pitcher Don Larsen after Larsen had pitched the only World Series perfect game in 1956, with Berra catching.

As a player, coach and manager, Berra was in 21 World Series. He played in 15 consecutive All-Star Games. A three-time American League Most Valuable Player, Berra's playing career spanned 1946 to 1965, and he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972.

## The Nickname Stuck

Yogi grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, in what was then and continues to be a primarily Italian neighborhood. His parents were Italian immigrants Pietro and Paolina Berra, with his father arriving at Ellis Island, the famous New York immigration port, in 1909. He knew nothing about baseball, but would later find out, of course.

Across the street from the Berras lived Joe Garagiola, another future major league catcher. Garagiola played in his first World Series at age 20 for the 1946 World Series champion Cardinals. Both Berra and Garagiola had attended South Side Catholic school, although Berra quit school after the eighth grade.

As Berra starred in American Legion baseball in St. Louis, he received his nickname from friend Bobby Hofman, another future big leaguer. Hofman said Berra resembled a Hindu yogi, a holy man, whenever he sat with arms and legs crossed waiting to bat or while looking sad after a defeat.

In 1942, the Cardinals chose to sign Garagiola over Berra. Cardinals General Manager Branch Rickey, knowing he would soon leave St. Louis to take over the Brooklyn Dodgers, held off, wanting to sign Berra for the Dodgers. The Yankees, however, signed Berra for the same $500 bonus the Cardinals offered Garagiola. The Yankees sent Berra to Norfolk of the Class B Piedmont League in the minors and Berra was credited with driving in 23 runs during one doubleheader game.

## The Catcher Also Plays The Field

During World War II, Berra joined the U.S. Navy and served as a gunner's mate on the USS Bayfield during the D-Day invasion of Europe.

Berra began playing for the Yankees in 1947 and soon established himself as one of the best "bad-ball hitters" in the game. When asked about that style, Berra reportedly said, "If I can hit it, it's a good pitch."

As a catcher, Berra was quick, mobile and a respected handler of pitchers, but he was versatile enough to play left field in his later years.

After managing the Yankees to the 1964 American League pennant win, Berra was fired when the Yankees lost that year's World Series to the Cardinals. Berra made a brief return to the field as a player-coach for the Mets the next year, taking his last turn at bat on May 9, 1965, when he was three days shy of his 40th birthday.

He would coach with the Mets for eight seasons before becoming their manager in 1972. That was the same year Berra not only was elected to the Hall of Fame but had his number 8 retired.

In 1973, the Mets were in last place midway through the season but when a reporter asked Berra if the season was over, he replied, "It ain't over till it's over."

## "Yogi-isms" Endure

Berra certainly had a way with words. Among his other Yogi-isms was: "If you come to a fork in the road, take it." Another time, he said, "We made too many wrong mistakes."

Berra was fired in 1975, only to return to the Yankees as a coach in 1976. The team immediately won three straight pennants and the 1977-78 World Series, reinforcing Berra's reputation as a lucky charm.

Longtime Yankees manager Casey Stengel once said of Berra: "He'd fall in a sewer and come up with a gold watch."

Berra was named Yankees manager again in 1984 but was fired early in the 1985 season. He ended his career as a coach with the Houston Astros.

## Signed Simply, Yogi Berra

Berra's son, Dale, played in the majors and son, Tim, played with the Baltimore Colts in the National Football League. He was married for 65 years to wife Carmen, who was also from St. Louis. She died in 2014.

They met when Carmen, a waitress, served Yogi lunch and he asked her name and whether she was married. Their first date was at a hockey game in St. Louis. Not long after, Berra proposed marriage by placing a ring on the table in front of Carmen while they dined at the Berra family home.

In an interview some years, Carmen Berra recalled how her husband once sent her an anniversary card signed, "Yogi Berra."

Carmen Berra told the Daily News she was happy he signed it that way because it eliminated any confusion about all the other Yogis that she knew.

Berra, who died at his home in Montclair, New Jersey, once was asked by Carmen where he wanted to be buried â€” in St. Louis, New York or Montclair.

"I don't know," he said. And then, as only he could say, "Why don't you surprise me?"
