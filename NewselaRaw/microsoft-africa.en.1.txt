SEATTLE, Wash. — Anand Mariappan is a software guru who works at Microsoft. He spends his days at work building data-analysis tools largely designed for people like him — office workers accustomed to high-resolution computer monitors, lightning-quick Internet and the creature comforts of a modern office park.

But in January, the 31-year-old software developer spent three weeks doing his best to help a different kind of client: startups trying to launch in Kampala, Uganda.

In Africa, his priorities and focus as an engineer shifted. Things like optimizing an app's layout for the iPhone did not have quite the same importance as making sure software could simply function. Internet regularly cuts out in Africa which poses a new challenge for people working in technology.

## Changing Priorities With Design

"Here, you have so many resources. Engineering talent, easily available Internet," Mariappan said. "In developed countries, you don't consider some of those factors."

Mariappan's trip to Africa was part of Microsoft's 2-year-old $75 million MySkills4Afrika initiative. The program has sent about 400 Microsoft employees to the country for two- to three-week stints, where they work closely with customers around Africa countries to share their particular skills, from software development to marketing.

The initiative serves a few different purposes and is part business-development effort, part workforce-leadership training and part public relations. Microsoft advertises it as a program designed to bolster the technological capacity of companies and government agencies in Africa. It also improves Microsoft's reputation and expands the network of the company's clients.

"It's not philanthropy, it is not a charity," said Fernando de Sousa, Microsoft's human resources chief for the Middle East and Africa and the program's founding manager. "We're investing in the continent in order to enable economic development."

## Thinking Differently About Africa

Microsoft's investment in Africa started in South Africa, long considered the continent's largest and most industrialized economy. Microsoft is among the many U.S. companies that target work in South Africa. In fact, the company was among the first U.S. businesses to return to doing work in South Africa after Congress eased strict trade regulations amid signs of a thaw in the enforced racial abuse of apartheid.

De Sousa joined Microsoft in South Africa in 1992 and he was on the team that in 2005 put together a development strategy for the continent. The strategy focused on how technology could help fulfill the United Nations' development goals for Africa. In 2013, Microsoft announced the three-year MySkills4Afrika initiative, committing what de Sousa said is the largest development investment anywhere outside of China.

"In the background there was the understanding that we needed to think about Africa in a different way," said de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique.

Like most major international outreach programs, the initiative has not been without its flops. The major investment of its early days, a push to increase adoption of a low-cost, Windows-powered smartphone, "did not do so well," according to Winnie Karanu, a program manager with Microsoft in Kenya. To make matters more challenging, the smartphone project happened at the same time Microsoft realized that globally it held a tiny fraction of the smartphone market amid fierce competition from Google and Apple.

## Learning While Teaching

But that is not the say there have not been important wins for the company in Africa. More successful than the phones, Karanu says, were training programs, internships for youth, a pilot program to use television white space to broaden the reach of the Internet, and the MySkills4Afrika program.

Mariappan's work in Uganda centered on sharing his insight on Power BI, which is Microsoft's relatively new data analytics tool. He spent time teaching companies how to harness the power of sales data involving farm goods and helped a startup company build mobile-payment tools.

"My goal was to teach," he said. "But I learned a lot."

Eileen Chou, a manager in Microsoft's information technology support group, had the opportunity to participate in the program too. During her time, she spent three weeks in Kenya last October working alongside a few other Microsoft employees to train the Kenya Red Cross' IT department. Their focus was on improving the methods in which employees work and helping them become familiar with Microsoft software which can make their daily work more effective.

"We all kind of came to a realization that the core issues are very much the same," she said. "You always feel like you never have enough people to do everything; you always wear multiple hats."

Chou added, "We all would do it again in a heartbeat."
