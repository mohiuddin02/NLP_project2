For years, chocolate lovers have taken comfort in a pleasing fact: Chocolate can be good for you. It's long been known that bittersweet dark chocolate improves cardiovascular health. The tasty treat helps the heart and blood vessels.

However, scientists have been unsure just why this is so. Until now, that is.

On Tuesday, scientists announced that they had solved the chocolate mystery: It seems that certain chocolate-loving microbes in the gut are responsible. They turn an otherwise indigestible part of the candy into something useful: anti-inflammatory compounds — that is, mixtures that bring down swelling.

Scientists started by setting up a series of test tubes. The idea was to copy what goes on in the human gut. The gut is known by scientists as the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Essentially, it is a long tube that starts at the mouth, feeds into the stomach, and ends at the anus.

## "Down The GI Tract"

In the test tubes, the scientists mixed cocoa powder with digestive juices and enzymes. These are what the body uses to break down food. They then exposed the powder to bacteria found in human feces.

The scientists observed something interesting after the cocoa was "digested." Long molecules called polyphenolic polymers remained within the gut. A molecule is the smallest unit or part of any substance.

The polyphenolic polymer molecules are too large to cross the walls of the gut, says scientist John Finley. Thus they can't be absorbed into the rest of the body as nutrients. Nutrients provide nourishment and food for the body. They are what keeps our body's motor running.

Polyphenolic polymer molecules didn't seem to be of much use at first. They "do nothing for us except travel down the GI tract," Finley said.

That is, until they run into some of the many microbes that inhabit the human colon: in particular, Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria. The colon is the main part of the intestine, which in turn is part of the GI tract. The intestine runs from the bottom end of the stomach to the anus.

## Chocolate-Loving Microbes

"These little guys say, 'Hey — there's something in there that I can use,' and they start to break it down," Finley said.

The smaller molecules that result from this breaking down can travel through the gut wall. Once they leave the gut, they can be used by the body.

"These materials are anti-inflammatory," Finley said. That is, they bring down inflammation, or pain and swelling, inside the body. This helps prevent "some forms of cardiovascular disease" caused by inflammation. In other words, by reducing swelling they lower the risk of various heart diseases.

A number of past studies suggest that dark chocolate can cause blood vessels to widen. That in turn lowers blood pressure, as blood is able to flow more easily. High blood pressure can be dangerous: It leads to heart attacks and other serious health problems. White chocolate and milk chocolate don't provide this benefit, only dark chocolate. Dark chocolate has more cocoa in it, so it's more powerful.

It has been unclear exactly why this blood-vessel widening happens. Scientists, however, have focused on two kinds of flavanols, which are found in plants and are considered healthy.

Finley said these flavanols were among those that were at first poorly digested. Like the polyphenolic polymers, they were eventually broken down by gut microbes. The other main part of the cocoa that was broken down was dietary fiber. It makes up almost one-third of cocoa powder.

## Cocoa Pill From Mars

Finley said that the amount of cocoa powder needed to produce healthful effects was relatively small: about two tablespoons a day.

There is a problem with dark chocolate, though, Finley said: the amount of sugar and fat that chocolate candy contains. He said a healthy alternative to candy is putting cocoa powder on oatmeal, as he does.

Finley said that the healthful stuff in cocoa powder might one day be put into pills. He noted that Mars Inc. is interested in doing just that. Mars is the company that makes M&amp;M candy.

But he said he wasn't very excited by the idea of taking a pill.

"I would rather eat a big old chocolate cookie," he said.
