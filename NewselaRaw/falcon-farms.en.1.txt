Veteran farmer Mark Flamm has declared war on birds. To scare away the annoying creatures snacking on his blueberry bushes, he has blasted recordings of bird distress calls, fired noisy "bird bangers," and ordered an employee to shake a bottle of gravel at the sky.

He even went the traditional route and planted a scarecrow.

"That didn't work," said Flamm, who once lost a fifth of his berries to his feathered foes, "though I got a picture of a bird sitting on the scarecrow."

That's when Flamm, whose farm is in central Washington state, called in the falcons.

## These Falcons "Stoop" To Terrify

Starting three years ago, Flamm hired master falconer Vale Alaverdian to drive off the flocks of sparrows and starlings growing fat off Flamm's fields. Traditionally a blood sport for the rich, falconry has found a second life in the world of bird control.

Alaverdian of Falcon Force (http://falconforce.com), based in La Crescenta, Calif., uses a hunting technique possibly dating back to the Bronze Age. He launches his raptors into a series of high-speed dives, called "stooping," that are meant to make the birds think they are under attack. Looking like an aeronautical war dance, the falcons terrify the birds. The birds are either paralyzed with fear or flee to new surroundings.

The falcons are trained to scare, not snack on, their targets.

"It's amazing. Suddenly all the other birds go quiet because they know they could be eaten," said Flamm, whose crop loss from birds has dwindled down to around 3 percent.

In the age-old face-off between man and bird, falconry has presented a new way to tip the scales in the farmer's favor.

Modern farming has embraced technology to resist disease, conserve water and conjure a whole menu of hybrid fruit. Yet when it comes to marauding birds, growers have few solutions short of peppering the skies with shotgun blasts.

## Bells, Canons And Firecrackers ...

"There's not much we can do," said Joe MacIlvaine, president of Paramount Farming Co. in Bakersfield, Calif., the world's largest almond and pistachio grower and processor.

A strawberry farmer's imperfect solution is to ride his bicycle near the crops, sounding its bell. Other farmers fire timed canons and firecrackers that can make a peaceful country morning sound like a war zone.

Specialty fruit and vegetable grower Alex Weiser has an employee drive up and down the fields shooing away birds like a tractor-driving scarecrow.

Recently, Weiser tried a device that he has dubbed the "evil eye," specially made inflatable yellow balloons with reflective silver patches. Hung on the end of a branch, they are meant to spook birds in mid-flight.

Despite all that, firing a flare gun at the airborne offenders seems to work the best, he said.

"Not too popular with the neighbors," Weiser said.

## ... But Birds Still Peck Away

Although weather and water are still a farmer's chief concerns, avian pests are a formidable challenge. Birds raise the risk of contaminated food and cost growers hundreds of millions a year in damaged crops.

Recent research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that birds peck $49 million away from California's wine-grape industry each harvest, $12.3 million from the state's sweet-cherry growers and $2.6 million from blueberry farms.

Birds prefer sugary fruit, just like humans, one reason that tart cherries in Washington state suffered only $1.8 million in losses.

"Birds are a serious problem because they tend to like the crops that are expensive," said Stephanie Shwiff. One of of the study's authors, she works as a researcher at the USDA's National Wildlife Research Center in Fort Collins, Colo.

Alaverdian demonstrated his falcons on a recent summer morning at a vineyard in Los Alamos.

## Genghis Protects A Vineyard

Alaverdian released Genghis, one of four falcons perched patiently in the back of his car. The 4-year-old peregrine circled over the grapes, gained altitude and then swooped with astonishing force toward his handler.

Genghis was lured by pigeon feathers tethered to the end of a rope that Alaverdian twirled with precision. Each time the falcon got close, Alaverdian pulled back the lure.

"This whole process is devastating from the prey's point of view," said Alaverdian, 39. He sent Genghis up several times until a couple dozen magpies vanished over a hill. Genghis was rewarded for his work with a bloody pigeon carcass pulled out of a Ziploc bag, which was stored in the cup holder of his SUV.

Alaverdian's $700 a day rate is a bargain compared to covering the plants with netting, which can cost $400 an acre. On a large farm, that netting could add up to $400,000. But it might take weeks or even months for Alaverdian to take care of the problem.

Although the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said falconry is growing in popularity, there aren't enough certified master falconers like Alaverdian.

Still, not just anyone can pick up the craft. The life of a falconer can be grueling.

## The Lonely Life Of A Falconer

Alaverdian, whose Armenian family fled war-torn Iran in the 1980s, said the job requires a comfort with ruggedness and spending long periods of time alone. He spends months without a break on a single vineyard or farm.

Alaverdian hasn't bought commercial meat in 14 years. He eats salmon, trout, elk and deer he catches in the wild. He is so engrossed with his work that he can't help but flinch when he sees a flock of birds even when he's driving back to his motel.

"When I was in Washington, I was asked why I didn't go to church," said Alaverdian. "I said, 'Unless the starlings go to church too, I'm not going either.'"
