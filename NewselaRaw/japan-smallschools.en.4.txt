"It's a little bit lonely," said Taiki Kato. He is 11 years old. He cannot wait to go to middle school next year. The school is a little bigger. He hopes to meet new kids.

Aone is a very small town. Only 638 people live there. There are two small stores and one restaurant.

There are many towns like Aone in Japan. Japan is a country in Asia.

## In A Small Town

People have been moving away from small towns. They are going to Tokyo. Tokyo is Japan's capital city. Life is more exciting there. It is also easier to find a job.

The schools in Tokyo are full. Many schools in small towns are almost empty. They do not have enough students.

Japan's government would like to close them.

It costs a lot of money to keep these tiny schools open. Money is not the only problem. The kids see the same students all the time. They may not know how to make friends with new kids.

There are other bad things about tiny schools. In Aone, there are not enough students to fill a class. Teachers must teach different grades at the same time. There are not enough kids to have a soccer team.

## In The Gym

There are good things also. No student falls behind in school. Teachers make sure each kid learns.

On a school day in Aone, the six students planted potato seeds. Then they ate lunch. They had fish, rice and soup with vegetables. Next, they picked mushrooms in the forest. Then they exercised in the gym.

Chiharu Yamaguchi is the mother of the only two girls in the school. She moved to Aone nine years ago. She was worried that the school was too small.

Soon she got to know the school and the parents and the teachers. Now she is not worried anymore.
