LOS ANGELES — A plane made to take paying customers to the edge of space and back crashed Friday during testing. One test pilot was killed and another was injured.

The space plane was called SpaceShipTwo, which is a project of Virgin Galactic. The company is an ambitious space business started by a British billionaire named Richard Branson.

"Space is hard and today was a tough day," said George Whitesides, the CEO of Virgin Galactic.

Two pilots were aboard SpaceShipTwo. A California Highway Patrol spokesman said two people were found near the crash site in the desert north of California City and east of Mojave. One of the pilots had used a parachute to escape the aircraft. Another was found at the site, according to the California Highway Patrol.

## World's First Space Liner

The WhiteKnightTwo aircraft, which carries the SpaceShipTwo, landed safely. U.S. transportation investigators were on their way to the site, which the Kern County sheriff's office said was spread over a 2- to 3-mile area.

Virgin Galactic has been working for almost 10 years to create the world's first space liner owned by a private business. The idea was to make several trips a day. Virgin would carry paying customers into space for a brief journey.

Friday's test was its first rocket-powered test flight in nine months. A company called Scaled Composites helped to organize the test flight. Scaled Composites' CEO said the flight was using a new fuel type that had been tested on the ground.

In January, SpaceShipTwo reached 71,000 feet — its highest altitude so far. Virgin Galactic has done its testing for the spacecraft in the Mojave Desert at Mojave Air and Space Port, about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles.

## Unmanned Rocket Explodes

The crash was the second disaster in the commercial space industry in a week. On Tuesday night, an unmanned rocket carrying supplies to the space station exploded just seconds after liftoff from a launch pad in Virginia. No one was injured in that explosion.

Virgin Galactic's plans have been repeatedly delayed. Branson said earlier this month that it was close to going to space. He did not say when that would happen.

Stuart Witt is CEO and general manager of Mojave Space and Air Port, where Virgin conducted its testing. He said he did not see an explosion or hear anything unusual.

"If there was a huge explosion, I didn't hear it," Witt said. A 90-second pause led him to think something had gone wrong, he said.

"It's when I wasn't hearing anything that I became concerned," he said.

## Riding To The Edge Of Space

The SpaceShipTwo plane was designed to fly with the WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft to 50,000 feet. There the spaceship separates and blasts off. Virgin Galactic has said that when the rocket motor engages, it will power the spaceship to nearly 2,500 miles per hour (mph) and take the pilot — and up to six passengers — to the edge of space, or more than 60 miles above the Earth's surface.

Passengers would experience weightlessness, or a lack of gravity. They would see the curve of the Earth's surface before the spaceship re-enters the atmosphere and glides back to a runway. The company planned to charge $250,000 for the experience.

Virgin Galactic said it has accepted more than $80 million in deposits for about 700 reservations made by people who are interested in the ride. Stars like Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Leonardo DiCaprio bought tickets. So did Jim Clash, a writer and resident of New York City. He reserved his ticket four years ago with a 10 percent deposit and says he still wants to take the trip.

"It's rocket science. It's dangerous, it's risky, it's complicated. Most of us who bought tickets know that," he said. "I expected there to be accident … I'm very sad and shocked that it was in such a spectacular fashion today, but it's not going to change my view."

Marco Caceres is senior analyst and director of space studies at the Teal Group. His company follows the aerospace and defense businesses. He said that having two crashes in a week could make it harder to get people to invest in the industry.

## "Probably Won't Happen This Decade"

Any time a person dies, it sends the message of how dangerous these ventures are, Caceres said. Virgin will now have a harder time attracting customers, he said. Virgin's space plane had looked safer than a rocket to the public, he said.

"People will now realize this is space travel," Caceres said, "and you're getting into a rocket."

Michael Blades is an analyst for a company called Frost &amp; Sullivan. He said the crash will indefinitely delay Virgin's goal of sending tourists into space.

"The passenger thing probably won't happen this decade," he said.

Friday's accident was not the first for the program. In 2007, during a test of the spaceship's rocket system, an explosion at the Mojave Desert airport killed three workers and injured three others.

The blast reminded the public of the risks of rocketry, which had long been operated by powerful governments rather than businesses.
