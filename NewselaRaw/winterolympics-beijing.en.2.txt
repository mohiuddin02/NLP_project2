KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia â€” Beijing will soon be the only city in history to have hosted both the Winter and Summer Olympic Games.

Beijing was just awarded the 2022 Winter Olympics. It beat out rival city Almaty, Kazakhstan, in a surprisingly close vote of 44 to 40.

The Chinese capital was seen by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as being a secure, reliable choice. With more than 300 million people in northern China, Beijing also offered huge opportunities for the Olympics to make money. The city in northern China hosted the Summer Olympics in 2008.

"It really is a safe choice," IOC President Thomas Bach said. "We know China will deliver on its promises."

## Secret Vote, Safe Choice

The IOC's secret vote was done by paper ballot. The first vote was done with electronic tablets, but there were technical problems and had to be done over. The result of the first vote was not disclosed.

Bach reacted defensively when asked at a news conference about the possibility of cheating.

"This is an unfair question," Bach said. "Obviously there was a technical issue with the voting system, the devices." He said that if the IOC decided to be on the safe side and vote again to make sure that the election was fair.

Going into the vote, Beijing was the strong favorite, although it does not get any snow. For events such as skiing, it will use artificial snow.

## A "Golden Opportunity" Might Have Been Missed

Almaty had hoped to bring the games to Central Asia for the first time. But the city was not as well known and was viewed as a riskier choice by IOC members. Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov made a last-minute plea for the IOC to be "brave" and award the games to his country.

"Almaty is not a risky choice for 2022," Massimov told the IOC delegates. "In fact, we are quite the opposite."

Massimov said Kazakhstan is "a golden opportunity to prove that smaller, advancing nations can successfully host the Winter Games."

Most IOC members were surprised by the close vote.

"Gee, you wouldn't have picked that close result a few months ago," IOC Vice President John Coates of Australia said. Coates said he thought that Kazakhstan got so close because of Massimov's speech. "The size of China, the number of people that are going to be introduced to winter sport now, those were all factors."

## Asia On The World Stage

Friday's result means the Olympics will be held three times in a row in East Asia. The 2018 Winter Games will be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

Bach pointed out that Asia is becoming more important to the world in all areas of life. "I think it is more or less normal that we have more Olympic Games taking place in Asia," Bach said.

Human rights groups criticized the IOC decision. They said the human rights situation in China has not improved since the 2008 Olympics. China does not allow freedom of speech or criticism of its government. Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, called it a "a slap in the face to China's human rights activists."

She said the IOC must get get the Chinese government to improve human rights.

## Almaty Will Not Give Up Its Olympic Dream

Beijing and Almaty had both been considered long shots when the 2022 contest opened two years ago. They were the only two candidates left after four European cities pulled out for various reasons.

The contest showed the contrast between the world's largest nation and a small, new country seeking to establish itself on the world stage. China's political and economic power was a big advantage against its northwestern neighbor. Kazakhstan only became independent in 1991.

Almaty Olympic Vice Chairman Andrey Kryukov said the city would consider trying again.

"One thing I can say is Almaty was ready to host the 2022 Winter Games," he said.

Beijing plans to use several facilities from the 2008 Olympics. The snow and sliding events would be in Yangqing and Zhangjiakou. The cities are between 37 and 87 miles outside Beijing. A planned high-speed rail line to Zhangjiakou is supposed to cut travel time to 50 minutes.
