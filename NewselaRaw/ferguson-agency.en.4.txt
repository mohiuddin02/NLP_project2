FERGUSON, Mo. â€” A little more than a day after Michael Brown was killed, the peacemakers arrived. Brown was a black teenager without a weapon who was shot by a white police officer. He was killed in August in Ferguson, Missouri, near St. Louis.

The shooting set off nearly nightly protests and violence. The black community felt that Brown wouldn't have been killed if he was white.

The peacemakers came into town to help create peace between the black and white communities. They introduced themselves to police and city officials. Late that night, they met with Brown's family. They sat in a police truck and talked.

## They Work In Secret

The peacemakers work for a little-known unit of the U.S. Department of Justice. The Department of Justice makes sure that people are obeying the law. The unit is called the Community Relations Service. They are also called mediators, because they mediate, or help all sides reach an agreement. These mediators were the first U.S. government officials to arrive in Ferguson.

Since then, they have held dozens of meetings. Police, citizens and community leaders have all attended. The mediators won't say what exactly they are doing. They want to work behind the scenes.

Yet the mediators have the most important job in Ferguson. They are getting all the different sides to sit down together and talk.

"God bless them," said Patricia Bynes, a leader in Ferguson.

Government officials are investigating Brown's death. The Justice Department is also looking into whether the police have used too much force against black people and protesters.

## A Private Place To Talk

The Community Relations Service is entirely different. The unit does not look into crimes or train police.

Its goal is to give all sides a private place to talk, said Grande H. Lum. He is the head of the Community Relations Service. Through talking, hopefully, the groups will solve their own problems.

It's best when people work out their problems themselves, Lum said. "Those are the longest-lasting solutions." His unit, he said, allows "people to speak."

Lum said mediators are trained to understand what is really causing a problem. They figure out who is involved and know who needs to be included in the meetings.

"We are going to be there," Lum said, "as long as it is needed."

## The Nation's Peacemaker

The Community Relations Service calls itself the nation's peacemaker. The unit was created as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The law outlawed unequal treatment of people because of race, color, sex and religion. People also can't be treated unfairly if they are from another country.

For 50 years, the unit has solved problems between the races in American cities.

In St. Louis, mediators have been in and out of the city for years.

Adolphus Pruitt is the president of the St. Louis branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The group fights for the rights of black people. He said he has called police officials many times about a problem. Sometimes they respond, but more often they don't.

When the peacemakers get involved, Pruitt said, everyone is willing to talk.

## Long And Difficult Meetings

Two Sundays after Michael Brown's shooting, mediator Rita Valenciano called a morning meeting of nine community leaders. They talked for three hours. "No breakfast. No orange juice. No nothing. Just us in a room," said Patricia Washington, who works for the county.

The conversation was difficult, she said. Ferguson police and city officials were there. Some people in the room did not want to talk with them.

However, before that meeting, "nobody was talking," Washington said.

Moreover, mediators are giving them practical help. They have provided training for those who want to protect protesters and teach people how to get information.

The situation is far from over. Washington said she's been trying for weeks to get the angriest protesters to come to the meetings, without any success.

Still, she said, there's been progress. Now the protesters are calling her and four have promised to come to the next meeting.
