SAN JOSE, Calif. - Crippled in space, the Kepler spacecraft's planet-hunting days are likely over. But its discoveries may be yet to come.

Scientists have only begun to dig through the huge amounts of data from Kepler, where proof of another Earth-like planet may be hiding.

"The signals are there, in the data we have now — we have to search for them," said NASA's William Borucki, the Kepler mission's principal investigator.

For the past four years, the $600 million Kepler has been focusing its lens on stars to detect the subtle dimming that occurs every time a planet passes in front of its sun. The passes are called "transits."

## Project Plots Position Of Passing Planets

The project has been a runaway success, changing our view of the universe. Before Kepler, we knew little about other solar systems in the Milky Way galaxy. Now we have a lot of information; it has taught us that planets orbit virtually every star in the sky, spurring the field of planetary science. The spacecraft lived as long as it was supposed to, but scientists had hoped it would survive far longer. That is because planet hunting proved to be tougher than anticipated. For instance, other signals can masquerade as a transiting planet, and stars naturally fluctuate in brightness.

Kepler would have collected so much data that signs of an Earth-like planet would have been easily confirmed if the spacecraft lasted until it ran out of fuel in 2019, the researchers said.

"We'll work with what we have," said Alan Gould at the University of California, Berkeley. "We need to make the most of the data that it has already gotten and is still in the pipeline." Since last July, two of Kepler's four gyroscopes have broken, making it unable to take a steady photographic aim at distant stars.

Engineers will try to bring the failed devices back into service, or find other ways to salvage the spacecraft.

So far, Kepler's first 22 months of data have found planets that are quite obvious. But most are in the wrong neighborhoods to sustain life - either too close, or too far away, from their suns. Or they are very big and gaseous, like Jupiter or Saturn.

Kepler has found 2,700 possible planets and 132 have been confirmed since its 2009 launch. Most recently, it revealed some planets circling in the right orbit — the "habitable zone" — around stars Kepler 62 and 69. To be in a habitable zone, a planet must be where temperatures and conditions are suitable for it to hold liquid water, which is very important for sustaining life. By using sophisticated methods of analysis and calculation, astronomers can work out the size and position of the passing planet. Two years of data await study.

"We haven't seen the most interesting data," said Natalie Batalha, deputy science team leader for the Kepler mission.

"The most important discoveries are yet to come. They're in our back pocket," she said.

## If Only There Was More Time

More years of study would have given scientists the chance to see more transits, confirming an orbit like Earth's. They also could have better estimated the planets' mass, size and other properties — and ruled out errors.

"It's so frustrating. It's such a nail-biter," said Laurance R. Doyle of the SETI Institute. "We are almost there. We really wanted to go the next mile to nail down an Earth and to tell if there are moons. The extended mission, with extra transits, would have told us that."

Because Kepler's data flow has stopped, it is even more important to understand the data received and look more closely for subtle patterns that might suggest an Earth-like planet.

The pressure is on such computer experts as Erik Petigura, an astronomy graduate student who works  to process the data.

"We will extend and improve the software. There are more improvements to be made," Petigura said.

"But all the simple and easy things have already been implemented," he cautioned. "Eventually we'll hit a limit."

## Best Is Yet To Come?

While grieving their loss like a family in mourning, the scientists said they are excited by what remains.

"It could have all ended on the launchpad," Gould said. "We are delighted to have been a part of such a beautiful and almost perfect mission."

Scientists also have two more missions to look forward to. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, will use a similar method to Kepler to find nearby exoplanets after its scheduled launch in 2017; and the James Webb Space Telescope, set to launch in 2018, will use its infrared vision to scan TESS's finds for signs of organic molecules.
