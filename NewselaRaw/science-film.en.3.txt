Thirty years ago, Tom Cruise starred as a brave Navy pilot in a movie called "Top Gun." His character, Maverick, performed an upside-down airplane dive. The U.S. military set up recruitment booths in movie theaters. They hoped young Americans would want to be like Maverick and join the military.

## People Wanted To Be A "Top Gun"

It worked. The Navy signed up 16,000 more people than it did a year earlier, said Richard Parker. He is a writer for Proceedings, the U.S. Naval Institute's monthly magazine.

"Top Gun" didn't just excite thousands of would-be sailors and airmen. For a long time the military and entertainment businesses had worked together. However, "Top Gun" made their partnership stronger.

Now the movie business has a new partner in NASA. It is the U.S. space agency. NASA's fictional adventures in outer space are the subject of the new movie, "The Martian."

## Will People Want To Explore Space?

Many people have already seen "The Martian." The movie made more than $100 million in its first weekend. Matt Damon stars as an astronaut stranded on Mars, the Red Planet. More and more people are becoming excited about space. The movie taps into that interest.

With "The Martian," NASA has the same opportunity the military had when "Top Gun" came out. Only now, NASA has extra social-media superpowers. NASA is using social media to make the most of its time in the spotlight. For example, on Twitter and Facebook NASA is writing about the real-world technologies shown in "The Martian." It is explaining the science behind Martian dust storms. It is also encouraging young women to take after the fictional mission commander in the movie, Melissa Lewis. NASA hopes to turn moviegoers into the nation's next generation of super cool scientists and technologists like the ones shown in the film.

## Oops, We Forgot Him On Mars!

At the beginning of the "The Martian," a very embarrassing fictional event happens to NASA. After a storm, the Ares III crew thinks their member Mark Watney is dead. They leave Mars without him. Back on Earth, NASA finds out Watney is still alive. They work hard to try and rescue him. The movie turns what would be a mistake for NASA into a big success.

The story of "The Martian" came from the book by Andy Weir. It shows NASA in a good way. Even if it did not, a NASA spokesperson said the agency does not usually change movie scripts. A script is the written story of a movie.

That is very different from how the U.S. military behaved after the movie "Top Gun" came out. The military did not aways help filmmakers. If a script did not show war and the U.S. troops in a good way, for example, filmmakers were not allowed to borrow real ships, tanks and bases for their movie.

## Touring A Real Space Center

NASA's involvement with Hollywood is different. It mostly helps filmmakers show science correctly, to increase knowledge about space.

"The Martian" filmmakers wanted to make the movie believable, so they toured NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. They also interviewed real NASA scientists and astronauts.

This is not the first time NASA has worked with Hollywood. It's helped with movies such as "Armageddon," "Men In Black III" and the Transformers series. Still, none of those films encouraged young people to get jobs in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Technology experts say we need more jobs in these STEM fields if the United States wants to remain a world leader.

"The Martian" is different. Moviegoers are getting to see NASA as a leading character, even a hero. Just like Tom Cruise was in "Top Gun."
