CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Evan Neal is definitely not your average 16-year-old. For one thing, he gives his father a few hundred dollars each month to cover the electricity cost of running his energy-hungry computer equipment.

It's all part of the latest business launched by the tech-savvy high school junior. Evan uses his powerful computer to get bitcoins. Bitcoin is a paperless and coin-less money that is earned and spent over the Internet. Bitcoin miners — as people like Evan are called — earn bitcoins by using special computer software to solve complicated math problems.

"It's definitely entertaining," Evan said. "I see it as an experience."

It's an experience that's making him money. Evan figures he has made more than $2,000 in profits. His costs are heavy, though, and include buying special computer equipment and giving $200 to $300 to his dad for the electric bill each month.

Evan also gives part of his profits to four of his high school friends. Each gave him $125 or more to help him buy equipment.

## Lots Of Business Ideas To Try

Bitcoin mining isn't Evan's first business.

When he was 11, Evan started a business called Dream Programming. For $25, he would help people's computers run faster.

Since then, Evan has started a series of other businesses. He has a power-washing and deck-refinishing service. He buys electronic devices in large amounts and resells them on Amazon.com. He also repairs computers for another business.

Evan's father, Dave Neal, described a recent weekend that kept Evan pretty busy. He did some bitcoin mining, a power-washing job and a computer repair job.

Neal is impressed by how much his son has learned about bitcoin. "He's 16, but it feels to me he is pretty much an expert in the field," Dave Neal said.

## Keeping The Secret

Bitcoins aren't backed by any government. Bitcoin has stirred up a lot of argument because people who use it aren't identified by name. Even the name of its creator is secret. Because names are kept secret, criminals and drug dealers have used bitcoin.

However, bitcoin became more accepted after government officials said that there are real uses for it. Some big businesses now let customers pay in bitcoins. Overstock.com and online game company Zynga are some of the biggest businesses that accept bitcoin.

The value of a bitcoin has gone up and down. It soared above $1,000 last year. As of Tuesday afternoon, a bitcoin was worth $625, according to Preev, a website that tracks its value.

## More Mining Power To Make It Work

Evan began bitcoin mining about a year ago. Soon, he discovered that if he wanted to make money at it, he would need more powerful computers.

To understand why, you need to know how bitcoin works.

Because bitcoins are only on the Internet, safety is a big concern. Bitcoins are worthless if they can be copied, which is where mining comes in.

Miners add a new layer of protection to what is known as the block chain. The block chain is a record of every bitcoin sale. It makes sure bitcoins cannot be copied.

Campbell Harvey is a business professor at Duke University. He compares the block chain to a series of vaults that are linked together. Miners, said Harvey, "are sealing off this vault with a computer program."

Harvey explained, "The reason you have to do this is so that nobody can hack it. You would need 25,000 of the world's fastest supercomputers to get into this block chain." He says that would be impossible to put together.

## A Race To The Bitcoin Finish!

Miners who manage to solve a difficult mathematical puzzle and create the vault first are rewarded with bitcoins. The miners are in a race to beat each other to the reward. Currently, 25 bitcoins are handed out about every 10 minutes.

Many miners, including Evan, join online pools of miners. They work together to solve math puzzles. They also share in the rewards. Evan says he has mined about 4.5 bitcoins so far.

The race to solve the puzzles has pushed some bitcoin miners to buy better computers. More powerful computers solve the math problems faster. Evan is about to upgrade his computers for the third time.

Evan admits that the ever-rising cost of computers may push him out of bitcoin mining.

On the other hand, Evan said, he may wind up being the one pushing other people out.
