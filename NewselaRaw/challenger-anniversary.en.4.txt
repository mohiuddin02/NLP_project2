ORLANDO, Fla. — The year was 1986. The place was the Kennedy Space Center. After a countdown, space shuttle Challenger took off with a roar. 

Then rocket flames set a giant gas tank on fire. Suddenly, Challenger blew up. It happened less than two minutes after takeoff. 

Challenger blew up 30 years ago this Thursday. Seven astronauts were killed. Teacher Christa McAuliffe was among them.

President Ronald Reagan spoke to the nation shortly after it happened.

## President Promised Not To Forget

"We will never forget them," Reagan said. The president promised the country would not stop exploring space.

Today, many people no longer remember. Many Americans were not even born at the time. There is also less interest in exploring space.

Howard Lieb remembers, though. He has not forgotten the faces of McAuliffe's parents.

The Challenger Center for Space Science Education wants everyone to know about Challenger. It wants to make sure all Americans remember what happened. It also does not want the U.S. to give up on exploring space.

## Centers Remember The Astronauts

The center was started in 1986\. It was founded by the families of the astronauts who died. It now has over 40 branches.

Lance Bush is the group's president. All the Challenger Center branches have pictures of the astronauts on the walls, he said. When children visit, they are told about these heroes.

So far, more than 4 million students have visited the centers. 

The Kennedy Space Center also has a place for visitors. Mike Ciannilli runs it. 

Ciannilli said he often hears stories from people who visit. They remember exactly where they were when Challenger blew up. 

Some were at school. Others were at home watching television with family. Some were outside, watching Challenger rising.

The terrible moment was not important just for the Kennedy Space Center, Ciannilli said. It was something very important in many people's lives.
