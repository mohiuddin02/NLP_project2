WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama gave his State of the Union address on Tuesday. It is a speech he uses to tell the nation about his plans. He also talks about how the country is doing.

In Tuesday's speech, he asked people to join him in leaving the past behind. He argued that his presidency had brought in a new time. Obama said the government is smarter and the country is becoming richer.

More people have jobs than at any other time during Obama's presidency.

"It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years," Obama said.

## Taxing The Rich

Lawmakers are usually either Democrats or Republicans. The two groups often disagree. Obama is a Democrat. He was speaking in front of Congress. For the first time in his presidency, Congress is mostly made up of Republicans. They won control of Congress in the last elections. Obama made it clear that he would not change his plans to please Republicans.

Obama talked about his idea to put higher taxes on rich Americans. The money from the taxes would be used to help the middle class. Middle class Americans make up most of the country's workers. If they have more money, the country does well. Obama wants middle class Americans to pay less in taxes. He also wants to make it easier for them to go to college by making community college free.

Obama is also asking lawmakers to give workers more vacation time or sick days. And he's used his presidential powers to help young adults afford to buy homes.

Republicans disagree with many of the president's ideas for laws.

Iowa lawmaker Joni Ernst gave the Republican response. She said Republicans and Democrats should work together. However, Ernst still disagreed with Obama in many ways. She said his health care plan had failed.

## Changing The Rules On Cuba

The president's address was mainly about problems within the United States. He did mention two of his actions in other countries.

President Obama talked about his decision to change the United States' relationship with Cuba. The U.S. has stopped people from doing business with the communist country for more than 50 years.

Communism is a type of government. In the 1950s, the American government was worried that communism was going to take over the world. To punish Cuba, the U.S. made new rules. People from the United States could not visit Cuba. Americans could not buy things made in Cuba.

Now, Obama wants to change these rules.

He also discussed the need to fight against the Islamic State, a violent group in the Middle East. The group has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It wants to set up its own country governed by Islamic law.

Republican Mitch McConnell, a lawmaker from Kentucky, said Obama's ideas might excite Democrats. But, he said the plans were not going to pass Congress.

McConnell said Obama should work with Republicans. They want to help fix already existing programs that give health care and money to older people. They also want to make sure the U.S. doesn't spend money it doesn't have. McConnell said Obama should not just tax people more.

## Guests At The Speech

Both the White House and Republicans invited guests to Tuesday's speech. The guests were used to support their views.

The Obamas invited Chelsey Davis, a student at a community college in Tennessee. Pranav Shetty, a doctor fighting the deadly Ebola disease in West Africa, was there. They also invited Alan Gross, a Cuban prisoner. He was released last month thanks to Obama's plan to change relations with the country.

Republicans also invited people to support their ideas.

Republican John Boehner of Ohio brought Jorge Luis García Pérez. The man spent 17 years in a Cuban jail for protesting the country's Communist government.

Many people like Pérez do not like Obama's plan. They do not want the U.S. to do business with Cuba.

The morning after the State of the Union, Obama was headed to Idaho and Kansas. The states are run by Republicans. Obama is visiting to share his plans for his seventh year in office.
