BEIJING, China â€” The presidents of the United States and China made an important announcement on Wednesday. Both leaders promised to cut pollution in their own countries. They hope it will slow climate change.

President Barack Obama said the U.S. must do much more to stop climate change. He set a new goal for the country: lowering pollution by one-quarter by 2025.

The president said the U.S. must use much less coal and oil. Coal and oil are burned for energy. When they are, they release carbon dioxide, or CO2. The CO2 ends up in our atmosphere. CO2 is known as a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap heat. Too much greenhouse gas makes the Earth warmer.

Chinese President Xi Jinping also spoke. He announced that China, too, will do more to cut pollution. Big cuts will be made by 2030, he said.

Xi said that China will use more alternative energy. Alternative energy doesn't give off CO2. Nuclear, wind and solar power are all types of alternative energy.

## Pollution A Huge Problem

China is now the world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases. Pollution in China has become a huge problem.

Obama said the new plan is a big step. "It shows what's possible when we work together."

The plan could lead to big improvements. Together, the U.S. and China are responsible for more than one-third of the world's greenhouse gases. Scientists say cuts in greenhouse gases could help stop temperatures from rising throughout the world.

Ken Lieberthal is an expert. He studies the relationship between China and the United States. Lieberthal said the new plan is very promising. By 2050, there could be a lot less pollution, he said.

Of course, change may not be easy. The U.S. and China will have to meet their new goals. Lieberthal says other countries must lower their own pollution, too.

## Fighting Climate Change

Scientists say climate change is already a huge problem. It affects life on every continent and in the oceans. Governments must act quickly, they say. Otherwise, the Earth could be damaged.

Congressman Henry Waxman, a Democrat, praised the new plan. "History may look back and say this was the turning point," he said.

Not everyone in the U.S. is happy, though. The plan was quickly challenged by a group of lawmakers in Washington. Republicans want to stop the new rules.

Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said the plan was a terrible idea. He said it would lead to higher electricity bills for people. He said jobs would be lost.

Obama has more to worry about than just Republicans. Courts could decide that some of the new changes are against the law. Also, the next president might overturn Obama's plan.
