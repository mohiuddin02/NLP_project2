WASHINGTON — The Federal government plans to give more protection to chimpanzees by changing their endangered status and shielding them from experiments.

A proposal by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the latest in a series of steps taken in the past two years to better protect chimps from usage in scientific research. Fish and Wildlife wants to declare captive chimpanzees as [endangered](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species), just like their relatives in the wild. Right now, they are listed as threatened.

The move means that privately owned chimpanzees will be off-limits to invasive experiments. Animal rights groups cheered the move.

The treatment of chimps – one of man's closest genetic cousins – has been a hot topic of debate for years.

## Chimps Used In AIDs Research

In the mid-1980s, scientists worked to understand HIV, which causes the disease AIDS, in hopes of developing a cure, treatment or both. The researchers infected laboratory chimps with the HIV virus.

Eventually, at least 198 chimps were infected with HIV, but just one developed an AIDS-like disease and died.

Despite their similarity to humans, chimps don't react to infection the same way. In HIV research, for example, a possible vaccine protected the chimps but not people. An article in the British Medical Journal concluded: "When it comes to testing HIV vaccines, only humans will do."

In early 2011, Ajit Varki of the University of California-San Diego found that chimps and humans experience disease differently. That called into question their usefulness as human stand-ins.

"Chimps and humans are extremely close genetically, so there is this feeling that they should be a good model to study human diseases," Varki said. "But most attention has been on what is similar. We should also pay more attention to the differences."

## To Endangered From Threatened

The Fish and Wildlife Service said there are about 2,000 chimpanzees in captivity in the U.S.

Since 1960, chimpanzees have experienced a dramatic decrease in population. The latest estimates put their worldwide population at 300,000 to 430,000. The Chimp is threatened encroaching human development into their habitats and by hunting.

The capture of chimpanzees for the international pet trade is another cause of the animals' decline. Fish and Wildlife pointed out that killing a female chimp who has an infant means twice the pay for a hunter. The mother's body is sold in the bush-meat trade. The infant enters the pet trade.

Fish and Wildlife's proposal has not yet been approved. But if it is, some activities involving chimps will require permits. For instance, buyers would need permission to purchase a chimpanzee from another state, but not from somebody in the same state.

The import and export of chimpanzees in and out of the U.S. will require a permit. So will activities that could harm or harass a chimpanzee. Interstate sales of chimpanzee blood and tissue will likewise require permits.

## Only Limited Research Permitted

While some research could still be permitted under the proposal, it will be limited. Fish and Wildlife will work with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation's leading medical-research facility, on determining any further research conducted on chimpanzees.

The use of chimpanzees in research has been argued about for years. Recently it underwent a significant transformation, thanks to advances in laboratory techniques by researchers. Knowledge once gained only by examining a live animal now can be learned in a petri dish. In addition, more and more evidence shows that chimpanzees don't work well as human fill-ins in research experiments.

The ethics of animal research have evolved in recent years. What once was commonplace is now a hot topic of debate. There is a growing feeling that chimps should be spared the pain and mental anguish of research.

In the past two years, the NIH has moved to reduce the money available for chimpanzee experimentation. In its proposal, Fish and Wildlife noted that while some biomedical research on captive chimpanzees continues in the U.S., "there is less need for chimpanzee studies due to the new non-chimpanzee models and technologies."

When it comes to studying HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases, or cancer, it may just not be worth using the primates as test subjects.

"Chimpanzees have repeatedly proven to be poor models for many areas of human disease research," said Dr. John J. Pippin of the group Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.
