FARMINGTON, N.M. — During World War II, Tom Jones Jr. served as one of the legendary Navajo code talkers. These [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) Marines used their own language to send secret messages the enemy was never able to figure out. Years later, the Navajo Nation decided to express its appreciation: It built him a house.

These days that house is in bad shape. The 89-year-old Jones struggles to keep warm during winter. His only heat comes from the ancient wood stove in the living room. What's more, the electricity doesn't work in his bathroom and the floor has worn away. The rough wood shows beneath his feet.

Jones is one of many Navajo who once served in the U.S. military and now live in houses that are falling apart. Often, they are as ruined as those they saw in battle. Some have no electricity or running water. The hallway in Jones' small home is too narrow for his wheelchair.

"My desire is a house where I can be able to get around, to have a heating system so I can sleep well and enjoy life," Jones said. He was speaking in the Native language of Dine. It was this language he had used to send messages for the U.S. and its allies during the war.

## Hundreds Wait For Housing

The Navajo reservation cuts through the New Mexico-Arizona border. Nearly 9,000 veterans, people who once served in war, live on the reservation. More than half of them do not have proper housing.

"There is a huge crisis taking place," said Navajo government spokesman Rick Abasta. "You'll even see some families living in storage sheds."

The tribe began constructing homes for veterans during the 1980s. And in 1998 it launched a new home-building program. This was made possible by a $6-million fund for Navajo veterans created by the tribe.

The aim was to provide free houses to veterans in need or help them pay for home repairs.

"These veterans, they deserve housing — decent and sanitary housing — for the services that they provided this country. And that would probably go even more so with our Navajo code talkers," Abasta said.

In February, Navajo leaders signed a contract with Home Depot. They plan to purchase building materials from the store to be used for veterans' housing.

It's part of a $1.9 million project, paid for by the Veterans Trust Fund. But that's just enough for 75 homes. Yet there are hundreds of veterans who are waiting for housing.

## Too Much Paperwork

There is only so much the tribe can do, Abasta said, because of limited funding. "We meet with congressmen about these issues," he said. "But most often it falls on deaf ears."

Navajo veterans and their supporters say the program is run poorly.

Etta Arviso is pushing leaders to provide better housing for several code talkers. The veterans tell her they face too much paperwork and regulations. Others give up hope because the wait is so long.

"Now you can see how our Navajo code talkers are treated," Arviso said. At Jones' house she has put up a sign out front: "Navajo Code Talker Needs a New Home."

Jones would like to move, but he can't afford to.

Right now, he is forced to spend most of his time in the living room. Jones is simply unable get his wheelchair through the narrow hallway leading to his bedroom or bathroom. His caretaker or a family member has to carry him into other parts of the home.

## "We Have No Funds"

When the military got him to sign up 73 years ago, he was told that he would have whatever he needed after the war, Jones said. He served as a corporal in the 3rd Marine Division from 1943 to 1945. A good part of that time was spent in heavy fighting, including at Iwo Jima.

When he returned home, he said, he was able to provide for himself. At one point he worked in the mines. When he was younger he never asked for handouts, he said proudly.

"I was strong," he said. "I would haul wood. I didn't have problems money-wise."

But when he got ill in 2007, he could no longer provide for himself. Jones is now in very poor health. He has a hard time hearing and can barely talk.

Jones has a grandson who followed him into the Marines. That grandson, Jarvis Jones, 37, said he was disappointed and disgusted with how his grandfather and other code talkers live.

"It's a lot of runaround," the younger Jones said. "The story on the reservation is 'We have no funds.'"
