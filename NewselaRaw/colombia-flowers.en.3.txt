BOGOTA, Colombia â€” On Valentine's Day, millions of Americans give red roses to their special someone. Many of those beautiful flowers come from one place: the fields around Colombia's capital city of Bogota.

Fifty years ago, Colombia shipped its first order of fresh-cut flowers to Miami. Since then, Colombian flowers have grown into a billion dollar business.

Flowers in the United States were once expensive and sold only at specialized shops. Today, they are much cheaper and are found in many places. They can be bought everywhere from grocery stores to gas stations.

Colombia has a lot to do with the change. It is now the world's second-largest flower exporter. The country will send 500 million flowers out to other countries for Valentine's Day, and 3 out of every 4 flowers given on the special day will come from Colombia.

## A Few Businessmen

Colombia's flower trade came about thanks to a handful of people. A few adventurous businessmen and a clever college student from the United States led the way.

It all began with Colombian Edgar Wells. While in the U.S., Wells noticed how expensive flowers were. He decided he could supply them more cheaply if he grew them himself in Colombia.

At the time, most of America's fresh-cut flowers came from California and Colorado. They were rare, expensive and reserved for special occasions.

Wells returned home and set up a flower company, named Flores Colombianas. He made his first shipment to Miami in October 1965.

Charles Weston is 83 years old now. When he was younger, he began managing Wells' store, Flores Colombianas.

## A Clever College Student

American college student David Cheever was the next important person to help Colombia's flower trade. In 1967, Cheever wrote a paper about Bogota sending its flowers around the world. He wrote about how Colombia's climate and high-altitude fields made it a perfect place to grow flowers.

Many people took notice of Cheever's paper. One of them was Colombian John Vaughan, who started growing flowers on a 2.5-acre plot of land in 1969.

Cheever was so sure his ideas were right that he decided to go into business too. In 1969, he founded his own Colombian flower company, named Flor America.

Cheever "was very generous with his ideas and knowledge," Vaughan said. The greenhouses used today on Colombian flower farms were largely created by him.

The early years were hard for Colombian flower sellers. Vaughan remembers having to hand-carry boxes of flowers to Miami.

U.S. buyers were difficult to find at first. However, Vaughan eventually convinced grocery stores that they should stock flowers. They soon became big buyers of Colombian flowers, which were much cheaper than flowers grown in the U.S.

## A Big Business

In the early 1970s, Flores Colombianas set up an office in Miami. After that, things really began to take off.

"We had sales girls who could talk to all of the cities in the United States," Weston said.

The Colombian flower trade has gotten much bigger since then. Now, there are around 350 flower growers in Colombia, with 130,000 workers. In 2013 around 200,000 tons of flowers were shipped from the country.

The future looks even brighter, said Colombian Agriculture Minister Aurelio Iragorri.

Soon, many people in the U.S. "will not only want flowers for Valentine's Day," he said. They will want to buy them year-round.
