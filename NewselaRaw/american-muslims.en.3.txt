WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last month, gunmen killed many people in Paris, France. A week afterward, Lena Badr Abdelhamid's husband sat her down. He warned her that police were looking for a man who happened to have the same name as them. Even the spelling of man's name, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was the same.

Abdelhamid worries that she may be in danger. The only reason is that she shares a name and a religion with a suspected terrorist.

## Worried About Hate Crime

"I wonder often how long will we have to pay for crimes that we haven't committed. I immediately began to dread the hate crimes that were sure to follow," Abdelhamid said. She, like the Paris attackers, is Muslim. A hate crime is an attack against a person because of his or her race or religion.

After the attacks, some people around the world said terrible things about Muslims. It frightened Muslims in the United States. They are worried that people might go after them in revenge for the Paris attacks. They wonder if they should try not to look Muslim. Some women say they do not know whether they should take off their headscarves. Some Muslim women wear the scarves out of modesty. 

Things have gotten even more scary for U.S. Muslims. A Muslim couple in California went on a shooting rampage, killing 14 people and wounding 21 others. The couple then died in a shootout with police. The woman had made a Facebook post pledging allegiance to the extremist group Islamic State. The group is trying to set up its own country. They want to rule by an extreme, violent Islamic law that other Muslims are against. Its fighters have taken over large parts of Iraq and Syria.

## Don't Attract Attention

Badi Ali is the imam of a mosque in Greensboro, North Carolina. The religious leader has been giving advice to nervous members of his mosque coming there to pray. He tells them to avoid attracting attention.

"You have to become like the palm tree. When the wind comes, you have to bow down a little bit until the wind goes away," Ali said.

Aysha Khan, who lives in Maryland, said she has been upset over the years to see anti-Muslim crimes happen more often. These attacks are caused by anger over extremist groups such the Islamic State. 

This week, Khan called her parents to tell them that she is going from Baltimore to Washington. Her father warned against taking the subway and offered to drive her. She refused.

Khan said normally she would thing they were being overly careful. "But they are actually not," she said.

## Crimes Against Muslims On The Rise

Muslim groups say she is correct.

The FBI said that crimes against Muslims are on the rise. Incidents involving other groups went down in 2014. The number of anti-Muslim incidents rose from 135 in 2013 to 154 in 2014, the FBI said.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) keeps track of attacks against Muslims. They include threats and attacks on mosques. In one, a Canadian mosque was set on fire. The group also recorded anti-Muslim hate graffiti and countless hate messages on the Internet. 

## Grateful For Some Support

Muslims say they are grateful to some non-Muslims who have given their support. One of these non-Muslims is Jack Swanson. The Texas boy was saving up for an iPad. Instead, he gave the money from his piggy bank to a mosque that was attacked. A well-known Muslim editor and lawyer sent Jack an iPad with a thank-you note signed, "Love, The American Muslim Community."

Many young Muslims think their community leaders should not go on television and condemn terror attacks as Muslims. It gives people the idea the extremists and ordinary Muslim believers have something in common, they say. They say the Muslim community should not "apologize" for behavior that is completely against what they stand for. Instead they should condemn terror attacks as Americans, as human beings.

Uzma Hussain, who lives in Maryland, feels that many people think that all Muslims are guilty.  She said Muslims might as well sign a document stating they are not terrorists.
