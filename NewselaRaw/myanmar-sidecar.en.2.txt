YANGON, Myanmar â€” Linn Naing rides off every morning looking for a day's work. He fixes the red cushions on his sidecar and pedals his bicycle taxi, looking for passengers around the city. He rides past old buildings, billboards and an Internet cafe called Google.

Myanmar, which used to be called Burma, was a colony controlled by the British until 1948. It was a military dictatorship until 2011 and it is still developing as a democracy. Many countries avoided Myanmar during the dictatorship because people had few rights under military rule. Today, countries are starting to do business there again.

## Old Buses, New Taxis And Nimble Sidecars

Shiny new apartment towers rise toward the sky. They are monuments to the modern transformation of Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar, with 7.4 million people. Fleets of small, new white taxis swarm around old buses, a sign that the city is becoming more wealthy.

But even in 2015, there is still room on the roads for bicycle sidecar taxis like Linn Naing's. Buses are cheap, but hot, and taxis are cool, but they are expensive, he says. Linn Naing has been at his job for eight years, and business is still good, he said. In fact, he said with the traffic jams nowadays, it is often faster to take a sidecar, so people prefer it.

## Sidecar Men Make Good Money

In many Asian cities, bicycle taxis and sidecars have been replaced by cheap motorcycles and scooters from China and Japan. But the military in Myanmar banned motorbikes in central Yangon.

Legend has it that bikes were banned after a motorcycle gang called the Scorpions cut off a general's car. But even as democracy develops, the government has not lifted the ban.

That is good news for Linn Naing and thousands of other sidecar drivers in the city. With fares ranging from 20 cents to 50 cents, sidecars are still a cheaper option than taxis for short trips.

Linn Naing makes about $10 a day taking women home from the market, children to school and tourists to temples. That is a decent wage in a country where the average person makes about $1,000 a year.

Still, getting into the business is not cheap; a bicycle and a sidecar can cost about $200 and a license is $300. Unlike many drivers, Linn Naing owns his sidecar, which means he does not have to pay a $2 to $3 daily fee to rent his ride.

## A Cheaper Ride By Design

The design of the sidecars is about 85 years old. According to the story, a mechanic designed them to create a cheaper form of transportation to compete with trains.

Burmese sidecars are made by hand out of wood. They have two seats, one facing forward and one facing the rear. Passengers sit back to back alongside the driver. A heavy metal bracket hooks the sidecar to the bicycle frame. A shiny bell and a light typically sit on the handlebars and a metal license plate flies hangs over the front fender.

Zaw Zaw Co, a Yangon artist, began putting bicycles in his paintings in 2011. He shows the bikes floating above old maps of famous places around the country. He says he wanted to paint something that showed working-class people. Many drivers are uneducated and don't have many jobs to choose, he said.

Zaw Zaw Co likes sidecars because they are practical. They are useful to get home from the store or to go somewhere where buses don't go, he said. The sidecars will survive, he said, because there will always be people who need them.
