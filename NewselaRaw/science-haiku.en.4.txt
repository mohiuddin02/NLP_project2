SEATTLE â€” The language of the United Nation's latest report on climate change is not what you'd call poetic. The report is crammed with complicated details about greenhouse gases, rising sea levels and our atmosphere. And it's not only hard to understand. It's also very, very long: some 2,200 pages.

Seattle ocean scientist Gregory Johnson helped write one of the chapters. But even he was having a hard time taking in the whole thing. So Johnson decided to simplify the report down to its most important points.

Johnson did this by turning to a centuries-old Japanese art form: haiku. Then, he added his own watercolor paintings.

With a bit of encouragement, Johnson decided to post his finished booklet on the Web. It is now getting a lot of attention.

"I was surprised that as many people responded as positively as they did," said Johnson. "It's been tweeted a thousand times, or something."

## Report's 19 Main Points ...

Online commenters have written verses to go along with it. Several teachers plan to use the booklet in their classrooms. And fans want to translate Johnson's work into all sorts of languages: Hindi, Italian, German, French and Luxembourgish. The last language is spoken in the tiny country of Luxembourg.

Blogger Chris Mooney praised the way Johnson summed up [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming). He did it, Mooney said, in an "understandable, and even moving, way."

The original U.N. report has 19 main points. For each of these, Johnson wrote a haiku.

Take global warming's effects on ice and snow. Some scientists say that when we burn things like gas it heats up the earth. And that is causing ice in the Arctic to melt. The report spends more than 100 pages on that subject. But Johnson boils it down to 17 syllables:

_Glaciers and ice sheets  
melt worldwide, speed increasing  
Sea ice, snow retreat_

Johnson also illustrates the poems with simple watercolors. One, for example, shows a sunlit iceberg. Another shows smokestacks and a swing set on a grassy hill. The second goes with the verse:

_Forty years from now  
children will live in a world  
shaped by our choices_

Haiku is a traditional Japanese poem with three lines. It uses 5- and 7-syllable lines in a familiar 5-7-5 pattern. Haiku might seem like an odd choice for a scientist. But Johnson was already well acquainted with it. For the past few years, he's been composing Facebook posts in haiku. He sees this as a way to keep his messages short and positive.

## ... In 17-Syllable Poems

Like most scientists Johnson's work life is all about complexity. That's part of what made the haiku exercise appealing.

He never intended anyone except family and friends to see the finished product. But they were impressed with what he'd done. They urged him to let the public see it too.

Johnson was unsure, and a little nervous.

"It took me a little while to get up the courage to put this out there," he said.

Eventually, he let the Seattle environmental group Sightline post the booklet on its website. It went up last month. Within two weeks, the post had received nearly 40,000 hits.

"Greg got the facts in there," said Sightline's Anna Fahey. But at the same time, she said, his post was moving. He "made this beautifully elegant and emotional case for why it matters."

The Sightline post has already attracted comments from those who don't believe in global warming. But, Johnson prefers not to argue about it. In any case, his own mind is made up. His work has made him convinced: Some changes caused by global warming can be observed now. And more are certain in the future.

Haiku and watercolors won't change that. Nor are they likely to change the minds of those who don't believe in global warming. But, Johnson said, perhaps his booklet will make a few people take a look at the U.N. report. That, he said, would make him happy.
