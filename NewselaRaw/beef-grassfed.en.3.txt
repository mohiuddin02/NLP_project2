DELEON SPRINGS, Fla. — The pregnant cow nosed around rancher David Strawn's pickup truck. She was hoping to find something good to eat.

For many years, Strawn's family raised cows, lambs and pigs on a ranch near Orlando, Florida. When his father died in 2002, Strawn started raising grass-fed cattle. He eventually got rid of the other animals.

Strawn loves eating a good piece of meat, but he insists on knowing that the creature it came from led the best life possible. That means it does not take antibiotic medicine to grow bigger. It does not eat grains. It does not live in a cage.

"These guys enjoy our pastures, the lakes," said Strawn, who is 79 years old. "They get gentle treatment. Their bad moments are very short — at the end."

## Some Say The Meat Is Healthier

Supporters of grass-fed meat like it for several reasons. They say it has less fat and is healthier than traditional meat. They also say it is better for the environment and is kinder to the animals.

Not everyone agrees. Some beef producers defend the use of feedlots, where cattle eat grain to get fatter. Other experts say there is little proof that grass-fed beef is healthier.

One thing is certain. Grass-fed meat is usually more expensive. In fact, it sometimes costs twice as much as regular meat. There are many reasons for this. One is that grass-fed cattle need more land to graze on. Farmers must then buy more land. Another reason is that grass-fed cattle take longer to grow. They also do not grow as big, so they supply less meat. As a result, the rancher needs to charge more money to make a profit.

## Most People Still Buy Traditional Beef

No one is sure how much grass-fed meat people are buying. Most people still buy traditional meat.

Emily Rankin owns a farm store in Orlando. She says grass-fed meat is more popular than it used to be. People who buy it care about their health and the well-being of animals.

Erika Maier is a schoolteacher. She has been buying grass-fed beef from David Strawn's ranch for several years. She says it is worth the long trip from her home. This month she and several other families bought a cow that weighed 935 pounds. It cost more than $2,000. The families split the cost.

## Rancher Loves Raising Cows

Maier freezes her meat and makes dog food out of the parts she does not want to eat. She gives it to her German shepherd, Buddy.

Strawn used to sell his meat to restaurants in South Florida. Then he decided to sell to people directly. He wanted to get to know them better. Strawn loves his business. He tries to preserve the trees and wildlife that share the land with his cattle.

"I really like growing things," said Strawn, who grew up on the ranch. "I like caring for things."

It takes some people a while to get used to way grass-fed beef tastes. It is firmer than regular beef and has less fat. Maier said it is delicious. She said she feels healthier since she and her family have been eating it.

"We need to keep our money in the community," said Maier, a mother of two children. "We need to help the local farmer, and we need to do what's right for the animals."
