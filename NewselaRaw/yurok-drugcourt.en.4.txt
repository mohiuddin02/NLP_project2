KLAMATH, Calif. â€” Drugs are "everywhere in Indian country," Lauren Alvarado says, simply.

Like many on the Yurok reservation here, she first tried drugs at age 12. Her first arrest came at age 13.

But today, at 31, Alvarado has kicked her drug habit. She has been clean for nine months, she said recently. And she is "hopeful, more grateful."

She got clean with the help of a Yurok wellness program. It puts traditional tribal values to work to heal Yurok men and women who are addicted, or hooked on drugs. The Yurok tribe is the largest in California. It has almost 6,000 members. The tribe's ancestral lands sit along the banks of the Klamath River.

## At The Wellness Court

Yurok Tribal Court Chief Judge Abby Abinanti created the wellness program four years ago. She's also a San Francisco County judge. The "wellness court" she created has earned trust from the California justice system.

Some tribal members charged with drug or alcohol crimes come to the court under certain conditions. They are released by the court but remain under its watch. Others are directed to Abinanti's court before trial. If they get better, charges are dropped.

Other people with drug problems find the program on their own. They may have tried approaches that failed. They come thinking that their culture and responsibility to their communities will give them a better chance at beating their drug problems.

Alvarado was one of those. She sought out Anthony Trombetti. He organizes the work of the wellness court.

"Either I would keep messing up and I would be in jail, or I would have to be better for myself," Alvarado said. "I chose myself."

## Before The Tribal Council

Wellness court workers found Alvarado a job. A student had come back to the reservation to study meat-eating animals there. Alvarado assisted her in her work. One afternoon, the two women sat together before the tribal council. Alvarado helped explain the strips of land they'd marked, the bones they had found, and the maps she helped draw.

She was nervous. But it didn't show.

Trombetti gives tribal members with drug problems who have made the greatest steps forward a large, hand-carved, redwood acorn. It's a symbol. Like them, it must fall, crack and find food and nourishment before it can blossom.

Alvarado is one of just two to receive an acorn. She now runs a home where she helps people stay sober. She credits Trombetti, Abinanti, and other wellness program workers for her success.

Lori Nesbitt works for the wellness court. She closely examines county jail lists to find people who need help. She snoops with aunts and uncles of people who go before the court. She wants to see how they're really doing.

"It's how we do things," Nesbitt said. She notes that aunts and uncles have a special place in Yurok culture. They're allowed to be strict with youngsters.

## Helping A Runaway

Not long ago a girl ran away from drug treatment. Nesbitt and Abinanti piled into a car to look for her. They found her at a McDonald's. She tried to run away, but then Abinanti showed her who was with them: her grandmother and aunt. She stopped in her tracks.

Tribal members are scattered through mountains along the river. Wellness program workers bring them to appearances at state courts. They transport them to drug treatment and make sure they stay. Some are allowed visits with their children. The tribe gets them there.

Rebecca Salinas, 32, sought out the program. Like Alvarado, she and her brother were caught in the trap of addiction: Their parents sold drugs and so did they.

Salinas has been drug-free for nearly 11 months now. She recently told Abinanti that she had landed a job. When she was using drugs, her four children were taken from her. Overjoyed, she reported that her second-oldest, age 10, would be coming home to her after Christmas.

"Did you sign up for the gift program?" Abinanti asked. "Because she'll be needing presents."
