Just the possibility that something new by the King of Pop Art had been discovered was enough to excite Warhol fanatics around the world.

The 28 images were apparently created and stored by Warhol on nearly-unreadable computer disks almost 30 years ago. They were created on Warhol's Commodore Amiga computer. The newly-discovered images include a version of "The Birth of Venus" by 15th century artist Sandro Botticelli, a Warhol self-portrait, and a Campbell's soup can — Warhol was famous for his soup cans. The students found versions of some of his other most iconic artworks, such as a banana and actress Marilyn Monroe.

It will take more research and debate before the discovery's historic value is clear. But the high interest is understandable for one of the world's most productive and studied artists, said Matt Wrbican. He is a Warhol expert and the Andy Warhol Museum's chief archivist.

"It's something that's new," he said, "and that doesn't happen very often with Warhol."

## "Learning A New Tool"

The Andy Warhol Museum, Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Museum of Art revealed the story Thursday morning.

Within hours of the discovery hitting the Internet, Wrbican heard from someone with doubts that Warhol created the images.

A man who worked with the now-closed Amiga World magazine called after reading a story about the discovery. He said he "doesn't think Warhol actually made a lot of those images," Wrbican said. The magazine published a story in 1986 about Warhol and his use of the Amiga computer.

But even if Warhol had help making the images, they would still help to understand Warhol as an artist.

"Like a lot of his work, it was a collaboration," Wrbican said.

Still, even if Warhol had created the images all by himself, Wrbican noted, "I want to emphasize we're not calling these artwork. It was just Warhol learning a new tool."

Warhol is famous for predicting that "everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes." Born in Pittsburgh, he died in 1987 in New York City. His paintings now fetch more than $100 million at auctions.

## "Painting" On An Amiga

The museum knew it had Warhol's Amiga computer and floppy disks for some time. Floppy disks were computer storage devices that held information. They have been replaced by CDs. Pulling information from floppy disks, especially the early ones, can be incredibly difficult. Wrbican said he had wanted to look through Warhol's computer and set of disks for a while, but couldn't find the time.

It took a modern, multimedia artist — and self-professed Warhol fanatic — to finally get the ball rolling.

In 2011, New York City artist Cory Arcangel was doing a show at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. He was asked if he had any ideas for any Pittsburgh-focused work.

Warhol was "painting" rock singer Debbie Harry on an Amiga computer.

Commodore had used the video to promote the launch of the Amiga. It was the first advanced multimedia art graphics computer.

Arcangel then called a friend at Carnegie Mellon to see if he knew anyone with any retro-computer expertise.

As it turns out, the university had an active and energetic Computer Club. Its members were especially interested in outdated computer technology and how it evolved.

"We were not optimistic when we first saw the floppy disks," said Keith Bare. He is a former Carnegie student. The disks had the computer's operating system on them. They were not personal information "disks with something handwritten on them like 'Andy Warhol's images' on them," he said.

## A Program Called KryoFlux

It turned out the disks and the computer were early versions. That made accessing the information on them that much more difficult. The students created their own program. They also used a program called a KryoFlux to allow a modern computer to "talk to" a floppy disk. Combing the two, the team managed to pull the images from the disk and save them.

"But I think we're going to have a lot of this in the future unless we start saving files in very standard file formats," said Michael Dile. He was deeply involved in the project. People, business, government and organizations all may have information stored on old computer formats.

People might think the museum could sell new computer images by Warhol for a lot of money. But Wrbican said even if Warhol did create them, it's not so easy to make money from the newfound work.

The museum might not even be able to release the Marilyn Monroe image, for example, he said. The people who own the rights to Monroe's image might sue the museum if it did. Anyone who wants to use the actress's picture may need to get permission from her heirs.

Similar copyright issues affect much of his work. Warhol typically used publicly available images or products.

Moreover, Wrbican said, "We don't really see them as Warhol's artwork, so I don't think we're going to be putting them out there on coffee cups to sell anytime soon."
