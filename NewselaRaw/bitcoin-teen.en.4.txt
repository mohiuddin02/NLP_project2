CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Evan Neal is not your average teenager. At 16, Evan has already started five different businesses.

His latest business uses powerful computers to get bitcoins. Bitcoin is a kind of paperless and coin-less money. It is earned and spent over the Internet. Bitcoin miners — as people like Evan are called — earn bitcoins by using their computer to solve hard math problems.

"It's definitely entertaining," Evan said. "I see it as an experience."

It's an experience that makes him money. Evan figures he has made more than $2,000. His costs are high, though. Bitcoin miners need expensive computer equipment. The equipment needs a great deal of electricity to run. Evan pays $200 to $300 a month toward his dad's electric bill.

Evan also gives part of his profits to four high school friends. Each gave him $125 or more to help him buy equipment.

## A Young Businessman

Bitcoin mining is not Evan's first business startup.

When he was 11, Evan started a business called Dream Programming. For $25, he fixed computers so they ran faster.

Since then, Evan has started a power-washing and deck-refinishing service. He buys electronic devices in large amounts and resells them on Amazon.com. He also repairs computers for another business.

Evan's father, Dave Neal, said a recent weekend kept Evan pretty busy. Evan did some bitcoin mining. He finished a power-washing job and a computer repair job.

Neal is impressed by how much Evan has learned about bitcoin. "He's 16, but it feels to me he is pretty much an expert in the field," Neal said.

## Not Everyone Trusts Bitcoins

Unlike dollars, bitcoins are not backed by any government. There are not many laws about how they can be used. Not everyone is in favor of bitcoin. People who use it are not identified by name. No one even knows who created it. Because names are secret, criminals and drug dealers use it.

However, bitcoin is becoming more accepted. U.S. government officials said there are some good uses for it. Business people have started buying bitcoins. Large businesses such as Overstock.com and online game company Zynga let customers pay with bitcoins.

The value of a bitcoin has gone up and down. It soared above $1,000 last year. As of Tuesday, a bitcoin's worth was listed as $625 on Preev, a website that tracks its value.

Evan began bitcoin mining about a year ago. He soon discovered that he needed more powerful computers.

To understand why, you need to know how bitcoin works.

## Solve The Puzzle, Get A Reward

Bitcoins are all online. Because of that, safety is a big issue. Bitcoins are worthless if they can be copied, which is where mining comes in.

Miners add extra protection to the record of bitcoin sales. It is important to protect the record so that bitcoins cannot be copied. Miners race to solve a difficult math puzzle to protect the record. Their reward is bitcoins. Miners with the fastest computers can solve puzzles quicker than other miners.

The reason you have to protect the record "is so that nobody can hack it," said Campbell Harvey. He is a business professor at Duke University in North Carolina. You would need 25,000 of the world's fastest supercomputers to get into the record, he said. Linking so many supercomputers together is just not possible.

Every 10 minutes, 25 bitcoins are handed out as rewards. Evan thinks he has earned about 4.5 bitcoins so far.

The math race has led some miners to buy better computers. Evan is about to upgrade his computers for the third time.

The price of the equipment keeps rising, though. Eventually, mining bitcoins may become too expensive for Evan.

On the other hand, Evan said, he may wind up pushing other miners out.
