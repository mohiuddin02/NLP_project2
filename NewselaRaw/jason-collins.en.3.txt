Basketball player Jason Collins revealed last week he is gay. The announcement made history.

The 34-year-old NBA player broke the news in Sports Illustrated. The story made headlines. No other player on a major league basketball, football, baseball or hockey team has ever said he was gay, at least not while he was still playing.

Collins wrote in an essay for the magazine: "I'm a 34-year-old NBA center. I'm black. And I'm gay. I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation."

Collins has played in the NBA since 2001. Six different teams have hired him. He was on the Boston Celtics and the Atlanta Hawks before he joined the Wizards.

Collins wrote that he realized he was gay when he was 12. His twin brother was getting interested in girls, but he was not. His aunt was the first relative with whom he shared his secret. She was not surprised. She accepted him lovingly. From then on, he knew he would always have support.

## Bombings Triggered Decision

Collins decided to make his announcement after the bombings at the Boston Marathon. The bombings showed he should not wait for the perfect moment to tell his secret. "Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?" he wrote.

Collins felt people's views were changing. More and more, Americans seem to believe in gay rights, he said. On Thursday, Rhode Island became the 10th U.S. state to allow gay marriage. Delaware became the 11th on Tuesday.

"We still have so much farther to go," he wrote.

## Positive Public Reaction

Collins has received a lot of support for his essay. Just hours after the story broke, he got a call from President Barack Obama. The president praised him for his courage.

"He seems like a terrific young man, and I told him I couldn't be prouder," the president told CNN.

Collins wrote that he was not sure what other basketball players would say. So far, it seems he has nothing to fear. NBA stars Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash of the Los Angeles Lakers went to the Internet to show their support.

"Proud of @jasoncollins34," Bryant wrote. "Don't suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others." Nash wrote: "The time has come. Maximum respect."

## Breaking Stereotypes

Collins has been a tough player on the court. In the 2004-2005 season he had 322 fouls, more than any other player.

"I'm not afraid to take on any opponent," Collins wrote. "I go against the gay stereotype, which is why I think a lot of players will be shocked: *That* guy is gay?"

Even though Collins got lots of praise, not everyone was supportive. An NFL player made a negative comment about Collins on the Internet. Sports Illustrated reported that the football player got lots of angry responses. He took down his comment. Then he publicly apologized.

Everyone will be watching to see where Collins goes next. His contract with the Wizards is over. He will be a free agent this summer. That means any team can offer him a job. Whoever hires him will get a lot of attention. It will show that the NBA is open to gay players.

Last week, Collins was on Good Morning America to discuss his news. "I think, I know, in my personal life, I'm ready, and I think the country is ready for supporting an openly gay basketball player," he said.

"I know that I, right now, am the happiest that I've ever been in my life," he added.
