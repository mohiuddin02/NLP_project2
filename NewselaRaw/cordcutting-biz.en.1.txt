SAN DIEGO, Calif. — On weekdays in the Larsen household, Kirsten, 12, and Soren, 15, get up early and park themselves on the couch before school. They do not turn on the television, though. Instead, the youngsters each pull out their cellphones and fire up YouTube to get a dose of videos, essentially acquiring the information they need to know before encountering peers.

Say hello to the future cord-cutters of America. Not only is cable becoming increasingly unnecessary to them, but so, too, is the actual TV set.

## They Click, Tap And Swipe

In fact, the change of TV viewing habits is most evidenced in how tots, tweens and teens consume content. They use cellphones and tablets to access the streaming video services of their liking. YouTube and Netflix consistently are the standouts.

"The shift away from traditional broadcast cable TV services, that's been happening for years, but now we've hit critical mass," said Terence Burke of kid-focused market research company KidSay. "Kids still watch TV. They still head to Disney and Nickelodeon, just in much smaller numbers and for much shorter durations."

Burke spends much of his time in elementary, middle and high schools studying the viewing habits of kids. He believes there is a massive movement underway in 2015 with their attention shifting away from cable TV. The future is about digital video consumed on handheld devices, he believes.

Smarty Pants is a market research company that conducts an annual study on the digital behavior of kids ages 6 to 12. It found that 81 percent of 6- to 8-year-olds and 76 percent of 9- to 12-year-olds use YouTube.

Netflix, meanwhile, is used by an identical percentage of the older group. A large chunk of the younger 6- to 8-year-olds are also Netflix users, according to the company's, "2015 Clicks, Taps & Swipes Report."

## Content For Every Age Group

With an endless selection of videos that are funny, and even educational, YouTube is not only the new stand-in for traditional cable TV when it comes to kids, but it is also their go-to search engine. As kids get older, Netflix satisfies tweens' emerging cravings for material that has a continuing story. Both video services win with kids because there is always something to watch, and all that is required is a click of the button on their favorite devices.

To court kids and, more importantly their parents, YouTube, Netflix and even Amazon have all created special spaces just for them. Those family friendly zones do well with preschoolers and kindergartners, but older kids want the real deal.

"In order to use YouTube, kids should be 13, but the reality is that 8-year-olds are on YouTube all the time," Burke said. "How are you going to keep them on YouTube Kids when they've seen YouTube? You're not."

That, in part, explains the existence of YouTube Red, the digital video service's new $10-per-month subscription option. It removes all ads, allows for offline viewing, lets users watch clips while they are using other apps, and will eventually come with original programming and movies featuring YouTube stars. YouTube has already successfully, perhaps unintentionally, hooked kids while they are young. Why not create a way for them to pay for more of what they clearly love?

## YouTube Has An Edge

In fact, YouTube ranks as the most-used smartphone app, favorite app and top website for both boys and girls ages 8 to 11, according to KidSay's trend-tracker. When asked to pick how they would watch shows if allowed only a single choice, 30 percent of pre-teen boys opted for YouTube. The total slightly edged out all other options, including regular TV and other streaming services, according to the survey.

Boys' favorite YouTube channels, which include "JackSepticEye," "PewDiePie" and "Stampylonghead," sound more like ridiculous, cartoon characters than important entertainment brands. Yet these channels make up an important group on YouTube, one that has turned video game commentators and comedians into bona fide celebrities.

Young girls have slightly different tastes. KidSay's survey found that 33 percent of tween-age girls picked streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Video as their first choice for watching shows.

YouTube is, of course, still very much a winner with young girls.

Susan Polizzotto's daughters Rachel, 9, and Lauren, 11, watch a variety of YouTube channels using their own iPad mini tablets. The kids watch Stampy's Minecraft videos, check out clips on how to paint nails or style hair, and follow a cooking challenge show.

Their behaviors line up with those of other pre-teen girls, a bunch that also named the family video blogs (vlogs) "Shaytards" and "Bratayleys" among their favorite channels in the KidSay survey. The vlogs are reality series-like YouTube shows, but created by real families with their real kids featured prominently. For young girls, the appeal is an intimacy and a connection to the family that feels more real to them than what's on TV, Burke said.

## There's A Smartphone In Most Hands

Hastening the move away from cable is the growing prevalence of smartphones, which are now commonplace among teens.

Fully 88 percent of American teens ages 13 to 17 have or have access to a mobile phone, and 73 percent of teens have smartphones, according to the Pew Research Center. But even tweens are increasingly getting access to their own devices.

"Once kids are tweens, they act like teens, and once they get a phone of their own phone, they're glued to it," said Wynee Tyree, the founder of Smarty Pants. Some kids as young as 8 are getting their own phones, she said, and "most have their own phone by the time they're 12."

If not phones, then tablets or computers. Some kids are even multi-tasking: playing a game on a computer, looking something up on a tablet and watching YouTube on another device, all at the same time.
