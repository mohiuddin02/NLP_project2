For many years, John Forbes Nash Jr. suffered from a terrible mental illness.

He wandered around Princeton University's math building. He talked to himself and wrote mysterious math symbols on the blackboards. He could not tell what was real from what was not real.

Nash was also a genius. He won the Nobel Prize for his ideas. People said he was one of the greatest mathematicians of his time.

## "A Beautiful Mind"

On Saturday, Nash and his wife, Alicia, died in a car accident in New Jersey. He was 86 and Alicia was 82. They were riding in a taxi to their home in Princeton. They had just come back from Norway in Europe, where Nash won an important math prize.

Nash was famous among mathematicians. He was known for his beautiful answers to math problems. More people knew him for his work in game theory. This is the study of how people make decisions.

Nash wrote his famous paper on game theory when he was just 21 years old. It was only 27 pages long, but it has had a huge effect. His ideas have been used by the leaders of countries and companies and unions.

Game theory was invented in the 1940s by two professors. They were interested in what is called "zero-sum" games. These have a winner who takes everything and a loser who gets nothing.

He figured out a way to make sure each person gets the best deal possible.

Nash understood how people argue and work together. Sylvia Nasar called this knowledge one of the most important ideas of the 1900s. Nasar's 1999 book about Nash is called "A Beautiful Mind." The 2001 movie, "A Beautiful Mind," was based on her book. It won an Oscar award.

## Getting The Right Answers

Nash was born June 13, 1928, in West Virginia. When Nash was in fourth grade, his parents were told he was not good in math. He would always get the right answers. The way he solved problems was not in any math book, though.

Nash graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pennsylvania in three years. In that time, he earned two degrees in math. Usually, it takes at least six years to earn both degrees.

At Princeton, Nash hardly attended class. He annoyed other students. He constantly whistled music, and many people did not like him. After just a few weeks there, he had a meeting with Princeton's most famous professor, Albert Einstein.

In Einstein's office, Nash told Einstein some of his ideas. After an hour, Einstein told him he needed to study more.

When Nash was 30, a magazine called him one of America's smartest mathematicians. In 1957, he married Alicia Larde, and the two had a son in 1959.

## In And Out of Hospitals

By then, he was very sick and spent many years in and out of hospitals.

At one point, he thought aliens were sending messages to him through the newspaper. He also turned down a job, saying he was about to become the Emperor of Antarctica.

Alicia divorced him in 1962. Yet, she cared for him over the years in her home. Other mathematicians at Princeton found him work there. In the 1980s, Nash began to get better. His ideas began making sense again. Some mathematicians began pushing for him to get the Nobel Prize in economics. He finally won the prize in 1994.

Alicia and John Nash got married again in 2001.

Their son is also a mathematician with the same mental illness as John. A few years ago, Nash and his wife starting meeting with New Jersey officials. They asked the officials to give more money for programs that help mentally ill people.
