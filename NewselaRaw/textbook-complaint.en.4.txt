Last week, Roni Dean-Burren got a text from her son.

The message was about history.

Her son is named Coby, and he is 15 years old. Coby sent her a photo of a page from a schoolbook. It showed a speech bubble pointing to Africa. The bubble spoke about the slave trade. It said that millions of workers were brought from Africa. They worked on large farms called plantations.

The words upset Dean-Burren. She was an English teacher for 11 years, and she is studying to become a professor. Dean-Burren has spent much time thinking about the power of words. She said she knew what the speech bubble meant.

## Thousands Angry Over Book

Dean-Burren posted her thoughts on Facebook. The book called the slaves "workers," she wrote. It called their move to the United States "immigration." Dean-Burren's ancestors were slaves. She said that the book sounded like they wanted to come to America and that they were paid for their work.

Thousands of people posted about the schoolbook on social media, like Facebook. They wrote that they felt angry. Dean-Burren also posted a video. People saw it at least half a million times.

McGraw-Hill Education put together the schoolbook. On Friday, it apologized on Facebook. It said it made a mistake.

The company promised to change the speech bubble. Now the bubble will say that African slaves were forced to come to America and work.

## Changes Will Be Made Online, Too

The changes will be made in the online book. They will be included the next time the book is printed.

On one hand, Dean-Burren is happy. McGraw-Hill is a big company, and it listened to her.

On the other hand, few students use the online book. The book may not be printed again for 10 years.

Dean-Burren and her son heard about the decision to change the book. Soon afterward, they were sitting next to each other. Coby called his mother's cellphone.

He told her to answer her phone. He reminded her about something she had told him.

She said to call her when he knew he could change the world.
