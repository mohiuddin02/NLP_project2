TOPEKA, Kan. â€” People who are very poor can get help from the government. The money they receive is known as welfare.

On Thursday, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed a new welfare law. It creates tougher rules for Kansans getting welfare.

The law shortens the time a person can receive money. It also stops people from spending welfare money on anything they want.

Brownback, a Republican, said the law will help people take care of themselves. He said it will make them try harder to find work. New jobs will help them get out of poverty, he said.

## Work Is In, Movies Are Out

People receiving welfare will now have to do something in return for the money. They will have two choices. They will have to work at least 20 hours a week or do job training.

They also will no longer be able to spend their welfare money on just anything. For example, they will not be allowed to use it to go to the movies.

The purpose of the law is "to get people back to work," Brownback said.

## This Law Is Mean, Critics Say

Some parts of the law have angered people. For example, some people do not like the rule that affects people who lie to get welfare. Now, the liar won't be the only one who gets punished. Every grown person living in the same home will also be punished. They will never be able to get welfare. It won't matter if they knew about the lying or not.

Another new rule also has people upset. It punishes Kansans who are arrested for drugs. People who are arrested twice for drugs won't get welfare for the rest of their lives.

Brownback said that if there are problems, the law can be changed. Yet, some lawmakers are unhappy with the law. They think it is mean.

There are more poor Kansans than ever before, lawmaker Anthony Hensley said. The new law punishes them, he said. It also looks down on them, he added.

The law will make it harder for poor Kansans, Hensley said.

Tom Burroughs is another lawmaker who is upset with the law. Burroughs said Kansas should be improving schools instead. It should be creating jobs, too.

All Kansans should have "a fair chance to succeed," Burroughs said.

## Only $25 A Day From The Bank

The law also includes a new rule on how much welfare people get each day. They will only be allowed to take out $25 a day from the bank. In the past, people got money once a month. They could decide on their own how much to spend each day.

Lawmaker Travis Couture-Lovelady thinks the $25-a-day rule is a good idea. It helps make sure people only buy important things like food, he said.

Some people spend welfare money on the wrong things, he said. Doing that "hurts the folks who are using the program in the correct manner."

Shannon Cotsoradis runs the group Kansas Action for Children. She said the new law is bad for mothers and young children. It forces women to return to work soon after having a baby.

Women who do not go back to work quickly will stop receiving welfare. Women who do go back will spend less time with their children. Cotsoradis says children will lose out either way.

"It's always been hard to be poor in Kansas," Cotsoradis said. "Now, it's going to be a lot harder."
