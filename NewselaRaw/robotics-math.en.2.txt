HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. â€” Often, it is the best students who do not get enough attention in class.

That's the view of Sabrina Walters, a teacher at Huntersville Elementary School in Huntersville, North Carolina. She has come up with a solution to make sure this does not happen.

The school is letting the best students work on projects that teach them to think more creatively and solve problems.

Students who test out of math, for instance, can learn robotics instead.

## That Was Easy. Next!

On a recent day, a group of third-graders in the robotics program practiced working as a team. Their challenge was to build a pyramid using plastic cups. The catch was that they could not touch the cups with their hands. They could only use a rubber band attached to several strings. It took them just 10 minutes.

This spring, they will compete against teams from other schools in a robotics contest called Rockin' Robotics. The contest promotes teamwork and problem-solving skills using science and technology.

In the robotics class, the students learn to build and program Lego Mindstorms robot kits. Walters said it teaches them to cooperate and work together with others. "They will learn how to shape their futures" by creating technology, not just buying it, she said.

The students must create something that people would be interested in buying. They can make something entirely new or they can choose to improve on something that already exists.

## Lots Of Big Ideas

The kids have not yet decided on a project, but their ideas range from the ambitious to just plain fun. Kids have suggested making a skateboard that teaches people how to learn, as well as a remote-controlled car. The competition will be held May 30.

Last year, six teams of about 10 students each took part in the contest. Walters was teaching at another school at the time. Her class there won second place for its electric guitar. The first-place winners made an automatic dog-feeder.

So far, students have learned how to write computer code. They also joined in a contest run by the Parent Teacher Association (PTA).

One of the students, Colin Edelman, said the robotics class has taught him about teamwork and how to solve problems creatively.

Colin wants to build a small robotic model of the Statue of Liberty that could move and lift up its torch. The Statue of Liberty is a huge statue on Liberty Island outside New York City. His robot model would also include facts about New York and how the statue came to America from France.

"You could ask questions to it and it'd be sort of like Siri," he said. Siri is the computerized voice on an iPhone.

He rates the class a nine out of 10 because it is interesting and challenging.

"Our weakness right now is probably that we don't really work together that well yet," Colin said. "But our strength eventually will be working as a team because that's how we'll end up winning."
