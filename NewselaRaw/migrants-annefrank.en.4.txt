President Barack Obama promised to let 10,000 Syrians come to America. Their country is at war. Millions of Syrians have left. They are trying to find safety in other countries. Some people in the United States do not want the Syrians to come.

About 75 years ago, there was another war. It was called World War II. There was also another group of refugees, the Jews. They also faced terrible danger in their home countries. During the war, Jews were killed and badly treated because of their religion. Like the Syrians today, the Jews wanted to come to the U.S. Also like today, people did not want to let them in.

Otto Frank and his family were Jewish. They lived in the Netherlands. His wife was Edith and his daughters were named Anne and Margot. Anne wrote her thoughts and feelings in a diary. After the war, her father made it into a book. He called it "The Diary of Anne Frank."

## Papers Tell Frank Family's Story

Richard Breitman is a history professor. In 2007, he wrote about some old papers. They tell how the Franks tried to come to the U.S.

Breitman said government rules kept the family from coming to the U.S. If the rules were different, Anne Frank might be alive today. She would be 77 years old.

Instead, she died when she was 15 years old.

At the time, people thought these rules would make the country safe. They also wanted to keep out people from other countries. Some people worried the Jews were spies. Many people are against the Syrians today for similar reasons. The Islamic State is a violent group. It has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. People think their fighters could hide among the Syrians. They worry that they could sneak into the United States and make trouble.

## Refugees Tried To Enter U.S. Many Years Ago TooÂ 

In 1939, the German army took over the Netherlands. They did not allow Jews to be teachers or be in government jobs. Jews could not own businesses. Their children had to go to special schools for Jews.

Otto Frank tried to come to the U.S. with his family. The government did not let them. He lived through the war but his wife and two daughters died.

In 1944, Anne Frank wrote in her diary that terrible things were happening. "I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart."
