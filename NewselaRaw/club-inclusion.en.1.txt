LOS ANGELES â€” InterVarsity Christian Fellowship members say they want to provide a welcoming space for all college students, believers or nonbelievers alike. Because it requires its leaders to hold Christian beliefs, however, the evangelical student group is now struggling to maintain its religious soul.

Chapters of InterVarsity and some other Christian groups were stripped of recognition at California State University campuses this fall because they refused to sign a nondiscrimination policy. The policy would require clubs and organizations to open their memberships and leadership to all students.

Cal State's so-called all-comers policy would mean that a student could join any student group regardless of his or her personal background. This could have some unexpected consequences. A Republican could conceivably run for and win election to lead the Democratic club. A white undergraduate could lead the Chinese Student Association. A nonmusician could be selected to lead the classical guitar club.

## "It's About Our Integrity"

Groups that refuse to agree to the all-comers policy and lose recognition can continue meeting on campus, but without free or cheap access to meeting rooms. They also are barred from participating in student fairs and cannot receive funding from campus student associations.

InterVarsity students consider that unfair. The group maintains that membership is open to everyone, but leadership positions should be held only by believers. Those who lead Bible study and prayers, for example, should believe in the religious teachings they are passing on, said Gregory L. Jao, a national field director for InterVarsity.

Jao went on to argue that the policy is achieving the opposite of what it is intended to achieve. The goal of the policy is to make sure that no one is excluded or discriminated against based on their background or beliefs. According to Jao, the effect of the policy is to exclude religious groups from campus communities.

For some in InterVarsity, not signing the all-comers policy was a matter of principle. "I don't think a non-Christian would want to be a leader in a Christian group," said music major Jasmine Kim, 22. "But it's about our integrity."

## The Supreme Court Rules

Cal State is not the only university confronting this issue. Other universities across the country have enforced anti-bias policies and faced the same hard questions. At the core of the debate is the question of whether religious groups should be held to the same standards as everyone else.

This question has made its way to the nation's highest court. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a California law school had the right to deny recognition to a Christian student group that excluded gay students. Since then, InterVarsity and other Christian groups have been denied recognition at Vanderbilt, Tufts and other universities for not agreeing to anti-discrimination policies.

Cal State's position is especially troubling for InterVarsity because it has hundreds of members on nearly all 23 Cal State campuses. Cal State is the nation's largest university system, with 450,000 students.

The University of California may follow Cal State's example. Spokeswoman Shelly Meron said the University of California system is reevaluating the rules regarding campus organizations. The rules do not currently require leadership positions to be open to all students, but that may soon change.

## A Little Respect?

Some legal scholars say that what is happening to religious groups on college campuses is just one example of what is happening across the country. They argue that religious groups have less independence than they used to, and religious thought has become less respected in American culture.

Edward Whelan is one such critic. He is the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an organization that describes itself as being "dedicated to applying the Judeo-Christian moral tradition to critical issues of public policy." Whelan argues that the Supreme Court decision of 2010 went against tradition and common sense.

"Prior to the (Supreme Court) ruling, everyone would recognize that it's absurd to tell college Democrats they have to accept leaders who aren't Democrats," he said. He added that everyone used to "recognize the core value of freedom of association and the ability of groups to have their own standards and leaders within broad bounds."

Other groups, however, said the Cal State system would be following the law as long as it applied standards evenly and to everyone equally.

"These groups aren't just claiming a right to discriminate when selecting leaders, they're insisting on a right to do so with government money and support," said Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's program on freedom of religion and belief.

Cal State officials have said that they are bound by long-standing university policy as well as state law, which prohibits discrimination in any program funded by the state.
