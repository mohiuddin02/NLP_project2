Last month, two injured pelicans arrived at SeaWorld's rescue center.

They were brought in just one day apart. Pierre and Claire, as the team called them, were both hurt, confused and lonely.

Then they spotted each other.

"They got very excited," said Sherry Branch, better known as "The Bird Lady." Branch is SeaWorld's head of aviculture, which means the keeping, feeding and housing of birds.

"They immediately waddled toward one another," Branch said. "I think it was comforting for them just to have someone else of the same species."

## Birds Are Rare For Rescuers

American white pelicans are rare in the world of Florida bird rescue. The team at the center in Orlando's SeaWorld had not seen one in nearly 10 years, maybe longer. Brown pelicans are much more common than whites. Browns are the ones that annoy fishermen by swooping in and stealing their fish.

Pierre, perhaps a year old, had been found in a lake near Bradenton, Florida.

"Its wing appeared to be broken, but he could swim OK," said Ed Straight. He is the president of the Wildlife Education and Rehabilitation Center on Anna Maria Island in Florida.

Probably, Pierre had become tangled in fishing line left in the lake, Straight said. The pelican had broken his wing trying to free himself.

Straight and his wife drove the pelican to SeaWorld's rescue center. It is located just beyond the marine park.

That was on March 7.

## Another Bird In Trouble

A day later, a state wildlife officer and a county police officer were patrolling a nearby river in a boat. They saw a small, struggling white pelican in the water.

"It took us a while to get it, but once we did and pulled the pelican into the boat, we could see it was really serious," said Heidi Cogburn. She works for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

"I don't know how that bird lived," added Orange County Deputy Kevin Oglesby. He also said it was amazing Claire was not eaten by an alligator.

## She Had Been Shot, And Could Have Died

Claire, it turned out, was at least 3 years old and had been shot. Maybe a duck hunter shot her by accident or maybe someone fired at her on purpose. Her injuries were likely several weeks old. Much longer, and she would have died.

Lara Croft is a veterinarian at SeaWorld. She said Claire's injury was so bad she had no choice but to operate and remove part of the pelican's wing. "Even though she'll never be able to fly, the wing also helps with balance" when she walks, Croft said.

Meanwhile, X-rays of Pierre showed an injured joint that had already started to heal.

Pierre has not left Claire's side, except when workers have to change her bandages.

"They're always right next to each other," Croft says. "They walk together. They swim together. They rest together."

## Share And Share Alike

For now, while they are healing, they share a yard, with plants and shade and their own private pond. Claire hides behind Pierre, scurrying to the far end of the yard when humans approach. Pierre protects Claire. His eyes look back and forth between the strangers and her, keeping a watch on both.

Croft, the veterinarian, hopes Pierre can eventually be released into the wild.

Claire, however, would not live very long if she were set free.

## Claire Will End Up With A Pair Of Suitors

"They have formed this very tight bond," and it would be sad to separate the two pelicans, Croft said. "But obviously, if he is able to fly, we want him to have as natural a life as possible."

Claire would not be lonely for long. Although SeaWorld's Pelican Point has many brown pelicans, a pair of American white pelicans have made their home there. Both of them are males.

"There are two handsome men out there just waiting for her," Branch says. "She'll have a good life."
