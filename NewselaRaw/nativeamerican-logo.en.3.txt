Many call the team's mascot and logo insulting to Native Americans. Calls to change the logo have been growing. So far, though, the team has refused to budge.

The town of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, shares something in common with the Washington Redskins. It has also used a picture of a Native American on its logo for a long time. The picture appears all over: on the town's official letters, business cards, cars and website.

Now the town is thinking of dropping that picture.

Perhaps unexpectedly, one group is against the change: [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American). The Ramapough Lenape Nation — the closest tribe to the town — is objecting to the switch.

## Chief Says It's Fine The Way It Is

Dwaine Perry, a Ramapough chief, said that there is a vast difference between the Franklin Lakes logo and the Redskins' logo. The first "represents the native people" with dignity; the second is insulting and cartoonish. Perry thinks the town should continue to include a picture of a Native American in its official logo.

Very few of Franklin Lakes' inhabitants are Native American. Still, the region has deep Native American roots.

Some time ago the town government asked students at Indian Hills High School to come up with possible new logos. It then posted an online survey asking people to choose between two new logos. One featured a scene of Franklin Lake. The other also featured Franklin Lake, but added the face of a Native American in front of it.

Of the 900 people who responded, three out of four picked the logo without the Native American.

People were also allowed to comment on the logo change. Most of the 200 comments focused on the same question: Would including a picture of a Native American be insulting — or just true to history?

## All Sides Should Be Considered

Some Native Americans expressed their opinion on the matter.

"We're tired of people trying to decide what would offend us," said Autumn Wind Scott. Scott is a Ramapough council member.

Artist Barbara Lawshe designed the current logo back in the late 1960s. When she found out that Franklin Lakes might change its logo, she first thought: "That's fine — give mine a rest after all these years."

However, when she learned that the Native American figure could be dropped, she changed her mind. "That's ridiculous," she said. "History is history — you can't change it."

Mayor Frank Bivona said the survey was not a vote but rather a way to measure opinion. The final decision will be made by town officials.

The town's government has not decided when — or if — it will change the logo. One official, Gregory C. Hart, said he was surprised at the way the Ramapough feel. He did admit, however, that the town had not contacted the Ramapough before announcing the possible change.

## Important Local History Lesson

The history of Franklin Lakes has deep Native American roots. Native Americans known as Minsis were in the area well before Europeans arrived. They lived along the Ramapo River in Franklin Cove and fished in Franklin Lake.

Among the Minsis, land and water were not owned but shared. When European settlers arrived, they offered to buy Minsi land. The Minsis believed the European goods were gifts, instead of a way of paying for their land.

Lawshe said she looked at history books when she created the current logo. "They needed something that would represent the history of the town," she recalled.

Jackie Bunker-Lohrenz is one of the town's librarians. She said she was impressed that Lawshe decided to remind people of how Native Americans had shaped the history of Franklin Lakes.

"Not everybody includes that history," Bunker-Lohrenz said.

And that's something Perry doesn't want the people of Franklin Lakes to forget.

If not for the Native Americans who "settled this area," he said, things would have been very different: Franklin Lakes would not have become a town.
