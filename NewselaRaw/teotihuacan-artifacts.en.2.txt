Scientists with the Mexican government announced Wednesday that three new chambers have been discovered at the end of a tunnel under the ancient mountain city of Teotihuacan. The tunnel was first discovered in 2003.

Mexican archaeologists say that the new rooms contained thousands of objects, including carved statues, rubber balls, jade from Guatemala and a wooden box of shells. Beyond some traces of skin, however, no bodies have been discovered. Nonetheless, archaeologists suspect that there is a burial chamber somewhere in the tunnel.

"Just before the chambers is where we found very important offerings," says Sergio Gomez, who directs the excavation project. Such offerings would likely have been made to honor a dead person of great importance. There were many of them, alongside many other objects.

## City Of Mystery

Archaeologists know very little about Teotihuacan, which is located just outside of Mexico City. The tunnel was discovered 11 years ago under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, which sits at the heart of the ancient city.

"These findings are very important," commented Professor George Cowgill, who directs a research center at Teotihuacan. They are significant "both for the quantity and the quality of materials being discovered." It will probably take years of study to truly understand the significance of each object and the reasons they were placed together, he added.

Teotihuacan was founded around 150 B.C. and collapsed sometime in the seventh century A.D., long before Europeans arrived in the New World. At its peak it was probably the most powerful city in all of North America, dominating even the Classic Maya, who existed at the same time. The Maya were located in the lowlands far to the east in what is now southern Mexico and Guatemala.

The inhabitants of Teotihuacan, unlike the Maya, did not have a system of writing and thus we know very little about how they lived or ran their city. For instance, archaeologists disagree about the nature of their political structure. One side believes there was a single all-powerful ruler. The other claims there was a system of joint rule involving four competing groups.

Unfortunately, neither images of Teotihuacan's kings nor royal burials have yet been discovered. The discovery of a royal burial under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent might change everything known about the city.

## Wooden Box Of Seashells

The tunnel was first discovered when a heavy rainstorm exposed a shaft that led to a spot about halfway down the tunnel's length. The shaft's function remains a mystery, though it could have been used for astronomical purposes. Scientists believe the tunnel had a ceremonial purpose.

Over the next decade Gomez's team dug out the tunnel and found numerous offerings. A high point came in 2013 with the discovery of two chambers on either side of the tunnel, which were filled with mirrors and strange crystal spheres.

Beyond the point in the tunnel where those chambers are located the soil is extremely wet.

"The water has made our work move slower," Gomez says. However, "the large quantity of water below has enabled the preservation of materials like wood, rubber and even skin fragments."

He and his team announced Wednesday that three more chambers lay beyond the initial two, arranged in a sort of cross just a few dozen feet down the tunnel. In and around those chambers he found more puzzling objects. They include a wooden box filled with shells imported from the ocean and carved by stone tools.

## Digging For A Burial Site

In addition, there were four 2-foot-tall jade statues, rubber balls and jaguar remains. They also found fragments of skin, although they can't be sure yet if the skin is human. Human or not, there are no obvious burials in any of the chambers â€” but that does not mean that the quest for a Teotihuacan burial is over.

The newly discovered objects could be offerings, Cowgill observed. However, he said, given the "large number of rather plain jars" they could also be the remains of a huge feast that was part of a funeral ceremony. Cowgill added that other objects in the chambers support the idea that women had an important position in Teotihuacan society and show that trade was carried out with distant peoples.

Gomez's team is in the process of excavating the rooms down to the floors. He said it is possible there are buried nobles hidden under rubble or even below the chamber floors.

"It's very exciting because it" supports the theory "that this could be an offering for something more important that lies beneath," Gomez said. He believes that there is a burial site "but we won't know for sure until next year."
