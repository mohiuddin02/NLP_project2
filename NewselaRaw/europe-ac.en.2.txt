VIENNA, Austria — Temperatures approached 100 degrees outside the Palais Coburg Hotel in Vienna, Austria. There, important talks concerning the Iranian nuclear program were taking place.

Iran's nuclear program had been in discussion for many weeks. It is a hot topic due to the danger of nuclear weapons and what it means for a country to possess nuclear energy or nuclear weapons. Inside the Palais Coburg Hotel, where world leaders were engaged in delicate negotiations, it was even hotter than 100 degrees.

"You have no idea what our room is like," one government leader said.

"The Coburg Hotel is a lovely hotel," he added. Still, "air conditioning is not what they did best."

## No AC Office Fights In Europe

Air conditioning may be considered normal in the United States. It makes warm places like Florida, Texas, and California's Central Valley livable during the summer. It may also set off office battles in the United States between men and women over what the proper temperatures should be.

There are no such disputes in Europe. Europeans hate the idea of air conditioning. Many note that it uses a lot of energy that helps drive the production of the greenhouse gases blamed for increasing global temperatures.

Travel websites are filled with stories — mostly from women — of how unpleasant the United States is with its artificial cold. Many Europeans report returning home ill.

## Sweltering Homes, Tinderbox Trains

In Germany, a government website recently advised sweating citizens to turn on a fan. Only 2 percent of German homes are air conditioned. Still, there are those who wonder if citizens really need to live so uncomfortably. Summers are, after all, getting hotter. Not Texas or Florida hot, but by European standards, sweltering.

Take, for example, the trains.

When Germans set up their train system, they added air conditioning. The air conditioning inside trains keeps passengers cool as long as the temperatures outside do not go higher than 89.6 degrees. The German agency that runs the trains admitted there was no plan for temperatures above that.

With more and more days of higher temperatures, German trains have gained a reputation as being extremely hot. Windows also do not open on high-speed trains.

Frank Boehnke, spokesman for the Association of German Rail Users, said passengers wonder how trains that can travel at more than 200 miles per hour can have such outdated air conditioning. The association represents German train riders.

"We have complaints every year. The temperature inside the trains can reach 122 degrees," Boehnke said. "Passengers can be locked up in such conditions for hours."

At times, the problem is obvious to all. On Aug. 3, a high-speed train from Berlin to Munich was sitting in the Stuttgart station when one of its overworked air conditioning units burst into flames.

## Sorry, The "Hitzekuppel" Is Closed

Trains are not the only place in Germany that could use an air conditioning upgrade. The temperature in the transparent cupola above the Bundestag, where the German parliament meets, has reached 104 many times this summer. The temperature has been recorded as high as 120. Around Berlin, its new nickname is "Hitzekuppel" or "heat dome" and tourists have passed out after making the climb to it. As such, it's often been closed during Berlin's peak tourist season.

Hotels either do not offer air conditioning or it doesn't work. Even grocery stores are unpleasant; entire sections of produce are thrown out for having over-ripened in the extreme temperatures.

## Germany Says AC Harms The Planet

Still, the German government is hesitant to recommend more air conditioning. This month, the German Ministry of the Environment excluded air conditioning specifically from aid provided to help people adapt to climate change.

"Air conditioning is ruled out as it works against the protection of the environment," it said.

The ministry called air conditioning a good example of a win-lose scenario: Those seeking relief from the heat might win, but the planet loses and it leads to more climate change problems in the long run.

Still, officials are not quite sure what they would suggest if faced with another summer like 2003. In that year, an estimated 70,000 Europeans died from heat-related causes.
