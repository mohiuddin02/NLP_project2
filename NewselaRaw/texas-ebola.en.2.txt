<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20141002_Ebola_updates.jpg" />EULESS, Texas â€” Carolyn Woahloe said what everybody was thinking: Some Texans are blaming her and her fellow Liberians for the first Ebola case to be diagnosed in the United States.

It started after a Liberian named Thomas Eric Duncan traveled to the Dallas area from West Africa, became ill and eventually tested positive for the deadly virus that has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa. Since then, Woahloe and others have heard the whispers and threats.

"Go back to Liberia."

On Wednesday night, Woahloe, a registered nurse, appeared with several Liberian pastors and community leaders to say, "Please don't blame Liberians."

## "This Is A World Problem"

Woahloe said she got calls from at least two Liberian workers who said people told them they should leave the United States. The nurse said she told the callers to stand their ground.

"If I am Liberian, that doesn't mean that I have Ebola," Woahloe said at a news conference at the New Life Fellowship Church in this Dallas suburb. "This is not a Liberian problem. This is a world problem."

A group of about 10 leaders stood together as a sign of solidarity, next to a drum set featuring African bongos. Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, addressed a crowd of reporters who had urgent questions:

"Do you know the Ebola patient?"

"Where is the patient's family?"

"Is the community concerned for its image?"

Gaye said the last thing Liberians need is to be blamed as a group.

"We want to work together with the Dallas community and with the people of the Liberian community to get as much information out about this as possible," he said.

## What To Do About The Borders

Health officials have said Duncan showed no sign of illness when he left Liberia. Still, someone asked whether Liberia's borders should be closed to keep other infected people from leaving.

One community leader jumped up and took the microphone, eager to respond.

"When you close the borders of a country, you don't just restrict the movement of people," local Liberian Pastor Emmanuel Botchway said. "Once you stop travel, you put a stop to trade and commerce. That would be terrible for Liberia."

Gaye said the Liberian community had met a month ago with officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Dallas area to learn what they could do for relatives suffering from Ebola back home in the impoverished nation. Health care in Liberia is not the best and even ambulances are scarce.

The CDC is responsible for protecting America from health, safety and security threats due to disease.

But since Duncan was found to have the disease, Gaye said, the community has not heard from health officials, though the community has tried to reach out.

## Helping Those Back Home

Harling Moore, pastor at New Life Fellowship Church, said the Liberian community, which numbers about 10,000 throughout central Texas, has more to worry about than its public image. They are concerned with their countrymen in Africa who are dying.

"We've been in communication with loved ones back home," he said. "We're offering advice on how to deal with this disease, and we are sending supplies."

In the church parking lot, officials pointed to a semi-trailer they said was loaded with medical supplies to be sent to two hospitals in Liberia.

If the borders were closed, they said, aid could not get in.

"This is more than just about words," said Moore, who fled civil war in Liberia and has lived in Dallas for 14 years. "This is a life-and-death situation. But we are trying to stay positive, encouraging one another and letting the community know that we are possible victims in this situation as well."

Jimmy Sando, a Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport worker, stood among the community leaders. "Every major disease ... known to man starts somewhere, but it doesn't stay in one place," he said. "It spreads. Like HIV and AIDS spread."

So please don't point a finger at Liberia, he pleaded.

"This disease has been around since the 1970s. It ... spread to countries like Nigeria and Liberia. You can't blame Liberians, just like you can't blame any one nation for AIDS. That's just fear talking. Here, there is one case. Back home, there are many, many cases."

## Come Forward For Care

Ebola is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of infected people who have signs of the disease, such as bleeding or vomiting. One cannot become infected by breathing in the Ebola virus through the air.

Botchway said pastors in the nine local Liberian churches would spread the word about the disease on Sunday. They will urge citizens who might have come in contact with Duncan to go to the hospital and to contact the CDC.

"We will tell them that this is not a disease of shame," he said. "If you think you might be infected, or if you know someone else, please come forward."

But don't even think of returning to your homeland because of mean-spirited comments, Woahloe stressed.

One of the women who called her said she had to go home, Woahloe said. "And I told her, 'Don't go anywhere. Just go to work.'"
