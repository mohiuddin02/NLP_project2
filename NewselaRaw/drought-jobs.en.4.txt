California is very dry right now. Very little rain has fallen there for a long time. It is a big problem for California's farmers.

California grows more fruits and vegetables than any other state. Farming takes a lot of water. Now farmers have to change the way they grow their crops.

Last year, California farmers stopped using some of their land. They were told to not use it to save water. They took part of their farmland and set it aside. They did not plant any crops on it. They knew the plants' roots would drink all of the water.

Now scientists say farmers might have to set aside twice as much land this year. They say the dry weather in 2015 will be much worse than it was in 2014.

## Fewer Farm Jobs In California

Wendy Fink-Weber works for a group that speaks for farmers. She says California lost about 17,000 farm jobs in 2014. She says that could mean more work for farmers in other states.

Farmers in other states could start planting some of the crops California cannot grow. But they could only plant the ones that would grow right away. Plants like almonds will not work. Almonds can take three to seven years of growing before they are ready to sell.

Farmers cannot stop growing on land where they planted fruit and nut trees. The farmers would have to pull up all of the trees and start over.

Instead, farmers will work on keeping the trees alive. The farmers will not water the trees a lot. They would grow larger and more delicious crops, but it would use up a lot of water. Instead, farmers will water the trees just enough to keep them alive.

## There Are Water Rules To Follow

Dry weather is normal in California. But it has gone a long time with no rain. Now California has to use more groundwater.

Groundwater is water in underground pools, like water from a well. The pools form naturally. They take a long time to fill back up on their own.

In the spring, melting snow usually gives the state water. The water from the snow can be used to water farmers' plants. This year, there was only a little bit of snow.

California has made new laws because of the water shortage. The laws say how much water people can use. Farmers do not have to follow some of the rules because water is such an important part of their jobs.

Many people want to help the farmers. Richard Howitt, who teaches at the University of California, wants to help, too.

He says farmers should grow different kinds of crops. When dry weather hits, the crops that need the most water could die. The plants that do not need much water might be OK.
