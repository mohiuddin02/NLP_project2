WASHINGTON â€” The three Democratic senators all fought the tobacco companies. They sponsored legislation to stop smoking on airplanes. They led efforts to get rid of smoking scenes in films. They successfully sued the tobacco companies for misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.

The three are Dick Durbin of Illinois, Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. They were at it again at a recent hearing. They questioned bosses from an industry. They said they were selling an unhealthy product and an unsafe message to young people.

But the subject of their anger was not tobacco. It was energy drinks. The sweetened beverages have caffeine to give a quick energy boosts. They have become increasingly popular over the last decade. High school and college students  often use them to study late into the night.

The senators want to make it harder for minors to get the drinks. The hearing was the biggest moment yet in that effort.

## "Keep 'Em For Life"

Energy drink companies say the senators overstate the health risk of caffeine to teenagers. But Durbin, Markey and Blumenthal are using lessons they learned when they fought against the sale and advertising of cigarettes to children under age 18.

They have asked the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the safety of energy drinks. They have urged high school and college sports groups to teach athletes about the risks of combining the drinks with exercise. Now they are focusing their efforts on how the companies promote and advertise their product. They claim the companies target young people.

At a recent hearing, Markey showed photos from energy drink companies' Facebook pages. Children were posing with cans of their products at public events. He talked about the tobacco industry trying to attract young smokers. It wanted to replace older customers who were dying off.

"Hook 'em early, keep 'em for life," he said. "Makes a lot of sense to me as a marketing promotion."

## A 14-Year-Old's Death

The campaign on energy drinks began early last year. It followed the death of 14-year-old Anais Fournier. The Maryland teenager had a bad valve in her heart. Fournier died after she apparently drank two 24-ounce cans of Monster energy drink in a 24-hour period.

Doctors said there was a change in her heart rate. They said it was "due to caffeine intoxication." Essentially, this is caffeine poisoning. The two drinks contained as much caffeine as 14 cans of soda. That's five times the amount recommended as they daily limit for teens. Monster Beverage has repeatedly denied any link between its product and Fournier's death.

A government report really worried the senators. It showed the number of emergency room visits involving energy drinks doubled to nearly 21,000 from 2007 to 2011. About 1,500 of those visits were by children aged 12 to 17.

Medical professionals tend to agree that energy drinks are not safe for minors. Young people are more likely to suffer the effects from large amounts of caffeine. The energy drink industry disagrees. It argues that caffeine has been studied for years and is safe.

## Teens Targeted By Ads

Rodney Sacks runs Monster.  He said during the Senate hearing that the company's products contain about 10 milligrams of caffeine per ounce. Most coffee served in coffee bars has twice that amount, he said. He and other industry officials said that teens drink far more caffeine from coffee, tea and soft drinks.

Blumenthal said energy drinks were not as bad as cigarettes. "Tobacco kills the consumer," he said. "Energy drinks can be bad for kids," but they are not as deadly.

The senators do not like how the energy drink industry advertises the beverages. The companies buy advertising on networks popular with youth such as MTV. They pay for development programs for teenage athletes. They sponsor concerts and sporting events that attract young people.

Blumenthal said it was like when tobacco companies used cowboys and cartoon characters that young people would find cool.

Industry officials said at the Senate hearing that their target customers are men between 18 and 35. They argued that their advertising is aimed at sporting events with broad appeal. They said they are not trying to target teens.
