LOS ANGELES — Seventy feet below Wilshire Boulevard, subway construction crews were hard at work. Fresh air roaring from giant ventilation pipes partly covered up the sickly sweet smell of petroleum.

Amid the clatter of jackhammers and the whine of a mini-excavator, paleontologist Kim Scott scouted the tarry muck for relics from a long-buried beach. She had plenty of choices in her search for remains of prehistoric life. Scott is a field and laboratory director with Cogstone Resource Management in Orange.

Major construction on the highly anticipated Westside subway extension won't begin until next year. But an exploratory shaft has already been dug at the corner of Ogden Drive to check soil conditions for future stations and tunnels. This preparatory work has already burped up a bonanza of prehistoric swag.

Officials had anticipated encountering a substantial cache: The dig is near the famed La Brea Tar Pits, where many prehistoric remains have been discovered over the years. And it features sandy soil rich with naturally occurring asphalt — a fossil haven.

## "Last Great Ice Age"

Paleontologists have recovered mollusks, asphalt-saturated sand dollars, pieces of driftwood and Monterey cypress cones. For Scott, two finds are particularly exciting: a rock embedded with what appears to be part of a sea lion's mouth, perhaps 2 million years old, and a non-fossilized 10-foot limb from a digger pine tree. That tree would look right at home today in Central California woodlands.

"The best record of life from the last great ice age in the world is found" on this stretch of Wilshire Boulevard, said Scott.

In the shaft, she added, "you're walking along an ice age shoreline."

The former Rancho La Brea area of Hancock Park and its surrounding areas indeed feature one of the world's premier paleontological troves. Over many thousands of years, petroleum from once massive underground oil fields oozed to the surface. It formed into bogs that trapped and killed unwary animals, and then preserved their skeletons.

Evidence abounds at the tar pits, where right in the heart of Los Angeles scientists have uncovered remnants of dire wolves, saber-toothed cats, ground sloths and other species.

The swimming-pool-size shaft, 18 feet wide by 38 feet long, is yielding evidence from its depths of a cooler, wetter Pleistocene climate of 100,000 to 330,000 years ago. Back then, Pacific Ocean waves lapped over what is now the bustling Miracle Mile stretch of Wilshire Boulevard. Materials from the upper 40 feet of the shaft range from the modern era to 50,000 years old. Below that is "near shore" material from 100,000 to 330,000 years ago, Scott said.

## A Mammoth Named Zed

This latest uncovering of prehistoric remnants follows major earlier discoveries in the same part of town. In 2006, the largest known cache of fossils from the last ice age was uncovered during the excavation for a nearby underground garage.

In one spectacular instance back then, a worker scraped his bulldozer across what turned out to be a nearly intact skeleton of a Columbian mammoth with 10-foot-long tusks. Researchers named the beast Zed.

Scientists were thrilled with the find, given that previous discoveries in the tar pits had included only bits and pieces of mammoths. So that construction could resume as quickly as possible, paleontologists pioneered a process similar to that used to move large living trees. After identifying the edges of each of 16 deposits, they dug around and underneath them. They then wrapped the deposits in heavy plastic, built wooden crates around them and lifted them out with a heavy crane.

Similar discoveries are expected once excavation begins for the Fairfax station, and scientists plan to use the same extraction method.

The exploratory shaft now being dug will be twice as deep as any other previous excavation in the area. At this stage, the marine finds are quite portable: geoducks, clams, snails, mussels, tusk shells. They're collected in takeout-food containers made of plastic, so that the asphalt does not stick. As for the rock that possibly contains a sea lion's tooth root, Scott explained that it probably washed out of an old formation and floated down a stream to the beach.

"Even though we're finding fossils older than what's found at La Brea, none of the identified fossils found to date are extinct," Scott said. "We can still find all the plants and animals in California."

## Working 15-Hour Days

Asphalt from an earlier descent already coated Scott's jeans, work boots and right forearm when she headed back down the steep metal steps into the hole one recent afternoon. The uneven surface at the base made it tough to balance. She stepped back with one foot, which sank immediately into ankle-deep water. Above the fresh muck, wood and concrete had been installed to hold back the soil.

Bethany Ader, another paleontologist, scrambled up and down a slippery slope of tar sand carrying small relics. The two scientists have routinely worked 15-hour days.

Work on the shaft began last April, and subway workers expect to hit 75 feet by the end of March. They will then excavate an additional 2 feet to pour a concrete slab floor.

Once the shaft is completed, it will be covered by street grating. Over the next six months, engineers will enter the shaft periodically to check for water and to determine how the soils will react during the subway tunneling and station construction.

At some point years hence, commuters will walk through the subterranean station, unaware that they're surrounded by the remnants of a distant sea.

Along this stretch of Wilshire, said subway system spokesman Dave Sotero, "L.A.'s prehistoric past is meeting its subway future."
