CHARLESTON, S.C. â€” A white former police officer will go on trial for the death of an unarmed black man.

A grand jury indicted, or charged, Michael Slager with murder on Monday. In South Carolina, a grand jury is made up of 18 people. They listen to the evidence of a case and make a decision on criminal charges.

Slager was a police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina. He is accused of shooting 50-year-old Walter Scott in the back after a traffic stop.

The April 4 shooting was recorded on a cellphone by a person standing nearby. It showed Slager firing as Scott ran away from him. The shooting stirred up a national discussion about how black people are treated by white police officers.

## Police Department Fired The Officer

Slager was fired from the police force immediately after the video became public.

"The jury will make up its own mind after it sees the video and hears the other testimony," said Scarlett Wilson. She is a lawyer for the government. It is not known when Slager will go on trial.

In the last six months, three other grand juries charged white officers for shooting black men.

Walter Scott's brother Rodney Scott said the family is "very happy and pleased" with the charges against Slager.

The 33-year-old Slager has been jailed since his arrest. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder.

Slager's lawyer did not want to comment about the charges.

Chris Stewart is a lawyer for Scott's family.

"Today was just an example of if you keep the faith, even in the darkest times, you will see the light," Stewart said.

After the shooting, Slager told police he tried to stun Scott with his Taser gun, but it did not work. Slager said the two men fought over it, and he fired his handgun at Scott to defend himself.

## Cellphone Video Became Worldwide News

The video shows the two men wrestling over what looks like the stun gun. Then Scott ran away and the officer began firing at him.

Another video was taken from a camera in the officer's car. It shows Slager running and chasing Scott after the traffic stop.

After the shooting, many people in South Carolina feared that the police would not take any action. Days later, Scott's family made public the cellphone video, and his death instantly became international news.

The video added fuel to the national argument about how police treat black people. Many people in the black community say police treat black people unfairly and are too violent with them. This argument became more intense in August when Michael Brown was shot to death in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown was an 18-year-old black teen and was not carrying a gun. In that case, there was no video of the shooting. Officer Darren Wilson, the white officer who fired the fatal shots, was not charged.

In Baltimore, six officers were charged in the death of Freddie Gray, who was also black. He was badly injured after his arrest by police. He later died at a hospital.

In South Carolina, charges have been brought against Slager and three other officers for shooting at unarmed black men. Three of the men were killed. Another was seriously injured.

Only one of the officers went to trial, but the jury could not agree on a decision. A retrial is set for next week.

In South Carolina, just 12 of the 18 people on a grand jury have to agree in order to charge someone. They do not have to decide that someone definitely broke the law, just that the person should go on trial.
