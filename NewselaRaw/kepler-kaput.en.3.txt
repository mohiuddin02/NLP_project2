SAN JOSE, Calif. - NASA's Kepler spacecraft has broken down in the far reaches of the galaxy. Its planet-hunting days are probably over. But its discoveries may be yet to come.

Scientists have only begun to dig through the mountains of data from Kepler. That is where proof of another Earth-like planet may be hiding.

"The signals are there, in the data we have now — we have to search for them," said NASA's William Borucki, the Kepler mission's principal investigator.

For the past four years, the $600 million Kepler has been focusing its lens on stars. It was watching for the slight dimming that occurs every time a planet passes in front of its sun. The passes are called "transits."

The project has been a big success, changing our view of the universe. The spacecraft lived as long as it was supposed to. But scientists had hoped it would survive far longer. That is because planet hunting is no piece of cake.

## If Only It Lasted...

Kepler would have collected so much information that scientists would have been sure they found signs of an Earth-like planet if the spacecraft lasted until  2019, the researchers said.

"We'll work with what we have," said scientist Alan Gould. "We need to make the most of the data that it has already gotten." Since last July, two of Kepler's four gyroscopes have broken. That makes it impossible for Kepler keep a steady focus on a distant star.

NASA's not quite ready to put Kepler out to pasture. Engineers will try to bring the gyroscopes back into service, or find other ways to salvage the spacecraft.

So far, Kepler's first 22 months of information have shown planets that are quite obvious. But most are in the wrong neighborhoods to sustain life. They are either too close or too far away from their suns. Or they are very big and full of gas, like Jupiter or Saturn.

Kepler has found 2,700 possible planets and 132 have been confirmed since its 2009 launch. Most recently, it revealed some planets circling in the right orbit — the "habitable zone" — around stars Kepler 62 and 69.

Astronomers can use the information from Kepler to figure out the size and position of the passing planet. They have two years of information to study.

"The most important discoveries are yet to come. They're in our back pocket," said Natalie Batalha, deputy science team leader for the mission.

## "A Nail-Biter"

More years of study would have given scientists the chance to confirm an orbit like the Earth's. "It's so frustrating. It's such a nail-biter," said Laurance R. Doyle of the SETI Institute. "We are almost there.

"We really wanted to go the next mile to nail down an Earth and to tell if there are moons," he said. "The extended mission, with extra transits, would have told us that."

Because Kepler's information flow has stopped, it is even more important to understand what it has already found and look more closely for subtle patterns that might suggest an Earth-like planet. The pressure is on such computer experts as Erik Petigura.

"We will extend and improve the software. There are more improvements to be made," Petigura said.

"But all the simple and easy things have already been implemented," he cautioned. "Eventually we'll hit a limit."

The scientists said they are excited by what remains,  though they are sad about what could have been if the spacecraft's gyroscopes had not failed.

"It could have all ended on the launchpad," Gould pointed out. "We are delighted to have been a part of such a beautiful and almost perfect mission."

Scientists also have two more missions to look forward to. One is called the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS. It will use a similar method to Kepler to find potential planets nearby after its scheduled launch in 2017. The other is the James Webb Space Telescope. It will use its infrared vision to scan TESS's finds for signs of organic molecules. It is set to launch in 2018.
