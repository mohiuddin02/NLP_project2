FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. â€” Lynda Walsh wants kids to look good no matter how little money they have.

Walsh recently opened the Cool Clothes Closet of South Palm Beach County. The store provides kids with clothing of all sizes, as well as purses and shoes to match. Kids can shop there for free. They do not have to worry about money.

Walsh's main goal is to provide both everyday clothing and nicer clothes for job interviews at no cost. She helps kids in foster care. She helps young adults getting their first jobs. She also helps the children of returning soldiers. Many veterans have not yet found work. Their families have no money to spend on things like clothes.

"We are here to give clothes away to kids who need them," Walsh said.

## Lots Of Sizes To Fit Everyone

She volunteers with children in foster care. She watches out for their rights in court. Children who cannot live with their families live with foster parents until they find permanent homes.

The Closet is set up like a fancy clothing store. There are clothes hanging on racks and folded in drawers for both boys and girls. The clothes range in sizes from extra small to triple extra large.

Walsh started her free clothing store in 2012. She was not a stranger to working with kids in tough situations. Before she moved to Florida in 2000, she lived in Chicago. She worked as a court reporter in the youth court system there.

In Florida, she saw how poorly many kids were dressed when they went to court.

"I saw teens coming to court in dirty, ragged clothes," she said.

The courthouse does have clothes for kids. They can change into them when they appear in court, but they cannot take them home. Walsh wanted to help kids look nice even when they are not in court.

## Many People Are Helping Out

Walsh asked friends and family to give their clothes to her store. They also helped organize the space. Walsh's 93-year-old mother washes and irons some of the donated clothes.

No outfit would be complete without the right accessories. Kids can choose shoes, purses and hats to match their new outfits.

The Clothes Closet opened its doors about four months ago. The children who have been helped so far have been grateful, Walsh said.

"Everybody has found something," she said. "Nobody has gone empty-handed."

Roberta Mizrahi is a volunteer at the store. She said that the kids are often shy about trying on the clothes at first. They get excited when they try on something they like, she said.

"I think it's wonderful," she added.

## Everyone Gets Personal Attention

There is no limit on how little or how much kids can take. Walsh said the average is about two shopping bags per person. To get the full experience, Walsh had fancy shopping bags made.

"I didn't want people walking out of here" with grocery bags, she said.

The store is not open during regular business hours, which are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Kids are in school then. Instead, Walsh makes personal appointments for each kid on weekends or after school.

Walsh said she has a special place in her heart for the older teens. She makes sure the store is stocked with clothing for job interviews.

"I can remember being their age," she said.
