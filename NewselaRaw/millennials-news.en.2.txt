NEW YORK, N.Y. — Not too long ago people had to buy newspapers if they wanted to find out what was going on in the world. These days, the world is filled with free information. There are plenty of places to catch up on the latest news. To get to a story, just click on a link on a phone or computer screen. It will not cost a penny.

Some young people are still willing to pay for the news, however.

A recent study shows that 40 percent of U.S. adults ages 18-34 pay for at least some of the news they read. Adults in that age range are called the "millennials." Forty percent of them subscribe — pay in advance — to get the news in a print newspaper or online. Another 13 percent use someone else's subscription.

"Forty percent is a strong number, but that means the majority are not willing to pay," journalism professor Keith Herndon said. "We have to think of ways of making the content compelling enough that someone would be willing to pay for it."

## Newspapers Are Struggling

Newspapers are having a hard time these days. The number of people willing to pay for a paper has been declining for years.

In 1984, more than 63 million people bought a newspaper daily. At the time, that was one-quarter of the country's total population. Today only about 40 million people pay for a daily newspaper, even though the U.S. population has grown by about one-third.

It is not just that fewer people are willing to pay for the news. Newspapers are also making much less money from advertising than they once did.

For many years the main way newspapers made money was from paid ads. Now, more and more companies advertise on online sites like Facebook or YouTube instead of in newspapers. Today newspapers make only about a third as much money from advertising as they did in 2003.

## Digital Revenue Is Still Small

Many newspapers now have online editions with digital advertisements. However, the total amount earned from digital advertising is still small. It is nowhere near enough to make up for the income newspapers have lost from print advertising.

Some major newspapers no longer post free articles online. Instead, they charge readers to look at their websites. For example, The New York Times and The Washington Post let non-subscribers read only a certain number of free articles per month. After that, readers must pay for a subscription to continue reading stories.

Still, this approach only works for a few of the biggest and most popular newspapers. Even for them it is hard to compete against all the free news. More and more people, particularly young people, do not see why they should ever have to pay for the news.

The problem is that finding the important stories and reporting them well takes a lot of work — and a lot of money. Newspapers are still the best at it, because they employ large numbers of experienced reporters. If they cannot make enough money, papers may be forced to cut back on reporting, or simply shut down.

For that reason it is important that people not completely lose the habit of paying for the news.

## Most Young People Won't Pay For News

The new study did find some willingness to keep on paying. Twenty-nine percent of the young people surveyed paid for a print paper or magazine, while 25 percent paid for some type of digital news.

Still, a lot of those surveyed never pay to read the news.

For example, Molly Vazquez, 26, does not see why she should have to.

"News is pretty readily come by for free. I don't think I should have to pay for it," Vazquez said. She gets enough news to satisfy her by clicking Facebook links or looking at BuzzFeed's free website.

Adam Saltz, 27, also does not pay for any of the news he reads. He clicks on links from Twitter but also follows blogs and reads The New York Times and The Washington Post online. He is able to read The New York Times for free because one of his parents has a subscription.

However, Saltz said he would be willing to spend money on a subscription.

"If I didn't have a family member who had one who was willing to share," he said, "I would probably be paying for mine."
