Kennewick man is the name scientists gave to an ancient skeleton found in Washington state in 1996. Scientists believe the bones are about 8,500 years old.

New DNA evidence shows that Kennewick Man is related to Native Americans living today. Scientists recently made the announcement. The discovery was reported in the journal Nature.

DNA holds the information that tells the body how to grow and function. DNA is passed on from parents to children.

## Who Were Kennewick Man's Relatives?

Many people did not agree on the ancient man's origins.

When they first found him, scientists wanted to study the bones to learn more about early Americans. However, Native Americans in the Northwest United States did not agree to it. They did not want anyone touching the bones. A law had been passed in 1990 that said Native American remains on U.S. government lands must be returned to their tribes.

Scientists questioned the tribes' claim on the Kennewick Man. They argued that he looked more like people from Japan and Polynesia than modern Native Americans. In 2004, after nearly 10 years in court, the tribes lost the case. Scientists continued to work on the bones. Studies of the skull seemed to show that Kennewick Man came from a different population than Native Americans.

## Some Hand Bone DNA Sparks A Match

Morten Rasmussen is a scientist at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He says scientists had already tried to study Kennewick Man's DNA back in the 1990s. However, they did not find anything.

But the technology is better now. Advances have made it easier to study DNA from ancient bodies even though they are often badly deteriorated.

The scientists could find Kennewick Man's DNA in just a tiny piece of bone from his hand. They compared his DNA with DNA of people from Asia and the Americas. They also looked at DNA from the Colville Indian tribe. This was one of the Native American groups that had claimed the remains.

Rasmussen said the results of the DNA testing were clear. Kennewick Man "shares by far the most with other Native Americans," he said.

## More Studies Can Be Helpful

David Reich is a DNA expert from Harvard University. He believes the discovery is exciting.

He said it clearly shows that Kennewick Man is related to Native Americans. He hopes more Native Americans will give their DNA for studies. It helps scientists learn how the ancient Americans are related to present-day tribes.

One of the study's authors said he has been in touch with the Colville tribe. They "seemed pretty excited" with the new discovery, he said.
