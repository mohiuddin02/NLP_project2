WASHINGTON â€” Children are streaming across the Mexican border. Many leave Central America to escape violence and poverty. Some travel another 1,500 miles from the border to Florida. More than 3,000 have gone to Florida this year.

Immigration courts in Florida then have to deal with them. Judges must decide to let the children stay or send them home. The courts think they have too many cases to decide in a normal way.

Florida courts are creating "rocket dockets." The sped-up court cases will end quickly. They will get through a court's list of cases, or docket, fast.

Volunteer lawyers are hurrying to get ready. They will have to argue up to 50 cases a day per judge. The lawyers will try to get the judges to let the children stay forever. If that does not work, they will try to stop kids from being sent back home immediately.

## One Friday At Court

Supporters of immigrants worry that the cases may not be fair.

On one Friday, 25 children appeared before a Miami judge. Only three had lawyers. The rest were by themselves, said Lesley Mendoza. She runs a free legal help program of Cuban lawyers.

Mendoza says these children cannot handle the court system on their own. They cannot understand court "without speaking the language, without any knowledge and limited education. That's just wrong."

The faster hearings mean some children will not have time to find a lawyer, Mendoza said. "Many who do have a legal right will be sent back." Being sent back means some kids will be hurt, she said. Others may be forced to join a gang. Mendoza said some may even be killed.

The Immigration Court in Orlando is also clogged with cases. Volunteer lawyers are being found to help all the children.

## Huge Increase In Cases

Immigration lawyer Camila Pachon Silva says there has been a huge increase in cases. "But these are not the first children to come," she said. "Children have crossed the borders on their own ever since we've had immigration in the United States."

The government said 3,181 border children have come to Florida this year. Most of them are teenagers from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Children usually get placed with family members.

Under U.S. law, children crossing alone cannot be sent back to their country immediately. They have the right to claim they should stay. They can argue that they face danger by returning to their homeland. Some children do get to stay. Others have been sent back to their countries.

The numbers of children crossing the border is becoming a huge problem. Children are fleeing countries such as Honduras. Drug dealing has spread there. Violent gangs attack families, including children. Many come to Florida. The state has the largest Honduran community in the nation.

"By having a special docket, you can move these cases," said Jeffrey Brauwerman. He was once an immigration judge and is now a Florida immigration lawyer. "I think the judges will be pretty fair-minded. The key thing is to unclog the docket."
