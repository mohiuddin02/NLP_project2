A new report says that the world isn't getting smaller. It's getting fatter.

People around the world were bigger in 2013 than in 1980. That goes for everyone â€” men and women, children and adults, rich and poor.

In 1980, 857 million people were overweight. In 2013, that number increased to 2.1 billion people.

Last year, one out of every four children in rich countries were overweight. That includes the U.S. In poorer countries, children also were heavier.

## Health Problems

A few extra pounds may seem harmless. But it can be serious. It's not healthy. [Too much weight increases the chances of health problems.](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) They include heart disease and diabetes.

For the new study, scientists studied people in 183 countries.

The United States is an especially fat country. Out of 100 American men, 31 weigh too much. For American women, the number is 34 of 100. There are 671 million really overweight people in the world. More than 87 million of them live in the U.S. That's more than any other country.

Scientists found that no country lost weight. That was the report's saddest finding.

## Will People Change?

Klim McPherson is a scientist at the University of Oxford in England. He says the world needs to take the weight problem more seriously.

For years, health experts tried to get people to stop smoking and eat healthy. Their efforts worked. People aren't dying as much from lung cancer or heart disease. Smoking can cause lung cancer.

"Can a similar success with weight ever happen?" said McPherson.

Probably not any time soon, he admitted. Experts know how to solve the weight problem. People have to eat less. They also need to buy less food. McPherson says that people should go back to weighing what they did 30 years ago. But there isn't enough interest to make big changes.
