The Texas police officer who has been heavily criticized for his rough handling of black teenagers at a pool party has resigned. His lawyer announced the resignation on Tuesday.

Corporal Eric Casebolt had been suspended since Sunday. His suspension came after a video of him confronting the teenagers was made available. The party took place Friday evening in McKinney, a suburb of Dallas.

In the video, Casebolt can be seen drawing his gun on the unarmed teenagers and throwing a 14-year-old girl in a bikini to the ground.

## Young Partygoers Did Not Appear Violent

The video, which was shot by a bystander, has had millions of views on YouTube. It shows Casebolt shouting and cursing at teenagers who do not appear to be acting violently or aggressively. Casebolt is seen wrestling some black teenagers to the ground.

Officials said residents had called the police to complain about an out-of-control party. Some of the teenagers said they had permission to be at the pool and said residents had harassed them.

The incident prompted a protest Monday. Meanwhile, police have promised to investigate Casebolt's actions.

A spokesman for the McKinney Police Department could not immediately be reached for a comment.

## Police Group Denies Racial Motivation

The incident has added to ongoing nationwide anger over how police handle black community members. It came following a series of highly publicized events in which unarmed black men were killed by police.

Fortunately, no one appears to have been seriously hurt this time.

Even so, the video was disturbing enough to draw widespread public condemnation. For some critics, it brought back memories of the nation's pre-1964 segregation laws, which banned blacks from using various whites-only public spaces. Under segregation, blacks in many states were denied the right to swim in pools with white Americans.

However, the McKinney police officers union said Monday that "this was not a racially motivated incident." It said McKinney police do not conduct "racially biased policing."

## Officers Should Be Peacekeepers, Expert Says

Policing expert David Bradford said the video suggests that Casebolt was overreacting. "In this particular case, the officer may have been overzealous in taking an enforcement role rather than a peacekeeper role."

"If this was my department and that was my officer," Bradford said, there would definitely be some retraining focused on "what our role is and what our job is in the community." Bradford nonetheless said he would need to know more about what happened before he could reach any final conclusions.

When officers are facing large crowds and trying to restore the peace, Bradford said, the first goal should be to calm things down. Police should then proceed to break up the crowd "in a lawful manner."
