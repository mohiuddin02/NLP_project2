Timothy Cade had only owned his hoverboard for three days. Suddenly, it exploded under him.

"Hoverboard is on fire," he says in a video taken right after he jumped off the burning piece of equipment. "What is going on dude?"

## Hot Toy Becomes A Hot Mess

The bow-shaped board does not really "hover," but is instead more like a cross between a skateboard and a Segway. It flamed and popped angrily.

His mother ran out with a box of baking soda. Though baking soda is recommended for extinguishing grease fires, it did not help the hoverboard situation. The toy hissed and boomed, then the battery pack went shooting out of it. Flames engulfed the board.

"You would not expect a fire like that to come out of a little thing like that," Cade said. He was speaking to his town's TV station, WKRG.

However, they do. Not just out of Cade's board, but at least 10 others. What was once the hottest toy of the holiday season has become something of a hot mess.

## Emergency Room Visits

Airlines will not allow hoverboards until they can figure out what's going on. Online stores like Amazon and Overstock will no longer be selling some brands. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is part of the U.S. government. It regulates the sale and making of thousands of different products sold in the United States, from baby cribs to cars. It announced this week that it will be looking into hoverboards. It will try to find the cause of reports of 29 emergency room visits and at least 11 fires related to hoverboards, according to The New York Times.

The problem, it seems, is the batteries.

Hoverboards use lithium-ion batteries. In a hoverboard, the batteries are kept in the foot rest. There are hundreds of companies making hoverboards. Many of them are in other countries, and do not abide by safety rules. When it comes to lithium ion batteries, a few shortcuts can have dangerous results.

## The Science Of Batteries

That is because of how batteries work. In a battery, two metals are surrounded by a liquid called an electrolyte. The metals are kept apart by an important separator. The anode is the negatively charged end of the battery, where the minus sign is. It gathers electrons, the tiny negatively charged particles that form an electric current.

The electrons want to balance things out. They flow to the cathode, or the positive end of a battery, marked by the plus sign. They have no way of getting to the cathode thanks to the separator. When you put the battery in a flashlight and turn it on, the current is allowed to flow and the bulb lights up. When you put a battery in the hoverboard and flip the switch, it zooms off.

Lithium ion batteries are rechargeable. They are lightweight and endlessly reusable. They are used in many types of electronics, from cellphones to electric cars.

## Separator Is Important

However, the electrolyte liquid used in these batteries is highly flammable. Because batteries can overheat, it is so important that the separator keep things apart. If a current were to flow through the battery, it could spark and cause a fire.

Lithium ion battery explosions do not just happen in hoverboards. IPods, which also use this type of battery, have gone up in flames, too.

Still, batteries in hoverboards face problems that an iPod does not. For one thing, no one is standing on iPods while smashing into walls at high speeds. The wear and tear to which hoverboards are subjected makes their batteries more likely to get damaged.

## Should Hoverboards Be Regulated?

For another, hoverboards also are pretty much unregulated, which worries Elliot Kaye, who is in charge of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. 

Speaking to The New York Times, Kaye explained that hoverboard manufacturers use strange manufacturing practices. Many of them are in China, which lets them avoid the rules in the countries they ship to.

There are no rules on how hoverboards must be made. Right now, it is easy for manufacturers to get away with poor products, he said.
