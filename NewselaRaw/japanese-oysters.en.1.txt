After pulling on his army-green fisherman's overalls, Hiromitsu Ito guns the throttle on his boat, steering it out into the waters that have both kept him alive and nearly killed him.

Five minutes offshore, he idles along some buoys. His nephew and a 17-year-old apprentice haul in a net. Ito grabs a shell bigger than a man's palm, opens it with a rusty blade, and quickly rinses it with seawater. "Yume-gaki," he says. "Dream oyster. Try it!"

Oysters, scallops, mussels and sea squirts thrive here in Ogatsu Bay, a waterway more than a mile inland from Japan's northeastern coast. However, despite the rich fishing waters, the number of seamen who know these waters well is shrinking.

## It's Been Tough Going

Ogatsu was one of the towns most devastated by the magnitude 9 earthquake that jolted Japan in March 2011. An 80-foot-high tsunami roared up the bay, swallowing the community and demolishing buildings. Three hundred people died in Ogatsu, among 15,890 victims nationwide.

Since then, much of the debris has been cleared. Hundreds of miles of roads have been rebuilt, as have most of the hospitals and schools.

Even with this construction, many people are still adrift. Officially, 220,000 people are still classified as displaced or evacuated. These victims have yet to return to permanent homes. While many were affected by the large-scale destruction of the storm, the fishery and food processing industries were hit particularly hard.

In Ogatsu's waters, the going has been tough.

Only about 800 residents have returned, among them about 70 fishermen. There is no gas station, no restaurant, not even a mini-mart.

## Recovery Is His Mission

Ito, the fisherman, has been on a quest to find a way to bring his town and its fishery industry back to life.

"I feel like it's my mission," he said. "No one told me to do it, but someone has to do it."

Ito has tried various things to help business recover in the town. For a while, he drove supplies to a town two hours away from Ogatsu. After that attempt, he and some other fishermen got back to the water, sharing the few boats they had and cultivating oysters.

Soon they created a business to take tourists on fishing expeditions, and gave people who donated money free fish. They called the enterprise Oh! Guts!, a play on Ogatsu's name, with a logo of a clenched fist to signal their determination.

For a while, the company was popular and tourists from around the world came to visit. Students from Harvard Business School even flew to Japan to learn more about the unique business model. Despite the initial popularity, outsiders' attention eventually declined.

"We thought we could develop some tourism here, but we couldn't," Ito said. By the end, the business had lost nearly $125,000.

## Dream Of Recovery

Ito's latest venture is perhaps a more sustainable project. It is a sea-to-table business. Oysters are caught in the sea and served at his restaurant in Sendai. Ito has even trademarked the oversize oysters from Ogatsu Bay, calling them yume-gaki, or "dream oysters."

"They're called yume-gaki because it's about the dream of recovery," he said.

Ito had wanted to create a sea-to-table business before the disaster, but it was too hard to make money at it back then. Fishermen used to have to sell their catch through a fishery association and other middlemen who would take a cut of the fishermen's money.

Ito said that while the people lost physical things in the tsunami, the atmosphere changed and people "gained new ideas and new attitudes."

## Can New Ventures Revitalize Ogatsu?

Ito's new business is called Kai-you, and it has managed to attract willing fishermen who earn double or even triple the money selling to Ito than they would to middlemen. Sometimes, Kai-you takes in 2 tons of seafood a day, cleans and distributes it, then sells it directly to 350 restaurants across Japan. They pay the fishery association a small fee.

Despite some remaining challenges, Ito reached a major goal last November when he opened Ostra de Ole, a 32-seat oyster bar on a busy corner in a Japanese town called Sendai.

Although Kai-you and Ostra de Ole seem to be flourishing, it remains to be seen whether they can truly revitalize the future of Ogatsu.

Just two new homes have been built in Ogatsu since the disaster. Ito bought a drafty old house up on a bluff that barely escaped the tsunami, but he splits his time between Ogatsu and Sendai, where he's focused on sales and the restaurant.

"I bought this for my parents, but even they don't want to live here," he says. His elderly mother and father have relocated to the nearby city of Ishinomaki.

## A Vacant Stretch Of Land

For now, Ito's 17-year-old apprentice, Hayato Yabuuchi, lives in the house. His father brought him to Ogatsu for some real-world experience after the teen had difficulty in school. After he finishes his daily work classifying oysters by size and packing them, Yabuuchi passes the time writing rap lyrics and keeping a diary.

Driving out of Ogatsu in his Mini Cooper, Ito points to a vacant stretch of land.

"Before, this was a town," he says. "Now, I don't know what to call it."
