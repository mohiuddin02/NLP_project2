The world's population of northern white rhinos declined 25 percent in a single day when Nola died. She was 41 years old, and one of the last four of the massive, two-horned animals remaining on Earth. 

Now there are only three.

Nola was euthanized — put to sleep — at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park on Sunday, according to a statement from the park on its Facebook page. Her illness from a bacterial infection and age-related health problems had become worse. 

"We're absolutely devastated by this loss," the park said, "but resolved to fight even harder to end extinction."

The northern white rhino is a subspecies of white rhinoceros that once ranged across parts of Uganda, Sudan, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and into Chad and Cameroon. They are among the largest land animals on Earth, second only to elephants. They can run at speeds of more than 30 miles per hour and their horns, tough skin and sheer size mean they have no natural predators.

## Humans To Blame For Rhinos' Destruction

Unnatural predators — humans — are an entirely different matter.

Civil war, loss of their natural environment and poaching for their valuable horns destroyed the rare breed. Between 1960 and 2015 the population of rhinos fell from 2,000 to five.

In addition to the loss of Nola, a 31-year-old Czech rhino named Nabiré died after complications from a burst cyst in July.

The subspecies has been extinct in the wild since 2008.

Now just three aging members of the subspecies survive at Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a preserve in Kenya. All are too old or unhealthy to breed naturally. Without some kind of scientific intervention, when these last three die, their subspecies dies with them.

## Close Rhino Relative Brought Back From Brink

The northern white rhino "disappeared right in front of our eyes and we didn't realize it until it was too late," Kathleen Garrigan told National Geographic magazine after Nabiré's death. She is a spokeswoman for the African Wildlife Foundation.

Though its numbers once tumbled as low as Nola's subspecies, the southern white rhinoceros, a close relative, has fared far better. According to the group Save The Rhino, more than 20,000 of the creatures exist in the wild after being hunted almost to extinction a century ago.

In 1900, fewer than 20 of the rhinos existed on a single South African preserve. Good fortune and local governments, however, favored the southern white rhino.  A combination of legal protections, breeding efforts and controlled trophy hunting schemes helped bring the subspecies back from the brink. Poaching persists: A record 1,215 white rhinos were killed in South Africa in 2015, according to the World Wildlife Fund. But by placing microchips in their prized horns to track the rhino and cracking down on the illegal ivory trade, officials hope to slash that number.

## Working To Preserve Eggs — And The Species

Northern white rhinos are unlikely to have such a comeback. The three who remain live under constant supervision in Kenya, surrounded by armed guards 24 hours a day. The lone male is too old to mate, and the two females are incapable of carrying a pregnancy, according to the Live Science website.

It would take a miracle to even produce another northern white rhino, let alone revive the subspecies — but scientists are hoping they can manufacture one.

Veterinarian Barbara Durrant of the San Diego Zoo's Institute for Conservation Research told Live Science that she and other researchers are working to develop a rhino in vitro fertilization procedure. The method would allow them to implant an embryo produced from a frozen egg and sperm. But the number of preserved reproductive cells is tiny -- they come from just 12 northern white rhinos -- and the method is still a long way from being ready to use them. Durrant said it has only been done twice, and both times the embryo never developed beyond a cluster of just two cells.

## Zoo Establishing Surrogate Program

The San Diego Zoo has set aside $2 million for an effort that would use southern white rhino mothers as surrogates to carry northern white rhino embryos, according to Scientific American magazine.

If all else fails, southern white rhino females may also be artificially inseminated with preserved northern males' sperm. This method would help retain some of the genetic traits that make the northern subspecies unique. This step, though less than ideal, would at least add to the rhino population's genetic diversity.

Meanwhile, staff at Ol Pejeta have been hurrying to harvest eggs from the last two living females.

"It's kind of a race against time," Ol Pejeta's CEO Richard Vigne told Live Science in June, when the global population of the subspecies still stood at five animals. "Those remaining females could all die tomorrow. Once they're gone, then the source of eggs disappears."
