WASHINGTON â€” Many cities around the country want to make neighborhoods safer for walking. They are improving paths for walkers and making cars slow down.

At the same time, cities are seeing more and more walkers get injured. These walkers are called pedestrians. Often they are hurt when a car or bike hits them.

Some walkers injure themselves. They walk into traffic. They crash into trees or signs. They fall off curbs. They even walk into wet cement. They have gotten cuts and bruises and head injuries. Some have even died.

These pedestrians do not see the trees because they are staring at their cellphones. They are distracted walkers.

## Look Up To Stay Safe

Every year, thousands of pedestrians are injured as they walk in cities. One out of every 10 of those injuries may be caused by cellphone use, studies have found.

In 2012, 4,700 walkers were killed. Deaths while walking have been rising since 2009.

Different cities and states have different plans to solve this problem.

In Utah, walkers who text were fined $50. In New Jersey, people who walked into traffic while on a phone got tickets.

New York City now has lower speed limits for cars. It makes the streets safer for walkers. The city has also blocked off some streets to make walking areas where cars are not allowed.

San Francisco has a Walk First program. The plan will try to make dangerous intersections safer.

## It Was A Joke, But People Listened

The city of Philadelphia had a different plan. They made fun of distracted walkers on April Fools' Day in 2012.

The city painted lanes on the sidewalk for people staring at their phones. They called the lanes "e-lanes."

Not everyone got the joke. In fact, some people in Philadelphia liked the lanes.

"It'll keep most of those bozos out of my way," one cellphone user said.

In one survey, half of the walkers admitted to crossing the street while on the phone. One of every four said they text while crossing the street.

Dr. Dietrich Jehle started studying walking injuries while he was an emergency room doctor. He has found that 1 out of every 10 pedestrian injuries are because of distracted walking. Jehle has also found that distracted walking causes more injuries than distracted driving.

"While talking on the phone is a distraction, texting is much more dangerous because you can't see the path in front of you," Jehle said.
