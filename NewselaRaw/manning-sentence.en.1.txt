WASHINGTON — An Army judge sentenced Pfc. Bradley Manning to 35 years in a military prison Wednesday, Aug. 21 for orchestrating the largest-ever leak of classified U.S. documents.

The sentence means the 25-year-old former intelligence analyst could eventually walk out of prison as a free man. He had faced what could have effectively been a life sentence.

The same judge who sentenced Manning, Col. Denise Lind, had previously acquitted him on an aiding-the-enemy charge that carried a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.

Lind found Manning guilty in July of 20 counts relating to the theft of an estimated 700,000 documents. The theft ranged from diplomatic communications and intelligence assessments to a graphic video of a U.S. Apache helicopter attack. Lind combined some of the charges so that the maximum Manning faced was 90 years.

## Gave Documents To WikiLeaks

Prosecutors had asked that Manning be sentenced to 60 years.

"There may not be a soldier in the history of the United States Army who displayed such an extreme disregard for the judgment of the officers appointed above him and the orders of the president of the United States," Army Capt. Joseph Morrow, one of the prosecutors, said during a sentencing hearing.

Defense attorney David Coombs had urged Lind to impose a sentence that allowed Manning to "have a life" when he left prison. He insisted that "Manning really truly, genuinely believed that this information could make a difference." Manning also "believed that the information couldn't be used to harm the United States," Coombs said.

Manning provided the material to WikiLeaks. The website publishes government and corporate secrets from the United States and other countries. Manning and Coombs had argued the leaks were well-intentioned. Coombs said the leaks were also the actions of a troubled young man who was under considerable stress while struggling to cope in what he called a poorly managed Army unit.

Manning can apply for parole after serving one-third of his sentence.

## Court-Martial Held At Fort Mead

"I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions," Manning told Lind during a sentencing hearing on Aug. 14. "When I made these decisions, I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people. I look back at my decisions and wonder, 'How on earth could I, a junior analyst, possibly believe I could change the world for the better over the decisions of those with the proper authority?'"

The court-martial was held at Fort Meade, Md., a tightly secured facility north of Washington that's also the home of the secretive National Security Agency.

Manning had agreed to plead guilty to certain charges that had carried a potential prison sentence of 20 years. But prosecutors charged him with additional crimes, including espionage.

His sentence will be shortened by more than 1,100 days for his pre-trial confinement and an additional 112 days to compensate for the severe treatment he received while held in a Marine Corps brig. Future good behavior in prison could further shave time off his sentence.

To shape her sentencing decision, Lind heard testimony from witnesses in both closed and open court sessions. The government's military and State Department witnesses emphasized the damage done by Manning's actions and the publication by WikiLeaks.

## "I Must Pay A Price"

When the information got out, a number of "foreign partners ... became greatly concerned whether we were still a trusted partner and whether we could still engage in intel operations with them," retired Army Brig. Gen. Robert Carr, formerly with the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified.

State Department officials testified about the consequences of having 250,000 department documents being made public. A military official said the enemy also changed the way it made some bombs based on the documents.

Defense witnesses focused on Manning's troubled upbringing as the child of alcoholic parents. Beset with anxiety even before enlisting, Manning was prescribed the anti-anxiety drug Lexapro. Manning received mental health counseling for angry outbursts when he was in the Army, a defense witness said.

"I understand that I must pay a price for my decisions and actions," Manning told Lind on Aug. 15. "Once I pay that price, I hope to one day live in the manner I haven't been able to in the past. I want to be a better person — to go to college, to get a degree — and to have a meaningful relationship with my sister's family and my family."
