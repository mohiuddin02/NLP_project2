WASHINGTON — Many men lost their lives in the Battle of Gettysburg and many were recognized for their bravery. It took more than 151 years, though, for First Lieutenant Alonzo Cushing to be recognized for his heroism with America's highest medal for valor.

On Thursday, President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor to Cushing's family in a moving ceremony at the White House.

Normally, the nation's highest medal for bravery is given within a few years of the heroic deed.

"But sometimes even the most extraordinary stories can get lost in the passage of time," Obama said. "This medal is a reminder that no matter how long it takes, it is never too late to do the right thing."

## Suffered Terrible Injuries

On July 3, 1863, Cushing, only 22 when he was killed, was the commander of an artillery unit that had been almost completely wiped out by Confederate fire. Despite terrible injuries, he refused to leave his cannon, the only artillery piece in his unit that was helping to hold off the soldiers of the Confederate South. His bravery, along with so many others on the battlefield, helped the North win the Civil War and end slavery.

Cushing was awarded the medal through the efforts of Margaret Zerwekh, an amateur historian who researched the Cushing family after moving to the Cushing family home in Delafield, Wisconsin, in the 1960s. As she pored through accounts of Cushing's heroism, she felt he deserved the Medal of Honor.

Through more than three decades Zerwekh never gave up, despite numerous setbacks. Zerwekh, now 94, was at the White House to witness a ceremony she spent so much time and effort to make happen.

"He deserved it," Zerwekh said.

During the ceremony, Obama singled out Zerwekh for her efforts, which started in the early 1980s.

"They say the wheels of democracy grind slowly, but 151 years slow?" said Wisconsin Representative Ron Kind, who attended the ceremony. He is the descendant of two brothers who fought during the Civil War. "This is the classic example of how two individuals can make a difference — Alonzo Cushing and Margaret Zerwekh."

## "A Stone In His Name"

A total of 63 Medals of Honor have been awarded for heroism during the Battle of Gettysburg. Few Medals of Honor have been awarded after death for service in the Civil War, said Laura Jowdy, an archivist with the Medal of Honor Society.

It took an Army department weeks to track down members of Cushing's family. Cushing died before having children and none of his brothers had children.

Receiving the Medal of Honor was Helen Loring Ensign, 85, of Palm Springs, California, a distant cousin of Cushing through his mother.

Wearing a button with Cushing's picture, Ensign stood next to the president as the citation was read.

Ensign has visited Gettysburg many times and stood at the spot where Cushing fell next to his artillery gun, a spot now memorialized with a stone marker.

"I remember being very, very proud to see a stone in his name. Gettysburg was a part of our family history," Ensign said.

## A West Point Graduate

Family members attending the ceremony included several named Cushing or Alonzo. Some learned of each other through efforts to trace the family tree for the Medal of Honor ceremony, said Ensign's niece Jessica Loring. In Washington, D.C., this week, family members met Zerwekh for the first time.

"We owe a great debt to her for doing this," said Loring.

Cushing's family wants to loan his Medal of Honor to museums and schools, Loring said, "because it's important to show the price of freedom."

On Friday, Cushing will be inducted into the Pentagon Hall of Heroes, and later this month, the Navy cruiser USS Gettysburg will honor Cushing by naming its officer's dining hall after him. Next week, the U.S. Military Academy will add his name to its memorial to graduates who earned the Medal of Honor.

While researching his 1993 biography "Cushing of Gettysburg: The Story of a Union Artillery Commander," Kent Masterson Brown read Cushing's letters and journals and learned he was a strong patriot who acted as a father figure to his younger brothers.

Cushing graduated in 1861 from West Point, a military school for officers, which he was encouraged by his mother to attend because there was no other way he could afford a college education.

## Commander Of Battery A

On July 3, 1863, he was commander of Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery, which was stationed on Cemetery Ridge near a small grove of trees on the Gettysburg battlefield. Before the desperate and ultimately disastrous Confederate attack, called Pickett's Charge, Confederate guns practically wiped out Cushing's unit. Soldiers were only a few hundred yards away from each other, trying to kill each other.

Paul C. Jussel, a military studies professor at the U.S. Army War College, said the battle was the last great effort Confederate General Robert E. Lee made for the South. "Ultimately, it doesn't work and Cushing had a lot to do with that."

During the Confederate attack Cushing was struck in the shoulder and abdomen, but continued to whisper commands to his soldiers. Historians estimate it was two hours from the time of his initial wounds until he was killed. About 8,000 soldiers were killed during the three-day battle, and more than three times that number were wounded.

Although Cushing was told to get medical help, he refused to leave.

"He said 'No, I'll fight it out or die in the attempt,'" said Brown.

When he was buried at West Point, Cushing was laid to rest underneath a tombstone inscribed "Faithful until death."
