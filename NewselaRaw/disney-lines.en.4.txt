ORLANDO, Fla. â€” Disney said recently it stop allowing disabled visitors to jump ahead in lines at its U.S. theme parks. Now Disney will make them return later.

Disney will soon end what it called its "guest assistance card" program. Parents of disabled kids around the country are upset.

Curtis Doyle will be affected by the new changes. He is 27 years old and has autism, which affects his brain. He's excited for the trip his family is planning to Walt Disney World next summer. He reminds his dad about it each day.

But the trip worries his father, Brad.

## No More Line Jumping

It might seem like a small change to most families. But it's not to Brad. His son has a habit of becoming attached to certain things. That's normal for people with mental disabilities. And he gets frustrated when he doesn't get what he wants. Sometimes he melts down in outbursts. He gets so upset that he may bite his own hands.

Some parents say making their children with disabilities wait isn't practical. Some kids cannot understand why they can't ride immediately. Others must take regular food, medicine or bathroom breaks. Some can be in the parks for only two or three hours. After that they become exhausted or upset.

Brad said it will be a huge problem for his son. He has taken Curtis many times to Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. "I really have to rethink my whole vacation now."

Disney says it understands their concerns. But it also says it must make changes to a program. Other people have been abusing it.

## Lying To Beat Long Waits

Rich families hire disabled tour guides to pretend to be family members. But the more common problem is people faking health problems. It can be hard to check if people complaining of back pain, for instance, are lying. Groups sometimes use a pass given to an older relative to jump the lines for rides.

The problem has gotten worse. Millions of people go to Disney parks each year. The big crowds have led to more abuse. Last year, Disney California Adventure opened Cars Land. It's based on the movie Cars. Soon after, Disney found that close to a quarter of all the visitors riding Radiator Springs Racers in Cars Land used a guest assistance card.

Disney says hundreds of thousands of people ask for the cards each year.

"Unfortunately, our current program has been abused and exploited," said Meg Crofton, in a letter. She runs Disney's theme parks in the U.S. and France.

Disney is seen as one of the most friendly companies for disabled visitors. Its guest assistance cards are a big reason why. They don't completely get rid of waiting. But they let a disabled guest and his or her party immediately enter a fast line. They may also be able to use a different entrance.

## Return Times Start Oct. 9

Both Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando do things differently. They generally make disabled visitors return to rides at certain times. Disney will begin doing the same on Oct. 9.

Under Disney's new system, guests will still get special cards. But when they use those cards at ride entrances, they will then be given a time to return. The length of the line will determine the return time. The new cards will also include the visitor's photo. They will be good for seven days. Under the old system they were good for 14.

Parents say there must be a better fix. Some suggest making families ask for the cards before going to the parks.

"There has to be some sort of middle ground," said Don La Vette of Illinois. He has an 11-year-old son with autism. "You can't hurt kids with disabilities because you have able-bodied people abusing the system or cheating."
