DILLINGHAM, Alaska â€” Residents of this fishing village in southwestern Alaska spoke with President Barack Obama's top environmental official. They told her that a proposed mine in the region will kill wild salmon and destroy their culture. She was visibly moved.

Gina McCarthy became administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last month. She said the residents' words reminded her of what the EPA works for every day.

"I intend to make you proud in the position the president has given me," she said to a standing ovation. Her speech took place in a packed gymnasium at a Dillingham school.

McCarthy visited the Bristol Bay region this week as a nationwide debate grows over the proposed mine. It could be the largest open-pit mine in North America. But it's in a region that produces half the world's wild red salmon.

## Gold Mine Versus Streams And Salmon

Proponents say the proposed gold and copper mine will create new jobs. Opponents say the mine will destroy streams, wetlands and salmon populations. Mine opponents in the fishing town of Dillingham were encouraged after McCarthy's visit. They felt she was sympathetic to their views.

"It was like a shot to the heart when she said, 'I'm going to make you proud,''' said Robyn Chaney of Dillingham. "It gives you a glimmer of hope."

The EPA may use the Clean Water Act to block the Pebble Mine even before it applies for permits.

Chaney's 14-year-old son, Triston, came with her to the meeting. He told the EPA leader that streams in the region are clean enough to drink from. "The first thing I ever drank as a baby was from a stream, and I want future generations to be able to," he said. He asked McCarthy to use her power to stop the Pebble Mine.

The area of the mine is huge and bursting with lakes and streams. It's a green, sweeping land of moose, caribou and grizzly bears surrounded by mountains.

A tiny camp dots the Alaskan wilderness. It is the only evidence of what could become one of the world's biggest mining operations.

## Safety Vests Touting "Zero Harm"

The Pebble Partnership says the region's deposit is one of the largest of its kind on the planet. The mine could produce 80.6 billion pounds of copper and 107.4 million ounces of gold over three decades.

The mine site is near the village of Iliamna, a cluster of about 100 people around a huge lake. The community is quiet even in the summer. There's little activity, aside from Pebble Partnership testing core samples and studying the fragile area. The company hopes the mine will bring in a lot of money.

The Pebble workers came to meet McCarthy in Iliamna wearing their safety vests with the slogan "zero harm" on them. They said the mine developers are hiring people from Iliamna and the surrounding Alaska Native villages. Jobs range from helping out in the kitchen to guarding workers from bears.

"There are no other job opportunities, absolutely none," said Janessa Woods, who has two children. She declared that without Pebble Partnership, she would be on welfare.

Added Mary Jane Nielsen, president and CEO of the Alaska Peninsula Corp., "We just need to be able to have some sort of economy in the villages because we have all these young men falling through the cracks."

Several people in Iliamna urged the EPA not to shut down the mine before the developers submit their plans. They said environmental politics shouldn't outweigh science.

## One Town Sharply Divided

But even in Iliamna, people are sharply divided.

"No amount of money or jobs can replace our way of life," Nondalton Tribal Council President William Evanoff told the EPA leader. "The threats are real."

In Dillingham, everyone who spoke to McCarthy was against the Pebble mine. The town of about 2,300 lives and breathes salmon. Weathered buildings display vivid murals celebrating salmon and urging their preservation.

"We are people of fish, we are people of salmon, that is what we depend on," said Curyung Tribal Chief Tom Tilden. Curyung is the Yupik Indian name for Dillingham. "We want this renewable resource to come back year after year after year so we can continue to be here. Your agency can provide us that opportunity."

The EPA leader toured the mine site with Pebble officials after leaving Dillingham. Pebble Partnership CEO John Shively said afterward that he assured McCarthy of the company's good intentions. The developers are "committed to building a mine that would create substantial economic activity while protecting the environment and the fishery."

An EPA study released in April said the mine could wipe out nearly 100 miles of streams and 4,800 acres of wetlands in the region. The EPA said it is finishing the study, which is based on a first round of mine plans submitted to government agencies.
