ARMENIA, El Salvador â€” Sixteen-year-old Roosemberth Palacios finds high school boring. So after school, he logs onto his computer. Then, he hunts for challenges.

And he's found them: Difficult online courses offered by professors at Stanford University and  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

He says he's aced a course called "Machine Learning" by hot-shot Stanford professor Andrew Ng: He scored a perfect 100. And he took a sophomore-level course by MIT professor Anant Agarwal called "Circuits and Electronics." He got a 91 for that one.

To get better at math, he took a course called "Numerical Analysis." It was offered online by a Swiss school. The class was given in French.

## Massive Open Online Courses

Such online courses are known as massive open online courses, or MOOCs. Here in the United States, they are a topic of some arguments on college campuses.

Some call them the future of learning.

Others think they will cause a lot of harm. They worry that fewer teachers will be hired. And that students won't be able to talk with their teachers any more. Some MOOC classes, after all, have as many as 10,000 students.

It's still not clear who's right when it come to MOOCs in the United States. But there's something people here often forget: MOOCs can mean a lot to students in poorer countries.

## "He Wants To Learn"

The online college classes have certainly been a big help for Roosemberth.

"At school, he hardly studies," said his father, Dr. Roberto Palacios. "He just shows up and takes the exams." But it isn't that he's lazy, Roberto added. "He wants to learn."

It's just, Roosemberth explained, that "I don't like simple things."

That was easy to see at the family's apartment. There, the teenager showed off his workbench. On it were circuit boards he has been soldering. It also had his own designs for an unmanned helicopter.

Because he does so well on tests, Roosemberth was selected to attend classes at the University of El Salvador. There he heard a talk by engineering professor Carlos Martinez. He told the students they should try taking some online courses.

## At The Internet Cafe

So Roosemberth signed up for MIT's "Circuits and Electronics" course. He had to go to a nearby Internet cafe to follow along.

"Sometimes I had to stay up very late. I'd tell myself, 'It's worth losing a little sleep over,'" the teenager said.

And he was excited by the courses.

"They've been really worthwhile because I'm learning things I don't learn in school, and that I don't think they even teach in the university here," he said. "For instance, we don't learn artificial intelligence here. We don't have labs for it."

The study of artificial intelligence deals with things like robots. And robots are too expensive for schools in poorer countries.

## Finding The Best And Brightest

Roosemberth is an example of one of the best things about MOOCs: They can help find bright students in poorer countries. Such students might otherwise remained undiscovered. And they might never get the chance to use their talents.

Thousands of students from Latin America are taking these online classes.

"Intelligence and ability are distributed equally around the globe," said computer scientist Armando Fox. "It's in everyone's best interest to find and cultivate that talent."
