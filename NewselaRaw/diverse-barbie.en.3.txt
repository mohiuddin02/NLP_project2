WASHINGTON â€” Barbie can finally stop wearing high-heeled shoes.

The toy company Mattel has released a line of "Fashionista" Barbies. For the first time in more than 50 years, Barbie can wear comfortable shoes.

Mattel first made Barbie in
 1959. Since then, she has had to wear only high heels. Even when you 
took off her shoes, her plastic feet remained on tiptoe.

The 23 new "Fashionista" Barbie dolls have ankles that move. Her feet adjust to wear either heels or shoes with flat soles. The dolls also come in a greater variety. They have eight skin tones and 14 face shapes. There are 22 hairdos, 23 hair colors and 18 eye colors.

## Dolls Look More Like Real People

The Barbie Fashionistas look like the people girls see around them, said Ani Istanboulian. She works for Mattel.

She said new Barbies have "street style." Many of the dolls look great in flat shoes, Istanboulian said.

The news created a lot of buzz this week. Many grown-ups feel sorry for Barbie's sore feet. They celebrated the change in footwear.

Finally, Barbie can be free from her pain, MTV Style said.

A fashion magazine article wondered if an overweight Barbie was next. The classic Barbie doll has an unusual body type. Barbie is very skinny and does not look like a normal woman.

## "One Small Step For Barbie"

"In plastic world, this is all huge news," the magazine article said. "One small step for Barbie, one huge leap for womankind."

The Mattel website shows some Barbie dolls wearing flat shoes instead of high heels.

The switch to flats has not solved one problem for these Barbies. Mattel warns that the dolls with long legs still cannot stand up by themselves.
