MARYSVILLE, Wash. — More kids in the United States are learning about computers. Some are learning the language that makes computers work. The language is called code.

Lauren Meek is one of these children. She is 6 years old. She is in kindergarten. Lauren made a set of instructions using code. Then she hit a button on the computer. A character went through a maze. 

"Yes! This is so easy," Lauren said. 

## Think, Create, Code!

People in business want more young people to learn about computers. Other groups do, too. They are helping some schools to teach computer classes. 

Students in the classes learn how computers work. Some experts say computer science teaches kids to think clearly. It also helps them be creative by using their imagination. Computers will be an important part of the students' lives. The classes teach them about computers when they are young.

Hadi Partovi started a group called Code.org. The group wants more students to try computer science.  

The group helps run an event. It is called "Hour of Code." The idea is to get millions of students to try coding for an hour.

## Critic Says Kids Don't Need Coding Classes

Not everybody agrees with teaching computers to young people. Jim Taylor does not. He wrote a book. It is about children growing up with computers. He said there is no proof that learning to code works. Kids do not need to learn about computers so soon, he said.

Most U.S. high schools do not teach computer science. Only 1 in 4 do. Even fewer schools teach it in lower grades. It is hard to find computer teachers.

## Getting Ready For Tomorrow's Jobs

Kelly Sheward is the principal at Lauren's school. More than half the students are from low-income families. Their families do not have much money. Learning computers helps, Kelly said. It can help these students become more ready for jobs someday. They can be as prepared as students in other schools.

Hank Palmer teaches fifth grade at the school. He said computer science is important. It is almost as important as reading and math, he said.
