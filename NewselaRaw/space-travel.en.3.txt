Going to the stars is often regarded as the future of human travel. Scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit space beyond Earth. He said, "Earth is humanity's cradle, but you're not meant to stay in your cradle forever." However, in the century since this vision was proposed, we have learned things about the universe and ourselves. The things suggest moving out into space may not be our future after all.

A big problem is the size of the universe. Its size was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars. For example, Tau Ceti is one of the closest stars to us. It is 100 billion times farther from Earth than our moon. We can't simply send people over such immense distances in a spaceship. A spaceship cannot support humans for the centuries it would take to travel. Instead of a spaceship, we would have to make an ark. The ark would need to be big enough to support a community of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological system.

However, the ark would have to be small enough to move at a fairly high speed. A bigger ark needs more fuel to slow itself down on reaching its final stop. For that reason and others, smaller is better. However, smallness creates problems for balancing the ecosystem. Both a big and a small ark have problems, so we would have to find a way to design a medium-sized craft.

## Humans Can Adjust

Another problem is the effects on our microbiomes. Our microbiome is made up of very small creatures called microbes that live in our bodies and keep us healthy. The microbiome system works in a delicate balance on Earth. Traveling to the stars means leaving that delicate balance without knowing what might happen. Any ark would therefore be an experiment. Its inhabitants would be lab animals. The first humans aboard might have volunteered to be experimental subjects, but their descendants would not have. These descendants would have no chance of escape.

Rules would have to be enforced to keep the experiment functioning. Having children would not be a matter of free choice. People would have to keep up the population in the ark. Many jobs would be required to keep the ark functioning, so work would also not be a free choice. There is a high chance people would face many difficulties following the rules. 

Still, humans can adjust. All the problems outlined so far might be solved. People enclosed in an ark might cross space successfully to a nearby planetary system. However, even if they do, their problems will have just begun.

## Poor Chances Of Success

Any planetary body the voyagers try to inhabit will be either alive or dead. If there is life, the problems of living in foreign surroundings could range from harmless to deadly. If voyagers find a dead planetary body, then they will have to make it livable. Making it livable will take centuries. Meanwhile, the ark would have to continue to work without failures.

Overall, there are many problems with traveling through space in an ark. There are other problems with trying to live on another planet. While it is not impossible, the project would have very poor chances of success. 

## Earth Needs To Be Sustainable First

Several steps would need to happen before launching people into space on an ark. First, there would need to be a human community on Earth like the one on the ark. It would teach us many of the things we would need to know. Second, there would need to be a great deal of practice in an ark orbiting our sun. Third, there would need to be robots that travel to nearby planetary systems to see if any of them can support humans.

The first step is the most important. If we don't first make a successful human community on our own world, there is no Planet B.
