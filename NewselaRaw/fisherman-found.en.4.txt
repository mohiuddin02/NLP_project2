His family was not ready to give up, though. They decided to wait at least four months before admitting he could no longer be alive.

The weeks and months passed. Jordan's family kept hoping he would turn up, but they didn't hear from him. The family began to lose hope.

On Friday, their prayers were finally answered: Jordan walked out of a hospital and into his parents' arms. He was 50 pounds thinner, but smiling.

"A lot of us didn't believe we'd see this day," said Glen Davis, Jordan's stepfather.

## "Everything Was Upside Down"

Jordan was spotted on the ocean Thursday afternoon. He was quickly rescued from his crippled boat. Jordan was found about 200 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

Jordan left on a fishing trip in January. A couple of days later, he ran into rough weather. His boat was knocked over and its mast was broken.

"I was flying through the air," he said on Friday. "Everything was upside down and backwards."

Jordan ended up with a broken shoulder.

Later, the boat was knocked over at least two more times.

Jordan survived on just a bit of food. He fried flour pancakes on a small stove and caught fish with a hand net. He collected rainwater whenever he could.

"For such a long time I was so thirsty," Jordan said Friday. At one point he was almost completely out of water. "Every day I was like, 'Please God, send me some rain, send me some water,'" he said. Right before he ran out of water, it finally rained.

He read the Bible all the way through many times, Jordan told rescuers. A blanket protected him from cold winds and the burning sun.

## Family Handed Out Fliers

Meanwhile, Jordan's parents grew more and more worried. Two months had gone by with no word from him.

They became even more concerned when he did not call on his mother's birthday.

The family began handing out fliers with Jordan's photo. Perhaps he had returned from his trip without calling them, they thought. If so, somebody might have spotted him.

As time went on, it became harder to believe Jordan was still alive, said Davis.

On Thursday, the family got the great news they had been hoping for. Jordan's father text-messaged them that Jordan had been found alive.

Jordan was rescued by a giant cargo ship. "They saw me on the front of my boat, standing up there waving my arms," he said Friday.

"He walked right up to me," said Kyle McCollum, of the U.S. Coast Guard, who lifted Jordan off the boat. "He had this nice smile on his face and I could tell he was in good spirits."

## His Bible And His Blanket

Jordan said his Bible and his blanket were the two things that gave him hope.

"I haven't heard you in so long," Jordan told his father. "I was afraid that you guys were crying and sad," he said. He worried that his family must be thinking he was dead, he said.

"We were,' Jordan's father replied. "I thought I lost you."

By Friday, Jordan was back at home in North Carolina. He was looking forward to a nice meal and to seeing his family again.

"The last couple weeks really weighed heavy on us," Davis said. "Now we're going to have a great Easter."
