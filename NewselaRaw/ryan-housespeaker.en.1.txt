WASHINGTON, D.C. - Paul D. Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, was elected speaker of the House of Representatives Thursday, and he immediately declared it "broken" and in need of reform.

The problems Ryan identified had less to do with fighting between Republicans and Democrats and more to do with divisions within his own party over tactics and ideology.

Those problems drove out former Speaker John A. Boehner, who in September announced he would resign his seat in Congress and along with it, the top leadership position in the House. Boehner's ouster prompted Ryan to pledge to return some of the power collected in recent decades by House leadership to its members.

"We are not solving problems; we are adding to them," Ryan said in a short speech after his election Thursday morning. "I am not interested in laying blame. We are not settling scores. We are wiping the slate clean. Neither the members nor the people are satisfied with how things are going. We need to make some changes, starting with how the House does business."

## He Could Help Unify Republicans

There was early evidence that Ryan might be the unifying force most Republicans hoped he would be.

Ryan got 236 votes, winning the support of all but nine of his Republican colleagues who voted for Representative Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida. All but three Democrats, meanwhile, supported House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California.

Following the vote, Ryan began his remarks to the House with a call for unity — and not only among the Republicans.

"Let's pray for each other, Republicans for Democrats, and Democrats for Republicans," he said, "and I don't mean pray for a conversion. Pray for a deeper understanding."

## Ryan Is Youngest Speaker Since 1869

He paid attention to demands of conservatives who felt sidelined by Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, and called for committees of representatives in Congress to take the lead in writing major legislation, instead of just the leaders: "We need to return to regular order," he said, embracing a watchword of Boehner critics.

"We have nothing to fear from honest differences honestly stated," Ryan added. "If you have ideas, let's hear them. A greater clarity between us can lead to a greater charity among us."

Ryan, who at 45 is the youngest speaker elected since 1869, took the oath of office from Representative John Conyers, 86, a Democrat from Michigan and the longest-serving member of the House.

Looking on were his family, including his wife, Janna, and children Liza, 13, Charlie, 12, and Sam, 10. Also seated in the speaker's box were former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and current Kansas Governor Sam Brownback. Ryan was Romney's running mate during his unsuccessful 2012 presidential run, and he served as a former legislative aide to Brownback.

## Former Speaker Leaves With "No Regrets, No Burdens"

Brownback said Ryan will have a key role advocating for Republican priorities ahead of next year's presidential election.

"He can help set that agenda, and he can set up the topics, that if you win the presidency in 2016, those will be topics that will then move, and that's a very important spot to be in," Brownback said.

Boehner, who cast the final vote for Ryan, said he leaves the House as "the same regular guy that came here" from the suburbs of Cincinnati 25 years ago.

"I leave with no regrets, no burdens," he said.

Boehner also left Ryan with a agreement hashed out with President Barack Obama that would increase government spending by $80 billion through 2017. It also raised the federal debt limit — the amount of money the government can owe as a result of borrowing in the past. The agreement enraged hard-line conservatives but cleared major obstacles from Ryan's path in his first 16 months as speaker.

## New Speaker Faces Pitfalls

Most Webster backers — many of them members of the hard-line conservatives — supported Ryan after he spent the past week reassuring them that they will play a more prominent role in lawmaking.

"I was voting my conscience," said Representative Louis Gohmert of Texas, one of the Webster supporters. He explained that he wished Ryan well but disagreed with him on key issues such as the 2008 financial bailout that gave large banks money to keep running.

There are clear pitfalls ahead for Ryan. In the coming weeks, he will have to get the House to pass a major spending bill ahead of a December 11 deadline for a government shutdown. The budget deal passed Thursday eliminates the major points of debate with Obama. However, the conservatives are threatening to shut down the government if it continues to fund Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions and other health services to women.

Webster, in an interview, said Ryan is "hoping he gets a semi-pass" on the spending bill "because it's been sort of dumped on him."

Asked how Ryan could handle those issues without alienating conservatives, Webster said he should start discussing them today.

The major problem, he said, is that "you wait 'til the very end so there's only one choice, and we can't do that, and I don't think he's wanting to do that. I think he wants to say, let's take up these important issues sooner so that we're not pushed up against a deadline."

## The Future "Looks Brighter," Republican Says

Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, who abandoned his own hopes of becoming speaker earlier this month in the face of opposition from conservative Republicans, said Ryan would be able to meet those challenges. "The future looks brighter," he said Thursday. "Yeah, there's work involved in that, but the hurdles are not as high as they were a week ago."

The Republican representatives are more united, McCarthy said, "and when we're united, we can accomplish big things."
