FAIRHOPE, Ala. â€“ In 1931, nine black teenagers were falsely accused of attacking two white women. They were known as the Scottsboro Boys. They were all found guilty in an Alabama court.

The nine are long dead. But on Thursday, Alabama's parole board pardoned the men, thanks to the work of one woman who wouldn't give up.

Pardoning the Scottsboro Boys means the men had their names cleared.

The Scottsboro Boys case was an important moment in history. It led to two major Supreme Court decisions, and helped start the civil rights movement in the many years that followed.

## Reputations Ruined

But during that time, the Scottsboro Boys became men, went into hiding, and eventually died. Their reputations were ruined. That changed only after a long fight by a woman from Scottsboro.

In the mid-1970s, when Sheila Washington was 17, she found a package under her parents' bed. It was a pillowcase, which held something rolled in layers of plastic. She unwrapped it, and a book tumbled out.

"An old, thin paperback," she said Thursday. It was book about nine boys who were black, like her. What she read changed her life.

Young people throughout the South hopped trains looking for work during the Great Depression in the 1930s. In 1931, nine teenage black boys, a few white boys and two white girls got on a train to Memphis.

A fight started, and the outnumbered white boys jumped off and went to the police. In Paint Rock, Ala., officers boarded the train. They arrested every black male, ranging from 13 to 19 years old. They also found the two white girls, who claimed they had been attacked.

## Decides To Do Something

Sheila Washington's father caught her as she read the boys' story and he snatched the book from her hands. She heard fear in his voice. "You don't need to know about that," he said. "Just keep quiet about this now."

After Washington's brother died in 1978 in the same prison where the Scottsboro boys had been held, she decided to do something.

Washington began work on a plan to make a museum about the Scottsboro Boys. People in town expressed outrage. "They said I was disgracing the good name of Scottsboro," she said.

After almost 20 years of work, she opened the museum where visitors could learn about the case, right out in the open.

Along the way she realized that civil rights leaders had abandoned the boys, she said. They focused instead on Rosa Parks. She was the Alabama woman who refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger in 1955. "After Rosa Parks, everybody shifted to her case, because it looked better and smelled better," she said.

Even after it became clear the Scottsboro Boys had committed no crime, they still lived with the reputation of attacking the two women.

## Parole Board Grants Pardons

Their nine trials took just two days. Everyone on the jury was white. The lawyer whose job it was to defend them didn't know Alabama law. All but the youngest teen was sentenced to die. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court made two historic decisions: that race cannot be the reason to keep someone off a jury, and that people on trial have the right to a proper lawyer.

In 1937, one of the women who accused the boys took back her story, saying had never been assaulted. That led to five of the boys' convictions being thrown out. One of them, Clarence Norris, received a pardon in 1976.

By then, the remaining boys had died, but Sheila Washington felt they still deserved to have their names cleared. She went before the Alabama parole board but was told there was no process for pardoning dead people.

So she approached state Sen. Arthur Orr, a white Republican whose greatest remembrance of the case, he said, came from a television special about one of the judges.

Orr drew up a bill that would allow for pardons for dead people. They could be pardoned in cases where they were discriminated against because of their skin color. In April, when Orr presented his bill, Republicans and Democrats all agreed with it. The law passed unanimously.

On Thursday, when the parole board granted the pardons, people burst into applause. Republican Gov. Robert J. Bentley issued a statement saying, "The pardons granted to the Scottsboro Boys today are long overdue."

"I believe the boys can rest now," Washington said.
