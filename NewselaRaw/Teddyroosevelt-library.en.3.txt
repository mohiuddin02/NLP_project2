BISMARCK, N.D. â€” President Theodore Roosevelt was a great outdoorsman and lover of nature. He created hundreds of national forests, parks and monuments during his presidency. His history, though, is being preserved online.

A group of Roosevelt scholars and fans are completing a design for a library and museum to honor his life. Unlike other presidential libraries, Roosevelt's will exist mainly on the Internet.

The physical library is expected to open in 2019 in Dickinson, about 35 miles east of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota. The national park is located partly on ranchland Roosevelt once owned. The library has already made thousands of documents, letters and photographs available online.

Roosevelt served as the 26th president from 1901 to 1909. He was an author, a soldier, a hunter, an explorer and a naturalist. He loved the country's rugged wilderness. The teddy bear was named after him after he refused to shoot an old black bear in 1902. Roosevelt hated it, though, when people called him "Teddy."

## Scattered Far And Wide

A presidential library collects the papers, records and belongings of a president. It gives people a greater understanding of a president and the effect he had on the country. The National Archives in Washington, D.C., oversees all presidential libraries from Herbert Hoover on. Hoover, the 31st president, served from 1929 to 1933. Any library for a president before Hoover must be built without the help of the federal government.

Roosevelt's papers are scattered across the country. They are in private collections and at places like the Library of Congress and Harvard University.

So far, the Theodore Roosevelt Center at Dickinson State University has digitally scanned about 50,000 documents. They include Roosevelt's personal and presidential notes, letters and belongings. The university hopes to add hundreds of thousands of more documents to its growing collection.

"It's very difficult to create a traditional presidential library for TR," said project manager Sharon Kilzer. "All the materials will never be gathered physically in one place."

She said the digital approach could be used for other presidential libraries.

## Abe Lincoln Got Digitalized Too

Other libraries outside of the National Archives system have also digitized much of their material. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois, is a good example of that. But those libraries already have a large collection of physical artifacts. The online material doesn't replace them.

The Theodore Roosevelt Library and Museum is expected to open by 2020. Scholars hope it will eventually include every Roosevelt-related item they can find.

"And I think that's an interesting phenomenon; it's a very 21st-century idea," said Daniel Stowell. He is the director and editor of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln. Stowell also is involved with the Roosevelt library.

Stowell thinks the Roosevelt library site will become the headquarters for Roosevelt scholars and fans. In time, it will slowly collect more actual objects to exhibit at the museum.

"Whatever topics you're interested in from Roosevelt's life and career ... the digital images are all brought together," he said.

## The "Cradle Of Conservation"

Last year, the North Dakota Legislature set aside $12 million to build the library. The city of Dickinson also promised $3 million more. The library will probably cost more, though.

Richard Woollacott is the project manager for Hilferty &amp; Associates. The company designs museums and exhibits. It is working on the master design plan for the library. Woollacott said Roosevelt's library will resemble a building from Roosevelt's time. He said it will look "like the Gilded Age, but updated with computers." The Gilded Age, a term created by author Mark Twain, refers to the final three decades of the 19th century.

Woollacott said the library will include computer stations. There, people can look up more information about an exhibit.

Roosevelt fell in love with the North Dakota wilderness, also called the badlands, during a 1883 hunting trip. He returned the following year. He started the Elkhorn Ranch where he raised cattle.

Organizers hope that the natural beauty of the badlands will help visitors better understand Roosevelt. The area is often called the "cradle of conservation" and inspired him to protect the country's unspoiled land. "It was here that the romance of my life began," Roosevelt later wrote.
