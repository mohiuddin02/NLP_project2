Their concept was confirmed last year by the discovery of the so-called Higgs particle, at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. The particle is also known as the Higgs boson. Some call it the "God particle."

"I am overwhelmed to receive this award and thank the Royal Swedish Academy," the 84-year-old Higgs said in a statement released by the University of Edinburgh, where he was a professor before retiring. "I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research."

Asked whether he could have imagined getting a Nobel Prize when he started the research 50 years ago, the 80-year-old Englert said no.

## "Milestone In The History Of Physics"

"You don't work thinking to get the Nobel Prize, that's not how you work," Englert said. "(Still) we had the impression that we were doing something that was important, that would later on be used by other researchers."

The announcement, which was widely expected, was delayed an hour, which is highly unusual. The academy decides the winners in a majority vote on the day of the announcement.

Staffan Normark, the permanent secretary of the academy, said the academy had tried to reach Higgs on Tuesday but "all the numbers we tried he did not answer." He wouldn't say if that's why the announcement was delayed.

Just awarding the men behind the theoretical discovery of the particle solved a tricky problem for the committee. It did not have to single out one of the thousands of scientists at CERN laboratory to share the award. The Nobel award can only be split by three people at most.

Academy member Ulf Danielsson noted that the prize announcement also honored the work done at CERN. He called the discovery "a milestone in the history of physics."

"This is a giant discovery, it means the final building block in the so-called standard model for particle physics has been put in place," Danielsson said. The standard model is the basic picture of how physics operates on Earth.

## A Riddle That Matters

Englert and Higgs theorized about the existence of the particle in the 1960s to provide an answer to a riddle: Why matter has mass. The tiny particle, they believed, acts like molasses on snow — causing other basic building blocks of nature to stick together, slow down and form atoms.

Without it, particles would keep flying through the universe, never coming together.

Scientists wanted to know how matter formed just after the Big Bang. They came up with an explanation that centers on the idea that there is an invisible field throughout the universe. As particles travel through the field, they are slowed down like a ball rolling through molasses. If this is the case, then it should be possible to detect a type of particle, dubbed the Higgs boson, where the fields clump together.

But decades would pass before scientists at CERN were able to confirm its existence in July 2012. To find it, they had to build a $10 billion collider in a 17-mile tunnel beneath the Swiss-French border.

Scientists used the collider to slam trillions of protons into each other. The collider produces energies simulating those 1 trillionth to 2 trillionths of a second after the Big Bang. Scientists examined data from the collisions to find proof that the Higgs boson existed.

Only about one collision per trillion will produce one of the Higgs bosons in the collider. It took CERN some time after the discovery of a new "Higgs-like" boson to decide that the particle was, in fact, very much like the Higgs boson that had been expected in the original formulation.

## Particles That Shaped The Universe

Michael Turner, president of the American Physical Society, an organization of physicists, said the Higgs particle captured the imagination of the public.

"If you're a physicist, you can't get in a taxi anywhere in the world without having the driver ask you about the Higgs particle," said Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago.

He said the finding of the Higgs completed the standard model. But beyond that, he said, it represents the first in a class of particles that scientists think played a role in shaping the universe. That means it points the way to tackling mysteries like the nature of so-called dark energy and dark matter.

The physics prize was the second of this year's Nobel awards to be announced. On Monday, the Nobel Prize in medicine was given to American scientists James Rothman, Randy Schekman and Thomas Sudhof for discoveries about how key substances are moved around within cells.

The prizes were started by a successful Swedish businessman, Alfred Nobel. The award money and medals will be handed out on Dec. 10 — the anniversary of his death in 1896. Each prize is worth 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million).
