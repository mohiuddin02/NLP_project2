UNITED NATIONS  — William Shakespeare's "Hamlet" is going global.

A production of the play hopes to visit every country in the world in two years. This week it landed at the United Nations, where the tale of the conflicted Danish prince received a loud and enthusiastic standing ovation from top diplomats.

This stripped-down production by Shakespeare's Globe, a theater in London, played at the U.N.'s New York headquarters for about 500 guests. The play, which includes international intrigue between Denmark and Norway, was set against a backdrop of real-world crises in Gaza and Ukraine.

"It's an absolute delight to be here. It's extraordinary. It feels very, very odd. But very pleasurably odd," said Dominic Dromgoole, artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe. "We like bold ideas. We like bold, simple — some would say stupid — ideas."

## The Globe's Globe-Trotting

The tour hopes to visit 205 nations and territories on all seven continents. The number is not exact, as countries and territories can change.

Before landing in New York, the tour has already performed in 28 countries and traveled 19,295 miles (31,053 kilometers). The tour began this spring at its London home, a reconstructed 16th-century theater on the River Thames.

With so much ground to cover, the production must travel light — the scenery is just a few steamer trunks, cloth sheets, wood beams and rope. The actors play multiple roles as well as instruments such as drums, violins and mandolins.

Even with these limitations, an enthusiastic cast brings the play to life. The audience at the U.N. included actress Kim Cattrall of "Sex and the City" fame and performance artist Laurie Anderson in the front row.

The U.N. is only the latest unusual place that these actors have performed "Hamlet." Past locations included opera halls, market places and beaches. The troupe hopes to visit all the world's countries, including Iraq, North Korea and Syria. They also hope to perform in the West Bank, though no firm plans have been announced.

"Inclusivity is a much better policy than exclusivity," said Dromgoole. "If you do start excluding anyone, you do have to ask the question 'Where do you start and where do you stop?'"

## A Multicultural Cast

The show has already played in some conflict zones. Amid the continued dispute between Russia and Ukraine, the show was performed in both Moscow and Kiev, the capital of Ukraine. At the Kiev performance, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko was in attendance.

The production next moves on to Central America and the Caribbean, stopping in the Bahamas on Wednesday and on to Mexico, Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica. Later this summer it will head to Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

The tour features a portable set and a 12-person multicultural cast that includes Hong Kong-born actress Jennifer Leong and Maori actor Rawiri Paratene.

The title role, Prince Hamlet, is alternated between London actor Naeem Hayat and Nigeria-born Ladi Emeruwa.

At the U.N., Hayat played Hamlet with poise, confidently portraying the young prince's crushing indecision and apparent madness.

## "We're Here To Tell A Story"

An international audience of U.N. diplomats might bring varied perspectives to the play, Emeruwa said.

"I think it'll mean different things to different people depending on what sort of situation they're in or what sort of situation their country is in as well," he said.

Since the show's journey began in London on April 23 — Shakespeare's 450th birthday — it has already made stops from Amsterdam to Prague, Cyprus to Ukraine. The tour concludes at its home theater on April 23, 2016 — the 400th anniversary of the Bard's death.

Despite the warm reception at the U.N., Paratene, who plays Polonius, Claudius or the Ghost, recognized the limits of art when faced with long-standing international problems.

"It would be foolish of us to go in thinking that we could get the diplomats to operate better," he said. "All we can do is tell the story and if they glean from that something that makes the Israeli representative go to the other side of the room and sit next to the Palestinian representative and maybe kiss each other on the cheek and talk and listen, that would be very nice. But that's not what we're here to do. We're here to tell a story."
