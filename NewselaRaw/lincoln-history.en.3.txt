WASHINGTON â€” President Abraham Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865. He died early the next morning.

This month it is 150 years since Lincoln was killed. In the years that followed his death, Americans have changed their view of our 16th president many times.

Lincoln is celebrated as the president who ended slavery in the United States. He is also hailed for keeping the country from splitting apart. By defeating the Confederate forces during the Civil War (1860-1865), he kept the slave-owning South from leaving the Union.

But some of the problems Lincoln faced in his fight against racism are still with us.

## Studying Lincoln From All Sides

Consider the recent shootings in Ferguson, Missouri, and North Charleston, South Carolina. In both cities a white police officer shot an unarmed black man to death. As these recent events show, the nation's struggles over race continue.

It was hoped that the election of Barack Obama, the country's first black president, could fix some racial problems. However, many of the challenges Lincoln faced have also come up during Obama's presidency. As a result, people are thinking about Lincoln in new ways.

"All generations rethink Lincoln," historian Martha Hodes said.

Hodes said memories of Lincoln are linked to painful current events and to "renewed calls for justice."

Other historians agree. They point to today's fights over voting rights. They feel that laws in certain states prevent some blacks from voting. In his time, Lincoln had to deal with strong resistance when he tried to give blacks equal voting rights.

Lincoln was not murdered because he freed the slaves, said historian Michael Burlingame. He was killed "because on April 11, 1865, he publicly called for black voting rights."

Booth was in the audience for that speech, and vowed then to kill Lincoln, said Burlingame.

## Symbol Of Hope, Then Disappointment

Lincoln should be honored as someone who died fighting for civil rights, Burlingame said. He should be thought of alongside Martin Luther King and others who were killed for fighting for racial justice.

Lincoln has not always been seen positively, however.

Lincoln was viewed extremely favorably during the 1950s. However, in the years that followed "a big change took place," historian Richard Wightman Fox said.

In the 1960s and 1970s, historians began to question whether Lincoln really cared that much about ending slavery. Perhaps, they said, he had other reasons for wanting to fight against the South. Some scholars argued that the Civil War was really more about money or power than slaves.

African-Americans first began to turn away from Lincoln during the Great Depression of the 1930s, said historian Edna Greene Medford. Many people were out of work during those years, but things were particularly hard for blacks.

Lincoln suddenly became a symbol of disappointment for many African-Americans.

"These former slaves recalled what life was supposed to be and what it was not," Medford said. "They were saying, 'Lincoln freed us, but he didn't give us anything but our freedom. We needed land, we needed more opportunity.'"

## A Leader In A Difficult Time

However, the African-American connection with Lincoln "never totally dies out," Medford said. In 1963, King delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. King talked about liberation and "how people are still suffering" in ways that recalled Lincoln, Medford said.

Today, many black Americans "understand the complexity of the man," Medford said. They "are understanding more what Lincoln was about, why he did what he did" as a leader in a time when many Americans supported slavery.

Newly examined letters show that Lincoln was very concerned about the suffering the Civil War caused. The president wrote many letters to the families of Northern soldiers, said James Cornelius of the Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. They show that he "cared deeply, individually, about each man he sent off to war, and possible death."

Lincoln fully understood "his duty as commander in chief to every soldier," Cornelius said.
