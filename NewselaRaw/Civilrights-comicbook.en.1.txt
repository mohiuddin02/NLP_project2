He worked with the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and others. They used peaceful methods like marches and demonstrations to change unjust laws that denied their people equal rights.

Now a United States congressman, John Lewis tells of that historic era in a comic book, "March:  Book Two." The graphic novel is the second installment in a series that describes Lewis' journey during the civil rights movement. "March" takes readers inside the days when he and his fellow nonviolent protesters faced a rising wave of violent attacks by white Southerners and police.

## "Almost Makes Me Cry"

The 74-year-old Democratic representative from Georgia said that when he turned the pages, it brought back those years when he was in his early 20s. He remembered the beatings, bus bombing, the dogs and fire hoses turned on protesting children by police.

"The drama of what happened, how it happened — it's so moving to me and so powerful, and for me to look at some of the drawings, it almost makes me cry," he said.

Martin Luther King Jr.'s father was also a preacher. He used to give his son preaching advice — "Make it plain, son, make it plain," Lewis said. "And I think 'March: Book Two' makes it plain and makes it possible for the young to understand, to feel it."

Lewis' latest book comes amid renewed attention to the civil rights era due to the new film "Selma." The movie is based on the famous march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital in Montgomery in 1965 to seek equal voting rights for African-Americans. During the march, Lewis was clubbed in the head by police, which the film shows.

## Sit-Ins, Freedom Rides

Lewis' first book, the best-selling "March: Book One," begins when he was a boy on his parents' farm in Alabama. It takes his story up to his embrace of nonviolent resistance, which became a way of fighting back peacefully against injustice. In the South, black people were forbidden to sit with white people at restaurant lunch counters. To show this was wrong, they sat at the counters reserved for whites and refused to move, in an act called sit-ins.

His second book picks up the story in the fall of 1960, as the movement's early gains led to increasingly brutal resistance from white Southerners. It covers the Freedom Rides by civil rights activists who rode buses into the segregated South. The book ends with the 1963 March on Washington, the rally attended by more than 200,000 people where King gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. Lewis was one of six organizers, and is the only one still living.

"March: Book Two" also includes the Birmingham, Alabama, church bombing that killed four young African-American girls.

Lewis was first elected to Congress in 1986. He worked on the books with co-author Andrew Aydin, one of his aides, and artist Nate Powell.

## Teaching About The Movement

Hundreds of schools in 40 states have used the first "March" book. Aydin and Lewis know because they keep a tally of the places where they've heard from students and teachers. Georgia State University, Marquette University in Wisconsin and Michigan State University use the book in freshman reading programs.

It helps fill a gap, Aydin said.

"Unfortunately, the civil rights movement is barely taught at all," he said. "And there's virtually no education for the nonviolent philosophy or civil disobedience."

In a 2011 report, the Southern Poverty Law Center found that 16 states didn't require instruction about the civil rights movement. In 19 others, it found that coverage was minimal, and that most states do not teach the era well.

Lewis and Aydin have been visiting schools and universities around the country.

Last year, a grand jury decided not to indict, or charge, the white police officer who shot and killed unarmed black youth Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Soon after, students in Louisiana created an organization modeled on the national student movement Lewis led. They were inspired by the student movement in the first book, Aydin said.

## Peaceful Protests

He said the book helps young people, who are pushing for social change, learn from those who came before them.

"They could all benefit about understanding how nonviolent protests succeeded in the past in pressuring political leaders to act," Aydin said.

The "March" books don't cover up anything. Lewis nearly dies early in the second book. An angry restaurant owner, who refuses to serve Lewis, locks him and other civil rights activists in the restaurant and tries to poison them.

Aydin got the idea for the book in 2008, when he worked as Lewis' spokesman for his re-election campaign. One day staffers were talking about what beach they'd hit after the election ended. Aydin said he'd go to a comic book convention. People laughed.

## Inspired By A Comic Book

"Don't laugh," Lewis told them. He said that a comic book in the 1950s called "Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story" had inspired him when he was 17, growing up 50 miles from Montgomery.

Aydin asked Lewis why didn't he write a comic book now.

"Asking an icon, a sitting congressman, to write a comic book. It was preposterous," Aydin said, "But it was still a good idea."

Both books flash-forward to 2009, when Lewis attended President Barack Obama's first inauguration. Aydin was there working for Lewis, watching a moment in history that his boss and many others had helped make possible.

More needs to be done to shine a light on that era, he thought, and a comic book might be the way to do it.
