The show Prabal Gurung put on was particularly special. Garung is a fashion designer. He creates ideas for clothes. He also grew up in Nepal. Earlier this year, Nepal was hit by a terrible earthquake. The ground shook. Many people were killed. Old buildings crumbled and fell down.

Most of Nepal's people are Buddhists. They believe in Buddhism, a religion. Some men and women spend their lives studying and teaching Buddhism. The men who do this are known as monks. They wear special robes. The robes are reddish-orange and yellow.

## Singing For Nepal And Its People

On Sunday night, Garung opened his show with Buddhist singing. A group of monks sang slowly and peacefully. They wore red and yellow robes. Their singing was a way of saying a prayer for Nepal and its people.

When they had finished, the monks left silently. Then, the show's music came on. Soon, the first fashion models appeared. They had on flowing dresses colored orange, yellow and red. The dresses were the same colors as the robes the monks wore.

Garung grew up in Nepal. This has been a very hard year for him. Like all people from Nepal, he was saddened by the earthquake. He still has family and friends back in Nepal. The people there need help badly.

## Beautiful Clothes Hold Special Meaning

Gurung began thinking back to his early life in Nepal. He remembered what he saw, heard and smelled. Soon he decided to make clothing that would say something about Nepal. He wanted to show the world what his country was about.

The clothes he made are beautiful. They also say something about what Nepal means to him.

It did not matter that most people at the show knew little about Nepal. Gurung made the country and its people feel close.

His fashion show was not just about beautiful clothes. It was also about remembering his country and his people.
