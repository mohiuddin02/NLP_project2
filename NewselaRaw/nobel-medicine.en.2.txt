STOCKHOLM â€” Three scientists in the United States won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discovering how key substances are transported within cells. The process is involved in such important activities as brain cell communication and the release of insulin.

James Rothman, 62, Randy Schekman, 64, and Dr. Thomas Sudhof, 57, won for their research on how tiny bubbles called vesicles act as cargo carriers inside cells. Rothman works at Yale University, Schekman is at the University of  California, Berkeley, and Sudhof is at Stanford University. They will share the $1.2 million prize.

This traffic control system ensures that the cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time. It keeps activities inside cells operating in an orderly fashion, the committee said. Defects can be harmful, leading to neurological diseases, diabetes and disorders affecting the immune system.

"Imagine hundreds of thousands of people who are traveling around hundreds of miles of streets; how are they going to find the right way? Where will the bus stop and open its doors so that people can get out?" Nobel committee secretary Goran Hansson said. "There are similar problems in the cell."

## Discoveries Stretched Through 3 Decades

The winners made their discoveries in the 1970s, '80s and '90s. Those discoveries have helped doctors diagnose a severe form of epilepsy and immune deficiency diseases in children, Hansson said. In the future, scientists hope the research could lead to medicines against more common types of epilepsy, diabetes and other conditions, he added.

Schekman said he was awakened at 1 a.m. at his home in California by the chairman of the prize committee. He was suffering from jet lag after returning from a trip to Germany the night before.

"I wasn't thinking too straight. I didn't have anything elegant to say," he told The Associated Press. "All I could say was 'Oh my God,' and that was that."

He called the prize a wonderful acknowledgment of the work he and his students had done, and said he knew it would change his life.

"I called my lab manager and I told him to go buy a couple bottles of Champagne and expect to have a celebration with my lab," he said.

In the 1970s, Schekman discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle transport. Rothman revealed in the 1980s and 1990s how vesicles delivered their cargo to the right places. Also in the '90s, Sudhof identified the machinery that controls when vesicles release chemical messengers from one brain cell that lets it communicate with another.

## One Got The Call While Driving

"This is not an overnight thing. Most of it has been accomplished and developed over many years, if not decades," Rothman told the AP.

Rothman said he lost grant money for the work recognized by the Nobel committee. He said he will reapply, hoping the Nobel Prize will make a difference.

Sudhof was born in Germany and moved to the United States in 1983. He also has U.S. citizenship. He told the AP he received the call from the committee while driving in southern Spain.

"I got the call while I was driving and like a good citizen I pulled over and picked up the phone," he said. "To be honest, I thought at first it was a joke. I have a lot of friends who might play these kinds of tricks."

The medicine prize kicked off this year's Nobel announcements. The awards in physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics will be announced this week and next. Each prize is worth 8 million Swedish kronor, or $1.2 million.

Rothman and Schekman won the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award for their research in 2002. Getting the Lasker award is often seen as a sign of being a Nobel Prize contender. Sudhof won the Lasker award this year.

## Their Research Has Helped Other Research

"I might have been just as happy to have been a practicing primary-care doctor," Sudhof said after winning that prize. But he worked with patients with severe brain diseases when he was a medical student, he said. "It left an indelible mark on my memory."

Jeremy Berg, former director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences in Maryland, said Monday's announcement was long overdue. It was widely expected because the research was "so fundamental, and has driven so much other research," he said.

Berg said the work provided the framework that scientists use to study how brain cells communicate and how other cells release hormones. In both cases, vesicles play a key role by delivering their cargo to the cell surface and releasing it to the outside, he said.

So the work has indirectly affected research into virtually all neurological disease as well as other diseases, he said.

The prizes were established by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel. They have been handed out by award committees in Stockholm and Oslo since 1901. The winners always receive their awards on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.
