SAN JOSE, Costa Rica â€” The United Nations, or U.N., was founded in 1945 to help bring about peace and cooperation among countries. Almost all of the world's nations are members. The U.N. can't actually force member countries to do things. However, its suggestions and opinions are taken very seriously.

Right now, the United Nations is pushing for a new way of looking at a certain group of people: the many Central Americans who have been coming into the United States.

Many Central Americans are crossing the border into the United States without permission. Currently, countries label them as migrants who left their homes to look for work. If they are caught entering the United States, they are sent back without a chance to defend themselves because they did not apply to come to the United States legally.

The U.N. says that many Central Americans should no longer be thought of as people looking for work. Instead, it says, they should be considered refugees. Refugees are people who have been forced to leave their country because of some serious danger. Unlike migrants searching for jobs, refugees are not simply seeking better opportunities. Typically, they are fleeing war or persecution. The real danger they are in is considered to be a strong reason for granting them protection in the United States. This protection is called asylum.

## A Different Kind Of Refugee

Even if the United States begins to call the [Central Americans refugees](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Central+american+emigration), the problem will not be solved immediately. Calling them refugees will not change the laws. It might, however, increase pressure on the United States and Mexico. It could encourage both countries to accept tens of thousands of people who cannot currently be considered for asylum.

The U.N. is hoping for an important change this week. On Thursday, officials from the United States, Mexico, and Central America will meet in the Central American country of Nicaragua. The group will discuss updating ways of thinking about refugees. Perhaps Central Americans will be called refugees soon.

Most people considered to be refugees are fleeing wars, such as those in Syria or Sudan. Central Americans are fleeing something else: crime. Many Central Americans countries have been taken over by gangs.

Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have become some of the most dangerous countries on Earth. Large areas of all three countries are under the control of gangs. Violence is very common.

Honduras now has more killings than any other nation not at war. Recently, a wave of attacks against churches, schools and buses has made the situation even worse.

In El Salvador, a new war between street gangs has led to a steep rise in the violence. At least 135,000 people have been forced to leave their homes.

The number of people fleeing Honduras and El Salvador is likely to rise.

"They are leaving for some reason," U.N. official Fernando Protti said. "Let's not send them back" automatically, he declared. Instead, we should look at "the reasons they left their country."

## Determining Fair Treatment

The United States has seen a big increase in the number of Central Americans crossing into its territory. In particular, there has been an increase in the number of children traveling alone. More than 52,000 children have been caught since October. Most say they are fleeing the gangs.

The United Nations can't force the U.S. and Mexico to accept Central Americans as refugees. However, a change in thinking could bring pressure on the two countries to do more.

U.N. official Leslie Velez declared that "children and families who fear for their lives" should be treated fairly. They must not be returned automatically, she said. Instead, they should go to court. The court should listen to whether they should be given asylum.
