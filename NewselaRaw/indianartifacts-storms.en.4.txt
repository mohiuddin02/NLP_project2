SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, Calif. â€” Thousands of years ago, people lived on an island near California. It is one of the first places where people made a home in North America. The area where they lived is full of cutting tools. There are also beads and cooking items.

All the things that they used are important to people like Torben Rick. He studies ancient people and is called an archaeologist. Rick works for a museum.

The Native American people who lived here centuries ago fished. They threw nets from canoes made of wood from redwood trees. They cooked dinners on stone grills and carefully chipped out tiny shell beads. The beads were used as money.

But storms and the ocean are destroying the things the people left behind. Rick and others are trying to do something to help.

## Understanding How They Lived

Rick works at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The Smithsonian is a group of museums in Washington, the nation's capital. Rick is in charge of the collection of items from ancient people.

Items found on the island can help us understand how the ancient people lived, Rick said. They can show how the people solved some of the problems we face today. But first, the items have to be saved.

Archaeologists are trying to do just that, by carefully digging up the items. They are working with conservationists, who try to protect nature. Six scientists made up a list earlier this month. The list shows areas on the island that are in danger.

The list will help officials make decisions about saving the places that are in danger.

Four groups have joined in the work. Two are the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Oregon. Leaders of the Chumash tribe make up the third group. The Chumash are Native Americans. Their ancestors lived in the area.

## Arrowheads And Rope

The fourth group is the Nature Conservancy, which manages most of the island. Santa Cruz is the largest of eight Channel Islands. The islands are 36 miles off the coast of Southern California.

The rising sea level is destroying the chance to learn about our past, said Scott Morrison. He works for the Conservancy. "We're trying to do something about that."

Eight sites were labelled "code red." Those sites contain important archaeological items. They also are in danger of being destroyed by rising seas soon.

One of the sites is a cave. Its location is hard to reach. The team saved items there. The items were buried beneath thick layers of sand and wood. The team found arrowheads, stone tools, rope and fabric made from sea grass.

A square piece of redwood was also found in the cave. The wood had brown tar on it. The piece was used to repair a hole in a canoe.

"The last time one of these planks was found was in the 1960s," said Jon M. Erlandson. He is an archaeologist at the University of Oregon. Erlandson is an expert on Santa Cruz Island's cultural items.

## "Before It's Too Late"

"There's not enough time to save everything," he said. The scientists are trying to list and save "all we can before it's too late," he said.

The sea around the island rose between 7,000 and 15,000 years ago. The rising water put much of the evidence of the island's earliest residents under water. Those people traveled the water. They arrived on the island at the end of the last ice age.

Their people lived well. There were a lot of fish and birds and other animals. In 1542, explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo counted several villages with a lot of people as he sailed past. There were many more he did not see.

The island is large. It has valleys, forests, mountains and beaches.

Rick was joined by Gil Unzueta, a Chumash Indian. He is keeping an eye on the effort to list the sites with the ancient items.

"We're standing on a living history book," Unzueta said. "And we're losing pages from it every day."
