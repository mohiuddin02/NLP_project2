WASHINGTON — He's intense, driven, focused on detail, and slightly untidy. Ralph Nader looks like the original geek.

The former presidential candidate is all over the Internet and social media. But it turns out that Nader, who just turned 80, is so last century.

His latest book, "Unstoppable," will soon be out, and like his previous 11 it was typed on a bulky manual typewriter. He doesn't have a cellphone. "Why should I have a cellphone? I have people I don't want to get phone calls from," he says. And his Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and email accounts are written by people working for him, under strict guidelines.

"I've never seen them," he said of his Internet accounts.

Nader is one of a small group of Americans who are "digitally resistant." They avoid electronic communication — from the Internet to smartphones — as much as possible, even as the world goes digital. But there's another emerging group that's also turning to old technology: tech users who don't trust of the amount of electronic spying revealed by former National Security Administration contractor Edward Snowden.

## Worried About Electronic Snooping

Snowden revealed that the U.S. government has been spying on people, reading emails and looking at phone conversations. Officials say this is to keep the country safe but many are unsure.

"After Snowden, how comfortable can anyone be putting their personal or professional life online, or even on their own computer?" asked Warren Sack. He designs computer programs and also does research on new technology.

The Pew Research Center took a poll last month to mark the 25th birthday of the World Wide Web. It found that 81 percent of U.S. adults use laptop and desktop computers at home, work, school or someplace else. The January poll of 1,006 Americans also found that 90 percent of all U.S. adults have cellphones. More than half of these are smartphones. In the 18-29 age group, 98 percent have cellphones. And 83 percent of them are smartphones.

The Pew Research Center's Internet project found that 87 percent of U.S. adults use the Internet at least occasionally. And 71 percent use it every day.

"This is a significant increase from the year 2000, our first measure. Just 29 percent of all adults said they went online on a typical day," according to Pew.

## Young People, Old Typewriters

In many ways, Jamie Patterson, 25, and Matthew Chojnacki, 27, are typical young people. They grew up on the Internet and live a city life in Toronto, Canada.

"I was very much ingrained in the digital culture," said Chojnacki.

But after stumbling onto a sort of garage sale one day, Chojnacki bought a few typewriters and started fixing them up. Pretty soon, he and Patterson had a business. They buy, restore and sell typewriters. Writers used the machines before computers were invented. They used tiny metal letters and ink-soaked ribbons to put words on pieces of paper. There was no screen, no delete key, no Internet and no video games.

To sell their typewriters, Chojnacki and Patterson use a website called OldFortTypewriterCo.com.

"It started out as a hobby, and so many people appreciated it that it became a side venture," Patterson said. In their day jobs, they work for a local transportation agency.

They would lug the typewriters to a weekly "vintage night" at a local bar. Some people would type, others would knit and a disc jockey would play old records on a record player.

"It's got a romantic appeal to it," Chojnacki said of the typewriter. "It's all mechanical."

Jeff Hendrie, an 18-year-old high school senior in the city of Detroit, is a bit unique. He carries a typewriter to school every day and does just about everything the old-fashioned way. Before he typed, he wrote his papers by hand. He uses an old flip phone and considers the U.S. mail "the most secure system." He has an email account out of necessity. But he isn't on social media and teachers who usually send students their assignments by text will give them to him in person instead.

"Pretty much everyone, including myself and my parents, say I was born in the wrong era," Hendrie said.

## Old Phones: Not Smart, But "Beautiful"

Lynne Joyrich teaches classes on modern culture and media at Brown University. But she still likes to use devices from the 1950s and 1960s, like rotary phones.

"I keep them because they are very beautiful," she said of her collection of old phones. Several work.

She has a smartphone to keep in touch with students but often forgets she has it, "for the pleasure of being able to be left alone." And that ability to control whom you are in contact with matters more and more.

"In today's world, there is more — and at the same time, less — comfort with surveillance and people being aware of what you're doing," she said.

New York City-based Laura Pitter, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit group, said: "I'm much more careful about what I do online. I talk in person more now."

She and others who carefully watch human rights worry about governments in other countries spying on them.

"People are keeping things in notebooks," she said. "Even the most savvy people who work in this area find it's very difficult to protect yourself."
