STOCKHOLM, Sweden â€” For the first time in many years, people are living in poverty in Sweden. These people are so poor that they have no electricity or running water.

Last week, Swedish officials closed a Roma camp because it was unsafe. The Roma are also known by the insulting word Gypsies. They are one of the last groups in Europe who are openly treated harshly. The Roma sleep on sidewalks or in shelters made of wood, metal and plastic. They make money by begging on the street and recycling bottles and cans.

Sweden is a country in northern Europe with very few poor people.

Now there are beggars on street corners in large cities and small towns. Many are Roma who came to Sweden from Eastern European countries like Romania and Bulgaria. Long before that, the Roma came to Europe from the country of India.

## After 100 Years, Poverty Is Back

"We are not used to having to see this type of deep poverty," said Martin Valfridsson. He is the person in charge of fixing the problem for the Swedish government. Valfridsson said that Sweden has worked hard for the last 100 years to end poverty.

He said that the Roma started coming to Sweden in 2012. Many more Roma came last year.

In Sweden, the Roma mostly look after themselves. The Roma are European citizens. Because of that, they cannot get asylum to stay in Sweden, which is just for refugees fleeing war or danger in their home countries.

## Roma Get Little Aid From Sweden

Sweden also does not give the Roma much help. They only get emergency aid. It includes a few days of food and housing at homeless shelters and also help returning home.

Many Roma do not even want that. They live on empty plots of land or in parks. Most plan to stay for just a few months. They often intend to go back home or to another country.

"I heard from others it was easier to earn money here," said Maria Carmen. She is a 38-year-old Roma from Romania who came to Sweden with her six children in recent weeks. Her clothes smelled from sleeping in a city park. "But when we got here, nothing."

Begging is not against the law in Sweden. Yet Swedes have begun wondering if giving money to beggars actually does them any good. A few beggars have been attacked on the street.

## Camp Becomes Dangerous

Some Swedes feel sorry for the beggars but also worry about the Roma camps.

In the Swedish city of Malmo, about 200 Roma set up a camp in an empty lot without permission. There was no electricity, running water or toilets. The owner of the lot was unable to make them leave.

As months went by, it became dirtier and dirtier, and trash piled up. Neighbors complained about the terrible smell.

Finally, city officials declared the camp dangerous to the environment and people's health. Protesters demanded that the Roma be allowed to stay, but police cleared out the camp. The Roma and the protesters were forced to leave.

## Sweden Asks Home Countries To Take Action

Veronica Wolgast-Karlberg is in charge of social services in Stockholm, Sweden's capital. The services she runs aid the poor. The city has spent years making rules to make sure people live in safe conditions, she said. "You just cannot live outside of those rules. It's about safety."

About 650 Roma live in 60 small camps in Stockholm, she said.

Valfridsson said the best way to help the Roma is to support ways of making their lives better in their home countries. Swedes should not give them money on the street, he said.

Swedish officials have asked Romania and Bulgaria to improve conditions for the Roma. If life is better for them, they will not need to go to other countries to beg.
