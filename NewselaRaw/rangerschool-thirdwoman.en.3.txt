COLUMBUS, Ga. â€” Graduates of the Ranger School are some of the most highly trained soldiers in the United States Army. They are also some of the strongest. The Army opened Ranger School to women for the first time this year.

Not long ago, the Army held a graduation ceremony for Ranger School. Major Lisa Jaster was awarded the Ranger tab. The special badge was pinned to the sleeve of her uniform.

Jaster was not the first woman to graduate. Captain Kristen Griest and First Lieutenant Shaye Haver finished the Army's challenging Ranger School two months earlier.

## A Test Of Mind And Body

Still, Jaster's graduation was very important. She is 37 years old and is the mother of two children. Her daughter is 3. Her son turned 7 in August, but Jaster missed his birthday. She was trying to finish Ranger School. It is like a long test for your brain and body. Ranger School is usually 62 days long, but it took Jaster 180 days to finish. She had to repeat the different stages of training until she passed each one.

Jaster graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York. She works as an engineer in Houston and serves in an Army Corps Reserve unit. She is married to Marine Lieutenant Colonel Allan Jaster.

Jaster's father, William Peplinski, also completed Ranger School almost 50 years ago. To become the first ever father-daughter Rangers is a very special honor.

## Surviving In All Kinds Of Conditions

Ranger School is very hard. Soldiers learn to survive in the woods, mountains and swamplands with little food or sleep. Living outdoors helps prepare soldiers for battle.

Jaster is not a quitter, but one day her strength was tested. Along with Jaster, Griest and Haver were the only women left. The other 16 women had been dropped from the course. Griest and Haver were moving on to the next phase of training. Jaster thought she would move on also. She had to stay back though. Jaster would have to repeat the phase until she passed. She started to cry. She wanted to give up.

Then Jaster looked at a photo she carried in her pocket. The picture showed her children Zac and Victoria dressed as superheroes. She remembered she had come to Ranger School to be a hero for her children.

## Women's Graduation Marks Change For Program

Jaster wanted to be a part of the Army's test program. The Army wanted to determine whether or not to open more combat roles to women. Jaster wanted to help answer that question. She wanted to prove women are as strong as men.

Her hard work paid off. The Army announced that Ranger School would now be open to both men and women. The next course starts in November. Female soldiers are expected to sign up, the Army said.

Jaster thought she might be treated differently at school because of her gender. Being male or female was unimportant though, she said. Jaster was surprised by that.

Once she got in the field and started training shoulder to shoulder, gender did not matter. Teachers and fellow students only wanted to know if she was tough enough to carry out a mission. Jaster proved she was.
