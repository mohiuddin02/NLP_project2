You may want to hold your nose before reading this: Doctors have found a way to put healthy people's poop into pills — and these pills are now being used to cure serious gut infections. Canadian researchers tried this on 27 patients and cured them all. And this was after strong antibiotics —  medicines designed to kill harmful bacteria — had failed to help.

It's a gross topic but a serious problem. Half a million Americans get Clostridium difficile, or C-diff, infections each year. About 14,000 of them die. The germ causes upset stomachs, cramping and terrible diarrhea.

There is a very strong and expensive antibiotic that can kill C-diff. But it also destroys good bacteria that live in the gut and help keep us healthy, making us more likely to get sick again.

Recently, scientists discovered something interesting: Poop from a healthy person can be used to restore good bacteria in a sick person. Transfers of poop from a healthy person to a sick one are called fecal transplants.

## Pills (Lots) Swallowed In One Sitting

But the methods doctors have been using are expensive and uncomfortable. These include colonoscopies, in which a tube is inserted far up the rear end. Doctors also have tried using throat tubes. Another method is an enema — pumping liquid poop up the rear. This treatment doesn't always work, though.

Now Dr. Thomas Louie of the University of Calgary has come up with a better way: a one-time treatment custom-made for each patient.

Healthy poop, usually from a relative, is processed in the lab to take out the good bacteria. The bacteria is cleaned, then packed into gel capsules. These are triple-coated to prevent them from dissolving before they reach the intestines.

There's no poop left, just bacteria, Louie said. "These people are not eating poop." And there are no smelly burps because the contents aren't released until they're well past the stomach.

Days before starting the treatment, patients are given an antibiotic to kill the C-diff. On the morning of the treatment, they have an enema to clean out their gut. That way, Louie said, "the new bacteria coming in have a clean slate."

It takes 24 to 34 capsules to fit the bacteria needed for a treatment. Patients swallow them in one sitting. The pills make their way to the large intestine, or colon, and seed it with normal bacteria.

## Poop Pills Cured 27 People So Far

On Thursday, Louie described 27 patients treated this way. All had suffered at least four C-diff infections. None got sick again after taking the poop pills.

Sixty-nine-year-old Margaret Corbin had a C-diff infection that lasted for two years.

"It was horrible," she said. "I thought I was dying. I couldn't eat. Every time I ate anything or drank water I was into the bathroom. I never went anywhere, I stayed home all the time."

She took pills made by Louie two years ago, and "I've been perfectly fine since," Corbin said.

Dr. Curtis Donskey praised Louie's work.

"The approach that Dr. Louie has is completely novel — no one else has done this," he said. Donskey believes the new method will be much easier for patients and doctors.

## May Treat Other Gut Problems

Louie's treatment must be made fresh for each patient right now. The reason is that the pills gradually dissolve at room temperature, as their water content breaks down the gel coating. But Minnesota doctors are experimenting with freezing the poop. This doesn't kill the bacteria, so pills could be stored and shipped anywhere a patient needed it.

A person in Minnesota could provide poop to treat someone in Florida, Donskey said. "That's where we're heading."

Other researchers are trying to find which bacteria most help fight off C-diff. Those might be grown in a lab dish and given to patients. Then the patients would not have to take the whole range of bacteria found in normal poop.

The hope is that doctors could give patients just the fighting bacteria, Donskey said.

Louie thinks the poop pills might have other uses besides curing C-diff infections. They may also help people with different kinds of gut bacteria problems. "So," he said, "it's not just about C-diff."
