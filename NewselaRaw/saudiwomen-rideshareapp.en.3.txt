RIYADH, Saudi Arabia â€” Hala Radwan earned a business degree from a university in France and came back to Saudi Arabia to work with a large company. Then she realized she did not know how she would get to and from work.

Women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia.

The country has few public buses and trains and hiring a driver is very expensive. She also did not want to deal with people saying mean things when she tried to hail a cab. Many people in Saudi Arabia frown upon women getting on buses and trains on their own.

"It was a nightmare," she said.

## Driving The Phone Apps

Then friends told her about Uber and a company called Careem. They are like taxi services. You can contact them for a ride through an app on your phone.

In Saudi Arabia's big cities, more and more people are using their phone apps to get a ride. Many businessmen who come from foreign countries do not want to deal with the country's messy taxi system. The app companies say most of their customers in Saudi Arabia are women.

The apps have given women more freedom to move about on their own. Saudi Arabia follows a strict type of Islam. It forces women to depend on a male relative, like a father or brother, to drive them anywhere. The government does not give women driver's licenses.

## Women Can Travel Safely

Radwan, who is 29, spends nearly $700 a month on rides from Careem.

The cost is a little higher than for a taxi, but she can depend on the apps. They are also safer. Both Uber and Careem can track exactly where their cars are. With a few taps, Hala can see who will be driving her. She can also see what type of car the driver uses and if his customers liked him in the past.

And it looks just like she is in an ordinary car.

At least four ride-booking apps are available in Saudi Arabia and more are planned. The technology is the same as what is used in the United States or Europe. There are, however, some important differences.

The companies in Saudi Arabia don't work with drivers who use their own cars to carry passengers. In the United States and Europe, using the driver's own car lowers the cost. In Saudi Arabia, the companies get their cars and drivers from licensed companies.

## App Companies See Lots Of Traffic

Mudassir Sheikha owns Careem. He says his company is trying to follow rules and offer a better service.

His company is based in the United Arab Emirates city of Dubai. It was one of the first ride services to open in Saudi Arabia. The company started there in summer 2013. It now has close to 100,000 customers, and that number is growing fast, he said.

"There are some (women) that take five to 10 trips with us every day," Sheikha said. "We don't see that kind of traffic anywhere."

Uber is run from San Francisco and works in more than 300 cities in 56 countries around the world. It started driving in Saudi Arabia a year ago. The number of its customers has grown as well.

## Good Drivers Are In Demand

There is no law saying women cannot drive in Saudi Arabia. But there are fatwas that say women should not drive. Fatwas are religious orders from Muslim clerics. They are the reason why the government will not give women a license to drive.

Families who can afford it will hire a driver to take the women in the family to different places. Sometimes, even that does not work.

"I have a driver, but sometimes he is too busy bringing my sisters from school," said Gamar al-Douh, age 24. She comes from a family of three girls. There are no brothers to help with the driving. "If I don't have someone to take me, I use Uber."

Radwan and her husband do not use a driver because they are expensive.

She and her friends used to exchange phone numbers for good drivers.

Now when one of them needs a driver, they tell her, "Why don't you take Uber or Careem?"
