A stunning photo spread all across the Internet over the weekend. It revealed a flood of water, or supertide, that covered over a bridge that connects the French coastline and an 11th-century French abbey that is usually surrounded more by sheep than water.

Photos from news agencies showed thousands of people arriving on the coast of Normandy to watch the spectacular 46-foot-high flood of water. It surrounded Mont Saint-Michel, the tiny island town of 44 people that sits around the abbey, which is a home for monks. People usually can only get to the island town of Mont Saint-Michel by one bridge, which was drowned by the high tide.

## Regular Date With The Supertide

Most articles that accompanied such photos failed to explain why this supertide happened. Some made vague references to the sun, or the moon, or the alignment of the sun and moon, or the eclipse that occurred the same day. An eclipse happens when the sun is blocked from the Earth by the moon. Many also called the March 20-21 event the "tide of the century." But this tide happens every 18 years. It last happened in March 1997. The next one will be in March 2033.

So what caused the supertide? A strong clue is the repeat of "March" in the dates. Tides are driven by the moon's gravitational pull. The sun's gravity has an effect, too, although much smaller. When the sun and moon are aligned with the Earth, their combined pull is greatest, creating what are called spring tides. They occur twice every month, but are often greatest in March and September, during the spring and autumn equinoxes.

This year the moon and sun aligned very exactly, causing Saturday's eclipse. "If we see a solar eclipse there will be a spring tide," said Hal Needham. He is a scientist who studies the weather at Louisiana State University. "But if we see a spring tide it doesn't mean we will see a solar eclipse."

## Enter The Equinox

That explains why the highest tides keep happening in March. But why do they happen every 18 years? This gets trickier. The best explanation comes from Britain's Met Office, its official weather agency. Experts at the Met said that some spring tides are higher than others because tidal forces are stronger when the moon is closest to the Earth in its orbit. Those forces are made even stronger when the sun and the moon are both directly over the equator, the group said. The sun sits above the equator around March 21 or in September, an event known as the equinox. The moon's orbit also takes it above and below the equator over a period of 27 days.

The Met said that very large spring tides occur when all these factors happen at the same time. About every 4.5 years the moon is closest to the Earth, and is over the equator. When the moon and sun line up, and they are directly over the equator, and the moon is closest to Earth, we get the so-called supertide.

## Combining Wind And Water

Needham also said that the weather can have a greater influence on tides than any of these factors. He mentioned Hurricane Sandy in the region around New York City and Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans as examples. One 18-year supertide might be higher than another depending on whether winds are pushing water up against a coastline. Lower-than-normal atmospheric pressure can cause the sea to rise higher.
