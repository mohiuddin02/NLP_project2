KIEV, Ukraine â€” The 3-month-old uprising against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich turned deadly on Tuesday. First, anti-government protesters set fire to the ruling party's headquarters. Then, police stormed the protesters' tent camp in what government officials called "an anti-terror operation."

At least nine people were killed: two police officers, an official of the ruling party, and six protesters. Opposition leader Oleksandra Kuzhel said the death toll had grown to 15 after police stormed the tent camp with stun grenades and water cannons, while other reports put the number of dead as high as 19.

Even the lower death toll would represent the worst one-day loss of life in the battle over the country's future. At issue is one major question: Will Ukraine be a nation tied more closely to Russia or to Western Europe?

Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union, a union of republics led by Russia. In 1991, the Soviet Union broke apart into several countries and Ukraine got its independence. Since then, Ukraine has remained closely linked to Russia.

Recently, however, people within Ukraine have called for a new direction. Some feel the country should develop closer ties with Western Europe, which might lead to more jobs and greater freedoms.

## An Eerie Orange Glow

On Tuesday, fiery explosions lit up the protesters' tent city in Independence Square, located in the capital city of Kiev.

The conflict began after protesters ignored a warning to clear out. Around 8 p.m., police stormed the area. Officers set fire to tents and threw cans of tear gas into the crowds of protesters.

The square was eerily lit by an orange glow, created by the blasts and burning sandbags. Clouds of smoke blew over the chaotic scene, but thousands of people remained in the square.

Unrest also broke out elsewhere in western Ukraine. In a number of areas, protesters attacked government offices.

Ukrainians who want closer ties with the West are demanding that Yanukovich step down. Their anger was sparked by a decision he made last November. Acting on his own, Yanukovich decided to scrap an agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, a group of 28 European countries that trade together. This agreement would have made trade between Ukraine and Western Europe easier. Yanukovich chose instead to keep close ties with Russia.

## Holding Their Ground

Russia, meanwhile, has promised Ukraine $15 billion in aid. The opposition sees this as an attempt to buy Yanukovich's loyalty. They also see it as an effort to steer Ukraine into joining the Eurasian Union. This is a trade group Russia is trying to set up. Russia sees it as an alternative to the European Union.

Opposition leaders said they had requested negotiations with the government to stop the growing violence. They said that the government had agreed to meet with them Wednesday. However, police continued to set fire the tent city well into the night.

Protest leaders remained defiant. Opposition leader Arseny Yatsenyuk appealed to Yanukovich to "spare Ukraine from becoming a country covered with blood." He called on the president to pull back police and stick to a cease-fire.

"This is an island of freedom and we will defend it," vowed Vitali Klitschko, another opposition leader. He urged the protesters to hold their ground against police attacks.

The government also held its ground. It blamed the violence on protesters.

## The Fight Isn't Over

Tuesday's unrest followed an agreement that seemed to signal things were calming down. Over the weekend, the government released the last of 234 protesters it had put in jail. The government also promised to drop criminal charges against them.

But protesters continued to press their demands. They still want Yanukovich to step down. They also insist that parliament limit the president's powers. The president was given greater powers in 2010, when a change was made to the constitution. Protesters demand a return to the constitution as it was before.

On Tuesday afternoon, protesters marched toward the parliament building.

The demonstrators grew angry when Yanukovich's ruling party put off a debate on the changes the opposition wants made to the constitution. Police then tried to block a procession of about 20,000 people who attempted to enter the parliament. Some of the protesters managed to get into the building. Others succeeded in breaking into the headquarters of Yanukovich's ruling party and set it on fire.

The brief peace over the weekend came to an end because neither side was satisfied. Protesters and the government seem to agree on only one thing: The fight over the future of Ukraine isn't over.
