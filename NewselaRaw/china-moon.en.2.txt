BEIJING — China launched a rocket early Monday. It carried a buggy-like vehicle that is expected to roam and explore the moon's surface for three months, as Beijing hopes to make sure that the next man on the moon is Chinese.

The Long March rocket lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province on schedule at 1:30 a.m. Monday, Beijing time, China's official news agency reported.

If all goes as planned, a landing vehicle and the rover will touch down on the moon's surface in about two weeks. It would be the first soft landing on the moon since 1976, when the Soviet Union landed the Luna 24 probe. A soft landing is a landing in which the vehicle does not break up.

The unmanned rover is gold-colored. It looks like a dune buggy. The rover is expected to conduct scientific projects like planting a telescope on the moon's surface and exploring under the surface of the moon. It will send photographs back to Earth.

## Getting The Chinese Excited About Space

The real purpose, aerospace experts believe, is to gain expertise. China would use the knowledge to eventually put a man on the moon, experts say.

"China sees the possibility of leading," said David Whitehouse, a British scientist who has written a book about the moon. "It will upset the Americans because the Americans think they own the moon."

China considers the mission as a opportunity to involve and excite its own people in space exploration. Even the name of the rover, Jade Rabbit, was selected by a public poll. The name refers to the pet rabbit of the Chinese moon goddess, Chang'e. Chang'e is also the name of the landing vehicle. Two previous Chang'e missions orbited the moon in 2007 and 2010.

The rocket launch was broadcast live on Chinese television. But the early-morning timing reduced the number of viewers.

"The timing is dictated more by physics than by propaganda," said Morris Jones, an Australian space analyst. The launch itself was relatively uncomplicated, he said. So as is the task of getting into orbit around the moon — something China has already done twice. But the landing could be more difficult.

"Landing on the moon is far trickier than simply going into orbit. There is no margin for error," he said.

## Moon Could Hold Some Surprises

China's state news service described the mission as the "most complicated and difficult task in China's space exploration."

"More than 80 percent of the technologies adopted in the mission are new," Wu Zhijian, spokesman for the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, said.

Only the United States and the Soviet Union have successfully landed on the moon in the past. The U.S. is the only nation to land people on the moon.

The launch comes as India has a spacecraft on the way to Mars. India is China's Asian economic rival. The Indian orbiter fired engines early Sunday that enabled it to leave Earth's orbit and begin its long journey to the Red Planet.

Moon exploration enthusiasts are eagerly waiting to learn what the Chinese mission will uncover.

There was a burst of moon exploration in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the 1969 landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. But since then, the moon's appeal has waned in favor of planets and asteroids. In 2010, President Obama killed plans for the Constellation program that was supposed to return Americans to the moon by 2020.

"People wanted to explore the planets. We wanted to see more distant worlds," Jones said. "But even though there was so much exploration of the moon in the 1960s and the 1970s, in recent years we have found out things about the moon we never suspected when astronauts went there. We have found areas where there is water ice and regions colder than Pluto. There are still many surprises."
