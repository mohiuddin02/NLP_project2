SEATTLE, Wash. â€” In computer science, students learn how to write software. They learn how to build networks of computers that work together. They do difficult math using computers.

In the past, most computer science students were men. Some schools are trying to change that.

The University of Washington has a plan to get more women into computer science. So far, the plan is working.

There are few women in computer science programs across the United States. Only 1 in 7 computer science graduates is a woman. At the University of Washington, the number is much higher. It is 1 in 3.

## Loves Computer Science

The university won an award for bringing women into computer science. The award comes with a $100,000 prize from Google. Lucy Sanders runs the group that gave the award. The group wants to get more women working in technology jobs.

The university is a "welcoming community" for women, Sanders said. The school has a strong plan to bring women into computer science, she added.

Siena Dumas Ang planned to study dance and math at the university. Then she took a few beginner computer science classes. Soon, she fell in love with it. Dumas Ang will graduate this spring with three areas of study: math, dance and computer science.

Computer science uses all the best parts of math, she said.

## Helping The Students

Beginning computer science classes at the university are challenging. There is a lot of help to get through them though. Working hard is more important than having studied computer science before.

Jasmine Singh knew she wanted to study computer science at the University of Washington. She took computer classes in high school. Still, it was difficult for her at first. There were times when she felt out of place. Sometimes, male students would talk about computer science and she did not understand the words they used.

The university helped Singh. She got a mentor. Her mentor was an older female computer science student. The mentor gave Singh advice on which classes to take. Singh is now in her last year at the university. She is studying both computer science and engineering.
