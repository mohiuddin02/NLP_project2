### PRO: He's handling it reasonably, legally — and humanely

INDIANAPOLIS — Far from today's near-militarized U.S.-Mexico border, rural southwest Indiana recently was ground zero for undocumented children from Mexico and Central America.

From 2004 to 2010, the federal government contracted with a privately owned juvenile detention facility in Vincennes, Indiana, to house immigrant children deemed the most dangerous.

These children arrived at the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village after being identified at the border because of tattoos or suspicion of drug use and other offenses in their home countries. Others had caused trouble or run away from less secure facilities in the United States. A few had U.S. juvenile delinquency records.

As the Immigration Clinic Director of Indiana University's McKinney School of Law, I traveled to Vincennes with volunteer law school students to provide legal assistance to these kids.

Funded in part by the federal government, the Immigration Clinic students and I provided "Know Your Rights" presentations to explain to the children their legal rights and what they could expect in upcoming immigration court proceedings.

Children — like adults — have no legal right to government-funded attorneys in immigration proceedings. As a result, we individually interviewed the children to match strong cases with volunteer attorneys.

We found children fleeing domestic abuse, gang violence and drugs. Some were subject to rape and mistreatment in other U.S. detention facilities.

These children were eligible for asylum and other special visas for abandoned children and victims of crime and human trafficking. Many were reunited with family in the United States based on the Supreme Court guarantee of "least restrictive placement" for children in immigration proceedings. Others went home voluntarily. Some were deported.

At one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes staged a peaceful sit-down to protest detention conditions. The local Knox County SWAT team was called in with riot gear, billy clubs and a police dog. Children were subject to lockdown, solitary confinement and other abuse.

When they confided the facility's misconduct to IU's law school students, we notified the federal government, which took immediate corrective action. Shortly thereafter, the private facility stopped housing immigrant children.

The federal treatment of today's immigrant children mirrors what happened at Vincennes, although on a much larger scale.

As the U.S. demand for drugs and guns continues, the violence in Central America is increasing. Children are amassing along the border. Volunteer attorneys are being recruited to travel to these sites to deliver "Know Your Rights" presentations and individually screen children. Pro bono and privately paid attorneys are assuming the representation of children reunited with families throughout the country.

U.S. immigration and refugee law protects survivors of violence and persecution. Attorneys, law school clinics and other volunteers are now stepping up and coordinating their services with the federal government.

Certainly, it is not a perfect system. But the Obama administration continues to demonstrate a commitment to protecting undocumented children within today's political and legal limits.

Initial exploration of refugee status for children in Honduras is part of that effort. Individuals fearing persecution throughout the world have had the right to seek refugee status at U.S. embassies following the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980.

This humanitarian legislation also gives the resident discretionary authority to address "unforeseen emergency refugee situations." These laws are built upon our historical protection of persons and acceptance of international conventions passed in the wake of World War II.

Not every child is entitled to admission. But turning children away at gunpoint is inconsistent with established law and practice. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their legal rights protected, provided visas when merited, and repatriated safely as necessary.

### CON: He's playing politics with the crisis rather than enforcing U.S. border security

WASHINGTON — Try as he might, President Obama cannot escape responsibility for the debacle at the U.S. southwest border, caused, in part, by his administration's mismanagement.

Until Congress returns next month, he should use the tools he has to secure the border and to discourage illegal crossings. One can only hope that he will not take unilateral actions that might make matters worse.

The president has been trying to walk a fine line between accommodating leaders of his domestic Latino base while at the same time dissuading Central Americans from starting the perilous journey north. Although compassionate rhetoric about immigrants is good politics, it is not good policy.

After all, the current crisis has been stoked by loose talk in Washington about a possible "amnesty" of illegal immigrants, stoked by Obama's 2012 decision to suspend deportation of youth with long-standing ties to the United States, and news that young children arriving at the border were being released pending hearings.

During a visit to Washington last month, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez cited "ambiguities" about U.S. border enforcement that are part of the "pull factor" encouraging people to rush across the U.S. border.

Hernandez also explained the "push factor": narco-violence that sows insecurity and deadly street gangs preying on youth in his country and neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala. Unfortunately, these are poor nations with governments unable or unwilling to deal with these challenges.

Refugee advocates contend that more than half of those arriving in recent months have bona fide claims that require a hearing under U.S. and international law.

That is contradicted by a Border Patrol survey in May that found that nearly all of those interviewed made the trek because of recent rumors of leniency. According to sources in Central America, so-called "coyotes" — criminals who make their living smuggling people — have been advertising lax U.S. border enforcement to drum up business.

Part of the initial problem in responding to the border crisis was the administration's overly broad application of a 2008 anti-human-trafficking law that requires a complicated hearing on an immigrant's asylum pleas.

The current crisis is fueled primarily by smuggling, not trafficking. Border personnel should be allowed to use their experience and discretion to screen for legitimate refugee or trafficking cases.

Of course, bona fide refugees in U.S. territory must be attended to lawfully. However, the UN should work with local governments to offer relief to refugees in their country of origin, rather than wait for them to run the gauntlet to the U.S. border.

One thing that all can agree upon is that no one is better off risking the thousand-mile trek through Mexico, during which many migrants are abused, robbed, raped or killed.

If the perception of lax enforcement lures people to risk life and limb that must change immediately. Republicans made these arguments while crafting a tough measure that would strengthen border enforcement, make it easier to deport new arrivals and send an unambiguous signal that the border is being secured.

Although the president initially talked tough on border enforcement, his political advisers apparently recommended that he toss the "hot potato" to congressional Republicans.

However, securing the border is the responsibility of the president, not the Congress. And, the president does not need new authority to get a handle on this crisis by sending an unambiguous message that illegal crossings will be stopped, most new arrivals will be turned around, and a sweeping unilateral "amnesty" is off the table.

Seeking a domestic political "win" by blaming congressional Republicans for inaction on the border is extraordinarily irresponsible — even dangerous.

Not only does it prolong the current crisis, it undermines the kind of bipartisan consensus that will be required to pay the costs of the current crisis and to eventually overhaul an immigration system that is failing the country.
