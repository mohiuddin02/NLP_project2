Cutting down trees in the Amazon gets a huge amount of attention. Scientists worry about that, but they also worry about something just as important. The freshwater ecosystems in the Amazon basin need protection, too.

The Amazon is in South America and it is the world's largest rain forest still standing. Trees grow close together. It is very warm with plenty of rain. It is home to many different plants and animals. The Amazon is shared by Brazil, Peru, Colombia and six other countries. The whole area covers almost half of South America, which is one of the world's seven continents.

Freshwater ecosystems are bodies of water where plants and animals live together and depend on each other. Scientists say the water systems are very important to the health of the Amazon basin. The basin is the largest network of rivers, streams and lakes in the world. It drains water into the 4,000-mile-long Amazon River. 

## Water Systems At Risk

Several things are causing trouble for the plants and animals that live in the Amazon. Scientists wrote in a magazine wrote that figuring out how to protect the Amazon's water systems is very important. They say the Amazon's people, plants and animals all need protection.

Leandro Castello works at a college in Virginia. He helped write the magazine article. Castello has helped care for fish in the Amazon. He says he was disappointed by how the rain forest's trees get much more attention than its water systems.

The freshwater ecosystems do many important things for the Amazon's people, plants and animals. The ecosystems move water through the rain forest and keep its soil healthy. They are also home to many plants and animals, including thousands of kinds of fish. In addition, people who live in the Amazon depend on the systems for food and water. Even though the water systems are so important, they are in trouble.  

## Danger From Dams And Mines

One cause of the troubles is a change in how the water moves around. Castello says the change is terrible for a freshwater ecosystem.

Dams change the way water moves. They stop natural water flow and block it up in pools. Fish and other animals cannot get through and move downstream. Dams are also a problem for people who make their living by fishing or who eat mostly fish.

There are many dams in the Amazon basin already. More are planned. Scientists say that if all the new dams are built, only three rivers will not be touched.

Mining can also change water systems. Gold miners take away sand and mud from the bottom of rivers and streams. Mining can change the water and even poison it.

## The High Cost Of Cutting Down Trees

In addition to dams and mining, cutting down trees is one of the biggest problems for freshwater ecosystems. Castello says trees have an important job. They take water from the soil and send it out through their leaves. When there are fewer trees, water runs back into the rivers, bringing soil with it.

Clearing rain forests can also cause it to rain less and make droughts worse. Plants and trees are also important for land. Without them, soil can wash into the water and change the shape of rivers and streams.

## Burning Up The Amazon

As the earth's climate changes, it may add another problem. Fossil fuels are natural fuels like oil, gas and coal. When people burn fossil fuels for energy, it creates greenhouse gases. The gases get trapped in the earth's atmosphere. As temperatures rise in the Amazon basin, droughts and severe storms may happen more often. Water levels in rivers may drop. Some streams might disappear.

Castello says lawmakers need to come up with a plan for both land and freshwater ecosystems. He also says that satellites could help countries watch freshwater ecosystems. Satellites already help countries see when trees are being cut that should not be touched.

Claudio Maretti is a scientist from Brazil. He says that countries need to work together to protect the Amazon's people, plants and animals.
