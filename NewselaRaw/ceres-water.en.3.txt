LOS ANGELES — It's hard to say just what Ceres is. It can be thought of as the largest known asteroid, or as the smallest dwarf planet. For a time in the 1800s, it was considered a full-fledged planet.

Whatever it is, Ceres is looking more interesting these days. Astronomers, who study space and planets, have discovered water vapor — like steam — shooting off the mysterious little planetoid. That discovery could tell us something fascinating about the history of our solar system.

Astronomer Michael Kippers led the study. For the first time, he said, we have "discovered water in the asteroid belt."

Ceres sits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. That belt may have millions of asteroids in it, but Ceres is the biggest one and the first one to be discovered. It is 590 miles wide and is round like a planet. Its shape is part of why it was once considered planet-like. It was big enough for its own gravity to crush it into a round shape.

But Ceres soon lost its title of planet when astronomers realized that there were other asteroids nearby. But, while other asteroids may be rocky like Ceres, they aren't round. Typically, asteroids are lumpy.

## Blasts Of Water Vapor

NASA's Dawn mission visits Ceres next year. But Kuppers had been looking to do a little advance scouting before then.

The biggest question hovering around the dwarf planet: Is it filled with water, or not?

Because Ceres isn't very dense, astronomers think that it could have a large amount of water. If it did, it would likely be stored away as ice. Astronomers in the 1990s picked up signs of water in the light coming from Ceres. However, a study in 2011 could not back that claim up.

To settle the matter, Kuppers and his team turned to telescopes at the Herschel Space Observatory. They spotted clear signs of water coming from two separate dark spots. These were located on roughly opposite sides of the little world.

Water was coming off Ceres at a quick pace. That made the scientists think there could be a lot of stored ice. So much, in fact, that once melted, it could add up to more fresh water than we have on Earth.

The scientists aren't exactly sure how the ice is stored on Ceres. And they don't know how it's escaping as vapor.

It could be that heat from inside the planet is the cause. This could be making the water rise up and explode up into blasts of water vapor. It could also simply be that ice on the surface is melting when the sun hits it. In any case, water on Ceres wouldn't ever be in liquid form. Liquid water requires a thicker atmosphere (like Earth's) to remain stable.

## Puzzling Questions Abound

Whatever is going on, the larger question remains: Why is Ceres so wet? And another puzzling question is why Ceres is so different from the asteroid named Vesta.

After all, Ceres is roughly the same distance from the sun as the lumpy asteroid Vesta. Yet Vesta is volcanic and completely dry. So how did Ceres hold onto this water when Vesta did not?

It turns out Ceres may not be originally from this part of the solar system. It probably came from somewhere out past the "snow line." Beyond this imaginary line in the solar system, ice can exist in space. There, it won't be melted by the sun's rays.

Ceres may have been moved around during a big migration in the solar system's history. The huge planet Jupiter, for example, is thought to have traveled long distances: first toward the sun, and then away from it. Its strong gravity yanked planets and asteroids around the solar system.

The discovery of ice on Ceres also supports the idea that asteroids aren't as dry as expected, Kuppers said. Comets are icy and are the usual suspects for having brought water to Earth. But, he said, it could just as well have been an asteroid. Asteroids are basically comets that don't have ice. But now one has been found with ice on it.

Answering more questions about Ceres will have to wait. The Herschel telescope, which is still in space, stopped working last year. But scientists won't have to wait too long: NASA's Dawn spacecraft will reach Ceres in spring 2015. It will give scientists a close look at this strange, distant world.

"I'm excited to see what Dawn is going to find out," said Kuppers.
