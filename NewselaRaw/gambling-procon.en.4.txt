###PRO: A ban won't work

LAS VEGAS — Preventing people from gambling won't work. In the 1920s, the sale of alcohol was banned by the government. It was called Prohibition. Many businesses were forced to go under because of it. And it led to severe side effects.

The effects included bad, criminal behavior. People illegally made and sold booze. The government spent years trying to stop it. It cost a lot of public money. In the end, the government canceled Prohibition.

Let's not make the same mistake twice. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is part of American history. Since our nation's founding, it's existed in some form or another.

We just need to protect against the problems gambling can bring. Let's take the rules that work at casinos and use them for online gaming.

## Online Gambling Is Here

It would be silly to think blocking gambling would stop Americans from getting into online gaming. It would happen anyway. All it would do is cost police money to deal with it. And millions of average American citizens would be turned into criminals.

The black market exists already. Today's gambling websites are unregulated. There are no rules and they don't have to pay taxes. It is illegal. But, most online casinos are in other countries, so they get away with it.

Unregulated online gaming is exploding: an estimated 1 million Americans are involved. In total, they spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming websites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to get into the newest form of gaming — online.

The U.S. shouldn't demonize or ignore it. Moreover, the money from this new form of gaming technology could pay for services Americans need. The money can be put toward covering the costs of education, for instance. And it could pay for dealing with the problems that sometimes come from gambling.

Modern technologies used in online gaming are there to protect Americans. They can prevent young people and problem gamblers from betting. And these safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow for online gaming within its state borders. These technologies, while not perfect, will continue to improve.

States and casino operators may not even want that much online gambling. Many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.

It's no secret that many state and city governments desperately need money. Online gaming holds the potential to help cities and states get the money they need.

## Look At Lotteries

State lotteries are a perfect example of using entertainment to raise money for good purposes. Large numbers of states now offer online lotteries. They would also be endangered by government prohibition.

The slippery slope of a possible ban doesn't stop at the state level. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was recently warned that popular sports fantasy leagues could be banned by this legislation as well.

Fantasy sports teams are created by choosing your favorite players from a sport like baseball and creating a made-up "team." Fantasy football is very popular. When the people who make the fantasy teams bet money that their players will score the most points, it is considered gambling.

It wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming were prohibited by the government too. Facebook and other social media feature games that might be regulated.

Americans are well known for their ability to start businesses from scratch. Innovators like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents.

Let's not let the government hold back new technology. Other countries around the world are already doing it. We need to keep up.

Pretending that progress, new ideas and the Internet don't or shouldn't exist is pointless. America should look back at our past mistakes. And we should look at how we've been inspired in the past. They will show us how to handle the challenges and opportunities that come from Internet gaming today.

### CON: Gambling hurts too many people

WASHINGTON — Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos are now allowed to operate online gambling websites. It's good news for them. Casinos in those cities don't make money like they used to. For seven straight years they've made less and less. The University of Nevada studied what would happen if this continues and found that casinos would have to double their online gambling to make up for lost money at their casinos.

It's no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey want to increase online gambling. Both states rely on the money gambling brings in. It pays for the services the states provide, such as education.

Online gambling became possible in 2011. An old law used to not allow it. But, then the government decided that only Internet betting on sports had to be blocked.

Be careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.

## Too Easy To Gamble Too Much

Congress set up a group to study the effects of gambling. In 1999, the group recommended there be no new casinos. It also told the government to block Internet gambling entirely. It said more studies were needed on the harms and benefits of online gambling. But this has not happened yet.

Meanwhile, supporters of online gambling are asking the government for more. They want permission to spread online gambling nationwide.

Online gambling will make it easier to gamble anytime. An increase in gambling leads to more problem gambling. Some people can't control their gambling and get into trouble. The problems with gambling have been well documented. Too much gambling leads to people running out of money, destroyed marriages, and jail.

Promoters of online gambling say there aren't many problem gamblers. They say they make up only a small number of overall players. But, the numbers don't show how problem gamblers affect others. Studies show that a problem gambler affects five to 10 other people.

Problem gamblers may be able to quit gambling. Even then, the damage may not be fixed. Gamblers can lose enormous amounts of money. Their problem can destroy relationships. Marriages can be torn apart. Couples may separate or divorce because of gambling.

The cost to society from gambling is huge. It's so big it can't be known. Gambling leads to an increase in crime and money problems. Lost jobs and broken families damage our society. Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols calculates that the cost of gambling probably outweighs its benefits by 3-to-1.

## End Internet Gambling

Internet gambling is particularly worrisome. Problem gambling is more common online than in casinos. In fact, it's three to four times more likely.

Online gambling is more dangerous than other forms of gambling. People can play all of the time and games go quickly. People play games alone — and play several games at once. People can lose more money than they have.

Online gambling companies claim they can stop young people from gambling online. They say they can screen people by age.

However, the FBI has countered this claim. In 2009 it wrote a letter to Congress. The letter stated that online gambling sites "are more than likely relying on credit card information" to gather this information. That information could be faked.

Legalizing online gambling may seem like the answer to a state's money problems. Evidence, however, suggests the opposite. Gambling hurts the poor more than the rich. And it takes money away from local businesses.

States can't be allowed to set their own online gambling rules. Congress needs to aid families and communities. It should end Internet gambling.
