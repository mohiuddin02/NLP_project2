FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — It is getting hard to find enough people to referee sports. One reason is that some referees have been attacked at games. Referees have even died.

Jimmy Woods has been a youth official, or referee, for nearly 30 years. He's lost count of how many football games he has refereed. He has been yelled at, threatened and called names many times.

He has been surrounded by angry parents following games. He has been cursed at as recently as this season by players and fans.

People do not respect officials anymore, said Woods. He is a 50-year-old firefighter who referees games as a second job. "They think you're out to get them or cheat them."

## Some Are Victims Of Violence

Violence against referees has been around as long as sports has. However, the headlines have appeared uncomfortably close for Woods and his fellow officials lately.

Referees in Utah and Michigan died after being punched by angry players during games. In September, two Texas football players smacked into a referee on purpose. People from all over were angry at the players.

This violence has made it harder to find referees. Many state sports groups are trying different things to find new referees.

One of those states is Kansas. The number of officials in Kansas has dropped since the 2012-13 school year.

There are many effects from not having enough referees, said Gary Musselman, who runs the Kansas State High School Activities Association. Games might be delayed or moved. Sometimes they are canceled altogether. There might also be fewer referees in sports such as soccer and basketball. Where are there are usually three referees watching the game, sometimes it is cut down to two.

## Younger People May Not Want The Job

Younger people may be less likely to want to become referees, Musselman said. They may not be ready to have people get angry at them for their decisions in a game, he said.

Two years ago, the association started making it easier for people to become a referee. They also offered money to find ways to get and train more officials. Coaches were asked to point out possible future referees among their players, too. It led 22 recent high school graduates to register as referees.

An athletic association in Wisconsin lets current and former members of the U.S. military skip paying the cost of signing up as a referee for one year.

Barry Mano started the National Association of Sports Officials (NASO) in 1980. He also spent 23 years as a college basketball referee. The group sent out a survey in 2002. The survey found that 9 out of 10 of people who run high school sports believed they did not have enough referees. He also said fans have become more angry at officials.

## "They Worry About Their Safety"

Most people stop being referees because of bad behavior, said Mano. He noted that his members get paid $50 to $60 per game at the high school level. "They worry about their safety," he said.

Don Boss is 64 years old. He was a referee for many different sports over his 47 years in the business. He has been a referee for high school and adult soccer leagues in Arkansas for more than 20 years. He also assigns referees to games.

"The problem isn't finding refs," Boss said. "The problem is finding good refs."

Like many officials, Woods started as a football referee to remain connected to the game he once played.

He continues to referee even though he has a serious illness. Woods plans to keep being a referee. He says without referees, kids would not be able to play sports.
