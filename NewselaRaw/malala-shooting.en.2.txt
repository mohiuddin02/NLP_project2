ISLAMABAD, Pakistan â€” Teen activist Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head in 2012 for speaking out on educating girls in Pakistan. Since the attack, Malala has become famous around the world. On Friday, Pakistan's army said that it had arrested 10 fighters suspected of being involved in the attack.

Pakistani army spokesman General Asim Saleem Bajwa said the captured fighters attacked Malala, who was 15 years old at the time. The men were acting on orders from Mullah Fazlullah, the head of the Pakistani Taliban, a terror organization.

Now, the Pakistani army is fighting the extremist group in North Waziristan, a region in Pakistan that borders Afghanistan. Extremist fighters have lived in North Waziristan for many years.

"The entire gang involved in the murder attempt ... has been busted," Bajwa said. He added that the "terrorists" were part of Tehrik-e-Taliban. It is a group that includes violent terror organizations across the area.

## "This Is Good News"

Malala is a teenage activist who seems older than she is. She had called for expanding girls' education in deeply religious and traditional areas of Pakistan. Her views upset Pakistanis who believe women should remain in the home. Many of the Islamic extremists in Pakistan view education for girls as an evil imported to Pakistan from Europe and the United States.

Because of her views, she was shot in the head in October 2012, while returning from school. Two other girls were also wounded in the attack.

Malala went to a hospital in Pakistan. Later she was flown to a hospital in Britain, where she now lives with her family.

"This is good news for our family and most importantly, for the people of Pakistan and the civilized world," said Malala's father, Ziauddin Yousafzai. He said capturing Malala's attackers is important. It gives hope to "the hundreds of thousands of people whose lives have been affected by terrorism."

## Still More Fighters Out There

Malala is from the northwestern Swat Valley area of Pakistan. The region was once home to Fazlullah, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban. Fazlullah became the Taliban leader after its former leader was killed by the United States in North Waziristan.

Fazlullah has been on the run since 2009. At the time, Pakistan started attacking the Swat Valley to kill the fighters. The fighters were trying to overthrow the government and force everyone to obey strict Islamic law.

Pakistan believes Fazlullah is hiding in Afghanistan, and Bajwa said Pakistan's government had raised the issue with the Afghan government. Both Pakistan and Afghanistan have accused each other of ignoring fighters who launch cross-border attacks from their territory.

"We will continue our efforts until (Fazlullah) is arrested or killed," Bajwa told a news conference.

He said the 10 men were captured because of information the Pakistani military got from one of the members of the group.

"The group acted upon the instructions of Mullah Fazlullah who, while based in Kunar, Afghanistan, passed instructions through his two associates," he said. He added that it was a "known fact" that Fazlullah and other "terrorists" are hiding in Afghanistan.

The arrests come at a time when Pakistan's military is carrying out a major attack against Taliban fighters in North Waziristan. Pakistan launched the June 15 operation after the fighters attacked one of the country's busiest airports, in the southern city of Karachi, shocking the nation.

The military says it has so far killed at least 975 fighters.
