LOS ANGELES â€” It is lunchtime at a Los Angeles high school. Parrish Jackson is dumping her food in the trash can.

The apricots are "sour," says the 16-year-old student. The turkey burger is "nasty." If it were up to her, she would just eat the potato wedges. Then she would buy Cheetos and juice at the school store.

Los Angeles Unified is the second largest school district in the country. Every day, students throw out at least $100,000 worth of food. And it's probably more, said David Binkle. He is in charge of meals. If you add everything up, schools waste $18 million on food each year.

"What can we do about this?" Binkle says. He answers: "We can stop forcing children to take food they don't like and throw in the garbage."

## Won't Eat Their Veggies

Many health experts don't agree with him. They say kids need to be given fruits and vegetables again and again. Then, they will start eating them.

In 2010, the lawmakers passed a [school meals law](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch). It is called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. First lady Michelle Obama supports it. The law says that students must take at least three foods at lunch. One of the foods must be a fruit or vegetable. Otherwise, the government won't pay for the meals. It doesn't matter, though, if students throw the meals out.

The wasted food costs about $1 billion each year.

The School Nutrition Association is trying to change the lunch law. It is a group that wants laws to [make children eat healthier.](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity)

"We're not opposed to healthy changes," said Julia Bauscher. She is a leader in the group. She says students shouldn't have to take foods they won't eat.

## Planting School Gardens

Juliana Cohen is with Harvard University in Boston. She said the rules have helped children eat healthier. That's particularly important for poor students. They rely more on school meals.

Cohen says the answer isn't to end the rules. The answer is to find ways to get children to eat their veggies. Make meals taste better and plant school gardens. Having recess before lunch also helps.

At the Los Angeles school, some students eat their whole lunch.

"Since we're football players, we eat all of it, bad or good," said Daniel Ofa.

A'lea Rendey is another student. She pulled a hair from her turkey burger. She and her friends said it was gross. Then she threw out her lunch and went to buy a Pop-Tart. "If the food was good food, we'd have no problems," she said.
