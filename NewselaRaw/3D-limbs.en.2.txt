BALTIMORE, Md. — Last year, a parent asked Dr. Albert Chi about easy and inexpensive artificial hands for children. He was stumped.

Chi looked into the latest artificial limbs, which can cost up to $40,000. Then he began searching for cheaper options.

Like many researchers, businesspeople and even artists recently, he turned to the 3-D printer. With a printer his wife bought him for Father's Day, and free designs and advice found online, he made a hand for about $20. A 3-D printer melts plastic sheets to make three-dimensional objects.

"One of the first kids we fitted was a 2-year-old," Chi said. "We thought the child was too young, but we weren't even able to finish strapping it on, and the kid was picking an object up."

## Real Helping Hands

The need for artificial limbs has created a network of volunteer designers, medical workers, artists, engineers, parents and fans of 3-D printing. They fit children with prosthetics, or artificial limbs, to replace those that were lost in an accident or the children weren't born with. The network is hoping to give hands, free of charge, to any interested child.

An organization called e-NABLE has matched kids with printers. More than 400 kids were provided with 3-D-printed hands over the past year. With designs that are free on e-NABLE's website, families may be printing their own. The 3-D printed versions are particularly useful for children, who often grow out of their artificial hands. Their families may not be able to afford replacements every few months or years. The 3-D versions also can be lighter and easier to use — and comes in their favorite colors.

## High-Fives All Around

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 4 in 10,000 children are born missing at least part of a hand, which equals about 1,500 a year. That number does not include those who have lost hands in accidents.

Griffin Matuszek, 5, was born without part of his left hand. He found his prosthetic hand mostly useless and a bit scary, said his mother, Quinn Cassidy.

Griffin, who now has a 3-D printed hand, was drawn to it because he could put it on himself and it was easy to use. His old one was tight and covered the lower part of his arm.

"He put it on and immediately gave Dr. Chi a high-five and then gave everyone in the room a high-five," Cassidy said. "He was able to pick up a small ball and throw it with his left hand right away."

Cassidy said the hand made Griffin happy and more confident. It also was not expensive. Griffin's mother was so grateful that she promised to pay for a 3-D printed hand for another child every time Griffin got a new one.

## Each Hand Takes Many Hours

To make an artificial hand, plastic sheets are fed into the 3-D printer and melted. The plastic comes out in layers that eventually look like Legos. The pieces are fitted together with plastic bolts that are also printed.

Hand parts take up to 10 hours to print. Assembling them takes another couple of hours. Kids are able to make the hands grasp objects by flexing their palms or wrists.

Brian Giavedoni is a prosthetist in Atlanta, Georgia. He fits children with artificial limbs. Giavedoni said he sees a demand for 3-D printed hands.

Younger children do not always see a need for a prosthetic, he said. They find them awkward since they have found ways to get along without a limb or hand, he said. Some don't feel both hands are necessary until they are teens.

Getting younger kids to wear them helps them exercise their muscles, he said. It also prepares them for more advanced equipment in the future, he said.

## "It's A Powerful Experience"

Printers have been used for other types of artificial body parts. Hands were more difficult to create, designers say.

Two men, a carpenter from South Africa and the other from Washington state, created the first 3-D printed hand design. In 2011, the South African, Richard Van As, accidentally lost some fingers. He couldn't afford artificial fingers, so he put together a replacement, but needed help making it more usable.

He looked online and found a giant puppet that used metal cables. He began working with its maker, Ivan Owen, to create a usable hand.

Then, a mother asked for an artificial hand for her 5-year-old son, so they made him one too. They eventually replaced the hands with better 3-D printed versions they called Robohands.

They posted the designs online for anyone to use.

"The goal is to make these devices as accessible and useful as possible," Owen said. "It's a powerful experience watching someone use a new hand."
