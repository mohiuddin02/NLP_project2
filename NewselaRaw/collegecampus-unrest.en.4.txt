The University of Missouri is dealing with some serious challenges. On Nov. 10, the president and chancellor of the school quit. Students and colleges across the country are noticing.

Since November, there have been protests at more than 100 colleges and universities across the country. Some students are unhappy. Minorities do not like how they are being treated. Many students are using tools like Facebook to tell people how they feel. 

Today's protests are inspired by the past. In 2014, a young black man was shot and killed in Ferguson, Missouri. People in that city began to protest. That started a movement in the country. People are not afraid to fight for what they believe in. 

## Students Want Equal Rights

The students are calling for change at their schools. They want people from all races and backgrounds to have the same rights as everyone else. To make their point, the protesters are doing different things. Some are refusing to eat. Others are camping out in offices. Many are writing lists of things they want changed.

Their actions are being noticed. 

Across the country, colleges are dealing with the protests. Some school leaders have been forced to leave. Last week, an administrator from a school in California stepped down. People were unhappy with how she spoke to a Latino student. 

Some schools are meeting students' demands. Another college in California is thinking about changing what they teach. They might start offering more classes about black history. 

## News Can Spread Faster Now

For years, university students have been fighting for equal rights. Protests are nothing new. The president of the University of California system said that colleges play an important part in changing how people act. Many problems are talked about at college. Many voices are also heard there. 

Today, social media plays a big part. A protest can spread fast with Instagram and Twitter. It was not like that 20 years ago.

News spreads fast now. What happened in Missouri was felt across the country. Students from other schools are wondering if the same thing could happen at their school. 

The protests have a few different goals. Many students are fighting for equal chances to succeed. They are tired of minorities being treated differently than white people.  

"As a black person, I think black people are just fed up. It's time out for ignoring these issues," said Shaun R. Harper. He teaches at the University of Pennsylvania.
