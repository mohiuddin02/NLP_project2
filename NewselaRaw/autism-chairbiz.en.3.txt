KANSAS CITY, Mo. - A year and a half ago, a group of high school science students in Missouri helped make a chair called the Sensory Lounger. Since then, the chair has received a lot of attention.

The chair is meant to calm children with autism.

Autism is an illness that makes it hard for people to connect with others because they have trouble understanding other people's feelings. Many children with autism struggle with behaviors like hurting themselves or having meltdowns. Certain kinds of touch like a tight hug help them to calm down.

The Sensory Lounger helps provide the kind of touch that is needed by children with autism. The inflatable chair imitates a tight hug.

Now the man who created the Sensory Lounger has even bigger plans.

Stuart Jackson is the man leading the project. He has worked with the students in the Center for Advanced Professional Studies (CAPS) program to form a business. The Sensory Chair Company will make chairs to sell.

He hopes to make enough chairs to begin testing them. There are also plans to hire several people with autism to help.

Jackson announced the launch of the company to a large group of therapists at a meeting in Nashville, Tennessee. The feedback was very good. Many therapists knew of patients or students who would benefit from the Sensory Lounger.

For Jackson, the project is very important because his son, Joshua, has autism.

## The Power Of Results

Austin Edmondson is a student who worked on the project. Next year he plans to study engineering when he goes to college.

"It's one thing to build something and just kind of get it out there," Edmondson says. "It's another thing to build something and see the results."

Now it's simply a matter of doing the work necessary to take the next step.

This summer, the graduating CAPS students will be hired to build enough chairs for a trial run. Other students will continue working on an updated chair.

Jackson is talking with a university about setting up a study to make sure the chair is safe and helpful for kids with autism. He is also figuring out how the business will be run.

## Jobs For People With Autism

At its heart, though, Jackson sees the project as a way to help people. Because of that, he plans to hire some people with autism to be a part of the company. He says the company will have three or four part-time jobs for people with autism this summer.

If the study goes well, Jackson will be closer to his goal. He has a big dream. He wants to get the Sensory Lounger inside as many therapy centers, classrooms and homes as possible. He would like for the chair to be ready for sale by the end of the year.

## The Chair's Magic Touch

On a Saturday morning last month, the first Just Be You Walk for Autism was happening in Kansas City. There were a lot of children with autism there. Many of the kids wanted to try the Sensory Lounger.

One by one, the children got comfortable in the chair while their parents watched. The kids sat calmly and quietly as the Sensory Lounger worked its magic.

Six-year-old Max tried the chair. His mom, Alison Anderson, was amazed at how comfy he looked.

"He's so chill," she said.

Jackson was watching all of the kids trying the chair. For him, the way the kids reacted was an example of the power of the Sensory Lounger.

A plan is in place and a team of students is hard at work on the project. The future appears promising.

Jackson says the Sensory Lounger could be a solution for families across the world.
