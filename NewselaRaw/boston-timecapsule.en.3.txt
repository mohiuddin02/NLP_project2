Workers found a more than 200-year-old time capsule in the Massachusetts State House.

The objects inside the capsule may be as old as the nation. Some of them may even be older.

The capsule had been placed in a stone from one of the corners of the "New" Massachusetts State House in 1795. Patriots Samuel Adams and Paul Revere took part in the original ceremony.

Experts think the capsule includes coins from 1652 to 1855. The original container made of leather was replaced in 1855 by a metal box. The capsule may contain a silver plate, newspapers, cards and a page from the Massachusetts Colony Records. Massachusetts was one of the original 13 colonies.

"It's exciting," Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin said. "The history of Massachusetts is the history of America, in many respects."

## Careful Digging

The box measures 5-by-7 inches. Officials recently decided to remove it while trying to fix a water leak.

As workers dug the box out, several dimes from 1854 fell out. Officials hope to X-ray it over the weekend. They probably will open it next week.

Oddly enough, this is the second time capsule found in Boston this year.

Less than half a mile away from the "New" State House stands the Old State House. A time capsule was found there three months ago. The Old State House was built in 1713 when England ruled Massachusetts. It is the oldest public building in Boston. Its walls have witnessed important moments of early American history.

On July 18, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read on its balcony.

## The Lion Holds Other Secrets

On the building, there are lion and unicorn statues. They were symbols of British rule.

The time capsule was hidden in the lion statue. It had been forgotten until 2011. That year, a descendant of the artist who created it spoke about its existence.

The lion and unicorn statues were removed on Sept. 14. Officials discovered a copper capsule in the head of the lion. The box was about the size of a shoebox.

It contained more treasures. Officials found a wooden piece of the original lion statue and photographs of officials and workers from 1901. They also found an envelope. It was addressed to people of the future "from the daily newspapers at City Hall." When they opened the envelope, it was empty.

"There was nothing in the envelope," said Heather Leet. She is with the Bostonian Society. The group helps fix up the Old State House. Leet said she thinks the empty envelope was a joke from the newspaper reporters of the time.

## 21st Century Objects Added In

This fall, the Bostonian Society created a new time capsule. Objects included a 2013 Boston Marathon medal, an Apple iPhone 5 and Red Sox baseball tickets. There was also a piece of a 1713 brick from the building.

The capsule was then placed back into the head of the lion statue. The statue was returned to the top of the Old State House on Nov. 23. It will wait there for the next person to open it in the future.
