CHICAGO — Millions of people watched on television last Sunday as Nik Wallenda set a world record in Chicago. He walked across a wire strung between Marina City's west tower and the Leo Burnett Building, about 50 stories above the ground. Not only that, the wire sloped upward at a 19-degree angle.

According to the Guinness World Records book, this made Wallenda's balancing act the highest incline tightrope walk ever.

A class of 10th- and 11th-grade math students at Hinsdale South High School in Darien, Illinois, then took a closer look. The numbers didn't seem to add up.

## Answer Begs For More Questions

The mystery began Monday when math teacher Linda Korbus gave the class a fun assignment. They were told to figure out how Wallenda's team of experts had calculated the incline of the tightrope.

The students used information supplied by the Discovery Channel, which sponsored Wallenda's walk. They pulled out their protractors, compasses and rulers and got to work estimating how steep Wallenda's wire was.

If Marina City was 588 feet, the Leo Burnett Building was 671 feet, and Wallenda walked a total of 454 feet, what was the incline?

Their answer was 10.5 degrees, not 19 degrees.

"I was expecting the grand reveal of 19 degrees, since professional engineers had worked on this," Korbus said. "When it came out lower, I couldn't believe it,"

Korbus immediately pulled out her own pencil to do the math. She got the same answer as her students. "Using the numbers they gave us, it just couldn't be true," she added, referring to the official estimate.

## Tightrope Curves And Dips

The students and the teacher were puzzled. Perhaps Wallenda had landed on an elevated platform on top of the roof, the students guessed. Or maybe the information reported by Discovery Channel about the heights of the buildings was incorrect.

As it turned out, the explanation was slightly more complicated. There was one thing that Korbus' math class did not consider: tightropes are not straight.

Thanks to gravity, tightrope wires dip in the middle. This means that the steepness of the wire varied as Wallenda made his way across. It became steeper on the second half of his walk.

Another factor was that, along with gravity, stabilizer wires pull down on the middle of a tightrope. On Wallenda's, there were 18 pairs of stabilizer wires running from the tightrope to the ground. These kept the tightrope from swinging as he made his way across. They also pulled down the center of the rope, adding to its curve.

"We don't have it simply suspended between two points," explained Mike Troffer. Troffer is Wallenda's uncle and chief engineer. "The stabilizers pull down on the rope, and the bend becomes steeper," he said.

## Making Careful Adjustments

Troffer and Wallenda faced some restrictions in designing the tightrope. On Marina City, the wire was tied to existing steel bolts that used to anchor TV towers. On the Leo Burnett Building, the wire was tied to a steel beam.

Troffer said he figured out how tight he could make the wire without breaking the anchors. When Wallenda inspected the tightrope hours before his walk, he wanted it to be tighter.

They tightened the stabilizing wires. This pulled the center of the wire downward and increased the steepness of the second half of the walk. What originally would be a 16-degree incline became a 19-degree incline, Troffer said.

"Nik got out there to check and he was not pleased with how tight some of the stabilizers were," Troffer said.

## One More Wire Tweak

This last-minute adjustment made the wire more curved, making the task of calculating its steepness even more tricky. The estimate that Korbus' students arrived at – 10.5 degrees – was based on the assumption that the wire was a straight line.

A representative from Guinness World Records was on the roof as Wallenda took the walk, but no one from the record-keeping group could be reached to comment on the incline. In addition to setting a world record for the highest incline tightrope walk, Wallenda also set a world record for the highest blindfolded tightrope walk.
