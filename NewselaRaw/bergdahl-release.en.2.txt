In June 2009, U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was captured in Afghanistan and held captive by the Taliban. For nearly five years, he was hailed as a hero.

But in the days since Bergdahl's high-profile release Saturday, an alternate narrative has emerged. In this version, the 28-year-old soldier from Idaho is not a hero but a deserter.

Early reports of his capture suggested that Bergdahl was taken prisoner while he was out on patrol. But several soldiers who were stationed with Bergdahl in eastern Afghanistan say he voluntarily left his unit. They are demanding that Bergdahl be punished for what they say was his decision to abandon his post. He risked the lives of soldiers who had to go looking for him, they say.

"He walked away from his duty as an American soldier — he deserted," said Joshua Cornelison, the platoon medic. "People are calling him a hero, and that is absolutely wrong."

Another platoon member, Evan Buetow, 27, said Bergdahl had spoken to fellow soldiers about "walking across the mountains on his own" or walking to India. They thought he was joking, Buetow said, "but then he ends up missing, and a light goes off."

## Answers Will Come In Time

Army officials have said they will be able to determine what happened during their talks with Bergdahl.

"Our first priority is assuring his well-being and his health and getting him reunited with his family. Other circumstances that may develop and questions, those will be dealt with later," said U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Questions of how and why Bergdahl disappeared from the outpost have shadowed him during his five years with the Taliban. He was freed after U.S. authorities negotiated a prisoner swap and agreed to release five Taliban commanders being held at the military jail at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The Taliban is an Islamic fundamentalist movement in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) that once controlled Afghanistan. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Taliban was overthrown by U.S.-led forces and has been fighting against them ever since.

Members of his unit had obeyed orders not to discuss him. But now that Bergdahl is free, they have decided to tell what they know, Cornelison said.

## Puzzle Pieces Don't All Fit

The 30 soldiers of 2nd Platoon, Blackfoot Company regarded Bergdahl as an outsider. He was quiet, reserved and unwilling to share the types of personal details other soldiers eagerly volunteered.

Bergdahl slept in a one-man tent at the observation post, a tiny patch of scrub in Paktika province, near the Pakistan border in eastern Afghanistan. He carried a notebook everywhere.

The sergeant disappeared before dawn on June 30, 2009. At the time, some of his platoon mates said they quickly suspected that he hadn't been taken by force by the Taliban.

Bergdahl was "upset at the way the Army was handling the war effort in Afghanistan," said Buetow.

Gerald Sutton, a former fellow platoon member, said Bergdahl was frustrated with the Army. He had casually wondered aloud what it would be like "to be left out on his own."

Like several other former platoon members, Sutton is calling for the Army to hold him legally accountable.

"He's a deserter — 100 percent — in every definition of the word," Buetow said. "We want him to answer for that."

On the night Bergdahl, then 23, disappeared, he returned from a guard shift at the outpost, Cornelison said. Cornelison was awakened by his platoon leader, who asked him, "Doc, you seen Bergdahl?"

A search of Bergdahl's tent turned up his rifle, helmet, armored vest, night-vision goggles and other gear. Missing was Bergdahl's notebook and possibly his compass.

When the platoon mounted a search of the area that morning, Cornelison said, a village boy said he had seen an American soldier crawling through the weeds nearby.

## What Price Was Paid For His Freedom?

On Saturday at Bagram air base in Afghanistan, when Hagel triumphantly announced, "This is a happy day. We got one of our own back," his words were greeted with near silence by U.S. troops.

Bergdahl could face a court-martial, a trial in military court, said Eugene Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School.

The accusations of desertion have come on the heels of a heated political controversy over the decision to trade the five Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl. Critics accuse President Barack Obama of caving into Taliban demands. They say he raised the ransom price for any future U.S. servicemen and women captured by the Taliban and didn't give Congress proper notice.

In 2012, Rolling Stone magazine quoted emails that Bergdahl allegedly sent to his parents suggesting that he had become disillusioned with the U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. The emails quoted him as saying he was "ashamed to be an American" and implied that he was considering desertion.

Bergdahl is now undergoing medical and mental evaluations at a U.S. military hospital in Germany, and will soon be sent for long-term therapy in Texas.

Only then may all the questions be answered, his fellow soldiers say. Although Sutton said he wants to see Bergdahl face a court-martial, he considered him a good soldier until he disappeared.

"I'd like to talk to the man and find out what was going on with him," Sutton said. "I mean, he was my friend. I want to know."
