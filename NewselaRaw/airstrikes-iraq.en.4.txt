WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama said U.S. military planes can drop bombs on Islamic fighters in northern Iraq. He wants to save Iraqis surrounded by the fighters. The Iraqis are called Yazidi. They have their own religion. Tens of thousands of Yazidis are stranded on a mountain.

The president also wants to help defend Americans in the area.

Obama said American military planes have dropped food and water to the Yazidis. The people could be killed by the Islamic fighters if they come down from the mountain. They could also die without the food and water.

"Today America is coming to help," he said on Thursday.

U.S. troops left Iraq in 2011. The United States has not gotten this involved in Iraq since then. Obama wants to be remembered as the president who ended what he has called the "dumb war" in Iraq.

## Yazidis Told To Convert Or Die

The main religion in Iraq is Islam. The Yazidis follow an older religion.

The fighters are part of a group called the Islamic State. They ordered the Yazidis to make a choice. They could join Islam, pay money, flee their homes or face death. The Yazidis ran away.

Obama said the Iraqi government requested the food and water. The Islamic State group is fighting against Iraq's government. They are also fighting the government in Syria. They want to take control of both countries.

Obama said that new U.S. attacks in Iraq could worry Americans. He promised not to put American soldiers back on the ground in Iraq.

Even so, he explained the Islamic State fighters might attack the city of Irbil. Then U.S. fighter jets might be needed. Irbil is in northern Iraq. Americans working for the U.S. government and army are based there.

"When the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action," Obama said. "That's my responsibility as commander in chief."

## A Life-Saving Mission

The U.S. military said planes have dropped food and water in the area.

They delivered 5,300 gallons of fresh drinking water. They also dropped 8,000 packaged meals to the stranded people.

The president said the life-saving mission was America's duty.

The U.S. was prepared to make more airdrops if needed, officials said. They did not say how quickly they would happen.

Officials said the U.S. military was flying over Irbil. Some of the flights are in traditional aircraft. The United States is also using planes with no pilots called drones. They were trying to gather information and watch as the situation gets worse.

## Many Want The President To Act

Obama will likely decide on his own whether to strike the fighters. Lawmakers from Congress left Washington, D.C., last week. They are on a five-week vacation called a recess. There was no sign that Congress was being called back to work.

However, officials said the White House was talking with some lawmakers. They included the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, and Mitch McConnell. McConnell is the leader of the Republicans in the Senate.

Some Republicans have called for the president to take action. They have said he does not need an OK from the lawmakers.
