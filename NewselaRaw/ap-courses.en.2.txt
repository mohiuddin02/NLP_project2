ORLANDO, Fla. â€” Kyana Julian started high school and her first Advanced Placement (AP) class at the same time. An AP class is a college level course that students take in high school. At the end, students can take an exam. If they score well, they can earn college credit.

Kyana goes to high school in Florida. Schools there encourage top students to take demanding classes, as do many schools around the country. Kyana says she took the class because her guidance counselor told her it would help her to get into a good college. Some students and parents say there is too much pressure to load up on difficult courses.

Kyana says she sometimes feels frustrated because administrators and guidance counselors seem to give the same advice to every student. "They don't look at a student as an individual," she says.

## Racking Up AP Classwork Points

School leaders say that they want all teens to know about the advantages of taking tough classes. They especially want to get the message out to those from lower-income families, and others who do not have the same opportunities as perhaps their more privileged peers.

Gordon Chavis works in admissions at the University of Central Florida. He says that if guidance counselors are "pushing them to take more difficult courses, it's because they want the students to be better prepared." He also says that students who do well in AP courses are usually ready for college.

A student's grade point average (GPA) is one factor that colleges use in the admission process. A GPA is the average number of grade points that high school classes are worth. Each letter grade equals a number on the grade point scale. GPA is calculated by dividing total grade points earned by total course credits.

AP classes are worth more. Chavis says public universities there adjust student GPAs so the hard classes are worth more points. The process is called weighting.

## More Options Heading Toward College

Mary Bridges is the guidance director at a Florida high school. She points out that counselors want to make sure students have as many options as possible for college. Bridges says, "What we're trying to look at is every student having a post-secondary plan."

Florida also offers incentives to high schools for offering AP and other tough courses. Benefits include no class size requirements and better school ratings.

AP classes are not required, but Bridges says that some students might find themselves automatically enrolled. Guidance counselors look at scores on state tests and the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT), to figure out who might be a good fit. The PSAT is a primer to the SAT college placement test. "What we don't want to do is miss students who could do well," Bridges says.

## AP Is Not For Everyone

Kyana is now a high school junior with a weighted GPA of nearly 5.0. She could take more AP courses, but feels the classes that she has already taken were not hard enough. She earned A's in the classes, but did not do well enough on the AP exams to earn college credit. Kyana said that "the sole purpose of taking the AP class was completely lost" for her.

One Florida public school official says parents tell him that their children are pushed too hard. He says, "I personally don't want any child in an AP course who doesn't want to be there."

Schools continue to recruit new AP students. Walt Griffin is a superintendent for a Florida school district. Recently, he met with all of his principals to review student information and find those who might qualify, and says, "I want to make sure that all students, regardless of their socioeconomic background, their ethnicity, have opportunities for advanced coursework."

## Giving Students The Equal Opportunity

Angie Gallo's daughter takes AP classes. Gallo says she recognizes that some students will not sign up for tough classes on their own, yet once students are enrolled, it is difficult to drop the class. Gallo says her daughter wanted to transfer out of an AP class and it was not easy to do. "If the child is in an AP class, and they can't handle it or they're stressed out, there should be a fail-safe," she says.

Mary Bridges agrees that guidance counselors should speak with parents who are worried. However, she also says that educators want to make sure students are not in classes that are too easy for them. She says that she would not be doing her job if she did not "give a student an opportunity, if they're capable of doing well."

The College Board runs the AP program for the entire country. It says more than 200,000 Florida students took at least one AP test this year, up 10 percent since 2011. That proves that students are still signing up.

John Williamson works for the College Board and says parents, students and counselors should determine what is best. He adds that there is another reason to take AP classes. Even students who do not score well enough on the AP exam to earn college credit are still more likely to graduate from college on time.
