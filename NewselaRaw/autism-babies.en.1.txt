LOS ANGELES – Children with autism spectrum disorders usually aren't diagnosed until they are at least 2 years old. But, a new study finds that signs of the condition can be seen as early as two months after birth.

Autism is usually thought of as a serious developmental problem. People who are autistic often have trouble communicating with others. They may have a tendency to do things over and over, or to focus on one interest to the exclusion of everything else. Autism spectrum disorder is a group of several brain disorders, including classic autism and Asperger's syndrome.

Researchers in the study focused on babies' ability to make eye contact with caregivers, since lack of eye contact is one of the hallmarks of autism. Among typical children, interest in the eyes increased steadily with age. But for children with autism, interest in the eyes declined starting between 2 and 6 months of age.

By the time of their second birthdays, levels of eye contact among children with autism were only half as high as levels seen in typically developing children.  The new study was published Wednesday by the journal Nature.

## Tracking Eye Contact

Researchers expected to see a difference between the two groups of kids. But, they were surprised that the infants who were later diagnosed with autism started out developing just like their peers. That suggests that some social skills that let us navigate the world around us may "initially be intact" in babies' brains, which would "offer a remarkable opportunity for treatment," the researchers wrote.

Warren Jones and Ami Klin of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta recruited 110 infants for their study. Among them, 59 had a sibling with autism and thus were considered at high risk of developing the condition themselves. An additional 51 infants who had no close relatives with autism were considered at low risk, and they served as controls.

The infants were shown scenes of typical caregiving while the researchers used eye-tracking technology to monitor where the babies focused their gazes. They measured the proportion of time spent paying attention to the woman's eyes, mouth, body (including neck, shoulders and hair) and nearby objects. The subjects were tested 10 times over the course of the study, between the ages of 2 months and 20 months.

By the time the toddlers were 3 years old, 13 were formally diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder — 10 boys and two girls from the high-risk group and one boy from the control group. For the sake of simplicity, they focused their analysis on boys: 11 with autism and 25 without.

The data showed that distinct differences in eye interest became noticeable when the babies were between 2 and 6 months old. During those early months, the boys in the control group spent more time focused on the caregiver's eyes than the mouth, body or other regions. But for the boys with autism, interest in the caregiver's eyes steadily declined after the 2-month test.

## Therapists Can Get Involved Earlier

The researchers also found that steeper declines in eye interest tended to be linked to more severe problems of socializing.

Other differences emerged as well. Although boys in both groups showed increasing interest in the caregiver's mouth up through the age of 18 months, the typically developing boys lost interest in the body and object regions much more quickly than the boys with autism.

"These results, although still limited in sample size, document the derailment of skills," Jones and Klin wrote.

If the results are confirmed and doctors are able to identify children with autism as early as 2 months of age, therapists could get involved earlier. And perhaps they might get better results.

"The sooner we are able to identify early markers for autism, the more effective our treatment interventions can be," said Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.

The study was funded by NIMH.
