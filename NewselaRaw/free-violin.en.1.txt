CHICAGO â€” For violin teacher Sarah Dupuis, more than just distance divides her wealthy suburban students from those on Chicago's West Side.

The student violinists at KIPP Ascend Primary School in Chicago's North Lawndale neighborhood face poverty and hardship. But they are determined to overcome these obstacles one string at a time.

"These kids are so brave, so strong and they work so hard," said Dupuis. She is an Oxford University-educated music teacher and a professional violinist with the Northbrook Symphony Orchestra. The barriers the Chicago kids face are largely unknown to her students in the wealthy suburbs of Glenview, Northbrook and Wilmette where she also teaches.

## No More Empty Boxes

"If I had to deal with half the things they do at that age, I'd have given up long ago," Dupuis said of her city students.

For the last three years, Dupuis has taught KIPP student musicians to play the violin in her free program, MUSIC Inc. Founded by Dupuis and school counselor Joi Truman, MUSIC Inc stands for "Music in Urban Schools Inspiring Change." The program began with no instruments, and at first students practiced on fake violins fashioned from empty Lean Cuisine boxes.

A local violin-maker, Michael Reuter, donated 25 instruments. Dozens more used violins have been donated to the program in recent years.

Today, the MUSIC program at KIPP has 12 families on a waiting list, Dupuis said. Officials also are trying to raise money to expand the program into more impoverished Chicago neighborhoods.

## Parents Get Involved

The program currently enrolls more than 70 KIPP students, ages 7 to 10. Dupuis said students are accepted into the program based upon their ability to meet leadership goals. For example, they must display responsible behavior in the classroom and complete homework assignments.

Dupuis said the children are also given a violin, a song book and a handbook for parents so they can practice at home.

Dupuis said that as parental participation is a key component of early Suzuki instruction. Suzuki is method of teaching musical instruments. Parents attend all the lessons and become "home teachers" for their children. MUSIC holds family classes on Saturdays at KIPP to teach parents how to help their children practice outside of the classroom.

KIPP parent Ashley Wiggins said her fourth-grade daughter has developed far more than musical ability after learning to play the violin.

## Take Away The Barriers

Wiggins is a mother of two with a full-time job. She said she enjoys attending the program's Saturday violin classes for parents.

"Madison used to be really shy, but she just played her violin before a few hundred people at a youth pageant at our church," Wiggins said. "This is something that never occurred to me, because I don't play an instrument, but playing the violin has helped Madison develop into a person who is responsible. She takes such good care of her instrument. She's much more confident and has the ability now to speak in front of a group."

Melissa Cowell is a third-grade teacher at KIPP who helps with the string program. She said she learned to play the viola with private lessons as a child growing up in Glenview, one of the wealthy suburbs where Dupuis also teaches.

"String education can be very expensive, even if it just means providing the instrument," Cowell said. "Providing violin instruction free of charge during the school day takes away the barriers."
