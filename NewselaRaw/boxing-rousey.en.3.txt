Mixed martial artist Holly Holm beat Ronda Rousey in a fight championship. The fight took place on Sunday in Australia. Rousey had never lost before and was thought to be unbeatable.

Holm and Rousey are two of the best fighters in the sport of mixed martial arts. It is also known as ultimate fighting. The sport is a mix of boxing, kickboxing, and types of wrestling. Holm won in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). It was the bantamweight title fight. Bantamweight fighters can weigh no more than 135 pounds.

Holm shocked the sporting world. She scored a second-round knockout victory. Rousey was sent to a hospital. She is OK but stayed overnight to be safe, said a UFC spokesman.

"Everything we worked on ended up being used," Holm said after the fight, which 56,214 people watched at a stadium. Holm now has 10 wins and no losses.

## Champ Won Last 3 Fights Quickly

Rousey, age 28, is six years younger than Holm, but she appeared very tired by the end of the first round. She badly missed with a punch that Holm ducked. Holm hit Rousey over and over with her left hand. One punch set up a left kick to the head.

Rousey seemed ready for the match. In Rousey's three fights before facing Holm, she beat three other mixed martial artists in seconds. This made her one of the best-known athletes in the world.

"I have a lot of respect for Ronda," Holm said. "This wouldn't have meant as much if it hadn't been for what she has done."

Holm said she just tried to stay focused. "We did this in practice. I (knew I) could do it again."

## Earlier, Holm Was A Top Boxer

Holm continued her track record of figuring out how to beat talented fighters. Holm was a champion boxer before. Now she is a mixed martial arts champion.

Holm's coach is Mike Winkeljohn. "I figured we'd pick her apart little by little. It played out real well," he said of Rousey.

"Holly walked into my gym 17 years ago. Now, you're going to come here and give the biggest upset in history ... We knew she could do it."

Holm fought tears while she answered questions after the fight. "I'll probably have a few sleepless nights replaying everything that happened," she said.

In her first two UFC fights, Holm appeared careful, but won both.

## Rematch Expected After Upset

UFC President Dana White said he will set up a rematch.

"Obviously … biggest upset ever," White said. "When you look at how Ronda is revered — baddest woman on the planet — definitely."

White first leaned toward making Miesha Tate the No. 1 contender to fight Rousey.

However, he decided to go with Holm. Rousey had beaten Tate twice. Also, Holm was a more interesting choice. She had boxing know-how, was taller than Rousey and has long arms that can reach farther than Rousey.

"This is the fight I went after," White said. "Holly, we said it at the time, had the range, uses her distance very well, has great head kicks. Everything we talked about is essentially what went down.

"Obviously, I thought Ronda would have more answers."

## Rousey Busy Making A Movie

The stunning event came after Rousey, who is from Los Angeles, acted out of character. At weigh-in a day earlier, she charged at Holm and called her a phony.

Rousey is making a movie right now.

White said he had wanted Rousey to fight at UFC 200 in July. Rousey's past wins mean she can get an immediate rematch if she wants it, White said. He said he would not set a date yet.

"I don't think there's any rush," White said. "She still has a movie to film, doing all the things she has to do before she fights again. I wouldn't (expect) her back any time soon."
