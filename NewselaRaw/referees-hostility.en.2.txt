FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Jimmy Woods has been a youth official for nearly 30 years. He's lost count of how many football games he has refereed and how many times he's been yelled at, threatened or insulted.

Oh, he remembers the details. He has been surrounded by angry parents following games. He has been called a cheater by coaches and cursed at as recently as this season by players and fans at a private high school in Little Rock.

People do not respect officials anymore, said Woods, a 50-year-old firefighter who officiates games on the side. "They think you're out to get them or cheat them."

Violence against referees is as old as sport itself. Most people are familiar with awful stories from soccer matches in Europe or South America. However, the headlines have appeared uncomfortably closer to home for Woods and his fellow officials lately.

## Angry Players Attack Referees

Over two years' time, referees in Utah and Michigan died after they were punched by angry players during games. In September, two San Antonio football players smacked into a referee on purpose. The incident drew widespread condemnation.

This has come at a cost. By all accounts from those involved, finding and keeping referees is becoming more and more difficult. In fact, recognizing the possible shortage, many desperate state high school associations have taken lead roles in recruiting new talent to an aging group of referees who are facing shockingly hostile conditions.

One of those states is Kansas, where the number of registered officials has dropped since the 2012-13 school year.

The effects of a referee shortage are many, said Gary Musselman, executive director of the Kansas State High School Activities Association. Games are delayed or moved or canceled altogether. Referee crews in sports such as soccer and basketball are trimmed from three to two.

## Older People May Handle Hostility Better

Younger people may be less likely to want to be officials, Musselman said. Older people may be "more established and aren't as caught up in, 'Does everybody like me?' Because officials are going to do things that people aren't going to like, and not everybody can handle that negative feedback."

Two years ago, the association started making it easier for people to train to be officials and offering a $1,000 grant. Coaches were asked to identify possible future referees among their players, too. The efforts resulted in 22 recent high school graduates registering to be officials.

The Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association offers to waive its first- or second-year registration fees for current and former members of the U.S. military. One marketing brochure reads: "From Serving Our Country ... To Helping Our Schools."

Barry Mano founded the National Association of Sports Officials (NASO) in 1980 and spent 23 years as a college basketball referee. The group doesn't keep national numbers to track the decline, but its 2002 survey found that 90 percent of high school officials believed they had a referee shortage. He also said fans have become more angry at officials.

## Pay May Not Outweigh Risks

"Unsporting behavior continues to be the main reason that people get out of officiating," said Mano. He noted that pay for his members ranges from roughly $50 to $60 per game at the high school level to approximately $2,500 to $3,000 for major college football games. "They worry about their safety, they worry about putting up with all that guff for $50 a game. Are you kidding me?"

A phone call to NASO leads to a menu with several choices. The third option is the association's Assault Protection Program for its 22,000-plus members.

It is a "sad" statement, Mano said. His organization has backed the creation of laws in more than 20 states to make punishments more harsh for people who attack a referee. NASO also provides insurance that can help officials who are the victim of an assault by a spectator or athlete. It also offers money for attorney fees.

## "The Problem Is Finding Good Refs"

Don Boss is 64 years old. He has officiated a variety of sports over his 47 years in the business. He has overseen high school and adult soccer leagues in Arkansas for more than 20 years. He assigns officials in the central part of the state and tries to weed out officials who might not be able to walk away from a heated situation.

"The problem isn't finding refs," Boss said. "The problem is finding good refs."

Like many officials, Woods started as a football referee to remain connected to the game he once played. It's a little money on the side, a chance to be active and around the game he loves.

Nearly 30 years later, the former minor league baseball player continues to referee despite taking medical leave from his firefighting job in recent years as he battles cancer. He plans to keep going.  

"It's a great service to the kids," Woods said. "Without these guys working at all levels of football, from pee wee to junior high to high school to college to different pro and semi-pro events, these kids wouldn't be able to play."
