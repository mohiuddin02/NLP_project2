HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. — Cassidy Campbell was born a boy. But as far back as she can remember she liked dolls and pink dresses.

"I felt like I was already a girl, so I was confused as to why my mom would cut my hair," Cassidy said.

For a short while in middle school, she tried explaining herself to her classmates. She told them she was transgender. That means she did not feel as though she was born in the right gender. But, the term seemed to confuse everyone. It made people not want to be around her. So she just told classmates she was gay.

During her first year in high school she started watching videos made by transgender women.

"They were so unique, so different and beautiful," the 16-year-old said. "That's when I started thinking this could be an option for me."

## Not Feeling Honest

On Halloween of her second year of school, Cassidy dressed up as a girl. She figured it would be the easiest time to express herself. Sometimes during that year and the next, she went to school in a dress or skirt.

But it did not feel honest.

"I would dread taking off my wig," Cassidy said.

So, she began taking medicine. The medicine can stop her from developing fully as a male. She did not tell her mother or ask a doctor.

One night, about three months ago, she told her mom.

"I was crying," she recalled.

Her mom told her she would support her. Her father has not stopped her. The teen is now on medicine prescribed by a doctor to make her body more feminine.

She has watched her body change. But, the biggest change has been mental, she said.

"I didn't just change physically; everything changed," she said.

She entered Marina High in Huntington Beach in August for the first time as Cassidy Lynn Campbell.

"This year," she said, stroking her long black hair, "I'm a girl every day."

## On A Mission To Be Queen

The thought of running for homecoming queen first swept through her mind last year. She pushed the idea aside. It would just be a joke, she told herself.

But now the high school senior sees it as a chance to make a statement.

"If I win it would mean that the school recognizes me as the gender I always felt I was," Cassidy said.

On Friday, the queen will be crowned at the school's football game. Her mother will join her on the field if Cassidy is a finalist.

On her bed are dresses she will wear to the game and homecoming.

Standing in front of a mirror and talking about Britney Spears, Cassidy is just like most high school girls. But, she worries about her health. She even worries about being attacked because of who she is.

"It's worth it because I lived a full life," Cassidy said.

## Growing Up Faster Than Others

The risks of taking her medications are low. But, there is a chance of blood clots and liver damage, said Johanna Olson. She works at the Center for Transyouth Health and Development. It's part of the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles.

"It's a medical necessity," Olson said. "It can't be framed as a choice," she said.

Cassidy's change has forced her to grow up faster than other kids, her mother said.

"I don't want her to be who she is, and my religion says it's wrong," said her mother, who is a born-again Christian. "But I think in the end, love is letting her be who she wants to be."

School officials have not stood in Cassidy's way.

Cassidy thinks she has a good shot at being crowned.

"I'm doing this for the kids who can't be themselves," she said.

## Story Update

SANTA ANA, Calif.—Cassidy Lynn Campbell broke down in tears Friday night. The teen was crowned homecoming queen.

The senior at Marina High School in Huntington Beach was born male. She told the Los Angeles Times she always felt like a girl.

On Friday, at Marina High's homecoming pep rally, five finalists were chosen. Cassidy was one of them.

At halftime, school district spokesman Tom Delapp said, the five finalists were called up and balloons were released from a box to announce the winner.

"She kind of broke down on the podium," Delapp said of Cassidy. "She was shocked. She cried a lot."

Students started chanting her name. Then, they ran down to hug her, he said.

"I was so proud to win, not just for me but for everyone out there," Cassidy told reporters afterward. "I think it really shows the progression of the times."
