CHICAGO, Ill. â€” The Kelly children took the train to downtown Chicago. They carried their music instruments on their backs.

They stood on a busy street corner. For two hours, they played music.

## Happy Sight, Happy Sounds

Some people stopped to listen. Others took pictures. Many were surprised at the happy sight. African-American kids were playing a harp, a cello and four violins on the street.

A bus driver stopped at a red light. He opened his door. Then he leaned from his seat so he could hear better. Another person took out a dollar bill. Then he dropped it in an open violin case. From time to time, the young musicians looked up to smile at their audience.

## Music Brings Joy

This is their summer job. The group had collected $240. The family has 15 kids. They can really use the money.

At home, music fills the small rooms.

La Shone Kelly is the mother of the family. She said when her children make music, everything feels better.

Learning music was their father's idea. His name is Jonathan Kelly. He thinks music brings joy to people.

## Serious About Practice

Jonathan said it is best to learn music at a young age. People can play their whole lives. The family gets together to sing and play. If others enjoy it, that is good too.

The Kellys spend about $1,300 each month on music. The money goes for music lessons and instruments. The family has given up so much to pay it. They do not buy new clothes. They also gave up their van. Now they take two cars.

La Shone said the music costs a great deal. Her children have to be serious about it. They must practice, she said.
