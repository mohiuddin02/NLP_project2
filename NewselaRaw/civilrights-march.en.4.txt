WASHINGTON — Fifty years ago giant crowds marched on Washington for civil rights. On Aug. 24 people from across the United States gathered in the nation's capital to celebrate that march. But they were not just there to remember the past. They said there is more work to do to make the country fair for all.

The group gathered under blue skies around the Lincoln Memorial. The monument is where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his "I Have a Dream" speech. On Saturday, speakers said people must not just stand by and watch. They need to stand up to make sure that people of all races are treated equally and get along.

John Lewis was the only speaker from the 1963 march. Now he is a congressman.

Lewis fired up Saturday's crowd. He pushed them to fight against a Supreme Court decision from June. The decision got rid of a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Passing that act was an important civil rights victory in the 1960s.

## "Bloody Sunday" Recalled

"I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala.," he told the crowd. He was talking about the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. People call that march "Bloody Sunday" because protesters were badly beaten. "I got arrested 40 times during the '60s, beaten and left bloodied and unconscious. But I'm not tired. I am ready to fight and continue to fight, and you must fight.

Attorney General Eric Holder echoed his views. He said Saturday's event was "about far more than reflecting on our past."

He said the "struggle must, and will, go on" until every American can exercise their right to vote. The struggle must continue until "all are treated equally and fairly in the eyes of the law."

Many people around the Lincoln Memorial wore T-shirts or buttons. Some carried signs with Trayvon Martin's picture. George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of the Florida teenager. Martin's mother was cheered loudly when she appeared.

## A Feeling Of Change

Emma Daniels is 70 years old. She wore a cap with buttons from the 1963 march. Daniels pointed to where she and other members of her Georgia church stood 50 years ago. She was 20 then.

"I wanted my children to have the same feeling that I had — change," said Daniels. She said there has been a lot of change. "We're going forward, it's slow, but we're moving forward."

Daniels said the mood was different Saturday than in 1963. She said there was an air of concern then. Many of the 250,000 people who were there that day had traveled through the South. Whites and blacks were separate in the South back then. The people who came to the rally feared being stopped by police officers who did not like them.

Saturday's gathering was relaxed. It was like a "family reunion," she said. Melanie Marshall, Daniels' daughter, said Saturday's event gave her a greater appreciation for the right to gather peacefully.

## Obama To Speak On Aug. 28

"In Egypt, people are fighting and killing each other in the street," Marshall said. "We're lucky to be able to come together like this, in a peaceful way."

Another large crowd is expected at the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28. President Barack Obama will speak at the spot where King made history 50 years ago.

Obama is the nation's first African-American president. He is expected to discuss the progress the country has made in living up to King's dream. In [his speech](http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf), King said he dreamed his children "will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."
