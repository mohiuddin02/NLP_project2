WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruling giving gays and lesbians the right to marry marked a huge shift in law and public attitudes. It also created the most important new constitutional liberty in many years.

Friday's 5-4 decision focused on the question of same-sex marriage. However, its meaning goes far beyond the battle for marriage equality. The ruling will almost surely lead to the end of any remaining laws that discriminate against gay people.

The court's ruling was cheered by some as a long overdue recognition of the basic human right to get married. Others, however, condemned it. They called it an effort by liberal justices to take over a matter that should be decided by state lawmakers.

The decision lets gay and lesbian couples marry in the 13 states that still banned gay marriage.

## Justice Says It's About Equal Respect, Dignity

The Supreme Court's justices are generally thought to be divided into two groups — liberals and conservatives — who tend to vote the same way. Each group can claim four justices, while Justice Anthony M. Kennedy more or less takes the middle ground.

"No longer may this liberty be denied to them," Justice Kennedy wrote. "No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were."

Same-sex couples, he wrote, "ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."

Kennedy declared that gays and lesbians deserve equal respect and dignity under the Constitution.

Kennedy described the struggle for gay marriage as a matter of equal rights. He based it on a 1967 decision that struck down laws that prevented African-Americans and white people from marrying. He also based it on rulings from the 1970s that ended laws that gave husbands greater rights than their wives.

## Court's Dissenters Heaped Scorn

The court's decision will likely encourage more people to accept same-sex marriage. A majority of Americans now support same-sex marriage, which was not the case just a few years ago.

Kennedy said that some parts of the country may not be ready to accept equality for gays and lesbians. "The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times," he wrote.

The four Supreme Court judges who voted against the decision heaped scorn on the majority opinion. Chief Justice John G. Roberts said that the court is not a legislature, like Congress, and should not make law. He also said that the Constitution does not decide on issues of marriage.

Roberts' opinion outlined why he thought the matter should be decided by lawmakers.

He called the court's decision an "act of will, not legal judgment."

## "Victory For America"

Amid rainbow flags and joyous celebrations on the Supreme Court steps, James Obergefell took a congratulatory phone call from President Barack Obama. Obergefell brought the case to the Supreme Court. He had sued the state of Ohio for refusing to recognize his marriage after his husband, John Arthur, died.

Obama applauded the ruling, calling it a "victory for America."

He praised the persistence of same-sex marriage supporters. "Sometimes," he said, "there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt."

Allowing gay couples to marry would strengthen communities, the president said.

Obama added, "This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: that when all Americans are treated as equal, all are free."

## Ruling Was A Matter Of Time

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined with Kennedy to vote for gay marriage. Justices Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined Roberts to vote against it.

The ruling came as no surprise. Federal judges, state courts, lawmakers and voters had already knocked down the legal barriers to gay marriages in 37 states.

Support for gay marriage picked up steam two years ago when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned gay marriage. The court said that marriages of same-sex couples deserved equal dignity and respect under the law.

Friday's decision addressed only the question of same-sex marriage. The ruling, though, may have far-reaching effects by sending a message that laws against gays and lesbians are on shaky ground.

Sarah Warbelow is a lawyer for the Human Rights Campaign in Washington. She said the Supreme Court ruling will help gay-rights supporters fight against any new laws that would target gay people. There are currently more than 115 bills, or proposed laws, being considered in state legislatures that would target gay people.

Warbelow and others would have liked Kennedy and the court to have gone even further. They wanted him to put discrimination against gay people on the same level as discrimination against racial minorities or women.

"That would have made it crystal clear that there are virtually no circumstances under which the government can discriminate against gays," Warbelow said.
