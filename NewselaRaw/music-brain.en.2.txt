Everyone dislikes some kind of music. But are there people out there who just don't respond to the emotional content of any music? In other words, are there people who simply aren't moved by the music that hits others in the heart?

According to a new study published on Thursday, the answer, apparently, is yes.

The finding was made by a team of researchers from Spain and Canada. They had been trying to develop an accurate way to measure people's sense of reward from music. To their surprise, they found that roughly 5 percent of those studied reported getting no pleasure at all from music.

So they followed up by testing 30 more people, grouped by how much they liked music. Those who expressed the least pleasure in music also exhibited the slightest emotional response when listening. These people felt little emotion even when they listened to music they had chosen themselves. Emotional response was measured by monitoring changes in heart rate and skin conductivity, or sweat.

## A Separate Musical Anhedonia?

"They were not just saying so," said the study's co-author, Josep Marco Pallares, a psychologist who studies the brain and human behavior. The group with little feeling for music had physical responses that lined up "with what they were saying."

It was already known that there are people who can't process music well. About 4 percent of the population has what is called amusia. They may not be able to recognize melodies to famous songs or tell if musical notes are out of tune. Others, particularly those who are depressed or have certain brain diseases like Alzheimer's, suffer from general anhedonia. They have difficulty experiencing pleasure at all.

But is there a separate musical anhedonia? The study suggests there may be.

None of the participants showed signs of general anhedonia. They reported no differences in their levels of pleasure when it came to things other than music. And all did well at categorizing musical passages as happy, sad, scary or peaceful.

The only thing that matched up well with the subjects' heart rate and level of sweat was their score on the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire. This rates such things as music-seeking behavior, use of music to change their mood, whether music was a shared experience between people, and other factors. Generally, the more emotionally subjects responded to music, the higher their Music Reward score.

The study suggests that musical enjoyment is not as universal as commonly assumed. Some people, apparently, just don't get that much joy from listening to music.

Marco said the results could help the team refine musical therapies for stroke victims. People who suffer from depression or brain diseases like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's might also be aided.

## Hyper-Hedonic Music Mix

Thirteen pieces were used in the study, drawn from responses to a poll of 200 people whose background makes them similar to those studied. The set list skewed toward well-known classical pieces such as "Spring," from Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," and the Puccini aria "Nessun Dorma."

"Most of them are very well known classical pieces," Marco said. "The list was not as original as we expected. We expected more pop music."

Also making the list was the musical theme to the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, "Barcelona." Composed by Freddie Mercury, this was recorded in a popular duet version with Montserrat Caballe.

Subjects were also asked to bring in several pieces of their own choice, Marco said. So-called hyper-hedonic people, characterized by high music appreciation, brought in what could only be described as an eclectic mix. Artists with more than one cut included Carlos Santana, Paco de Lucia and Beethoven. Pink Floyd, Deep Purple and Genesis were wedged in among Beirut, Rihanna and movie score composer Clint Mansell.

"I would say it was less typical," Marco said of the mix brought in by the hyper-hedonic people.

For those with less emotional connection to music, the task of selecting a handful of songs proved difficult. "They were really having trouble bringing music in, and some of them asked family and friends to give them music," Marco said.

Besides some Beethoven and the themes to "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Superman," the group less moved by music chose music by the Verve, Franz Ferdinand and Moby.
