SOCHI, Russia â€” Imagine you lived in a city where the baseball team just lost the World Series to its biggest rival. And then in the same weekend, your football team lost the Super Bowl to its biggest rival. Imagine how you would feel.

Then you might begin to understand how people in Norway feel. Their country did very badly in last weekend's cross-country skiing results at the Olympics.

In both the men's and women's relay events, Norway didn't win a single medal. This is like a national sports disaster. In Norway, people are said to be born with skis on their feet. It was only the second time the Norwegians haven't won a single medal in the relay races since 1964.

What's worse, their biggest rival Sweden won both races. The Swedes had such a big lead in Sunday's men's race that Marcus Hellner, the Swedish anchor, had time to relax and carry his country's blue and yellow flag down the last part of the race.

## "Huge Drama"

"To be beaten by the Swedes is the worst that can happen," Petter Northug said. He is the Norwegian anchor, or team captain.

For Norway, the loss has been covered heavily by the news. There are rumors that the team's coaches could lose their jobs after the Sochi Games.

"This is, like, huge drama," said Ida N. Rasch. She is a journalist with NRK, the Norwegian broadcaster.

Her co-worker, Morten Stenberg, agreed. "The whole country is talking about the bad results this week," he said.

In fact, Norway's problems began last Thursday and Friday.  That's when the men's and women's individual distance races were held. Between those two races, the country won just a single medal.

That was far below what the Norwegians had been hoping. Norwegian women hold the top four spots in the international women's rankings, and the men hold three of the top four spots among men's rankings.

The relay races are a source of deep national pride.

Norwegian fans love the individual medals won by stars like Northug and Marit Bjorgen. But they love a strong place in the four-leg team events, too. Nothing signals Norway's power in cross-country like a medal in the relays.

## Desperate Measures

But their rivals have been beating them. The Swedish men's team have now won two Olympic relays in a row.

"You hear Norway talking about the relay 12 months a year," Canadian cross-country star Alex Harvey said in an interview. "You hear Northug talking about how he'll beat Hellner every day."

After the loss in the women's race on Saturday, Norway's athletes and coaches pinned their failure on skis. They said they were slower than the other teams' skis, which led to an intense, last-minute effort to fix the problem in time for the men's event.

The day of that race, the Canadian team saw 22 Norwegians who were out on the trails testing skis. That's compared to the seven testers on the Canadian team.

"That's just what we saw on the track. Maybe there were more in the wax cabin," said Sacha Bergeron, the Canadian ski technician who did the count. "For sure, they were trying to find a solution."

The desperate measures didn't work. Norway's men again complained about slow skis after their race.

But there are also questions about the Norwegians' ability. Other countries' coaches, athletes and fans think that Norway's skiers are simply not performing.

"I think they'll probably blame their skis," said Justin Wadsworth. He is the coach of the Canadian cross-country team. "But their athletes are obviously not in top shape. I think they're just off their A-game."

## Slow Skis

Vidar Lofshus, the chief of Norway's cross-country team, denied that.

"Right now, I have no explanation," he said in an interview following the men's relay. He blamed the country's poor performance on slow skis. "It's just a horror right now."

Norway's struggles may be painful at home. But officials at the International Ski Federation (FIS), which organizes the cross-country races, think the diversity on the Olympic podiums is a good thing.

France won its first-ever relay medal on Sunday. It took bronze, beating out fourth-place Norway. The win should help make the sport more popular in France, according to Pierre Mignerey. He works for FIS.

"We all know when you have a medalist in your ski club, you have more kids who want to be skiing," he said. "It's good for cross-country when it's not only gold medals for Norway."

The Norwegian team has been performing so badly that even the Swedish athletes are starting to feel sorry for them.

"After seeing them ski, you know they are much better than the results show," Teodor Peterson said in an interview. He won a silver medal for Sweden in the cross-country sprint last week.

"You'd rather beat them by this much," he said, spreading his fingers a few inches apart, "than by a lot."
