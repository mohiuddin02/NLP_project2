HORSE MOUNTAIN, Utah —  Standing atop a rocky ridge near his base camp at dawn, Scott Richardson looks over an ancient wilderness.

"This is dinosaur country," he says, gesturing toward the valley. "There are bones all over this place."

The 58-year-old Arizona native is dressed in a wide-brimmed hat and white clothes to stay safe from the sun.

Just off the path, an object catches his eye. An odd, almost oval shape pokes from the dirt. He quickly determines it's a 75-million-year-old hadrosaur vertebra. The fossil is caked with dirt, and it looks like any other rock to most people. But Richardson sees something else: He's seen many similarly shaped bones and recognizes the object's size and heft.

He drags his fingers over the piece of bone. He explains that it came from the top of the creature's spine, near its neck. "This is what it's all about," he says. "If you brushed around and dug some holes, you might find other bones going into the ground. There might be a whole animal here."

## Always Watching, Searching

Richardson finds dinosaurs. He is a bone hunter of ancient predators and their prey.

Six months each year, from March to September, he works as a paleontologist technician for the federal Bureau of Land Management.

He ranges across the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and helps dig bone quarries. He pieces together pieces of bone in a lab — puzzles with no images to guide him.

He is always watching, searching for a hint — a different color, feel or shape — that suggests a dinosaur's grave might lie somewhere beneath.

Richardson, the son of two teachers, grew up in Phoenix. He learned his love of the desert hunt when his father took him scrounging for Native American arrowheads.

For 12 years, he has bushwhacked across southern Utah, scouting out traces of the distant past.

"These were colossal creatures that ruled the planet for millions of years," Richardson says, standing in his lab in nearby Kanab. He holds a 5-foot-long hadrosaur femur, which looks like a bone from an old "Flintstones" cartoon. "To expose bones that haven't seen the light of the sun for 80 million years is just pretty incredible."

## The Coast Of A Lost Continent

The 1-million-square-acre Kaiparowits Plateau, part of the national monument, contains a trove of bones from the Cretaceous period, which lasted from 144 million to 65 million years ago. This part of southern Utah back then was lush forest. It was the coast of the lost continent Laramidia when a vast sea split present-day North America.

"It wasn't exactly a fun time to be around," Richardson says. "Temperatures were over 100 degrees, with 90 percent humidity. Aside from the predators, there were bugs, insects and worms, all of them with sharp teeth that were trying to eat you. Even the birds had teeth."

Rugged and isolated, unmapped by the U.S. Geological Survey until half a century ago, the Kaiparowits is virtually untouched by paleontologists. Scientists in the last decade have unearthed as many as 20 new dinosaur species.

In addition to the dinosaurs, they discovered a 90-million-year-old shark with grinding teeth. They found petrified dinosaur skin, and a horned skull the size of a small elephant. There were also crocodiles that swam and chased prey on land, and 2-foot-tall creatures with razor claws that ran in deadly packs like velociraptors.

Walking hundreds of miles a year, Richardson has uncovered four new species of dinosaur, including the only full head and spine of a Kosmoceratops. He found a member of the armored ankylosaur family; a Lythronax, an ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex; and an unknown species of a duck-billed dinosaur.

## Finding Something Truly Remarkable

Richardson remembers his first big dinosaur find as well as a parent would remember the birth of a first child. The year was 2006. Just after a hard rain, Richardson spied bones in the dirt while hiking.

Dropping his 40-pound pack loaded with tools, he began carefully digging. His heart raced with excitement and he sensed he had found something truly remarkable.

He approached a paleontology team nearby and asked the experts to look at his find. They told him the bones were nothing special — and then broke into grins. The site was huge: a full skull of an unknown cousin of the triceratops.

The creature, labeled "the horniest dinosaur," had a record-breaking 15 horns jutting from its skull. It was eventually named Kosmoceratops richardsoni. Richardson's friends began calling him "Scottosaurus."

"That's when I knew I'd arrived," he says. "There's a photo of me with the skull, grinning ear to ear like a proud daddy."
