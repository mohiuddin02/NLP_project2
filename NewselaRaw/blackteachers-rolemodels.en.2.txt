PITTSBURGH — Twenty high school students here were asked if they planned to go to college. They all raised their hands. Then they were asked if they planned to study education. All the hands dropped.

These students from Pittsburgh Westinghouse Academy illustrate a national trend: Fewer than 2 percent of teachers in the United States are African-American males, according to Robert Millward, an education professor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

Millward created the Black Men Teaching Initiative to encourage more African-American students, especially young men, to become teachers.

Four colleges in Pennsylvania have joined together to support the initiative. One of their approaches is holding workshops for high school students. The program's goal: to encourage black men to go to college and become teachers. The second task is more difficult than the first, Millward explained.

"They say that teachers don't make much" money, he said. "They see teaching as a woman's profession. They say, 'I didn't have a good experience in school, so why would I want to spend life teaching?'"

## Separate Was Not Equal

The lack of black teachers is an issue with historical roots. Until the 1950s, many American public schools were segregated — there were separate schools for black children and white children. Officials at the time claimed the schools were "separate, but equal."

In its groundbreaking 1954 case, Brown v. Board of Education, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that separate schools could never be equal, and that the black students were being hurt.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, American schools began to desegregate. Schools that were once only for white students would now also enroll black students.

The government began sending some black students on buses to white schools. With fewer students, some black schools had to close, causing many black teachers and principals to lose their jobs during this time.

The number of African-American teachers was cut almost by half, going from 80,000 nationwide in 1954 to 42,000 in 1965.

Few black educators were offered jobs at white schools. The positions open to them were often not as important or paid less than the ones they previously had held.

## Wanted: Positive Male Role Models

Rich Milner, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in urban education, said that before 1954, teaching was one of the three main professions that allowed African-Americans to move into the middle class; the others were nursing and church leadership. Teachers were seen as community leaders beyond the walls of the classroom, he said.

When the number of black teachers fell, the number of positive male role models dropped with it. Walter Lewis, who works with students through the Black Men Teaching Initiative, said many of the families that he works with do not have father figures.

"A lot of the students call me 'dad' or 'uncle,'" he said. "I am often the positive male role model. They need someone who can say, 'Don't do that' — someone who is not afraid of them."

The Black Men Teaching Initiative hopes that providing African-American middle and high school students with role models will create a snowball effect that builds on itself.

Stanley Denton, a professor who works with the program, remembers being stared at as he walked the halls of Pittsburgh schools.

"Our children were aware that someone like me was a rarity and that someone like me was an asset," Denton said.

## Other Programs Lend A Hand

The initiative takes various forms at different schools. Some schools are recruiting more math and science teachers and persuading teacher assistants to go back to school to become certified teachers. A local community college is helping students take necessary classes at low cost so they can transfer into four-year education programs.

The program is paid for by the Heinz Endowments, a charitable organization that gets its funding from the famous ketchup maker. Heinz has given $360,000 over the past three years through its African-American Men and Boys Task Force. It also pays for programs where a few African-American college graduates are paid to visit schools as role models and to work on a master's degree.

While education experts support the effort, they warn against viewing more black male teachers as the only solution. Low school funding, a shortage of resources, and under-qualified teachers can all hurt black students, regardless of the number of black male teachers, Milner said.

"Black male teachers can serve as role models, especially for black male students, but what are we going to do to support black male teachers who take on these other layers of responsibility?" he asked.

Nina Esposito-Visgitis, president of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, also admires the program. "We need a diverse population of teachers, but we need to make sure that all our teachers get the special training that urban teachers need," she said.
