WASHINGTON â€” Sarah Ball was 15 and a sophomore at Hernando High School in Brooksville, Fla., when a friend posted on Facebook: "I hate Sarah Ball, and I don't care who knows."

Then there was the Facebook group "Hernando Haters" asking to rate her attractiveness. An email called her a "waste of space." The emailer did not give his or her name. And this text arrived on her 16th birthday: "Wow, you're still alive? Impressive. Well happy birthday anyway."

It wasn't until Sarah's mom saw the messages that the girl told her everything.

More young people are telling their family members about being [harassed](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying) online, and it's helping. A poll released Thursday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MTV found incidents of "digital abuse" are still happening a lot. But they are declining a bit.

## More Teens Talking About Cyberbullying

Teenagers and young adults are growing more aware about the harm done from online meanness and cyberbullying, the poll showed. There was also a slight increase among those willing to tell a parent or sibling.

"It was actually quite embarrassing, to be honest," remembers Ball, now an 18-year-old college freshman. But "really, truly, if it wasn't for my parents, I don't think I'd be where I'm at today."

The survey's findings come a week after two Florida girls, ages 12 and 14, were arrested for allegedly bullying a 12-year-old girl online. The girl later killed herself by jumping off a tower at an abandoned concrete plant.

The poll found that 49 percent of young people ages 14 through 24 in the U.S. said they have had at least one brush with some kind of electronic harassment. That is down from about 56 percent in 2011. Of those who have encountered an incident, 34 percent went to a parent, compared with 27 percent just two years ago. And 18 percent asked a brother or sister for help. Only 12 percent did two years ago.

"I feel like we're making progress," said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor at Florida Atlantic University. "People should be encouraged."

When asked what helped, 72 percent of those who faced online abuse said that they changed their email address, screen name or cell number. Meanwhile, 66 percent who talked to a parent said it helped too. Less than one-third of people who retaliated found that helpful, while just as many said it had no effect, and 20 percent said getting revenge actually made the problem worse.

## "Cool To Care" About Others

Girls were more likely than boys to be the targets of online meanness. They also were more likely to reach out for help.

The poll also indicated that young people are becoming more aware of the impact of cyberbullying. Some 72 percent, up from 65 percent in 2011, said online abuse was a problem that society should address. Those who think it should be accepted as a part of life declined from 33 percent to 24 percent.

Hinduja credits school programs that are making it "cool to care" about others. Adults who can help teens talk through their options are more aware of the problem, too, he said. Those options can include deactivating an account or going to school administrators for help in removing hurtful postings.

That was the case for Ball. Her parents encouraged her to fight back by speaking up. "They said this is my ticket to helping other people," she said.

With their help, Ball sent copies of the abusive emails, texts and Facebook pages to school authorities, news outlets and politicians. She also organized an anti-bullying rally. She still maintains a Facebook site called "Hernando Unbreakable," and she works with local kids identified by the schools as victims of cyberbullying.

## Many Schools Can Punish Cyberbullies

Ball  said she thinks if other teens are reaching out more for help, it's as a last resort. Many kids fear making it worse, she said. That was one reason Jennifer Tinsley, 20, said she didn't tell her parents in the eighth grade when another student used Facebook to threaten to stab and beat her.

"I didn't want them to worry about me," Tinsley, now a college student in Fort Wayne, Ind., said of her family. "I just didn't want the extra attention."

According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, every state but Montana has anti-bullying laws. Many of the laws address cyberbullying specifically. Most state laws are focused on allowing school districts to punish offenders. In Florida, for example, a law was passed allowing schools to discipline students harassing others off campus.

In Florida's recent cyberbullying case, the police took the unusual step of charging the two teen girls with aggravated stalking. Even if convicted, however, the girls were not expected to spend time in juvenile jail because they didn't have criminal histories.

The AP-NORC Center/MTV poll was conducted online Sept. 27 through Oct. 7 among a national sample of 1,297 people between the ages of 14 and 24. Funding for the study was provided by MTV as part of its campaign to stop digital abuse, "A Thin Line."
