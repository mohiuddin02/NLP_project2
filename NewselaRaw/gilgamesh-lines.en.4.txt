The countries of Iraq and Syria are in the Middle East. The Islamic State is a violent group in Iraq and Syria. It has destroyed statues and temples built thousands of years ago. It also sold treasures to people in other countries. All of this is against the law.

Though there is one happy story. A museum in Iraq has rescued some ancient tablets. It also discovered something new and exciting.

## Mud Protected The Ancient Words

Ancient History Et Cetera is a news website. It is about archaeology and history. Archaeology is the study of how people lived in the past. Ancient History reported that the Sulaymaniyah Museum bought some clay tablets. They are 2,600 years old. The museum wanted to keep the tablets in Iraq. They are part of the country's culture. The museum made a deal with smugglers. The deal was the museum would not call police if the old tablets were turned in.

Most of the tablets were still covered with mud, Ancient History said. Some were whole, while others were broken. They probably were dug up in Babel. Digging up old treasures is not allowed. Babel was called Babylon in ancient times. The whole area was once called Mesopotamia.

## World's Oldest Story

Experts looked at the tablets. They found new lines from an ancient story, the Epic of Gilgamesh. The legend is 4,000 years old. Some experts call it the world's oldest story.

The story tells of Gilgamesh, the great king of Uruk. He travels with his friend Enkidu into the Cedar Forest. They want to defeat the ogre Humbaba. He guards the forest.

The tablets give new details about the story.

In the new lines, Gilgamesh and Enkidu saw monkeys in Cedar Forest. There were no monkeys in other versions.

In the original story, Humbaba was an ogre. The new tablets tell us that he is not an ogre. Instead, Humbaba is a king from another country. He listens to music at another king's court.

## Ancient Eyes See The Forest

The Epic of Gilgamesh contains many ideas, or themes. These themes are shared by other cultures. There is a hero who is too proud. The story includes a great flood and a man on a giant boat. The boat is called an ark.

In one way, the story sounds like it could be written today. Gilgamesh and Enkidu cut down cedar trees from the forest. Then they took the trees home. The new tablets say the men cut down too many trees. They warn that it is bad and will make the gods angry. The story shows caring for the environment. This is rare in ancient poems, said Andrew George. He helped to put the words on the new tablets into English.

The Epic of Gilgamesh was important in ancient Mesopotamia. It was passed down over many generations. At some point, people forgot about it. At least until European experts discovered it again in the 1800s.
