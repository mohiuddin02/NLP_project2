WASHINGTON â€” Ralph Nader looks like someone who would love computers.

He ran for president a few times and is very famous. Because he is well-known, there is a lot of information about him on the Internet. Still, Nader probably never sees what is written about him. He doesn't like using technology.

He writes his books, not on a computer, but on a typewriter. The typewriter is a noisy machine that writers used to use before computers were invented. When the writer's finger hits the keyboard, a small piece of metal hits a ribbon soaked with ink, and makes a letter on a piece of paper. After typing words on one page, the writer has to put in a blank sheet of paper before typing the next page.

Nader doesn't have a cellphone. "Why should I have a cellphone? I have people I don't want to get phone calls from," he says. And his Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and email accounts are written by people working for him.

"I've never seen them," he said of his Internet accounts.

## Who Needs The Internet?

Nader is one of a small group of Americans who are fighting technology. They try not to use electronic tools to talk. They don't use the Internet and they don't use smartphones.

Some of them just don't like change. Some of them don't trust the technology. Earlier this year, a man named Edward Snowden told newspapers a big secret. He said that the American government is using technology to spy on Americans. They read emails and can see who you called on the phone. This makes many people very nervous.

The Pew Research Center took a poll last month. It marked the 25th birthday of the Internet. Pew found that 8 out of 10 U.S. adults use laptop and desktop computers at home, work, school or someplace else. The poll also found that 9 out of 10 of all U.S. adults have cellphones. More than half of these are smartphones. But almost all people between 18 and 29 years old have cellphones. And most of the cell phones are smartphones.

Pew also found that most U.S. adults use the Internet at least occasionally. More than half of them use it every day.

That's a lot more than when Pew first asked the same question in 2000.

## Old Machine Just His Type

Jamie Patterson and Matthew Chojnacki are young adults. In many ways, they are very normal. The married couple is in their 20s. They grew up on the Internet and live in a big city.

But after stumbling onto an sale one day, Chojnacki bought a few typewriters and started fixing them up. Pretty soon, he and Patterson had a business. They buy, fix and sell typewriters. Of course, they use a website, OldFortTypewriterCo.com.

Jeff Hendrie is an 18-year-old high school senior in Detroit. He does just about everything the old-fashioned way.

He brings a big, old typewriter to school every day. He uses a flip phone. He isn't on Facebook or Twitter. He has an email account, but only because he has to.

Lynne Joyrich teaches college classes on media. She likes to use phones from the 1950s and 1960s. These old telephones have dials that you have to spin with your fingers. They make clicking noises instead of beeps, like push-button phones.

"I keep them because they are very beautiful," she said about her collection of old phones.

She does have a smartphone to keep in touch with students. But she often forgets she has it, "for the pleasure of being able to be left alone." The ability to control who can talk to you matters more and more.

Laura Pitter is a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a group that fights for basic rights for people. She said: "I'm much more careful about what I do online. I talk in person more now."

She worries about people in other countries watching her. So do other people who care about human rights.
