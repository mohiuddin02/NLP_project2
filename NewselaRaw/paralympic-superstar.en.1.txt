BALTIMORE — You start with a little girl, dropped in an orphanage and afflicted with a spinal condition that has paralyzed her below the belly button. She's cared for, yes, but as she scoots around the facility on her hands, no one seeing her can imagine a future ripe with possibility.

How do you get from there to a 24-year-old woman nicknamed "The Beast," a fearsomely muscled athlete who believes her body can fulfill the most outlandish ambitions her mind conceives?

Given her biography, the latest story starring Tatyana McFadden, of Clarksville, Md., is almost too rich.

Starting Friday, she'll compete in at least three events at the Sochi Winter Paralympics, a brand-new arena for an athlete who has already conquered the Summer Paralympics and the wheelchair marathon circuit. She'll take on the best in the world after just 50 days training on snow, a daunting challenge but one that exhilarates her.

She'll do so in Russia, the very country where, in that orphanage, her horizons once seemed so limited. And she'll perform in front of her birth mother and the director of her former orphanage.

## Wins Four Major Marathons

The changes in McFadden amazed staffers at Orphanage 13 in St. Petersburg, who met her during a return visit in 2011. She was adopted by an American woman years ago.

"I was the first person with a disability to come back, and they were absolutely amazed — from scrawny to how strong I've become," McFadden says. "It amazed them, because they've never seen someone with a disability become so successful and so independent."

"Very few women in the world are as fit as she is or can generate the power that she does, no matter what the sport," says her track coach, Adam Bleakney.

All of her previous achievements merely set the stage for 2013, when McFadden became the first person to win four major marathons — Boston, London, Chicago and New York — in the same calendar year. And those victories were sandwiched around a world championship performance in which she won every race between 100 and 5,000 meters.

Even as her remarkable 2013 unfolded, McFadden had her eye on the next hurdle — winter.

McFadden had hatched her plan to try cross-country skiing — known as sit skiing in the Paralympics.

Whether she would put it this way or not, McFadden seems to thrive on attempting feats that sound impossible to most.

"I guess I do," she says. "My mom was like, 'Why do you want to do a winter sport? You've always been a summer athlete.' It's a new challenge and it's fun. Yeah, it's crazy to deal with the changes. But it's also fun."

## Seeking The Next Challenge

"What can I do next?" she says, describing her ethos. "I think that's the fun part."

McFadden brought up the cross-country idea with coaches from the U.S. Paralympic team. They agreed she'd be perfect for the sport because of her upper-body power and cardiovascular endurance.

But the shift from champion marathoner to Olympics-ready skier wasn't instant, McFadden says. Though her strength made her competitive, the ideal skiing motion requires harmony between the upper body and the core muscles. That's hard for McFadden because of the extent of her paralysis.

"The endurance, strength and power she has earned on the track and in her training are her greatest assets in Nordic skiing," says her winter coach, John Farra. "But otherwise, skiing is very different from track."

On snow McFadden isn't yet the powerful force she is on the track or a marathon course. A top-10 finish is a good result for her at the world-class level, with her best chances for victory coming at the shorter distances.

"She is still very new in the sport," Farra says. "But I would not count her out in any event she enters. They don't make them much tougher than this one."

Though McFadden is focused on Sochi as an athletic competition, there's little question the games will carry an extra layer of emotion because of her Russian background.

After she won the London Marathon in 2011, she decided to visit St. Petersburg before returning to the U.S.

## Thanking Her Birth Mother

McFadden went back to Orphanage 13, taking in the modest space that had seemed so huge to her when she was a tiny kid, navigating the halls on her hands.

After touring the orphanage, she met her birth mother.

Some articles describe McFadden as having been "abandoned" in the orphanage, but she doesn't regard the experience that way. Her birth mother, Nina Polivikova, was young and had no means to care for a baby with spina bifida. She had been told her child would die, that there was no hope for her.

"My birth mom, she had to do the hardest part," McFadden says. "Just to give me life and then put me in the orphanage, because I was extremely sick."

She wanted their reunion to be free of feelings of guilt.

"Going back and showing her the person I've become was almost a way of saying thank you to her," she says. "I wanted her to know, 'It's not your fault. You did what you could. You did the best that you could at that time and moment.'"

She has remained in touch with Polivikova since their meeting and looks forward to racing in front of her and various cousins in Sochi.

"That's the first time they get to physically see me compete," McFadden says. "For me, that's going to be fulfilling. I'm sure I'll never forget being able to see them at the starting line or being there when I cross."
