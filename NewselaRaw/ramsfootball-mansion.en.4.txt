LOS ANGELES, Calif. — The St. Louis Rams are moving to Los Angeles. Players and coaches will need a place to live. Real estate agents will make money by helping them. The agents help people buy homes.

A football team has 53 players. Then there are coaches. Other people work for the team, too. More than 100 people will be looking for homes, said Kofi Nartey. He is a real estate agent.

Kofi's company will add workers to help Rams players. They will help players hire moving companies. Players will need to move their furniture. They will help them check out schools, he said.

Who gets the business? People who know a player, agents said. Agents are scrambling to meet the players.

## L.A. Homes Are More Expensive

The agents will not make much money to start. Real estate agents can make big money when people buy a home. Agents think most Rams players will not buy. They will rent.

Many players only play for a team for a short time. Most players do not last in the NFL for long. Players may not want to buy.

It also costs a lot to buy a home in Los Angeles. St. Louis was much cheaper.

Even the lowest-paid NFL players make $435,000, though. They can afford Los Angeles. Still, the agents probably will mostly help players rent. They will not set up many sales.

## Players Must Consider Locations

Agents say the rental work pays off. They hope to get to know the player by helping them rent. The player may buy later. He may use the same agent. The agent can make big money then. It could be hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Players also need to decide where to live.

Agents say Rams players might like certain places around Los Angeles. The places are popular with pro athletes. Manhattan Beach is one place. There are beautiful homes on the beach. It is near the airport. It is also near where the team will play. 

Other players will want to be near where they practice. They do not want to be late to practice. They have to pay the team money if they are late.
