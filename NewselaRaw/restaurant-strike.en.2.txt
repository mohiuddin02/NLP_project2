NEW YORK â€” A crowd of chanting workers gathered on Aug. 29 at a McDonald's in New York City demanding higher pay. Organizers said it was just the beginning of a day of protests that were to spread across the country.

About 500 people, including workers, activists, religious leaders, news crews and local politicians, showed up outside the McDonald's on Fifth Avenue. The protesters chanted "Si Se Puede" ("Yes, We Can" in Spanish) and "Hey, hey, ho, ho $7.25 has got to go."

Some held signs saying "On Strike: Can't Survive on $7.25."

Workers in all 50 states must be paid [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) of at least $7.25 per hour. The protesters want the minimum raised to $15. They also called for the chance to join a union, an organization of workers in a common field who bargain together for their wages and working conditions.

## Protests Expected To Spread

The protesters planned to spread out to other restaurants throughout New York during the day. Protests were also expected in 1,000 stores in 50 cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, N.C.

Meanwhile, a think-tank put a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal. The ad, by the Employment Policies Institute, shows a robot making pancakes. It explains that restaurants have to pay workers less to keep prices low. If wages get too high, they might need to use robots instead. The ad was called "in response to the protest."

The fast-food protests first began in New York on Nov. 29. There have been three protests in New York since then, and they have spread to Chicago and other cities.

Thursday's protest was to be the first for fast-food workers in Los Angeles and other cities.

## An Entire Industry Targeted

"This is our fourth strike in New York, and now we have 50 cities striking with us," said Tyeisha Batts, 27, one of the protesters. "I'm ready for a change," said Batts, who has worked in fast food for six years.

The protests come as more workers in blue- and white-collar jobs begin to stand up and demand better working conditions. But the fast-food protests are unique because they are not targeting one employer or company, but a whole industry.

In Chicago, for instance, workers were expected to strike at Wendy's, Subway and McDonald's outlets. In New York, they're to be at Wendy's and Burger King along with McDonald's.

Derrick Langley stood in front of the chanting crowds. The 27-year-old pointed to scars on his arms that he said came from cleaning the grill in the KFC restaurant where he works. He also has a second-degree burn on his right foot, he said.

## Fast-Food Workforce Has  Changed

"They don't seem to care," he said about his employers. "It's horrible how they manage us, how they talk to us, how they treat us. They don't respect us as human."

The fast-food workforce has changed over the years. The industry used to employ mostly younger people just trying to make pocket money. Now, workers are older and depend on the work to feed their families. Studies by the Economic Policies Institute show that the average age of minimum-wage workers is now 35, and that 88 percent are 20 and older.

"This morning, I'm out here taking a stand for all the fast-food workers around the world," Langley said. "If you're not going to stand up for yourselves, we will."
