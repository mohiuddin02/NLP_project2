NEW YORK â€” A doctor in New York has the deadly Ebola virus.

City officials had been worried for a long time that an Ebola patient would show up in the city.

It could quickly become a health disaster. There are 8.4 million people in the city. People there stand close together on subway cars. They bump into each other on crowded sidewalks.

The doctor had been treating Ebola patients in West Africa. A test showed that he had the virus a few days after he returned to New York.

The first people in the United States found to have Ebola were in Dallas, Texas. They had the virus last month. Mistakes were made in those cases. New York got ready.

## The Patient Was Taken Care Of Quickly

The doctor in New York is named Craig Allen Spencer. He was quickly taken to a hospital. He was separated from other people. The woman he is going to marry and his friends were quarantined. They are being kept from other people to make sure they do not spread the disease if they have it. His apartment was sealed. It was specially cleaned.

New York and New Jersey announced new rules. Anyone traveling from three West African nations who had direct contact with an Ebola patient would be quarantined. That includes health care workers.

Ebola was too serious to trust people to quarantine themselves, said New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo.

Spencer worked in Africa with the aid group Doctors Without Borders. He called the group on Thursday to report that he had a fever.

City officials said Spencer did not have signs of Ebola until Thursday morning. He was not contagious when he was out in the city earlier in the week. He could not spread the disease then.

## Neighbors Get Health Information

Neighbors gathered outside Spencer's Harlem neighborhood apartment building. Health crews sealed his apartment. They handed out Ebola information in English and Spanish.

Cleaners wearing protective suits and boots went into the apartment. They spent hours cleaning it.

Pedro Vanegas lives across the street from the apartment building.

"The truth is that I was surprised and worried when I found out last night," Vanegas said. "But I think the government is doing the best they can. They started cleaning the apartment immediately."

Others were not so sure. Some think people should be stopped from coming to the United States from West Africa. Ebola is believed to have killed more than 4,800 people in that region.

## New Rules For Travelers

Juan Perez's family lives down the block. He said his parents had not sent his younger sister to her school across the street. They were afraid that she could catch Ebola.

New York's mayor sent a Twitter photograph of himself riding a crowded subway car. He wanted to show New Yorkers that they did not need to worry.

U.S. medical officials have voluntary rules for people returning from areas that have Ebola cases. They say that they should stay completely away from other people for 21 days. They should also take their temperatures twice a day. It is believed that 21 days is as long as it can take Ebola to show up in a person.

But Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie disagreed. They came up with new rules. From now on, they said, health care workers and others who had direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will be made to spend 21 days in quarantine.

Officials at airports in New York and New Jersey will interview passengers coming from three West African countries. Then they will decide whether to quarantine those passengers.

"He's a doctor," Cuomo said of Spencer, and even he did not follow the guidelines for the quarantine. "So we have to do more."
