BEIJING â€” The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is almost over. A yellow submarine will make the last try to find it. The plane disappeared a month ago. It was traveling between the Asian countries of Malaysia and China.

Now, search parties are about to call off the searches on the ocean surface. Instead, they are sending a small submarine underwater. A submarine is like a boat that can go under the sea. Many submarines have people on board to steer them, but this submarine is a robot.

The robot submarine is called a "Bluefin-21." Australian technicians were ready to send it into the Indian Ocean Monday afternoon, near where they think the plane disappeared. They planned to send it 2.8 miles down to the floor of the ocean. It will look for any sign of the plane.

"It is time to go underwater," Angus Houston said. He is organizing the search from Perth, Australia.

## Search Could Take Two Months

Unless the submarine gets lucky, the search could take a while. The area it is searching is 600 square miles. That is larger than the city of Los Angeles. The U.S. Navy said it could take between six weeks and two months to map the area where the plane probably disappeared. The Navy loaned the Bluefin-21 to the search team.

The sub is 16 feet long and weighs 1,650 pounds. It moves about as fast as a person walking. Houston said the first day's work would cover about 15 square miles.

These searches "can take quite a bit of time," said David Kelly. He is president of Bluefin Robotics, which made the submarine.

The Bluefin-21 works on a 24-hour cycle. It takes two hours each way to get to the bottom of the ocean and back. It can search down there for 16 hours. Once it surfaces, it takes four hours to download the information it gathered. Then it has to get ready for its next dive.

The Bluefin-21 uses sonar to make a high-resolution 3-D map. It floats in pitch-black water about 150 feet above the sea floor. It scans a half-mile of the seabed below.

## Missing Plane Had 239 People Aboard

The sonar can be swapped out for high-definition cameras. When the cameras are on, the sub hovers just 15 feet off the seafloor. It takes a series of overlapping pictures. They are combined to make one big picture.

The sub is basically silent underwater. It cannot tell the search crew what it's found. It only sends back basic information like how deep it is and how much battery power it has left.

"You give it a track and it goes," said Charitha Pattiaratchi. He maps the ocean. The sub doesn't send any pictures "or anything while it's down there," he said.

The plane disappeared near Asia with 239 people aboard. Searchers were 1,300 miles off the western coast of Australia. They waited 38 days to send out the submarine. They were hoping to figure out where it could have landed.

A pinger locator towed by the searchers' boat picked up signals four times. Searchers think the signals came from the plane. But there have been no new signals for six days. The batteries on the locating tools from the plane only last 30 days.

## Nothing Found On Ocean Surface

Looking on the ocean surface hasn't been successful so far, either. Houston said that it would probably be called off in the next two to three days.

They have not found anything on the surface by now. So they probably will not in the future, Houston said. The chances are low. "Australia and its partners (will have) to decide the way ahead later this week," he said.

It's a "tough call to make," Van Gurley said. He is a retired U.S. Navy captain and works at Metron Inc. Metron helped find a French plane when it crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.

"It sounds like Angus Houston said some words to prepare everybody," he said. It should only be "a couple days" more. Then, no one will be searching by plane or by boat. They'll be searching with the robot sub.
