FORT MILL, South Carolina — For four years, Ed Currie worked to grow a new pepper. Finally, he gave it to a friend to sample.

"He took a bite and fell to his knees and threw up. I knew I had something," Currie said.

Currie created the hottest chili pepper in the world. It's called Smokin' Ed's Carolina Reaper.

He created the Reaper by combining two other extremely hot peppers. The process is known as crossbreeding.

## Winning The World Record

It took Currie 12 years of growing peppers before he finally took the world record. He tested hundreds of combinations before he found one that was hot enough.

A year ago, Guinness World Records officially called the Carolina Reaper the hottest pepper in the world.

To compare the heat of peppers, scientists use the Scoville heat scale. It's named after Wilbur Scoville. He was an American pharmacist who invented the scale in 1912.

Non-spicy peppers like bell peppers have 0 Scoville heat units (SHUs). Spicy jalapeños might reach 10,000 SHUs.

The Carolina Reaper? It reaches 1.56 million SHUs.

Chemists at Winthrop University in South Carolina have been measuring the heat of Currie's peppers for years. "Too darn hot for me to taste," said Cliff Calloway, a chemistry professor at Winthrop.

Calloway has tested the Reaper for more than five years. It's the hottest pepper he has ever seen. Even the smell of the pepper was too hot, Calloway said.

## Tasting The Reaper

The human body is tricked by the chemical "heat" from the Reaper. The body feels like it is being burned with a match, Calloway said.

Currie explained that chemicals called capsaicinoids in hot peppers attach to our taste buds.

"It tricks the body into thinking it's being burned," he said. "Your body signals that as heat."

Currie recently ate a whole Carolina Reaper. He was celebrating the one-year date since his Guinness world record. He said he eats eight to 10 extremely hot peppers each day.

"Agh ... I'm ... losing ... the ... ability ... to ... talk," Currie said, gasping.

His throat was on fire. His face was blood red. His eyes watered. He swallowed the rest of the Reaper. He gulped down cold water. "Eating them whole like that is just stupid," he said.

## Salsa And Hot Sauce

Currie, 51, first became fascinated with growing plants when he was a boy in Michigan. He read library books about plants and gardening magazines ordered by his mother, a master gardener.

Currie began to grow peppers after he read that they might reduce the risk of heart attacks and cancer. Both diseases run in his family.

In 2001, Currie moved to South Carolina. He began working at a bank. He made salsas and hot sauces at home from peppers he grew in his yard.

His hot peppers helped him meet his wife, who loves salsa. She convinced him to sell his salsas instead of giving them away to friends and neighbors.

Currie then opened a small booth at a flea market. Two years ago, he opened a store in Fort Mill. He quit his bank job so he could work full-time at his company.

Today, Currie's company is 8 years old. It sells salsa, hot sauce, chili seeds, chili jellies and sweets to customers worldwide.

## A Top-Secret Pepper

For now, the Carolina Reaper is officially the world's hottest pepper. Still, Currie has even hotter peppers.

In case anyone breaks his record, he's ready to take it right back. Currie has one top-secret pepper that he says reaches 2.83 million SHUs in scientific lab testing.

The new pepper "tastes awful," Currie said. "It has a few seconds of flavor. Then the heat builds and builds and just doesn't let up."

After eating one, Currie was in pain for 40 minutes, he said. He woke up hours later at 2 a.m. with terrible stomach pains.

Currie has eaten about 50 of the super-hot secret pepper.

Why?

"I'm stupid," he said.
