CHICAGO â€” Unless you live there, there aren't many reasons to visit East Garfield Boulevard on Chicago's South Side.

It's only a mile from the fancy University of Chicago campus. But this neighborhood is not doing well. The streets feel empty. Many of the stores have gone out of business.

Residents of this neighborhood are hoping that things will soon change. They are hoping that President Barack Obama will choose to build his presidential library in their area.

A president, after leaving office, traditionally builds a presidential library. More than a normal library, it is a museum and archive. It holds documents and souvenirs from a president's time in office. They are often built in a president's home town.

## An Inner-City First

Obama was born in Hawaii, but many believe that he will choose to build his library in Chicago. Both he and first lady Michelle Obama have personal and political connections here. Other possibilities include Honolulu and New York City.

The site of the library will be announced in early 2015.

There are at least five different groups in Chicago that want to host the library. They all believe the library will bring cultural benefits and new businesses with it.

Some see great potential in putting Obama's library in a struggling neighborhood.

The library could bring opportunity and inspiration to a poor neighborhood, according to Chicago sociologist Carol Adams.

"Kids could just be passing by and stop in," she said. "They wouldn't have to wait on school trips, with a presidential library just down the street from where they live," she said.

But no presidential library has been built in a low-income, inner-city neighborhood. Presidential library experts are not sure if building one could really help a struggling area.

"There could be a risk of crime, poverty or reputation," said Curt Smith, author of a book on presidential libraries.

He added that it's a generous thought to use a presidential library to help a neighborhood, but he reminded people to be careful. "You have to make sure you don't damage the library as a whole and end up not helping anyone," Smith said.

## A Downtown Transformed

Presidential libraries have helped cities and neighborhoods before.

The Clinton library in Little Rock, Ark., led to more than $2 billion in development along the downtown riverfront.

James "Skip" Rutherford is a friend of Bill Clinton's who helped plan the library.

"It has transformed downtown Little Rock and had a positive impact on housing," he said.

Choosing the right spot wasn't easy. At first, groups around the city suggested 40 possible sites. City officials chose five finalists.

Rutherford was part of a team who visited each site. They looked at many factors. They wanted a site that was easy to get to, with space for parking. They also wanted hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions nearby.

Clinton selected the old warehouse district downtown on the banks of the Arkansas River.

"The one chosen had an economic impact on the entire city," Rutherford said.

The area known as the River Market District now attracts more than 300,000 visitors a year. One reason is that there are other attractions, such as museums and entertainment venues, also in the area.

## Designing A Library

A good location is key, said Marshall Brown, professor of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology. A presidential library on its own can't always attract large numbers of people, he said.

Brown had his graduate students examine the possible sites for the library in Chicago. He also asked them to design their own ambitious plans for the campus.

Brown pointed to President John F. Kennedy's library in Boston as an example. The Kennedy library sits by itself on a peninsula sticking out into a bay.

"The (Kennedy) library, which has been sitting on Columbia Point in Boston since the 1980s, has attracted very little energy," Brown said.
