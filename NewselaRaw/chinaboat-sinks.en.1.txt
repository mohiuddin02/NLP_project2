The Eastern Star capsized on the Yangtze River Monday night with 458 people aboard. At least 15 people were brought to safety during a frantic rescue effort, including three pulled from the overturned hull Tuesday, and five people were confirmed dead, the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency reported.

The vessel was carrying mostly elderly tourists from Nanjing to the southwestern city of Chongqing, and overturned in China's Hubei province.

## Rescuers Search For Those Trapped Inside

Divers rescued a 65-year-old woman and, later, two men who had been trapped, state broadcaster CCTV reported. It said more people had been found and were being rescued, but did not say whether they were still inside the overturned hull.

CCTV video showed rescuers in orange life vests climbing on the hull. One of them lay down on the boat, tapped with a hammer and listened for a response, then gestured downward.

"We will do everything we can to rescue everyone trapped in there, no matter they're still alive or not, and we will treat them as our own families," Hubei military region commander Chen Shoumin said.

The survivors included the ship's captain and chief engineer, both of whom were taken into police custody, CCTV said. Relatives who gathered in Shanghai, where many of the tourists started their journey, questioned whether the captain did enough to ensure the passengers' safety. They also demanded answers from local officials in angry and disorderly scenes that drew a heavy police response.

## Captain, Engineer Say Cyclone Caught Ship

Xinhua quoted the captain and the chief engineer as saying the four-level Eastern Star sank quickly after being caught in what they described as a cyclone. The People's Daily newspaper said the ship sank within two minutes.

Zhang, the tour guide, said in an interview from his hospital bed that he grabbed a life jacket with seconds to spare as the ship listed in the storm. The motion of the ship sent bottles rolling off tables, he said, and then suddenly it turned all the way over.

The 43-year-old Zhang said he drifted in the Yangtze all night despite not being able to swim, reaching shore as dawn approached.

"The raindrops hitting my face felt like hailstones," Zhang said, adding that he told himself to just hang on a little longer.

## Some Survivors Swim To Shore

Some survivors swam ashore. Others were rescued after search teams climbed on the upside-down hull and heard people yelling for help from inside, more than 12 hours after the ship overturned.

Thirteen navy divers were on the scene and 170 more were joining them, Chen said.

The 65-year-old woman was rescued by divers who took extra breathing apparatus up into the ship. They spent about five minutes teaching her how to use it before bringing her out to safety, Chen said.

That woman "had a very strong will and learned very fast, and after 20 minutes she surfaced to the water and was rescued," he added.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang traveled to the accident site.

The overturned ship had drifted almost 2 miles downstream before coming to rest close to shore, where fast currents made the rescue difficult.

## Ship Floats Downstream, Indicating Some Air Left Inside

The fact that the capsized ship drifted downstream was a good sign for rescuers because it meant there was enough air inside to give it buoyancy. It could also mean enough air was left for survivors to breathe, said Park Chi-mo, a professor of naval architecture and ocean engineering at South Korea's Ulsan University.

"It all depends how much space there is inside the vessel," Park said.

CCTV said the ship had been carrying 406 Chinese passengers, five travel agency employees and a crew of 47, most of whom were 50 to 80 years old.

The relatives of the boat passengers gathered in Shanghai at a travel agency that had booked many of the trips. They later went to a government office to demand more information about the accident before police broke up the gatherings.

## Families Await News On Relatives

Huang Yan, 49, an accountant in Shanghai, wept as she told a reporter that she believes that her husband, 49, and his father, who is in his 70s, were aboard. But she said she couldn't be sure because she hadn't seen a passenger list yet.

"Why did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?" Huang shouted. "We want the government to release the name list to see who was on the boat."

A group of about a dozen retirees from a Shanghai bus company were on the trip, said a woman. Among them, she said, were her older sister and brother-in-law, both 60, and their 6-year-old granddaughter.

"This group has traveled together a lot, but only on short trips. This is the first time they traveled for a long trip," Chen said.

## Yangtze River Known To Flood During Summer

The ship sank in the Damazhou waterway section, where the river is 50 feet deep. The Yangtze is the world's third-longest river and sometimes floods during the summer rainy season.

More than 50 boats and 3,000 people were involved in the search.

The Eastern Star was 251 feet long and 36 feet wide, and could carry a maximum of 534 people, CCTV reported. It is owned by the Chongqing Eastern Shipping Corp., which focuses on tourism routes in the popular Three Gorges river canyon region. The company could not be reached for comment.

CCTV reported that 6 inches of rain had fallen in the region in the past 24 hours. Local media reported winds reached 80 miles per hour during the accident.
