Camille Galli had the perfect dress for her big night â€” a fancy high school dance called a prom. It was one part of growing up that Camille wasn't always sure she would get to experience.

Camille has autism. Like many people with autism, she has a hard time communicating and understanding people's feelings, and often struggles in social situations.

Camille's path to the prom began last year. Her older sister, Bella, was getting dressed up for her prom. Frustrated, Camille started tapping out a message on the electronic device she uses to communicate.

"Why am I not going to prom?" the 16-year-old asked.

## Raising Money For The Prom

Camille's 14-year-old sister, Frankie, couldn't forget those words. She teamed up with Lauren Etherton, a 17-year-old whose brother also has autism. The girls decided to make sure that their siblings could enjoy a prom designed with their needs in mind.

This prom would still have a disco ball and delicious food. However, there would also be a quiet room where students could calm down if the chaos of the dance floor got to be too much.

Frankie's sister and Lauren's brother both attend the Kennedy Krieger School for children with developmental disabilities. The girls shared their idea with teachers at the school. Then they invited their friends to help and divided up the prom-planning responsibilities.

Frankie and her family put together a fundraiser at a local exercise studio, where people donated money to take a special exercise class. The event raised $11,000, which was enough to pay for food and prom activities at a fancy building called Somerset House. They even had enough money left over to pay for next year's prom, too.

## Practicing For The Prom

Volunteers visited the Kennedy Krieger School several times before prom night. To help get students ready for the big event, Frankie and her classmates made videos about proper table manners. They taught students some dance steps they could use on prom night and talked about how to ask someone to dance.

Principal Joanna Sandusky said teachers at Kennedy Krieger also worked the prom into their lesson plans.

"We've been practicing dancing," she said. "We've been practicing being part of a bigger group because that can be extremely challenging for a lot of our students."

Kennedy Krieger staff said all that prom practice made a big difference for their students. They started noticing changes before the big event even took place. Students became more comfortable participating in school events like pep rallies. Social skills like greeting a person to start a conversation also improved.

"I've seen a lot of growth in our students," said Maria Papageorgiou, a speech and language teacher. She pointed out that the prom was not just a fun way to keep students engaged. The challenge has benefits that will carry over into students' everyday lives. "It's a very meaningful way to teach," she said.

## Making Silly Moves To The Music

On prom night, teenage volunteers mixed into the crowd, inviting the Kennedy Krieger students to dance, take photos and enjoy the food. They wanted to make sure everyone joined in the fun. Teachers were also on hand to take students into the quiet room if they needed a break from all the excitement.

Jaleel, 21, will graduate from Kennedy Krieger in two weeks. He said he'd been looking forward to "girls and food" more than anything else. As soon as he arrived, a young blond volunteer in a black dress posed for a photo with him. Then he headed for the appetizers.

Lauren's brother, Justin, 19, was also having a blast. Seeing his friend Matthew playing with a light-up toy handed out by the DJ, he pointed and yelled, "Guys! Guys! Get a photo of this. Look at Matthew!"

Justin made his way to the photo booth, where Lauren tried to tease him into picking up a fake mustache when they took a sheet of silly pictures together. He chopped her playfully with a plastic axe instead. "Oh my gosh, I'm so happy," Lauren gushed after taking the photo. "A lot of the kids who normally don't participate are participating. They're up dancing!"

Meanwhile, Frankie kept inviting Kennedy Krieger students to dance. They didn't always want to, but she threw herself into the music, moving her arms and legs like crazy. Sometimes, she got a dance partner to pick up his feet and imitate her silly moves.

Frankie said she was delighted and moved to see her friends trying just as hard to give students with autism a special night.

"Seeing my friends bond with all these people is the greatest experience," she said.
