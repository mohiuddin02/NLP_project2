SOCHI, Russia — After a remarkable showing at the costliest Olympics ever, Russia celebrated. Seventeen days of sports and global unity came to a close on Sunday night with a grand farewell show.

The rowdy crowd chanted "Ro-ssi-ya! Ro-ssi-ya!" — "Russia! Russia!" — before being surrounded by fireworks and carried through a visually stunning overview of Russian history.

The closing ceremony started at 20:14 local time. The time was a nod to the year 2014, which President Vladimir Putin has seized upon to remake Russia's image. He has wanted to use the Olympics' power to wow and direct global attention onto his country.

"Now we can see our country is very friendly," said Boris Kozikov of St. Petersburg, Russia. "This is very important for other countries around the world to see."

## An Old Town Transformed

The money Russia spent on the games was the most in history. The huge sum transformed Sochi from an old resort town on the Black Sea into a household name. It showcased how far Russia has come. Just two decades ago the country began to allow greater freedoms for its people. But the Olympic show didn't win over those with complaints against Russia. Under Putin, some say Russia has gone backward on democracy, human rights and its treatment of gays.

One of Sochi's big successes was safety. Terrorists threatened to target the games, but the feared attacks didn't come to pass.

The president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) praised the Sochi organizers. "It's amazing what has happened here," Thomas Bach said a few hours before the ceremony.

As dusk fell, Russians and international visitors streamed into the stadium. The ceremony featured the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.

Russia celebrated its gifts to music and literature in the ceremony. Performers in puffy white wigs pushed 62 grand pianos around the stadium floor. Meanwhile, a pianist played music from Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.

There was also ballet, for which Russia is famous. Dancers from two of the world's oldest ballet companies performed. The faces of Russian authors through the ages were projected onto enormous screens.

## Russia's Medal Turnaround

Athletes said goodbye to other athletes from far-off places. Some looked ahead to the 2018 Winter Games at Pyeongchang in South Korea.

Winners of Russia's record 13 gold medals marched into the stadium. They carried Russia's white, blue and red flag, which was raised alongside the Olympic flag. Athletes streamed by their hundreds into the stadium, dancing and taking "selfies," pictures of themselves, with their phones. Earlier, giant screens flashed highlights of their Olympic feats.

Six athletes were absent, however. They failed their drug tests. The IOC ran 2,631 tests to catch athletes using drugs that can help them perform better. It was the most tests ever run in a Winter Olympics.

Putin smiled as he stood beside Bach, and he had reason to be pleased.

Russia's athletes topped the Sochi medals table, both in golds and total — 33. It was a stunning turnaround from the 2010 Vancouver Games. There, it won just three golds and 15 total. People began doubting Russia's winter sports power. This time, Russia's bag of Sochi gold was the biggest haul since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was a group of republics controlled by Russia. It's breakup gave many Eastern European and Central Asian countries their freedom.

## Cool-As-Ice Gold Medalist

Russia's golden run started with its victory in team figure skating.

Russia's last gold came Sunday in the four-man bobsled. The games' highlight for home fans was Adelina Sotnikova. Cool as ice at 17, she became Russia's first gold medalist in women's Olympic figure skating.

"The success of the home team is always an important part of the success of the games overall," Bach said.

Not all of the news out of Sochi was about sport. An outspoken female punk rock group tried to play in public. Security forces whipped them. Organizers faced complaints going in about Russia's harsh treatment of gays. And during the last days of the games, violence flared in Ukraine, Russia's neighbor.

In an interview on Saturday, Bach singled out Ukraine's victory in the women's biathlon relay. He called it "really an emotional moment" of the games. He praised Ukrainian athletes for staying to take part in the games even though many had just died in protests back home.

"Seeing your capital burning, and feeling this responsibility, and then winning the gold medal," he said, "this really stands out for me."
