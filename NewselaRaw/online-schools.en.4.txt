DAYTON, Ohio â€” Kelsey Hooten had been afraid to start the seventh grade. She was bullied the year before when she was in sixth grade.

Her mom is Krista Hooten. She knew something had to be done when she saw "terror" in her daughter Kelsey's eyes. And all they were doing was a bit of back-to-school shopping.

It started in the sixth grade with other girls calling her ugly. They also said bad things about her to other kids. But then it became physical. [Bullies](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying) pulled her hair on the bus and shoved her to the ground.

"It changed her personality," Krista Hooten said. "It was a horrible, horrible year."

## Pulled From Public School

Hooten and her husband decided it was time to make a change. They pulled Kelsey from public school. Then they put her in an online school called the Ohio Virtual Academy. In the new school, she can take all her classes from home.

Bullying in school is a big problem. One-third of all U.S. children are targeted each year. That is around 13 million students.

Krista Hooten said her daughter did not tell her just how much she was being bullied.

This was true even when the attacks became physical. The teenager acted "like she was dealing with it and it wasn't that big a deal," Hooten said.

"All I knew at that point was she didn't want to go" to school. When Kelsey left in the morning, "she cried all the way to the bus stop," she said.

Hooten talked to her daughter's teachers. But all they said was that Kelsey should "find another group of friends."

Kelsey is now 16 and in 10th grade. She said she has not been bullied since she started attending the Ohio Virtual Academy.

## Cyberbullying Is Also A Problem

The academy was created in 2006. It now has more than 12,600 students.

While the academy is good at protecting students from bullying, so far it has not been that good at educating them. Students are doing very badly on tests. And more than half cannot finish in four years.

Bullying has always been a problem, of course. But it is even more of a problem today. This is because kids spend so much time online. And some kids bully other kids online. The name for this new kind of bullying is "cyberbullying."

"Because of cyberbullying, students can't escape" bullying, said expert Susan Davies. "It's not something that's just happening at school. They're being targeted in their home when they're not even around other kids."

Cyberbullying does happen at the Ohio Virtual Academy. Kristin Stewart is the head of the school. She says the school is tough on bullying. It has kicked out and suspended students for bullying.

The academy trains its teachers to look for signs of bullying. Stewart said she thinks bullying is caught sooner than usual at the school. This is "because the teachers are online with students."

## Meeting Other Students Online

Students who have been bullied need time to get over the bullying. It can take a while before they trust other students again, Stewart said.

But once they do, "we have blogs and Facebook where kids can go online and meet each other." They are "in their homes and they're feeling safe. They can move at their own pace."

Students also choose the school for reasons other than bullying.

Hooten's two other daughters also attend the Ohio Virtual Academy. Lexie, 14, started so she could spend more time on her dancing. Hannah, 11, started there because she was missing many days of school because of her asthma.

Next year Kelsey will begin taking college courses.

Her mother said things got better for Kelsey almost as soon as she left public school.

"She was just happier again," she said.
