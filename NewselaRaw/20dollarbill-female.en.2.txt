WASHINGTON â€” The group that wants to replace President Andrew Jackson with a woman on the $20 bill has revealed its final four candidates. More than 256,000 votes were placed on possible candidates.

Former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt made the finals. So did Harriet Tubman, who campaigned against slavery, and civil rights activist Rosa Parks. Wilma Mankiller, the first woman elected chief of a major Native American tribe, is also on the list. Voting for the winner is now open. The group behind the push, Women on 20s, has not yet decided when to end the voting.

The group's original list of 100 names was sliced down to 60 through informal discussion. A survey was used to cut the list to 30. Women's history experts helped pick 15 from that list. The public was then able to choose its three favorites from the list of 15 candidates. People on the list also included women's rights supporters Betty Friedan and Susan B. Anthony, who led to push for women to be allowed to vote. Rachel Carson, who worked to save the environment, was also in the final 15.

## "The Most Recognizable Names"

Women on 20s said that Roosevelt, Tubman and Parks received the most votes. Mankiller was on the list of 30 but not the list of 15 that the public voted on. The group said she  was selected for the final ballot "by popular demand" and "strong public sentiment that people should have the choice of a Native American to replace Andrew Jackson."

The group wants to change the $20 bill not only because the year 2020 will be the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted voting rights to women. It is also going after the $20 because President Jackson helped pass the Indian Removal Act of 1830. The law forced Native American tribes off their lands in and made them move far away during what is commonly referred to as the Trail of Tears.

Susan Ades Stone is the group's executive director. She said in an interview that they were not surprised by the three women whose names received the most votes.

"They are probably the most recognizable names, and the ones that have been taught, to some degree, in schools," Stone said. "But they are also all seen as heroic in some way. I think that's what people want: Someone who can be representative for women." She also said people want somebody who has "touched everyone's lives."

Stone said the group hopes to talk with the White House within the next few weeks. She does not know whether they will wait to formally reach out to the White House until a winner is named. They may allow the voting to continue, in hopes White House support and attention could launch even more interest and voting.

## "People's Opportunity To Be Heard"

"It's possible the president will want to hear from more people," Stone said. "We don't want to prematurely cut off people's opportunity to be heard."

The Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing website says that the treasury secretary is responsible for selecting the pictures of people that will appear on dollar bills. According to U.S. law, only a person who is dead may appear on U.S. money.

Stone said they decided to go to the White House instead of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to try to get more attention for the conversation about women being equal to men. The group also did not propose anything that might get Congress involved. For example, the group did not suggest a new bill that would be worth a different amount of money than current bills.

If the White House and Treasury actually do support the idea, Stone said, there would then be committees to choose who would be on the bill and what the bill would look like. The person who wins the group's vote will not necessarily be the person on the bill, she said.

The men featured on current U.S. bills have not changed since 1929.
