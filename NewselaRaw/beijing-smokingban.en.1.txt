China's Communist Party has practiced the art of public shaming for years.

China has had a Communist government since 1949. When people have done or said something the government disapproves of, they have been known to disappear for a time. Then they reappear after publicly denouncing themselves on state-run television stations. Business leaders, celebrities and news reporters who have been imprisoned by the party have turned up regularly from behind prison bars to speak about their misdeeds. These displays of shame are one of the many ways the government pushes people to follow its rules.

Now officials are using the tactic on another group that it feels has wronged the country: smokers.

## Indoor Spaces Become Restricted

This week, the capital city of Beijing banned smoking in indoor public spaces and workplaces. The city unfurled giant "Stop Smoking" banners over Beijing's famous Bird's Nest sports stadium. The city also advised people to use an elaborate set of hand signals to tell others to stop smoking, and increased fines for smoking in restricted areas.

With more than 300 million smokers — nearly as many people as live in the United States — China is the world's largest tobacco consumer. The government estimates that another 740 million of its citizens are exposed to second-hand smoke and that more than 1 million people in the country die from smoking-related diseases each year.

## Smoking Shaming Moves Online

In 2008, as part of its clean-up campaign for the Olympic Games, the capital of Beijing for the first time required public places like restaurants, bars and hotels to provide smoke-free areas or rooms.

Back then, the consequences could be harsh for businesses that did not follow the new smoking rules, with fines as high as $725. For individuals, though, the consequences were far less strict. Fines for individuals who smoked in non-smoking areas were only as much as 10 renminbi, or about $1.40 at that time.

That has now changed. The government has announced it will increase the fine for individuals to 200 yuan, or about $32. The government will also begin posting the names of people who break the smoking ban three times on the Internet. Public shaming has been taken online.

## Peer Reaction Can Be Harsh

Outing lawbreaking smokers online may not sound like a big deal. The reaction of online citizens to inappropriate behavior can be harsh, however, especially in Asia. In 2005, a woman in South Korea refused to clean up her dog's waste and was caught in photos that were posted online. Internet users quickly figured out who she was and she was harassed so badly that she reportedly left her university.

In China, shaming has actually been used by citizens to punish wrongdoing of all kinds. For example, online citizens have exposed and shamed government officials who steal money, and hit-and-run drivers have been identified.

In the past, the government has expressed concerns that shaming on the Internet could lead to "cyberviolence" and privacy violations. China heavily censors what its citizens can access online. Now it looks like it has reversed course, at least when it comes to smokers.
