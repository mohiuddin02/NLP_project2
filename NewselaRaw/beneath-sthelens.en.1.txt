TACOMA, Wash. — Ever since Mount St. Helens' cataclysmic eruption 34 years ago this month, scientists have been tracking the volcano's explosive energy. The goal: to better understand how Washington's most active volcano works.

This summer, the scientists will be the ones setting off the explosions.

Researchers are preparing to set off explosive charges buried in two dozen 80-foot-deep wells drilled around the mountain. They'll record the seismic energy of the explosions on thousands of portable seismometers placed by an army of volunteers traveling by car, on foot and on horseback.

Their goal is to see with greater clarity the details of how molten rock, or magma, makes its way to St. Helens' crater. It bubbles up from the area where tectonic plates collide and the magma is created, some 60 miles beneath the surface.

"We've been looking at what's beneath the volcano through very fuzzy glasses," said Seth Moran, a seismicity expert with the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascade Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington. "This still won't give us anything like 20/20 vision, but it should make things quite a bit clearer."

## iMUSH Experiments

The explosive experiments scheduled for this summer are one part of experiments collectively called iMUSH for "Imaging Magma Under St. Helens." Together, they make up one of the most complete series of imaging experiments ever conducted on any volcano, say researchers.

The $3 million project involves scientists from several universities.

In addition to the explosive testing, specialists in other disciplines are preparing for experiments using enhanced receptors for naturally occurring seismic activity. They'll also examine the magnetic and electrical properties of rock deep beneath the volcano, which scientists say is a useful guide to identifying magma.

The goal is to "see" deep below St. Helens to the area where the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate from the Pacific is forced under the North American plate. When one plate slides under another it is called subduction. This Cascade "subduction zone" also is the area that can produce magnitude-9 earthquakes when the plates slip or break.

Magma from this zone makes its way to the surface in Northwest volcanoes, but exactly how that happens remains a mystery despite more than three decades of research.

Scientists have a good sense of what's beneath the volcano down to a depth of about 6 miles, Moran said. There are many theories about what's going on in deeper reaches, but nobody has been able to prove one.

## Questions To Answer

Does the magma pool in a reservoir at the crust? Does it make its way upward in a single, narrow pipelike passage? Or does it collect in one or more underground ponds along the way?

Finding answers is important, scientists say, because it will enable them to better interpret the volcano's signals when magma is on the move. That knowledge, they say, will help them predict eruptions not only at St. Helens but also at other volcanoes in the Cascades and around the world — and possibly save many thousands of lives.

"It's long been looked at by individual disciplines," Moran said. "All of them have their own resolution issues and error issues, plus they're all measuring different kinds of things."

By combining the strengths of the various imaging methods, he said, individual weaknesses will be filtered out.

"By throwing multiple things at this, we'll have a better sense of the whole," he said.

Moran and other Geological Survey analysts confirmed last month that St. Helens remains active. While an eruption is not near, the analysis showed a new supply of magma is slowly repressurizing the magma chamber beneath the mountain.

## A Seismicity Superstar

Steve Malone, now a University of Washington professor, was a seismicity superstar when St. Helens erupted 34 years ago. He is participating in the iMush studies.

Scientists did not foresee St. Helens' unusual sideways blast on May 18, 1980. But thanks to Malone and others, they were able to roughly predict when the eruption would occur and thereby saved many lives.

Fifty-seven people died in the 1980 eruption, which devastated 150 square miles of southwestern Washington and sent up an eruption cloud that reached the stratosphere.

Malone and other scientists are meeting to design 70 enhanced seismic stations that will be installed up to 30 miles from the mountain for tests that will measure natural seismicity.

The thousands of smaller seismometers that will be used in the explosive testing are slightly smaller than a can of tennis balls. Each run off two D-cell batteries, Moran said.

"You can put 15 of them in a backpack," he said.

Even so, installing 2,600 seismometers in the rugged and roadless areas close to the volcano will take a lot of labor.

An "army of volunteers," will be needed, said Carolyn Driedger, a scientist and spokeswoman at the Cascades Volcano Observatory.

## "Living On The Edge"

The public's involvement in the iMUSH project has value of its own, independent of the scientific goals, Driedger said.

"It's good because it involves people in studying the world in which they live," she said. "Here in the Pacific Northwest we are literally living on the edge. It's not a stable place. We have land being shoved beneath us, right under our feet. We have magma being formed right now. We have rocks that are crunching together that will eventually slip and create earthquakes."

She added, "Getting people out there helps them to recognize that these changes are happening."

Driedger and others draw comparisons between Mount Rainier in Washington and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, where 23,000 people were buried in a volcanic mud flow, or lahar, when the mountain erupted in 1985.

Rainier is considered the most dangerous volcano in America, not for its eruptive force but because of the lahars its eruptions are almost certain to generate.
