NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” Soon after customers arrive at Mozzeria for the first time, they notice that something's different about the restaurant: Nearly every worker is deaf.

Owners Russ and Melody Stein are also deaf, and have run their San Francisco restaurant since 2011. The business is thriving because customers love the food and the Steins have overcome obstacles deaf people can face when they become small business owners. They have had to deal with lingering bias and prejudice, and fewer resources than hearing business owners.

"We have the same skills as a hearing individual," Russ Stein said.

Running Mozzeria comes naturally to Melody Stein, whose family is in the restaurant business.

"It's something I've always wanted to do," she said.

## A Growing Interest In Entrepreneurship

Deaf people have the same ambition and ability to own their own businesses as those who can hear, said Tom Baldridge. He is the director of the business administration program at Gallaudet University, the largest educational institution serving the deaf and hard of hearing. There's a growing interest among Gallaudet students in entrepreneurship, or starting a business, something that is seen at business schools across the country. The university is expanding its entrepreneurship offerings beyond just classes, and giving students experience in running businesses like campus coffee shops.

"A lot is happening right now beyond a few courses in entrepreneurship. We've hired a consultant who's going to guide us (and) infuse corporate entrepreneurship into all the academic disciplines," Baldridge said.

The hearing world is still catching up to the idea of deaf business owners. The Steins have encountered discrimination from people who hear and don't want to make accommodations to help those who are deaf or hard of hearing.

For example, the couple has run into resistance when they asked for help at local government offices, including when they were trying to get permits to open the restaurant.

"We have had our rough moments," Russ Stein said. "There have been times when I had to ask for interpreters, and I was made fun of. I was looked down upon."

## Most Vendors Adapt

Restaurant suppliers and other business owners who can hear are often startled or feel awkward when they first meet the couple. Some have assumed that because the Steins are deaf, they didn't know what they were doing, Russ Stein said. Some have been impatient about writing down what they want to say, or have said offensive or inappropriate things.

"People ask, 'how do you drive?'" Stein said.

But most vendors adapt to working with the Steins, such as Mozzeria's wine seller who has even helped them learn more about the restaurant business.

And customers, most of whom can hear, seem happy to write their questions about items on the menu. Some seem awkward when they first come in, but they soon relax and enjoy their meals.

"They learn to overcome their fear," Melody Stein said.

## She Wanted A Fashion Career

Many deaf owners have dealt with this kind of prejudice. Hearing people have told them that the best careers for deaf people are teaching or counseling other deaf people.

Mara Ladines, who owns By Mara, a clothing manufacturer and store in New York, wanted a career in fashion design. But some counselors in college tried to steer her toward a job that would require less communication with others.

"They believed a deaf individual can't get a job in the fashion industry." she said.

Ladines insisted on taking design courses and got jobs at clothing companies, including H&amp;M. In 2008, she began designing T-shirts and other clothes with a logo that shows the American Sign Language sign for "I love you." She started the business online and it has grown to the point where she could open her store last spring; many of the people who walk in are hearing, and Ladines is able to communicate with them and make sales.

Ladines wants to keep building her business, but she's frustrated by a lack of money. She wants to find an adviser who understands the deaf culture.

"It seems that most hearing individuals don't understand that a deaf individual can own a business," she said. "I feel I was born as a natural business owner."

## Technology Has Been Helpful, But It's Also A Barrier

With email a central part of any business, deaf owners communicate with vendors, bankers, customers and government offices. The Internet makes phone service easier. Free services, like video relays, allow deaf people to communicate in sign language with an interpreter who then speaks to a hearing person via phone.

The Small Business Administration (SBA), a government agency that helps small businesses, started a videophone service this year. It lets deaf owners communicate through sign language with SBA employees, which makes it easier to get help and information about loans and other services. Previously, owners had to use other services that were slower and didn't offer the human contact video relay does.

But owners say the Internet could be much more helpful. Few videos and online seminars designed for small business owners have captioned or sign language interpreters. It's frustrating to Melissa Greenlee, who runs deaffriendly.com, a website that helps deaf people find services and companies that accommodate their needs.

"While technology has been a wonderful advancement for our community in so many ways, it also has been my biggest barrier to advancement," she said.
