Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told the world last week that he is gay.

Technology companies in California's Silicon Valley have been fighting for gay rights in the United States for years, and Cook's announcement may push them to the front of global struggles for equality.

Cook's disclosure, made in an essay for Bloomberg Businessweek, was about far more than his own sexuality. It was a declaration that a business leader is not defined by whom he dates. It announced that companies can innovate whether the chief executive is gay or straight, and that the tech industry is at its finest when its leaders are their true authentic selves.

"Everyone is saying, 'Look at the most valuable company on the planet, and it's run by a gay man,'" gay-rights activist Chris Sinton said. "Maybe someday,  some kid in Russia will read that and change his view on what sexuality is and what a gay person can accomplish."

## An Opportunity "To Get More Involved"

Tech companies are some of the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the world. After Cook's announcement, they have a new opportunity to support equality. Their influence may be valuable in countries such as Russia and Pakistan, where gays and lesbians are discriminated against — or worse.

"These big tech companies have offices overseas," gay-rights activist Leanne Pittsford said. They "sell products in places where there are not only not enough women as business role models but definitely not a lot of lesbian role models." Cook's announcement, she said, could motivate tech companies "to get more involved overseas."

Fighting for gay rights around the world may be a natural next step for the tech community. Many tech companies, which often are staffed by highly educated young people, have a very open-minded attitude toward gay people.

## Parades, Campaigns And Benefits

Tech companies have championed gay rights more openly and aggressively than most other kinds of companies. Apple, for example, marches in the annual San Francisco Pride parade. Google has its Legalize Love campaign, which promotes gay rights in countries where homosexuality is illegal. Tech companies were offering benefits for same-sex partners in the 1980s, when such benefits were unheard of almost everywhere else.

"Technology as an industry has always been based on early adopters and innovators," said gay-rights activist Jonathan Lovitz. "So they are likely to be ahead of the curve on social policy. You're watching banks and law firms that are now playing catch-up with the tech sector, which has been way out in front."

Leading tech companies, including Google and Apple, rank high on the Human Rights Watch equality index, which tracks how companies treat gay workers. Tech also has one of the highest percentages of workers who say they feel comfortable telling coworkers they are gay.

## Openness Is Growing

Researcher Christie Smith says that part of the reason for tech's openness is that tech leaders tend to be more honest about themselves than executives in other industries. Before Cook's announcement, a number of prominent tech leaders had already come out as gay. Among them are Megan Smith, who oversaw Google's experimental projects and recently joined the White House as chief technology officer of the United States; Peter Thiel, PayPal cofounder and billionaire investor; Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator; Wesley Chan, an early Google product manager and a major investor in tech startups; and Nancy Vitale, an executive at Genentech.

Even the technology these companies create — social media networks, dating apps, video-sharing platforms — has helped to reduce intolerance and homophobia. In an information-driven culture, everyone has seen a LGBT group's Facebook page or a "coming out" video on YouTube.

"Once you have the Internet of people connecting with each other, and whether that's on Facebook or people connecting on apps, you can't reverse that," said Kenji Yoshino, a New York University professor who is writing a book on this topic. "You can't unring that bell. The fact that gay people exist is everywhere, and you have to decide whether or not you're going to treat them as brothers and sisters. And I think tech — Google, Facebook and Apple — had a lot to do with that."

## The Long Road To Tolerance

However, there's still plenty of work to be done to promote tolerance in Silicon Valley, activists say.

While tech companies have embraced the gay community, they have done little to bring more women, blacks and Latinos into their workforce. Apple's employees, for example, are 70 percent male and 55 percent white.

Still, Cook's announcement may provide inspiration to many both inside and outside the tech world.

"This sends a social message," diversity consultant Jennifer Brown said. Cook's announcement is a reminder that the leaders of most large companies are still straight white men, and that there is still more work to be done, she said.
