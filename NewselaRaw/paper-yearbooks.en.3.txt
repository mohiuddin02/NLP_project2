CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Students at Prospect High School set aside their smartphones and tablets for a few moments. Instead of reading on a screen, they read the paper pages in their yearbooks.

With social media, like Facebook, "the pictures and messages we post kind of go up, and then they go away," said Caroline Chengary. She is a high school senior and the editor of the Prospect High School yearbook.

She said hard-copy yearbooks are something "that you can keep with you, and look back at when you're older."

Surprisingly, many high school students don't want digital yearbooks. They still like hardcover yearbooks better.

## Students Prefer Hard Copies

Students, teachers and other experts agree that hard-copy yearbooks remain very popular with students.

It seems a bit unusual. Because of improvements in technology, that fewer textbooks are being printed. Yet this is not true for yearbooks. Yearbook sales have stayed high over the past five years. Experts say it is because class sizes have been getting larger at schools.

Kevin Miller works at a company that makes yearbooks. He said that his company had tried making digital yearbooks. But the company decided to stop making digital yearbooks because students wanted hard copies. He said there's something special "to actually feel the book in your hand."

## Tagging Photos With Video Links

That is not to say the yearbook hasn't changed.

Some high schools use technology in their hardcover yearbooks. The technology uses smartphone apps. The yearbook tags photos with links to videos of special events. The smartphone app can then be used to watch the videos that are linked to those pictures. The videos may show clips from the prom or an exciting football game, for example.

Experts still think that many high school students will want the traditional style of yearbook. They say technology may change, but books can last forever.

## "It's Always Exciting"

Pete Macabobby works at Wheaton Warrenville South High School. He helps students put together the school yearbook. He said that last year the school sold 1,300 yearbooks. The yearbook is made by 10 students who are in the yearbook club.

The students want a traditional yearbook, Macabobby said. He also thinks that views toward technology are changing. He believes that today's students do not want to use technology all of the time.

New Trier High School has a special ceremony each year for seniors. The school has a jazz band perform while students gather to write in each other's yearbooks.

Kevin Bond works at New Trier High School. He says that yearbook sales there are as strong as they've ever been. He also said that many students he has talked to still want to read hardcover or paperback books.

At Prospect High, junior Brady Schwartz smiled as he picked up his yearbook. "It's always exciting to see your pictures in the yearbook," he said. "And when the yearbooks are handed out, you know it's that much closer to the end of the school year."
