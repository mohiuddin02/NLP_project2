NEW YORK â€” Valery Gergiev is a famous and respected Russian music conductor. He leads orchestras of musicians to make beautiful, classical music. Still, not everyone likes Gergiev. He is friends with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a leader who is disliked by many people.

Gergiev travels the world, conducting operas, ballets and orchestras. He was in the United States last month. Protesters followed him almost everywhere.

In New York, Ukrainian protesters stood in the cold outside the Metropolitan Opera. They held signs. Some wrote phrases like "GERGIEV supports WAR in UKRAINE." Another wrote "DON'T PLAY PUTIN'S TUNE."

## Conducting Music

In 2014, fighting broke out between Ukrainian soldiers and rebels in eastern Ukraine. The rebels want their part of Ukraine to join Russia. Putin has been supporting the rebels. This has made many people in Ukraine and Europe angry.

Russia and Ukraine used to be in one country, called the Soviet Union. They became separate countries when the Soviet Union broke up more than 20 years ago. Now, some Ukrainians fear that Russia wants to take their country again.

Gergiev supports Putin, which upsets many people. Some artists have refused to perform with him. He was banned from a German festival. Still, Gergiev says he is too busy for politics. He says music is what's important to him.

Gergiev conducts music all over the world. He leads the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. It's famous for holding ballet, opera and orchestra performances.

He's also busy in other countries. He has been the music director of the London Symphony Orchestra. Next he will move to the Munich Philharmonic in Germany. He travels to classical music festivals all over the world: Finland, Sweden, Holland, Israel and China. He often acts as a guest-conductor for other orchestras.

## Protester On Stage

Recently, Gergiev spent a month in the United States. He and the Mariinsky company visited New York, Florida and Michigan. They performed opera, ballet and classical music. He also guest-conducted the famous Metropolitan Opera in New York.

During the trip, protesters met him wherever he went. At the Metropolitan Opera, someone came on stage. The protester held up a banner and interrupted the show as Russian singer Anna Netrebko was taking a bow. Netrebko is also a supporter of Putin.

Gergiev says he is fine with protesters expressing their opinions outside. It's not appropriate inside the theater, he says.

When the Soviet Union ended, Gergiev had a grand vision. Without the Soviet government gone, there would be more freedom for artists like him. He wanted to take a new look at Russian culture. Russia needed to know its history so it could rebuild as a new nation, he said.

Gergiev brought back operas that had been forgotten during the Soviet years. He focused on Russian composers.

In St. Petersburg, he found a friend in city government. His friend was an assistant mayor who supported Russian fine arts, future President Putin.

## "You Have To Go Back"

As president, Putin is not shy about supporting Russian fine arts like ballet and opera. When other world leaders visit, he often takes them to see a ballet or classical music performance.

Gergiev has become a fighter for the environment. He also performs charity concerts around the world.

Still, anger toward Gergiev has been building. His long-time friend Putin has become more and more unpopular in Europe and the United States. Many were angered when Gergiev supported the Russian takeover of Crimea last year. Crimea used to be part of Ukraine.

"It's a long story," he explains. He says that people outside of the region have trouble understanding how deep the issues are. For this, Gergiev says you have to go back to the history of Ukraine and its relationship to Russian culture.

"The issue is not something from five years ago or three years ago. You have to go back 200 years, 100 years," he says.
