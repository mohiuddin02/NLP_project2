LONDON â€” Racism is out of control in Russian soccer, a new report says.

Fans yell anti-black insults at players from Africa. A Russian soccer coach even made anti-black comments about players on his own team.

The report, called "Time for Action," expresses concern about racism at the World Cup in Russia in three years. It listed more than 200 cases of racism in Russian soccer, which is called football in Europe.

Piara Powar is the head of Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE). Powar said the report shows a disturbing picture of racism and hatred of foreigners. Powar's group helps to fight racism in European soccer. FARE and another group wrote the report.

## People Want To Feel Safe

Racism could even threaten the safety of visitors to the 2018 World Cup. The world soccer championship will take place in Russia, and players and fans from all over the world will be there.

People need to be "assured if they go they won't be attacked," Powar said.

The report listed dozens of cases where fans raised money for neo-Nazis in jail. Neo-Nazis are anti-black and anti-Jewish, and believe white people are superior and should have all the power. The report said fans have shown neo-Nazi symbols at soccer games and they make insulting comments to black people and people from other cultures.

"Our hope in Russia in the lead-up to 2018 is we get action taken to protect the safety of fans and of players," Powar added. "Players have already said they will walk off if they hear racism. That is a danger. We want that to be addressed in advance."

## Plan Of Action Needed

In 2010, Russian President Vladimir Putin promised to deal with the problem of racism at soccer games.

"We see it and we believe it is a problem and unfortunately we have quite a number of such problems," Putin said.

But the report argues that not enough has been done. The report says Russia must put in place a plan to prevent racism. Otherwise, "it will be difficult to ensure the safety of visitors" to the World Cup. The plan includes punishing racist behavior, creating a way to stop neo-Nazi groups, and educating Russians about racism and intolerance.

Some of the Russian soccer fans have links to racist groups. Fans have shouted racist slogans because they hate blacks or foreigners. Others see it simply as a game tactic. They are trying to distract the other team's star players, says longtime Moscow fan Dmitry Dedkov.

## The Rules Are Mostly Ignored

The report said rules were created in 2011 to deal with racism. Teams can be fined for racist speech and stadiums can be closed, yet the rules have not worked. Racism at soccer games has not decreased, the report said.

In Russia, well-known coaches and players take photos with fans. Some of these fans wear tattoos or T-shirts with the Nazi symbol of the swastika. Famous singers sing with racist fans in the stands.

The report particularly spoke about fans of five Russian soccer teams who wear neo-Nazi symbols. Their fans wave banners, which read "White Pride World Wide."

The report says that none of this is surprising. Hatred of foreigners has grown more intense in Russia since the early 2000s.

Last season, CSKA Moscow fans made monkey noises at a black player on another team. The fans were fined for racism. The player, Yaye Toure, is from Ivory Coast in Africa. He said that if players think there will be racism at the World Cup, they will not come.

## Attitude Adjustments

The report lists just five examples of abuse against black people. However, Powar said the actual number is far higher and that this soccer season seems to have been especially bad.

In December, fans of the Moscow team Spartak made racist comments to another team's player who was from Africa. The player responded with a rude gesture. He was benched for three matches. Yet Spartak was fined only about $1,300.

A coach, named Igor Gamula, even made insulting comments about black players on his own team. He was banned for five games.

Racist attitudes "are widespread among Russian football fans," the report concluded. It is unlikely that this will improve in the near future, it said.
