Across the nation, there has been a growing awareness of the danger of concussions in young athletes. [Concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) are minor brain injuries that result from blows to the head. Particularly if they occur repeatedly, they can have serious long-term effects.

In response to this growing concern, the White House on Wednesday presented several new efforts. The goal is to help prevent and more effectively treat concussions in children.

Officials announced that $65 million had been pledged to pay for these efforts.

The National College Athletic Association (NCAA), which makes the rules for college sports, contributed $30 million. Another $25 million came from the National Football League (NFL). And $10 million was a gift from the New York Giants football team's co-owner, Steve Tisch.

## Starting Programs And Improving Others

Tisch's contribution will help get a national tracking system for concussions off the ground.

"Hopefully, 20 years from today, athletes won't be discovering" head injuries they got years earlier "playing in high school and college," Tisch said. "This is kind of a new frontier."

Tisch's contribution will expand a program founded in 2012. So far, that program has treated 600 young patients with brain injuries. It has also studied the aftereffects of concussions in student athletes.

"This commitment will launch our program to the next level," said the program's leader, Dr. Christopher Giza. He said the program will now be able to reach more students. Its goal will be to improve treatment and to learn more about the longer-term effects of concussion.

## Head Injuries Can Have Many Consequences

Earlier studies have shown that concussions can cause serious long-term problems. Among these are learning problems, mental health problems and even dementia. This has made parents uncomfortable about allowing their children to play several sports.

In late 2013, President Barack Obama revealed that he shared that concern: If he had a son, the president said, he would not let him play pro football.

Nonetheless, the Obamas take a strong interest in sports. Indeed, one of their goals is to get children to be more physically active. To help make sure sports are as safe as possible, the president has been eager to boost research on concussions.

A major scientific report on concussions was issued last autumn. It declared that far too little is known about the effects of repeated blows to the developing brain.

The report recommended that leagues, coaches and parents follow certain guidelines: A child who has been hit hard in the head should be banned from playing until he or she has been examined by a doctor. And safety rules should be strictly followed. For instance, head-to-head contact in football and blindside hits to the head in hockey should not be allowed.

## Concussion Injuries Have Increased

Some researchers believe that the young brain recovers more quickly from bumps and injuries than the adult brain does. Others fear the opposite: Because the young brain is still developing, they say, repeated blows may be more damaging. Much of a young brain's wiring does not have the protective, fatty coating seen in older brains.

Over the years, there has been a steady increase in the number of concussions reported. In 2001 about 150,000 people under the age of 19 were treated for concussions. By 2009, that number had risen to 250,000. A recent NCAA survey of 15 college sports showed that between 1989 and 2004 the rate of reported concussions doubled.

## Safety First

Other new efforts to combat concussions include the following:

—The NCAA and the Department of Defense will spend $30 million on the most extensive research to date on concussions. Another goal of this effort will be to change attitudes. For many athletes, blows to the head are seen as dings to be "shaken off."

—The NFL will spend $25 million to promote youth sports safety. The league says it will seek to increase the number of athletic trainers in schools. It will also work to educate parents about sports safety.

—The National Institutes of Health will launch a long-term study of concussions. Specifically, it will examine the effects of repeated blows to the head.

—The National Institute of Standards and Technology will spend $5 million to develop advanced materials for helmets. Hopefully, such materials will provide better protection against concussion.
