WASHINGTON — In May 1995, geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting of U.S. and ex-Soviet nuclear weapons designers. To his surprise, the Cold Warriors were eager to work together against an unlikely but dangerous threat from space: asteroids headed straight for Earth.

First Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, spoke up. He urged others meeting at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to consider building and orbiting huge, new nuclear weapons for planetary protection. Then some top Russian weapons experts lent their support.

"It was a really bizarre thing to see that these weapons designers were willing to work together — to build the biggest bombs ever," said Melosh.

Ever since, he has been pushing back against scientists who still support the nuclear option. He argues that non-nuclear solutions are both possible and far less dangerous.

## To Bomb, Or Not To Bomb, Asteroids

But Melosh's campaign suffered a setback last month when the U.S. signed an agreement with Russia that could open the door to new collaboration between nuclear weapons scientists. A Sept. 16 announcement cited "defense from asteroids" as one possible area of study.

President Barack Obama has committed the United States to seeking a world without nuclear weapons. But NASA is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to study their use against asteroids.

Weapons experts in the United States and Russia say the asteroid threat is a reason to hold onto — or to build — very large nuclear bombs.

To some critics, the idea smacks of bad science fiction. It sounds, they say, like something out of the 1998 Bruce Willis action film "Armageddon." In that movie, a team of deep-sea oil drillers lands on an Earth-bound asteroid. They plant a nuclear warhead on it and blow the rock into halves that just miss Earth.

Critics note that work on the nuclear option could violate several international treaties. One is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty signed by 129 countries. The treaty forbids the use of nuclear weapons in space.

Some experts also worry about the radioactive debris that would be created by blasting an asteroid. Such bits and pieces could themselves cause terrible damage on Earth.

But the idea has strong supporters. Bong Wie is director of Iowa State University's Asteroid Deflection Research Center. He said he has a grant from NASA to design a "hypervelocity nuclear interceptor system." Basically, that's a missile-borne warhead fitted with a battering ram.

The ram would separate from the bomb before the bomb hit, he said. It would gouge a crater into the asteroid so that the bomb could then blast the asteroid to bits.

Engineering professor Keith Holsapple said NASA has given him a grant as well. He is now studying ways to knock an Earth-bound asteroid from its path. He is considering both nuclear explosions and battering rams.

## What It Would Take To Stop An Asteroid

The leading U.S. supporter of the nuclear solution is probably David S.P. Dearborn, a research physicist and weapons designer. Dearborn said that he was offended years ago when other researchers told reporters that nuclear weapons simply couldn't work against asteroids. "That's just not true," he said.

Nuclear weapons could be used in two ways, he said. If the collision was still at least 10 years away, a nuclear blast could knock the asteroid off course. If time was shorter, defenders would try to blow up the asteroid.

"You fragment it with enough force so that the pieces spread out," and mostly miss the Earth, he said. Small bits of rock would burn up in the atmosphere.

There would be no need to build new weapons, he said. But shattering a large asteroid probably would require a weapon with a yield of about a megaton, or 1 million tons of TNT. This is roughly the power of the largest bomb in the current U.S. arsenal.

Physicist Mark Boslough has studied the possible effects of nuclear blasts on asteroids. He agrees that on short notice nuclear "really is the only option."

## Non-Nuclear Options

Melosh disagrees. Ninety percent of the biggest asteroids already have been found and ruled out as a near-term threat, he says. So there is time to find suitable, non-nuclear alternatives. These include hitting asteroids with rams, zapping them with lasers or tugging them off their path.

And Melosh has tested one of his ideas. In 2005 he served as co-investigator on a NASA mission known as Deep Impact. In that mission, NASA launched an 820-pound copper-covered battering ram that gouged a crater out of the comet Tempel 1.

For nuclear bombs to work even as a last-ditch effort, he said, they would need to be more powerful than any ever built. And a lot more people, he warned, have been killed by nuclear weapons than by asteroids.
