Public health experts say that kids should get at least an hour of exercise each day, and American teens are not getting enough. To remedy the problem, they recommend that half of it be done at school.  

Students should spend 30 minutes of the school day doing moderate to vigorous physical activity, scientists say. To do that, schools would need to devote around 8 percent of each school day to physical fitness. A recent study by the journal Pediatrics found that students currently are not reaching that number. Instead, they are spending only about 5 percent of the school day, or about 23 minutes, improving their bodies instead of their minds.

## Teens' Reputation Precedes Them

Researchers observed that adolescents spend many hours a week at school. Because of this they say, "Even a small increase in the proportion of at-school time spent physically active could lead to meaningful increases in overall physical activity and metabolic health."  More time exercising at school could make for healthier bodies.

American teenagers have a reputation for sitting a great deal and exercising very little. They are among the most sedentary in the world, with only 8 percent getting the recommended 60 minutes of exercise a day. Studies show that without enough exercise, teens are more likely to develop a chronic, or long-term illness such as diabetes and heart disease. In addition, lack of exercise affects the brain and can result in lower grades.

## Most Activity Takes Place At School

To see when and where teens were getting exercise, researchers gave 549 Seattle, Washington, and Baltimore, Maryland, volunteers global positioning system (GPS) monitors and activity trackers. The devices recorded location and movement every 30 seconds for about a week.

All of the volunteers were between the ages of 12 and 16. The GPS monitors showed that they spent more of their waking hours at school than anywhere else. On average, they spent 42 percent of their time at school, 28 percent at home,13 percent in their neighborhoods, 4 percent near their schools and the rest elsewhere.

The activity trackers revealed that the students averaged about 39 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. On school days, more than half of those minutes were tallied at school. The amount of time teens spent exercising was more than 25 percent higher on school days than on weekend days, and when weekends were factored in, 42 percent of the week's total exercise happened at school.

Since the teenagers spent the largest amount of their time at school, that is where they got the largest total amount of exercise. However, spending the most time at school also led to the most total time spent sitting while there.

## Spending Time Outdoors Is Key

While the teens spent less time at home and outside than they did at school, those were the places where students tended to be more active. Therefore, researchers concluded that students should exercise more at school and spend more time outside in neighborhoods and schoolyards.

"Increasing time in home and school neighborhoods might increase physical activity, partly by reducing time spent in less active locations," the researchers said.

Scientists did not find that race, ethnicity or whether students came from college-educated families made any difference in exercise patterns. What they did find was that boys got more exercise than girls, and that that should be kept in mind when trying to increase physical fitness in teens.
