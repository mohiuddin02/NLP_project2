JERUSALEM — On Jan. 27, 1945, the German soldiers told Jewish American prisoners of war (POWs) to identify themselves.

Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds did not agree to that. He knew the Jewish soldiers could be sent to their deaths. Edmonds had been captured about three months earlier by the Germans. In the German POW camp, he ordered more than 1,000 Americans soldiers to step forward with him. Then he announced, "We are all Jews here."

Edmonds would not waver, even with a pistol to his head. The Germans eventually backed down.

## An Extraordinary Sense Of Responsibility

Seventy years later, Edmonds is being given one of Israel's highest honors. It recognizes non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II. During the war, many of the countries of the world fought each other. It was started by Germany. Edmonds is the first American soldier to earn the honor. Edmonds, who is from Knoxville, Tennessee, died in 1985.

"Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier," said Avner Shalev. He is the head of Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and memorial in Israel. During World War II, the Germans tried to destroy the Jewish people. At the time, Germany was run by the Nazis. Nazi Germans killed and imprisoned millions of Jews during the Holocaust. Edmonds "had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings," Shalev said. "The choices and actions of Master Sergeant Edmonds set an example for his fellow American soldiers."

The story was only discovered by Edmond's son long after his father's death.

## His Son Untangled The Mystery

Edmonds was captured with thousands of others in late 1944 and spent 100 days in a POW camp. His son, Chris Edmonds, knew a little from diaries his father kept in the POW camp.

Chris Edmonds only began to figure out what really happened a few years ago. He read a newspaper article online about former President's Richard Nixon's search for a home. Nixon bought the home from a man who said Edmonds saved him and dozens of other Jews during the war.

Edmonds' son found the man and another Jewish former POW. They said the German army kept the Jewish POWs separate from non-Jews.

Jewish American POWs were sent to slave labor camps. They were forced to work under terrible conditions, and many prisoners died. U.S. soldiers had been warned that Jewish soldiers would be in danger if the Germans captured them. They were told to destroy any evidence that they were Jewish.

The two men said the German camp head ordered the Jews to identify themselves.

## "We Are All Jews Here"

Turning to the rest of the POWs, Edmonds said, "We are not doing that," Chris Edmonds said. 

The German commander then said to Edmonds, "They cannot all be Jews." Edmonds replied, "We are all Jews here."

Then the Nazi officer pointed his pistol at Edmonds and offered him one last chance.

Edmonds told him: "If you are going to shoot, you are going to have to shoot all of us," Chris Edmonds said.

The German officer gave up. Chris Edmonds said he thinks his father saved the lives of more than 200 Jewish-American soldiers.

## He's The First Soldier To Be Given The Honor

More than 26,000 people have been named "Righteous Among the Nations." Trees are planted at the Yad Vashem museum in honor of those who risked their lives to save Jews.

Before Edmonds, only four of the Righteous were Americans. He is the first soldier to be given the award and the first whose actions saved the lives of fellow Americans. A ceremony for Edmonds will be held next year in Israel. 

## Inspired By His Faith

Irena Steinfeldt is with Yad Vashem. She said Edmonds made a quick, clear, moral decision. She called him a hero.

Chris Edmonds said his father's actions were inspired by his strong belief in Christianity.

"All he had to fight with was his will power and his wits," he said. "I'm just glad he did the right thing."
