ANCHORAGE, Alaska â€” It is spring break for middle school students in south-central Alaska. Many spent it playing video games, skiing or just enjoying a lazy week away from school. Grayson Davey, an eighth-grader, spent most of his week off looking for employees.

Grayson is only 13 years old, but he already owns a business. It is called Alaska Paracord Designs and has made $40,000 in sales in three years. Now Grayson is looking to expand and hire people to make his products. The neatly woven bracelets or keychain dangles are made from paracord. This is tough nylon cord usually used for parachutes. The fire-starter bracelet looks like many other woven bracelets being sold online to outdoors fans. Grayson's products, which he makes himself at his home, however, have some special items that could save lives.

## His Products Can Also Save Lives

In an emergency, the bracelet can be taken apart and the parachute cord used in a variety of ways. For example, it could be used to create a shelter, or make a tight bandage to stop bleeding. But Grayson's bracelet is much more than a bundle of cord. Its clasp is also a whistle that can be used to signal for help. If the cord is unwound, the fire-starter bracelet has 17 feet of military-grade cord. Inside there is a piece of firesteel and a striker that can be used to start a fire. There is also 10 inches of waxed jute twine, a waterproof tinder that will light and burn easily.

When your adventure goes wrong, "what you have on you is your survival kit," he said.

## Company Could Be His Career

Grayson began making his products in 2013, when he was 11 years old. So far he has sold more than 1,000 of his fire-starter bracelets and fire bugs. The fire bugs attach to a keychain and contain a mylar signal mirror and a small knife. The fire-starter bracelet sells for $35, the fire bug for $25.

Over spring break, Grayson picked out two possible employees; he is looking for at least three more. Even though he's not in high school yet, Grayson has put $10,000 in profits into the stock market and the rest of the profits back into his growing company.

"I want to grow the company as big as I can and at least get enough money for college," he said. "And it could end up being my career."

## Idea Sparked By Boating Accident

Grayson said he got his big idea after a family friend almost died while boating. The boat overturned and the man and his young daughter fell into the water. The pair swam to a nearby island but were stuck on it for three days before they were rescued. They could not build a fire or shelter because all their gear was lost. That's when Grayson figured out that a woven paracord bracelet with small, useful tools planted inside would have made a difference.

Three years later, Grayson owns his own company. He sells his growing product line on the Web and at several local stores.

Grayson bought his fishing gear at one of these local stores. "He told me he was getting into paracord a lot," said Stewart Valladolid, the buying manager at the store, "and I told him to bring some in." Grayson brought his first sample in and Stewart said he was "absolutely amazed on the detail" that he put into the bracelet.

That was in 2013 and since then, Valladolid said, his shop continues to sell the popular item.

## Wants To Expand His Business

Grayson wants his business to grow and handle bigger orders. The way to do that is to hire people to make his bracelets for him. He was looking into hiring home-bound people who could learn how to make the product. Grayson thinks his new employees could make $15 to $20 per hour, working part-time.

The entire experience of starting and expanding a company is, however, more than a money-maker for Grayson. It has been a life lesson.

Grayson said he does not think enough people follow both their dreams and their ideas.

"If you have an idea that can be a business, just see the different ways you can start it up, and see how you can grow it from there," he said. "But it might not be easy. You have to work hard too."
