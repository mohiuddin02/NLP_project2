FERGUSON, Mo. â€” Missouri Governor Jay Nixon sent the National Guard to Ferguson early Monday, hours after police fired tear gas at protesters. Protesters have filled the streets almost nightly after an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer a week ago.

The National Guard would help "in restoring peace and order," Nixon said. Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, has been filled with angry crowds since 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed Aug. 9.

The violence is hurtful to the family of Michael Brown and the teen's memory, Nixon said. The protests are also unfair to community members who long for justice "and to feel safe in their own homes," he said.

On Sunday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered an autopsy on Brown's body. An autopsy is a medical examination of a corpse to determine the cause of death. A private autopsy done for the family found the unarmed teen was shot six times. Results of an autopsy ordered by the state are not known.

## Tear Gas Fired At Protesters

As night fell in Ferguson Sunday, another peaceful protest quickly turned violent. Marchers pushed toward one end of a street and police pushed them back with tear gas. Tear gas is a chemical that irritates the eyes. It is used to break up protests. Officials said there had been reports of gunfire, destruction of property and fires being set. Also, at least two people were shot by protesters, an official said.

Captain Ron Johnson is with the Missouri Highway Patrol. He is in command in Ferguson. Because of the violence, police had no alternative but to use tear gas, he said.

Doctor Michael Baden conducted the private autopsy for the Brown family. He said that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown's skull. Brown's head may have been bent forward when he was shot, Baden said.

Brown also was shot in his right arm, and all the bullets were fired into his front, Baden said.

## Clashes Before Curfew

Brian Fallon, a Justice Department spokesman, said the federal department decided to conduct the autopsy because of events surrounding Brown's death. Brown's family also requested it, Fallon said. The department, which is part of the federal government, is investigating the shooting.

A federal autopsy is "not that unusual," said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor.

Federal authorities want to let the public know that something is being done, Weinstein said.

Sunday's clashes in Ferguson started at about 9 p.m. A day earlier, Nixon had ordered everyone to stay inside during a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew.

Officers ordered all protesters to leave. Many of the marchers obeyed the order, but a group of about 100 stood until they got hit by a round of tear gas.

Protesters laid concrete blocks across the street to block police vehicles. But the vehicles easily plowed through. The crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.

By 11 p.m., most protesters left.

## "Shame To My Heart"

Earlier in the day, Johnson said he had met members of Brown's family. The experience "brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart," he said.

"When this is over," he told the crowd, "I'm going to go in my son's room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that's my baby."

Johnson added, "We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael's going to make it better for our sons to be better black men."

The Ferguson community is mainly black and its police department is mainly white. Brown's death has worsened racial anger in the town.

## Accounts Of Brown's Death Differ

Ferguson police waited six days to say who shot Brown. They also waited to say that  Brown was accused of robbing a store shortly before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a suspect in the robbery before Brown's death. Brown was accused of stealing a $49 box of cigars.

Police have said little about what happened next, only that there was a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired at him.

Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, has served on the police force for six years. He had no previous complaints against him. He has been taken off the streets since the shooting. The department has refused to say where he is.

About 150 people, mainly police and relatives of officers, gathered in St. Louis on Sunday to support Wilson. Some of them carried signs urging people to wait for all the facts in the case before making up their minds.
