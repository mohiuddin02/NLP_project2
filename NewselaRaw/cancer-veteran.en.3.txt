PHILADELPHIA, Pa. — Cancer almost killed Peter Zucca before his first birthday. Now, at age 12, he knows what it is to live with this terrible disease.

Peter lives near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He uses what he has gone through to make life easier for others like him.

Young patients at a children's hospital nearby liked little wagons better than wheelchairs. The hospital did not have enough wagons for everyone. Peter helped raise money to buy more of them.

Peter lost his hearing because of being treated for his cancer.

Peter read books about how to deal with hearing loss. Most books about childhood hearing loss seemed "really bad." He decided to write his own, called "Peter Learns to Listen."

His book offers tips to children who cannot hear well: "Make sure to get the right (ear) molds, or they'll fall out when you hang upside down in a tree."

## Planning For A Birthday ... And A Funeral

Peter certainly knows the troubles of kids with cancer. He has made 13 trips to the operating room. In the end, cancer took most of his right leg.

Yet Peter came out a superhero of sorts.

Peter has run a race. He plays second base on his Little League team. He swims and dives, and he dreams of pitching in the major leagues.

It was Christmas Eve 2003 when Dennis and Dawn Zucca learned their 10-month-old boy had cancer. The cancer was in his legs and had spread to his lungs.

Peter could not stand. He dragged his body along and could not hold down food.

Two months later, the Zuccas made plans for Peter's first birthday. They also made plans in case he died.

"Enjoy him the best you can" their doctors said, giving him two months to live.

## "The Best Gift"

Amazingly, several months later a doctor cut out the cancer. Peter was sent home. There was only a small chance he would live, his mother said.

On Christmas Eve 2008, Peter's doctor called. "I have the best gift — you're cured," he told Peter.

The medical treatments had hurt the nerves in his hands and a foot. His right leg did not grow well. Three years ago his family decided to have his leg stretched out. He had to wear a sort of metal cage on his leg. It had pins and wires in many places with a wire that went into his bones. Then just as Peter was learning to walk again, a different cancer grew on the leg.

Dennis and Dawn Zucca had a choice: Lose the leg, or lose the boy.

Dawn begged that the leg be cut off.

It was not easy. Peter writes: "For a while after that, I was sad most of the time."

## Foundation Has Raised Thousands Of Dollars

The hardest part, Peter said, is "not being able to play the same way."

He turned to helping others. He started the Peter Powerhouse Foundation a year ago.

The foundation has raised thousands of dollars. The money bought 100 wagons for the hospital. It also bought goggles that allow children to watch movies during treatment. Peter is hoping to raise even more money.

Peter will head to middle school in the fall. He still goes for tests for cancer every year. So far, so good, his mother says.

As for his future, he dreams of going to college and studying computers. On a recent afternoon, though, Peter Powerhouse needed some fun: "I was thinking we'd play basketball."
