DHARAMSALA, India — Gonpo Tso was born a princess.

As a child, she dressed in fur-trimmed robes and lived in a castle on the edge of the Tibetan village large enough to hold the thousand Buddhist monks who once paid tribute to her father.

One night in 1958, when she was 7, everything changed. She returned home and found the Chinese army waiting. Chinese soldiers were taping over windows and doors. Women were rushing around in tears trying to pack up the family's possessions.

Her father, a Tibetan king, was summoned to a meeting. Chinese Communist officials ordered Gonpo, her mother, and her sister into a car and drove them away from the lands that the family had ruled for generations.

"Everybody in the village was in tears the night they left," remembered an elderly neighbor, who was once a playmate of Gonpo.

## The Daughter Of A King

After being expelled from the life she once knew, Gonpo began a difficult odyssey all over China. She has lost almost everyone she ever loved.

"When people hear I am the daughter of a king, they imagine I must be really spoiled, but they don't know what I have experienced," Gonpo says.

Now in her early 60s, Gonpo looks nothing like a princess. She is shy and slow to open up about her past.

"I try not to talk about it because it makes me sad," she apologizes.

Gonpo is the heir to the now-gone Mei kingdom, which until the mid-20th century, was centered in Aba, a mostly Tibetan city in China's Sichuan province.

## Reform Never Comes To Tibet

Until the 1950s, the area was ruled by Gonpo's family, and although the Chinese referred to her father as a tribal chieftain, Tibetans used the word gyalpo, or king.

The king reported neither to the Tibetan government nor to Chinese authorities. The people of his kingdom maintained a fierce independence.

Her father, Rapten Tinley, a tall, slim man with high cheekbones and furrowed brows, appears in photos seeming to carry the weight of the world.

In 1949, the Chinese invaded central Tibet. Knowing how powerful the Chinese military was, Gonpo's father instructed his people not to resist them.

He initially thought the Chinese could bring much-needed reform to Tibet, but changed his mind in 1958 when the Communist Party enacted what it called its "democratic reforms." Gonpo's father was forced from power.

Gonpo's family was kicked out of their home and they were exiled to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. The rest of the Tibetan community back in Aba starved as the Communists took over. Gonpo initially lived in comfort in Chengdu. She and her older sister attended an elite Chinese elementary school and then a high school in Beijing for ethnic minorities. Her father was even given a position in China's government — but the family's situation soon began to fall apart.

## Candies And Good-bye

In 1966, the Communists launched the Cultural Revolution to end old traditions and cultures, as well as the ideas of capitalism — which supports people owning their own property and making decisions about how to buy and sell goods. Gonpo had been visiting her parents and sister when she was ordered to return to Beijing. Fearing for her safety, her parents dropped her off at the train, giving her a bag of candies to share with her seatmates.

She would never see her parents again.

In October 1966, two months after 15-year-old Gonpo returned to school, her mother disappeared. A few days later, her father, searching for his wife, jumped into a river and drowned in an apparent suicide.

## A Quiet Life Is Uprooted

In 1968, Gonpo learned that she would be exiled more than 2,000 miles away near the Russian border. She would work on a military-run farming compound in Xinjiang.

She performed hard physical labor every day, sometimes walking 10 miles. It was there that she learned that her sister, who had become a doctor, had died. The one bright spot on the farm was a handsome young Chinese man who also lived there. When she had milk to sell, he and his friends would buy it. Over the years, they fell in love and eventually married.

Gonpo and her husband were allowed to move from the compound and settled in his hometown in eastern China. Gonpo went to college and got a job teaching music and Chinese in elementary school. She had two daughters and settled into a quiet life, her colleagues completely unaware of her background.

One day, a fancy limo pulled up and Gonpo was ordered to report to the Communist Party offices. A Tibetan member of the Chinese government had discovered her identity and decided to give her a new apartment and special treatment.

In 1984, Gonpa was allowed to visit Aba for the first time since being expelled. She wept at the gates of the ruined monastery. The Tibetans rushed to her. "All we could do was hold each other and cry," she says.

Gonpo was not unhappy in China. She loved her husband, yet she felt her Tibetan heritage slipping away from her. Taking the advice of a high-ranking Tibetan to reconnect with her history, she decided to go on a pilgrimage to India, the birthplace of Buddhism.

## Welcomed By The Dalai Lama

When Gonpo left for India in 1989, she took the older of her two daughters, then 10, but left her husband and 9-year-old in Nanjing with promises to return after a few months. Once in Dharamsala, she started Tibetan lessons. The Dalai Lama welcomed her warmly and even nominated her to serve in the Tibetan government-in-exile.

Once Gonpo settled in, she was not eager to return to China. The months stretched into years and then decades. Gonpo would not see her husband and younger daughter again until 2005, when they came to visit her in India.

"I was the only living child of the Mei king. I felt duty bound to stay here," Gonpo says.

She knew it made her husband sad, however she said that "he understood too that in the larger scheme of things, the issue of Tibet was bigger than family things."

Now, she is a familiar figure in Dharamsala, where everybody now addresses her by her title: princess.
