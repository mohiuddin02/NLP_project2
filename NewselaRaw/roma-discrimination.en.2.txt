<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131024_Roma.jpg" /> BERLIN — Earlier this month, 15-year-old Leonarda Dibrani was grabbed by French police while she was on a school field trip. Her crime? The French government had just turned down her immigrant family's request to remain in France and claimed it couldn't wait until the end of the school day to get her out of the country.

Police escorted her off a bus filled with her classmates and whisked her away. Along with her family, she was quickly expelled to Kosovo, a country where she had never lived.

Many believe the real reason Leonarda was deported so quickly was the girl's ethnicity. She is Romani, or to use the more common and insulting word, a Gypsy. Experts say that harsh treatment of Roma people is all too common. They are one of the last ethnic groups in Europe it is still widely acceptable to insult and mistreat.

The Roma are thought to have originated in northern India, but have lived in Europe since the 1300s. A report by the charity group Oxfam recently described them as the most "deprived ethnic group within Europe." It went on to say Romani are "disproportionately affected by poverty" and discriminated against when it comes to employment, education, and health care.

## Roma Are An Easy Target

Leonarda Dibrani's story at first took a surprising turn. Hundreds of French supporters, including many students, flooded the streets of Paris to demand that she be allowed to return. Many thought the incident might mark a turning point. Perhaps now the deeply negative views Europeans hold of their centuries-old neighbors might at last begin to change.

But such hope disappeared within days when a Greek Roma family was accused of kidnapping a blond girl found living with them. Police came across the little girl in a Roma settlement north of Athens.

A Greek official added to the uproar when he said: "This case has reinforced our suspicions of Roma involvement in child trafficking. … Blond, blue-eyed children are clearly being targeted."

The belief that Gypsies kidnap children stretches back centuries. It is reflected in folklore and literature. This ancient prejudice has stubbornly survived.

"The Italians gorged themselves on this story of a little blond girl who they believe was snatched by evil Gypsies," said Rome-based human rights lawyer Claudia Tavani. "This is despite the fact that, to this day, it has never once been proven that the Roma have had anything to do with kidnapping."

Tavani said the recent European economic crisis has increased discrimination, especially in struggling nations such as Greece and Italy. When times are tough, people want someone to blame. The Roma are an easy target.

## Victims Of Widespread Discrimination

In Italy, the Roma are trotted out every time a government or a politician is in trouble, Tavani said. "Politicians see easy votes in vowing to rid Italy of these thieves, robbers and kidnappers," she said.

The demonization of the Roma is hardly limited to Italy. Indeed, it can be found all over Europe.

In Slovakia, city governments build walls around what they call Gypsy camps. In the Czech Republic, neo-Nazis lead protests against their presence.

In Romania, a right-wing political party recently offered cash to any Roma woman who would get sterilized. In France, Gilles Bourdouleix, a 53-year-old member of Parliament, this summer said of the Roma: "Maybe Hitler didn't kill enough of them."

Hitler's Germany killed between 250,000 and 500,000 Roma (and Sinti, another branch of the people known as Gypsies). The Holocaust hardly ended hatred toward the population in Germany.

Romani Rose is chairman of the Central Council of Sinti and Roma in Germany. Standing next to a year-old memorial to victims of the Nazis, he said the hatred remains widespread.

"Even after the Holocaust, our minority still encounters racism and discrimination," he said. They are, he noted, the last people in Europe to be hired and first to be fired. He said poor villagers come to Berlin and find only overcrowded apartments where crooked landlords overcharge them for a mattress on the floor. "Such overpopulation leads to conflicts with the neighbors, and old prejudices come up again," he said.

## "But I Have Hope"

Cordula Simon, a Berlin government official, is eager to help Roma immigrants.

Europeans, she said, view the Roma people either as "happy dancers and fiddlers or as dangerous criminals. The reality is that they are just people, and in dealing with Roma immigrants there are many positive stories to tell. Too few are willing to listen, however."

One of the most positive stories, she said, involves education. Young Roma children, many from desperately poor rural areas of Romania and Bulgaria, arrive in Berlin schools extremely unprepared. Many have never been to school before.

"But their energy level, their hunger to learn, is enormous," she said. And it's moving to see how much Roma parents will sacrifice to give their children a better life, she added.

Mitek is a 37-year-old Roma immigrant from Bulgaria. He lost a job and could find no new work at home, so he left his wife and children behind and came to Berlin, hoping for a better life. What he has found to this point isn't much.

Every day he's either out looking for plastic bottles for refunds or sitting and thinking about the good life to come. And he still believes, even though for the last six months his "home" has been a scrap-wood hut inside an abandoned factory.

"My hope is still to find a job, and to bring my wife and children to live with me," he said while seated outside his hut. "It hasn't happened yet. But I have hope. My life will be better soon."
