Big chain stores are opening their stores earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving Day. They want to bring in holiday shoppers. Some people are not happy about the move. A lot of store workers don't like it.

Charde Nabors would prefer to spend Thanksgiving in her mother's kitchen. But the Sears department store cashier may spend the day working instead.

Sears is among the many chain stores that will be open on Thanksgiving Day.

"We really don't want to work that, but who would say no when you need the money?" said Nabors. She is a single mother with an infant and a 3-year-old. She works part time. Nabors gets paid $9 per hour.

She may have to work that day even if she does not volunteer.

Thanksgiving "brings you and your family together," Nabors said. "And this is just taking it away."

## Black Friday Becomes Black Thursday

The holiday shopping season used to start the day after Thanksgiving. The day became known as Black Friday. Now Black Friday may be dead. The family Thanksgiving dinner may be hurt, too.

Kmart might be the best example. It has been open for some hours on Thanksgiving for many years. But Kmart will open its doors at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving. It will stay open for 41 hours. Macy's has been closed on Thanksgiving for 155 years. That streak will end this year. Macy's will open at 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving.

So will Sears. It will then stay open through the night. Sears will not close until 10 p.m. Friday. Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy and many others will also have Thanksgiving hours.

"Thanksgiving used to be the one day retailers took a breather," said Bill Martin. He is the founder of  ShopperTrak. His company gives advice to stores, or retailers.  Now that has changed. "They're trying to get to the consumer's wallet as early as possible."

Stores have been racing to start the holiday season earlier. Now Black Friday is Black Thursday.

Why? There could be many reasons. There are not as many days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year as there were last year. Hanukkah also comes very early. Stores may be scared of losing sales to a competitor. Shoppers also can just shop on an iPad at home whenever they want.

## Hunting Deals Before Eating Turkey Dinner

Several big chains claim they are simply giving their customers what they want. But experts say that just is not true.

Martin calls the change a "sad event." He does not think shoppers are asking stores to open earlier. Instead, stores want to get shoppers in the store "to get to the money before it's all spent."

But a small group of shoppers who want deals will be glad for the extended Black Friday, Darrin Duber-Smith said. He calls them adventure shoppers. Duber-Smith is a marketing professor. He teaches at Metropolitan State University of Denver

Last year, 23 percent of holiday shoppers said they would shop on Thanksgiving Day. That was up from 17 percent in 2011, according to a survey by Deloitte.

David Gladney said he prefers it when stores open early on Thanksgiving Day. That way, he can get his deal hunting out of the way in the beginning of the day. Then he can get back to food, family and football.

"I would come out â€” just because it's that early," he said.

It does not seem as bad anymore to be doing something besides being with family on Thanksgiving. Shopping is only the latest alternative activity, said Randy Allen. He is a professor at Cornell University.

Turkey Trot running races and deer hunting on Thanksgiving morning pull people away from family, Allen said. And, of course, sports fans are often watching football games. So what's the harm in non-sports fans shopping?

"It's not like the whole family is necessarily together the whole day, anyway," Allen said.
