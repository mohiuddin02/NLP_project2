FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — Nineteen firefighters died Sunday while battling a fast-moving wildfire northwest of Phoenix, the most firefighters to die fighting a wildfire since 1933.

The firefighters went missing while fighting the Yarnell Hill fire. The out-of-control blaze had surrounded the community of Yarnell, burning down much of the town, officials said. The town's 649 people had already been evacuated, but about 200 buildings were lost.

Strong, unpredictable winds caused the wildfire to more than quadruple in size by Monday. It was still far from being contained.

The firefighters belonged to the Granite Mountain Interagency Hotshot Crew, an elite unit sponsored by a fire department in nearby Prescott.  Residents there were grieving through social media after word of the deaths arrived Sunday night.

## There Was No Escape

"This is as dark a day as I can remember," Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said in a statement. "It may be days or longer before an investigation reveals how this tragedy occurred, but the essence we already know in our hearts: fighting fires is dangerous work."

The blaze was sparked Friday by lightning, officials said, and remained out of control on Monday.

Officials lost radio contact with the crew at 4:30 p.m., said Steve Skurja, assistant spokesman for the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office. A helicopter crew spotted the bodies, he said.

He said all of the firefighters had deployed their fire shelters — an emergency measure when there is no escape.

The shelters are a sort of fireproof blanket that has foil. It is designed to protect the firefighter from the heat of the flames, as well as smoke and ash, while still letting them breathe. But it can still get very hot inside.

Skurja confirmed that 19 members of the 20-person crew had died. One survivor was hospitalized, he said, but he did not know the firefighter's condition.

"The fire was very aggressive. It just overtook them," Skurja said.

## Grim Statistics

Roxie Glover, a spokeswoman for Wickenburg Community Hospital, said officials had told her to expect injured firefighters. Then the grim news arrived.

"It became clear that the firefighters had been deceased," Glover said. "We were told that we were not getting firefighters."

But homeowners flooded in, suffering from the effects of breathing too much smoke. Some also were in shock from losing their homes, she said.

Sunday's incident appears to be the deadliest in decades for wildfires. The previous highest number of deaths in a fire came in Colorado on July 6, 1994. There, at Storm King Mountain near Glenwood Springs, 14 firefighters were trapped and killed when a wind-driven blaze blew up a hill.

Since the 1950s — until Sunday — only three other wildfires had claimed the lives of 10 or more firefighters. Each of those fires led to changes in safety regulations and training.

According to National Interagency Fire Center statistics, Sunday's deaths were the worst since 1933, when a fire in Los Angeles' Griffith Park killed at least 25 firefighters.

## "We're Devastated"

Officials said some of the Arizona firefighters had been found in fire shelters in the area, where winds occasionally exceeding 40 miles per hour (mph) helped fan the flames in 95-degree heat.

Deploying a fire shelter is typically a "last desperate step" for survival, said Timothy Ingalsbee, executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology. "That means they have been trapped."

A couple dozen firefighters are killed on average each year, he said, but 19 firefighters dying in one fire is a "horrific tragedy."

When they are fighting fast-moving fires and trying to save lives and property, "firefighters are put into this no-man's land, having to make these heroic stands … against the unstoppable force of wildfires," he said.

Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo appeared grim in a late-night news conference.

"Emotionally? We're devastated," Fraijo said. "We just lost 19 of some of the finest people you're ever going to meet. Right now we're in crisis. … Truly, we're going through a terrible crisis right now."
