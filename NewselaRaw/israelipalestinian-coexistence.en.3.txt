CHICAGO — Taher is a Palestinian teenager from the West Bank region of the Middle East. Until now, he'd never met an Israeli.

Shachar is an Israeli teen from Jerusalem. He'd never before spoken to a Palestinian, although they are neighbors.

The two 15-year-olds are among a group of about 20 teens who arrived in Chicago recently. They are taking part in a program that tries to build peace and understanding between the longtime enemies. The program is called Hands of Peace. It brings Israeli and Palestinian teens to the U.S. where they can talk freely about their lives and make friends, said Julie Kanak. She is in charge of Hands of Peace.

"Here I can see Israeli kids and talk to them and send them my message," Taher said. "I can tell them what I can't tell them back in the West Bank."

Only the first names of the teens are being used. Kanak said they could face problems at home for taking part in the program.

## "They're All Just Teenagers"

"It's really impossible for them to meet ... back in their home territory," Kanak said. Kanak spoke of the wall that stands between Israel and the Palestinian areas. The two peoples are separated in other ways. Israelis and Palestinians live in different cities. Their children go to different schools. There are very few places Israelis and Palestinians can even meet.

The Palestinians are seeking their own country. They and the Israelis have been negotiating — and fighting — over the land for decades. Neither side trusts the other. Most recently, Israel and the Hamas group that governs Gaza have been in a fierce fight.

Eleven years ago, the Glenview Community Church in suburban Chicago began Hands of Peace. More than 400 teenagers from the Middle East have taken part in the program. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is always in the background. But this is one of the first times the program has taken place when the two sides are actually fighting, said Roy Gordon. He works for the program.

"We were all really concerned," Gordon said. "We were wondering if there was going to be any problems with the young people being able to get out here, but everything has gone well so far."

Each morning the teens meet for two hours. They are encouraged to talk freely about their feelings, experiences, prejudices, hopes and dreams.

"Most of these young people have never had a conversation with someone on the other side," Gordon said. "This is their first opportunity to do that. Pretty quickly they learn that they're all just teenagers and they have a lot more in common than they have separately."

## Learning About Each Other

Earlier the group had a barbecue in a nearby park. The barbecue was followed by a game of softball, a game many of the teens had never played before.

But softball was not the only "first" for Taher. It was also the first time Taher met an Israeli. He said he wants to talk to the other teens about his experience as a Palestinian.

"I want to make change," he said. "And I want to have a voice to show to people what Palestine is and what we truly do, who are Palestinians and what we suffer."

The trip also marked the first time that Shachar has met a Palestinian.

"A success for me would be to get to know the Palestinians better and what do they really want, and how they feel about the situation that's going on in Israel," he said. "It's so weird because we're here trying to get to know each other, and back home there's missiles. It's crazy."

Some people may think the program doesn't do any good, but Gordon said it does.

"The other option is to do nothing, and to me that's not an acceptable option," he said. "Something has to be done, and this is what we chose to do. We're giving them an opportunity to learn something about the other side."
