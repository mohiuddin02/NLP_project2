WASHINGTON — In 1794, a Portuguese slave ship crashed on the rocks off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa. It was taking about 400 slaves from Mozambique in Africa to Brazil. About half of the slaves died in the rough waters. The slaves who lived were resold and sent to South America to work on Brazil's sugar plantations.

Two items retrieved from the shipwreck of the São José-Paquete de Africa are now headed to Washington, D.C. One is an iron ballast, a weight that is carried on a ship to keep it stable. The other is a wooden pulley block, which is part of a machine used to lift heavy objects onto boats. The items will be displayed next year in an exhibition on slavery in the new National Museum of African American History and Culture.

"These will be part of the list of 'I've got to see this,'" predicted Lonnie Bunch, the museum's founding director. He was in South Africa Monday, where officials announced the long-term loan of the objects from the Iziko Museums.

## Telling A Full, Complex Story

The artifacts represent a significant addition to the newest Smithsonian museum, which is set to open next year in Washington, D.C.

"I'm not attempting to tell a narrative," Bunch said. He said the goal isn't so much to tell a story, but to create a space with a few artifacts that have powerful meaning, "almost like religious relics."

The National Museum of African American History and Culture was created by Congress in 2003. The $540 million building will open with 11 exhibitions, including the one on slavery. The museum has already collected important items from the time period of slavery. They include iron shackles for a child, a bill of sale for a 10-year-old slave boy, and a 19th-century slave cabin from South Carolina.

Like those pieces, the objects from the shipwreck will help people understand the "grand historical story" of slavery, said the museum's curator Paul Gardullo.

"We have many items that tell a full and complex story of slavery ... and the way it shaped our nation and the modern world. This will add to that in a unique way," Gardullo said.

He added that, while the ballast and pulley block are simple objects, they can still help visitors think about slavery in an emotional way.

## Long-Term Object Loan

The agreement between the Iziko Museums and the Smithsonian calls for the objects to be on loan for at least 10 years, Bunch said. "We leave that open because part of this is the research and excavation. There might be objects we don't know about yet."

The loan agreement is an important development in the Slave Wreck Project. The global effort was launched in 2008 to study the slave trade through the discovery and archaeological study of shipwrecks.

The National Museum of African American History and Culture has been working on the project with five other organizations. They include the Iziko Museums and George Washington University.

"It's a great collaboration that brings us across the ocean," Gardullo said. "We've created this new model, engaging in these conversations and looking at new ways to do this work."

## Slave Wreck Project Discoveries

The São José shipwreck was first discovered in the 1980s but was misidentified as an older Dutch boat. In 2008, researchers with the Slave Wreck Project chose the site as its first undertaking. They began to explore the underwater location and conduct research in the cities the ship was thought to have visited.

Since 2010, project researchers have uncovered documents in Portugal that have revealed who owned the ship. The records also indicate what type of cargo the ship was carrying when it departed Mozambique. There is also evidence that the ship's captain bought a slave from a sheikh, a local leader.

Officials involved in the project are in Cape Town this week for a series of discussions. They hope that the richly detailed story of the São José shipwreck is just the start of their discoveries.

"One of the last areas that can provide us with new knowledge (of the slave trade) is underwater," Bunch said. "My hope is this will be a long-term research-driven project and that there will be other wrecks we can identify, and ultimately, I'd like to see over a period of time different artifacts come to the museum."
