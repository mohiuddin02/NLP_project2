MEXICO CITY, Mexico — People who dig up things from the past have found something. They found a passageway in Mexico. It is like a tunnel. This passageway might go to the resting place of an Aztec leader. 

The Aztecs were a powerful people. They ruled from the year 1325 to 1521. The Aztecs lived where Mexico is now. 

The passageway was found at one of their most important places of prayer. It is called Templo Mayor.

## Knocking On Old Doorways

People believe the Aztecs burned their leaders after they died. Their bodies were turned to ash. The remains have never been found. 

Leonardo Lopez Lujan digs up remains from history. He led the group that found the passageway. It goes into the middle of a room. Kings were believed to have been burned there after they died. 

The passageway comes to an end. Then there are two blocked doorways.

Workers filled the tunnel with dirt for two years. They were working on one of the doorways.

That work is almost done.

## Wait And See What Is There

Leonardo hopes to start digging again in 2016.

He wants to go into the passageway. He wants to find out what is behind the two doors. Leonardo thinks there will be containers holding the remains of Aztec leaders. He could be wrong, he said. 

Finding remains of those leaders would make Mexico proud. The country has few remains from the Aztecs. 

Leonardo is being careful. He says his idea is just a guess. There might not even be graves at the end of the passageway. He is patient to find out.
