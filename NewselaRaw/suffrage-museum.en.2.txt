Alice Stokes Paul was a leader in the fight for women's rights. She co-founded the National Woman's Party in 1916 as American women were fighting for the right to vote.

As late as the 1970s, she was still answering the door at the National Women's Party headquarters, a red brick building at the corner of Second Street and Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C.

## Women's Suffrage Movement

Stokes Paul died in 1977, but the house is still there. It's called the Sewall-Belmont House, and it's still the headquarters of the National Woman's Party. Today, the group runs the house as a museum to the women's suffrage movement, to fight for suffrage, or the right to vote. The U.S. Constitution only allowed men to vote. Women struggled for years to gain voting rights. They had to convince Congress and the states to amend, or change, the Constitution. The 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote in 1920.

In 2020, the 19th Amendment will turn 100. The question is, will the National Woman's Party and the Sewall-Belmont House be around to celebrate the anniversary?

The house is likely to be around — it is protected as a historic place. The house has a unique distinction: it is thought to be the only private house burned by the British during the War of 1812, after a resident took a potshot at British soldiers.

## Museum Needs More Money

Still, the house's role as a women's history museum is threatened. It takes a lot of money to maintain a 200-year-old building, and money is running short.

"When winter comes, I'm terrified of a cracked pipe in the basement," said Page Harrington, the director of the Sewall-Belmont House Museum.

Right now, she is the only full-time employee at the house. Last year she had to spend $90,000 to have mold removed from the library's heating and air conditioning system. That meant cutting the hours of her employees, moving some of them from full-time to part-time.

Money may be tight but Harrington is determined that the museum will survive. "We will fight tooth and nail before we go quietly into the night," she said.

The Sewall-Belmont House tells the story of a determined group of women who put their lives on the line to get the vote for half the nation's population.

## Protesters Arrested In 1917

After a demonstration in front of the White House in 1917, many female protesters were arrested and sent to the Occoquan Workhouse, a prison. At the Workhouse, some of the prisoners began hunger strikes, and were force-fed. Others were beaten.

Today, a set of steps from the Occoquan Workhouse is on display outside the Sewall-Belmont House, reminding visitors of the sacrifices made by the women's rights pioneers.

In October 1916, a young leader of the movement — Inez Milholland — collapsed while giving a speech in Los Angeles. She was in poor health and suffering from anemia — a blood condition that can cause fatigue. She had been advised not to go on the speaking tour.

After her death a month later at age 30, The New York Times called Milholland an "idol of the suffragists and one of the most beautiful women in the United States."

## Suffragette On A White Horse

A wonderful painting inside the museum shows Milholland as most Americans knew her: wearing a white cape and riding a white horse. That's what she wore when she led a suffrage parade through Washington on the day before Woodrow Wilson became president in 1913.

The National Woman's Party's big victory was winning women the right to vote, but it worked on other causes as well.

Over time, the National Woman's Party saw its influence fade. Younger feminists may have seen the older women's rights pioneers as old-fashioned and out-of-touch.

## Newspapers, Tea And Soap

There is an antique vibe to the Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum, with its black-and-white photographs, fading banners and old newsprint. The gift shop sells tea and soap, among other items. The National Woman's Party ran tea rooms to raise money. They sold soap, too — arguing that giving women the vote would help "clean up" politics.

It may be old-fashioned, but this is the stuff of history, after all.

"We are still here," she said. "It's a lifeline to the past. It draws a connection to the women who came before us."

In 1974, Stokes Paul was interviewed by American Heritage Magazine, and asked to describe her part in the struggle for women's rights.

"I always feel ... the movement is a sort of mosaic," she said. "Each of us puts in one little stone, and then you get a great mosaic at the end."
