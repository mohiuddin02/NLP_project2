WASHINGTON â€” Making a grocery run for the astronauts on the International Space Station might not be as cool as transporting the astronauts themselves into orbit. But several companies are fighting for the job. NASA is having companies compete for a contract to fly cargo to the station in unmanned rocket ships.

People who study the aerospace industry say the competition among the companies is a sign. It means that commercial spaceflight is going through a renaissance, or rebirth.

## Eager Space Racers

It appears that at least five space companies have sent in proposals for the work. Even giant companies want the job. Some of those sending proposals, such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, did not bother to apply for the work the last time. In a new sort of space race, the contract has touched off an intense competition. Both defense contractors, which usually build military equipment, and new space start-ups are eager for the NASA contract.

Years ago, NASA, which is run by the government, created a plan to give people from private companies the job of transporting supplies to the space station in low Earth orbit. NASA said it did not have enough money to transport supplies. It said it needed to focus its scientists on bigger projects, such as Mars.

Some members of Congress and others criticized the decision, arguing that businesses could not be trusted with such high-stakes work. They said the business of spaceflight should be left to NASA. But in the years since, NASA's decision to depend on commercial companies helped jump-start the commercial space industry. These new companies have grown stronger by raising money from the private investors. Unlike NASA, they do not have to rely on tax dollars and decisions by lawmakers.

## SpaceX Blazing The Trail

For the past few years, two companies have been sending supplies to the space station.

One of them is SpaceX. A company run by the founder of Tesla, billionaire Elon Musk, won a $1.6 billion contract with NASA. So far, SpaceX has made five successful trips to the space station and the company is scheduled for a sixth trip in April.

The other company to win the cargo contract is Orbital Sciences, which is now called Orbital ATK. Their unmanned rocket exploded shortly after takeoff last year. The explosion caused people to ask whether NASA should be using so many private businesses for space work.

Yet the explosion did not lower the enthusiasm for outsourcing the work at NASA. People are still excited by SpaceX's success. However, the work is also necessary. Because of NASA's reduced funding, the government agency does not really have a choice but to hire contractors to do the work for it, experts said.

## Funding Pours In

The private space industry has been kept afloat by billionaires such as Musk.

But now others are also looking to give money to space companies. On a recent trip to Silicon Valley, Eric Stallmer, the president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, said many other investors feared they might miss out on money-making opportunities.

In January, SpaceX announced it had received a $1 billion investment from Google and Fidelity Bank. Planet Labs, which builds and operates satellites, also announced this year that it had received $95 million in funding.

The money, or interest, in space was not there just a few years ago.

At the time of the last cargo contract, "the environment looked different," said Marco Caceres, who studies the aerospace and defense industries. "A lot of people were saying this is wrong; NASA has to have its own rocket."

SpaceX's successful launches made the once unheard of startup famous. It also demonstrated that there is money to be made in space.

## "We've Proven The System Works"

Last year, NASA awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing, worth some $6.8 billion, to take astronauts to the space station. Now, in the coming months, it is expected to award another contract for cargo resupply. The new contract could also be worth billions.

Fresh off its win to take astronauts to the space station, Boeing thinks it has a good shot. Its CST-100 capsule, originally designed for astronauts, could be easily reconfigured to handle cargo, said John Mulholland. He is a Boeing vice president in its space programs.

Despite the explosion in October, Orbital ATK said its experience delivering cargo to the space station unsuccessfully gives it an edge. "We've proven the system works and works extremely well," spokesman Barron Beneski said. "NASA knew we were a partner they could rely on."

A spokesman for SpaceX still will not say whether it will apply for the contract, but many experts believe it will.

The world's largest military contractor, Lockheed Martin, is in as well. The company is promising to unveil "an innovative, reliable solution" at a private event this week. Lockheed makes the Orion space capsule, which late last year NASA launched on a historic mission. The Orion sent a spacecraft farther than any vehicle designed for human travel had gone in 40 years. No one was onboard the test flight of the Orion, which will someday carry astronauts into deep space.
