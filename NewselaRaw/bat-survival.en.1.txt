HACKENSACK, N.J. â€” While New Jersey's little brown bat population has nearly died off from a fungal infection called white nose syndrome, another species, the big brown bat, appears to be benefiting. Its numbers have risen as much as 50 percent in the state since the disease first hit in 2009, experts say.

The picture looks grim for little brown bats. Their population has plunged about 90 percent since 2008, when their hibernating numbers were about 30,000 in New Jersey. Now there are so few that the species might not be able to recover at all, experts say. Birth rates can't keep up since the females produce only one pup a year.

Big brown bats are also infected with the disease but have actually thrived since white nose struck. A variety of reasons explains it, including the way the bats hibernate and even their body size. In fact, their numbers are increasing so much, that they have begun to take over summer sleeping spots once occupied by little brown bats.

## There Might Be Some Hope

Despite the dismal prospects for little brown bats, researchers have grasped at a few hopeful signs. Some little brown bats that have been marked for research are returning to hibernate each year in the same caves and abandoned mine shafts. It shows that at least one small group has managed to fight off the disease.

One idea as to why is the possibility that they have become immune and their bodies fight the disease. Another theory is that they were born with a gene that helps resist the fungus, so they never got sick in the first place.

"Right now natural selection is at work allowing those bats with certain traits to survive," said DeeAnn Reeder, an expert on white nose syndrome at Bucknell University. "The ones surviving must be a little different, a little hardier."

## Millions Of Bats Have Died

Federal officials have estimated that 7 million bats of various species have died nationally since white nose was first detected in a cave near Albany, New York, in 2006. The disease has now spread to 25 states.

The bats become infected while hibernating as the fungus leaves a white powder on their muzzles, ears and wings. It causes the bats to move around while sleeping, which burns calories and the fat the bats stored up for their hibernation. Since bats don't eat when they hibernate, they die of hunger.

The loss of bats can affect humans too. Bats help eat vast quantities of insects that carry diseases and damage farmers' crops. Bats eat so many insects that they save U.S. farmers $4 billion worth of fruits and vegetables every year.

## A Long Road To Survival

Researchers see some bright spots for the little brown bat. Even though their overall numbers are still declining, the survival rate for hibernating little brown bats in New Jersey has been rising a bit each year. The rate was 66 percent in 2010, and 71 percent last winter, according to research conducted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Brooke Maslo, a wildlife ecologist at Rutgers University.

It's not enough to save the bats yet. The survival rate would have to grow beyond 100 percent for the population to start replacing the thousands lost to the disease. "At some point we may not have enough bats left to replace those being lost," Maslo said.

Across the country, researchers are close to finding treatments. Some are looking to see if a certain bacteria that fights off fungus could help the bats battle infection. Others are studying a fungus that might be more powerful than the white nose fungus but would not kill any bats. Still other researchers are looking at a substance that fights fungus called chitosan. It is found in the shells of sea creatures.

## White Nose Takes Hold

Jeremy Coleman is coordinating the fight against white nose syndrome at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He says any of the treatments being studied might hurt other animals in the area if scientists sprayed an entire cave of hibernating bats. As a result, Coleman said whole caves will not be treated for a while. Even if the bats could survive the disease, it could take hundreds of years for them to reach their population before white nose, he said.

Different types of bats have responded differently to white nose. A species called the tricolored bat and one called the northern long-eared bat have also been dying rapidly. But the Virginia big-eared bat has survived even in caves where other types of bats have been found dying all around them, Reeder said.

In New Jersey, big brown bats have actually increased in numbers, even though they are sometimes infected with white nose syndrome. MacKenzie Hall is a biologist at the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey. A recent report by Hall found that the population has grown 50 percent since white nose first appeared.

## Big Brown Bats Are ... Bigger

One key reason, Reeder said, is that big brown bats are larger. They lose less heat during hibernation, making it easier to sustain themselves on their stored body fat. When the fungus makes them move around, they burn less energy and don't starve to death like little brown bats.

Big brown bats also hibernate a month later and emerge a month earlier than little brown bats. Because they hibernate less, the disease has less of an impact on them. In addition, they hibernate in very small groups or alone. Little brown bats hibernate close together in large groups, making it easier for the disease to spread. Finally, unlike many bat species, big brown bats produce two pups a year, making it easier for them to increase their overall numbers.
