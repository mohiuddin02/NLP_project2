Paul Schmidt coaches a basketball team of fourth-graders in Edina, Minnesota. His players — Caylor, Gage, Tyler, Torin — are 9 and 10 years old. And they are playing to win.

In one game, the team swarmed their opponents like bees. They won the game by 19 points.

After the game, Schmidt quickly gathered the young players around him. He had only a few minutes to talk about their plan for the next game before it started.

This is the world of youth competitive basketball in Minnesota. The players grow up fast as they experience the intense competition that many love but others hate. Minnesota has long had ultra-competitive youth hockey. Now, youth basketball may be the next competitive sport for kids.

## More Kids Want To Play

More and more boys and girls are playing competitive basketball at younger and younger ages. Some teams are for third-graders, or even for second-graders.

Ten years ago, the Minnesota Youth Athletic Services (MYAS) began hosting a state tournament for boys' fourth-grade traveling teams. When it started, 20 teams played. Last year, 115 teams played.

"Too many parents over here think their kid is going be the next Minnesota Gopher," Todd Breyfogle said, shaking his head. "I won't say it's hockey-like, but it's close."

Breyfogle was a college basketball player. Still, he was unsure at first about signing up his son, Easton, to play on Edina's team. In the end, he did sign him up and before long, Breyfogle was sitting court-side, yelling to the team, "Come on, drive it!"

Edina's traveling basketball teams are part of a larger trend in Minnesota: more teams made up of fourth-graders. At the Cake Eater Classic — Edina's boys' basketball tournament for fourth- to eighth-graders — 234 teams competed from across the state.

Schmidt's team will play at least 40 games this winter. The fee to join one the team is $500, if you make the squad. Back in the fall, 44 fourth-graders tried out and 15 were cut. Experts from other areas were brought in to help judge the players.

## Parents Are Very Involved

"It's just really fun, especially if you're on a really good team," Schmidt's 10-year-old son, Lleyton, said between games at a weekend tournament. Was he tired? "Like, sort of," he replied.

It is not the kids, like Lleyton, who are asking to play competitive basketball, but the parents, said Rich Penick, the director at MYAS. "It's the parents that are driving it."

Deborah Edwards is the executive director of the Positive Coaching Alliance in Minnesota. The group tries to focus on how sports can help young people to grow. She said she shakes her head over what is happening. "Youth sports is so scheduled — it's over-scheduled," she said about how much time kids have to dedicate to the sport. "I think these traveling basketball teams just add to the over-scheduling of the kids."

Both parents and young players have many commitments when they are part of a traveling basketball team. There is time, travel, money. Some young players might not be ready for the tougher aspects of competitive sports, like getting cut from a team.

## A Little Extra Coaching

In Edina, the passionate parents have different ways of supporting their young athletes.

Giovanna Ingram is paying $75 an hour to have her son, Vinnie, get extra training from a former professional basketball player. She jokingly called herself an "over-the-top" parent.

She said she hopes her son will become good enough at basketball to win a scholarship to a good university. In that case, he could go to school for free, in exchange for playing for the school team.

She quickly added that "the end all is to keep him out of trouble, (keep) him healthy — maybe get a scholarship in the end."

Basketball parent Mike Munson sits on the bench with a tablet. He uses an app to look at the team's shots, or attempts to make a basket.

## Game-Day Stress

Parents of the players face problems of their own. It is expensive, for one. Doug Lundahl, whose son, Jake, wears number 21, talked of paying $110 for basketball shoes, $125 for a uniform and $120 for an Under Armour gym bag with Jake's name on it.

Then there is the stress of watching the games. "They've had so many close games," Lundahl said, standing and watching a practice. "As a parent, you age real fast."
