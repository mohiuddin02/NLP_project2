JEFFERSON COUNTY, Colo. â€” Major floods have struck the state of Colorado. Rescue teams spent the weekend trying to find people. Officials say more people were missing on Sunday than the day before. Hundreds of people remained unaccounted for. The number of people thought killed by the floods rose, too.

Officials said at least 700 people were still listed as missing. Flooding washed out bridges and roads. Several central Colorado communities have been cut off.

Gov. John Hickenlooper said he hoped that many of the missing were simply unable to get in touch. He hoped they were already out of danger or staying with friends.

But he added that he was still worried. "I mean, there are many, many homes that have been destroyed." The governor made his comments on CNN.

## Record Rainfall Too Much To Handle

Larimer County police said an 80-year-old woman had probably been killed. That brings the death toll to six. The number could change.

A Larimer County spokesman said the woman had been injured. She could not get out of her house as floodwaters began surrounding it. The house was gone when neighbors came back to get her out. The woman is missing. Officials assume she is dead.

It began raining on Monday. By Wednesday the rainfall had set records. The National Weather Service reported as much as 9 to 10 inches of rain in just hours in many areas. The rain was too much for the ground to handle. It was already soaked.

Heavy rains have also stopped some rescue efforts.

Floods have damaged 4,500 square miles of eastern Colorado. As many as 100 roadways got damaged. Waters raged. They were so bad that they turned into 15- to 20-foot walls of water. They smashed through the area. Those waters destroyed dozens of bridges.

## Hit Worse In The Mountains

Boulder County was hit the hardest. Officials said that by Saturday, 3,500 people still had to stay away from home in the city of Boulder. This is called an evacuation order. Another 5,500 were under those evacuation orders in Longmont. At least 3,600 customers did not have gas. A total of 3,000 did not have electricity, just in Boulder.

Things were worse in the mountains. Power has been out for days. People have been told to boil their water before drinking it. They are waiting for supplies and rescue. Thousands of people sought shelter.

As of Sunday morning, 234 were not accounted for in Boulder County, said Liz Donaghey. She works at the Boulder Office of Emergency Management.

Larimer County authorities said 482 people were unaccounted for.

Donaghey stressed that not everyone on the list was missing. She said she hoped the number would become more clear as authorities try to remove names that are on the list more than once.

## Many Have No Phone Service

It has been difficult to get accurate numbers of the missing. Phones are not working in some of the hardest-hit areas.

Phone service was restored to some areas, so authorities hoped they could reach more people.

The National Guard has rescued 1,700 people from isolated areas. But helicopters cannot fly when the rain is heavy. Helicopters are important for reaching people where the roads have been flooded out.

Still, Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said things were starting to look up.

"I can tell you, while I felt hopeless on Friday, I felt a lot of hope, a lot of energy yesterday," Smith said.
