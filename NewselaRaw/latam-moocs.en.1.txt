ARMENIA, El Salvador â€” Roosemberth Palacios, a curly-haired 16-year-old, finds high school boring. So after the school day finishes, he logs onto his computer and hunts for challenges.

He's found them in difficult online courses offered by professors at Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

He says he's aced a course called "Machine Learning" by hot-shot Stanford professor Andrew Ng, scoring a perfect 100. And he took a sophomore-level course by MIT professor Anant Agarwal called "Circuits and Electronics," for which he got a 91.

To patch up some weakness he saw in his math skills, he took a course called "Numerical Analysis," offered online by the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland. The class was in French.

## The Rise Or Fall Of Higher Education?

So-called massive open online courses, or MOOCs, are creating controversy at universities in the United States. Some professors and administrators are labeling them the future, while others see in them the downfall of higher education.

A few superstar professors pull in upward of 10,000 students around the globe for free, or nearly free, courses. But others see the courses as a dangerous fad. They worry that MOOCs will drastically reduce the number of teachers hired, and turn professors into nothing more than glorified teaching assistants.

Critics also fear that meaningful classroom discussion will become a thing of the past, replaced by message boards and student-led forums.

Lost in the debate about online learning, however, is its impact in far-flung regions of the globe. It has certainly been a big plus for Roosemberth, according to his father, Dr. Roberto Palacios.

"At school, he hardly studies," the father said. "He just shows up and takes the exams." But it's not that Roosemberth isn't ambitious. "He wants to learn."

It's just, Roosemberth explained, that "I don't like simple things."

That was evident within minutes of arriving at the family's modest walk-up apartment, where the teenager showed off his workbench. On it were circuit boards he has been soldering, and his own proposal to build an unmanned helicopter.

## Attending Class At An Internet Cafe

Because of his knack for acing tests, Roosemberth was selected more than a year ago to take part in a gifted students program at the University of El Salvador. This is located in the capital, San Salvador, 20 miles to the east of his town. It was there he heard a talk by Carlos Martinez, an electrical engineering professor and strong advocate for online courses. The teenager signed up for MIT's "Circuits and Electronics" course.

He had to go to a nearby Internet cafe to hear the lectures by Agarwal, who is president of edX, an online-learning company. edX was set up in 2012 by MIT and Harvard and has offered 72 courses online.

"Sometimes I had to stay up very late," the teenager said. When that happened, "I'd tell myself, 'It's worth losing a little sleep over.'"

Indeed, despite the occasional sleepless night, Roosemberth was excited by the courses.

"They've been really worthwhile because I'm learning things I don't learn in school and that I don't think they even teach in the university here," he said. "For instance, we don't learn artificial intelligence here. We don't have labs for it."

U.S. professors who offer online courses say the ability to reach undiscovered bright students in the developing world is one of the benefits of online learning.

"Nobody would disagree that, by and large, intelligence and ability are distributed equally around the globe," said Armando Fox, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and director of a lab there studying online courses. "It's in everyone's best interest to find and cultivate that talent."

## Watching Experiments Online

Online courses increasingly are offered in different languages, including Spanish, French and Chinese. And technology helps ease the burden of understanding lectures in English, as most lectures have subtitles, and a Google translating tool can also be used.

Already, the impact of online courses is rippling across Latin America.

"Approximately 10 percent of the 1.3 million people on the edX platform come from Latin American countries," Dan O'Connell, a spokesman for edX, said. They come not only from heavily populated countries like Brazil and Mexico, but also from places such as Haiti, Belize and Uruguay.

"These students got into these courses enthusiastically," said Jorge Zetino Chicas, an engineering professor at the University of El Salvador. Part of the reason is that teaching styles differ. "We teach from textbooks," whereas MOOC professors "apply what they teach. This helps with understanding."

Mauricio Rodriguez, an engineering student, cracked a grin while telling of an MIT professor's experiment for an online "Electricity and Magnetism" course he took.

"The professor attached electrodes to a cucumber and you could see the cucumber burn," Rodriguez said. It was better than any textbook description of the principle under discussion, he added.

## Studying With People All Over The World

The university offers no credit for the online courses, but students want the prestige of a certificate for a completed course from MIT or other famous institutions.

Word of the online courses has spread to students outside of the sciences and engineering.

Nahiely Mendoza, 24, who graduated with a law degree in December, said she looked over the online listings and grew excited.

"I wanted to take 'Intellectual Property,' but I got in too late. So I signed up for 'Justice' by Professor Michael Sandel," Mendoza said, referring to a Harvard professor whose hugely popular course deals with justice, equality and democracy.

"I felt it was much harder than our university courses," Mendoza said. "I was used to classes that were more controlled by the professor." But the online course had study groups with people from all over the world, and she soon found herself hooked. Mendoza, who says she's "entertained by studying," has just signed up for two more classes.
