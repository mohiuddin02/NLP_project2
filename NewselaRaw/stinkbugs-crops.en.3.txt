Rinehart first noticed the problem five years ago. He saw brownish, sunken areas on the apples and peaches and thought the fruit was low in calcium. But spraying the fruit with calcium didn't help.

University of Maryland scientists cut open his fruit and examined it. Then it became clear that the problem was stink bugs. The bugs are more damaging to fruit than a lack of calcium, and they are also more unpredictable.

Rinehart owns Rinehart Orchards in Maryland. He said stink bugs damage one tenth to one fifth of his crop every year.

"They are a major, major issue in our orchards." Rinehart said. "It's nothing that you can take lightly."

## Can Escape The Cold

The stink bug is an invasive species. They came to North America in the late 1990s. Damage caused by the bugs was particularly severe in 2010 and 2011. Some Maryland growers like Rinehart are still dealing with stink bug-related damage. The problem can nearly ruin the worth of a fruit crop, he said. But others have seen damage ease.

Stink bugs pierce fruit with their mouths and suck sugar out. The damage may have decreased since 2010 and 2011. But there's no reason to believe the insect is in decline for good, said Gerry Brust. He is an expert in pest management at the University of Maryland.

"That's what insect populations do. It goes up, down," he said.

Even extreme weather is not enough to bring down the state's stink bug population. So the record low temperatures in many parts of the nation this winter are not solving the problem.

Stink bugs can escape the cold by living in dead or rotting trees, rock outcroppings or buildings, said Donald Weber. He studies bugs for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

"They're perfectly capable of surviving the winter," Weber said.

## "They're Not Going Away"

The insects have not just survived, though; they have expanded to more than 40 states. They have also reached parts of Canada and Europe, Weber said.

Rinehart said he has to look hard for stink bug damage. If he finds significant damage, he can spray something to keep bugs away. The spray is safe for the produce, but it also keeps away insects that help the fruit. Pesticides only help in the short term, Weber said.

Guy Moore, of Maryland's Larriland Farm, said that stink bugs brought devastating damage in 2010 and 2011. But they did not cause significant damage after that.

USDA scientists take samples of apples and peaches from his farm. They have been able to help watch the stink bug population and find damage. Moore hopes the stink bugs will be a smaller problem in the future.

Stink bugs have been in North America for a short period of time. As a result, scientists still do not know much about their population changes, Weber said.

"We've only had a few years; there's a lot of other things that can happen," he said. "We had a big cold snap this year; maybe that does nothing to them. We just don't know. The safe bet is they're not going away, and they're going to be a distinct and significant pest problem in the mid-Atlantic states for a while."

## Tiny Wasps As Predators

Some predators are slowly starting to recognize stink bugs as food, Weber said. Scientists are considering introducing natural enemies to feed on the stink bugs.

Identifying and deploying natural enemies could take a long time. Introducing a stink bug predator could take three to five years. Scientists from all three North American countries would have to agree to let it happen, Weber said.

There will likely be a plan to introduce tiny wasps as predators of stink bugs within a year, Weber said. The wasps lay their eggs on other insects' eggs. Then the newly hatched wasps eat the eggs of their prey — including stink bugs.

Chemists have also copied the stink bug's pheromones, or scent, Weber said. The pheromone could allow growers to draw the insects away from produce.

But for now, growers will have to continue to use short-term measures like pesticides to minimize damage.

"In this business, you are at the mercy of nature. Stink bugs are something that have definitely added to that and added in a very strong way," Rinehart said. "Yeah, stink bugs are a bummer, man."
