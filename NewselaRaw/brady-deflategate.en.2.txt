With movie-star good looks and four Super Bowl championships, Tom Brady has been an NFL golden boy,

But even a golden boy has to play by the rules.

The NFL delivered that message loud and clear Monday. It suspended the New England Patriots star quarterback without pay for the first four games of next season.

## "The Integrity Of the Game"

The punishment comes days after the football league announced results of an investigation. It found Brady was "likely generally aware" that team workers had conspired to let the air out of the Patriots' footballs for last season's American Football Conference (AFC) championship game. Deflating the balls made them easier to throw and catch.

The Patriots were fined $1 million. They also were stripped of their first-round draft pick next year and a fourth-round selection in 2017. Equipment workers John Jastremski and Jim McNally were suspended indefinitely. McNally had referred to himself as "the deflator" in text messages, according to investigators.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said it was critical to protect "the integrity of the game."

## Setting Up An October Showdown

Unless Brady's suspension is reduced, he will not be able to play until an October game against the Indianapolis Colts.

During the Jan. 18 championship game, the Colts told the NFL that the footballs were suspicious, and they were tested at halftime. Most of them were under the minimum of 12.5 pounds per square inch.

The Patriots won that game, 45-7, and two weeks later defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.

Brady's agent, Don Yee, called the NFL report "an incredibly frail exercise in fact-finding and logic." He said Brady would appeal the suspension.

Team owner Robert Kraft released a statement saying that the decision against the Patriots was not based on good evidence. He also said the punishment was too severe.

## Is The Penalty Fair?

Kraft called the investigation "one-sided." He complained that he had scientific evidence that cold weather caused the problem, but it had been ignored. "Tom Brady has our unconditional support. Our belief in him has not wavered," Kraft added.

Brady's suspension is twice as long as what was originally imposed last year on Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice. The Baltimore player struck the woman who was then his fiance and knocked her unconscious in an elevator. When video of the attack came out, Rice was suspended.

In Brady's case, reaction to the penalties for what has been dubbed "Deflategate" was mixed.

Former NFL linebacker Shawne Merriman was in favor of the suspension. "It's a good thing the @nfl suspended Tom Brady now everyone knows that NOBODY is above the system," he wrote on Twitter.

## "More Probable Than Not"

Former NFL tight end Jake Ballard thought differently. "4 games?? What a joke!" he wrote. He said that the crime did not match the  punishment, and the suspension was too severe. He ended his tweet with #lostmorerespectfortheNFL."

The 243-page report released by the NFL concluded it was "more probable than not" that a Patriots employee deflated the team's footballs. The report stated that Brady was at least generally aware that the footballs deflated.

The Patriots have been accused of cheating in the past.

However, not all NFL rule breaking results in a strong penalty. Last season, during a 12-degree game in Minneapolis, Vikings workers were captured on camera using heaters to warm the footballs, which is against the rules. The league gave the Vikings a warning. In 2012, the San Diego Chargers were fined $20,000 for failing to immediately surrender illegal "Stickum" towels when officials asked for them. The towels improve the grip on the ball.

## "Accountable For His Actions"

Brady refused to give investigators access to his email and text messages. His unwillingness to fully cooperate — along with the team's past history of cheating — likely led to a heavier penalty.

"Each player, no matter how accomplished and otherwise respected, has an obligation to comply with the rules," said NFL Executive Vice President Troy Vincent. A player "must be held accountable for his actions when those rules are violated and the public's confidence in the game is called into question."

## Love Him Or Hate Him?

By every indication, Brady is still as popular as ever among Patriots' fans. He was cheered enthusiastically last week, one day after the NFL report was released, at an event at Salem State University in Massachusetts. And there were loud boos when journalist Jim Gray asked him whether the controversy diminished New England's Super Bowl championship.

Brady smiled broadly before answering, "Absolutely not," to more cheers.

To some, that showed the arrogance of the Patriots, while others argued both sides.

"If you hate the Patriots you're going to say those guys always cheat," said Rich Gannon, a former NFL quarterback and league's Most Valued Player. "But if Tom Brady had 12.5 pounds of pressure in those footballs or 11, what difference does it make? He's still one of the greatest quarterbacks ever. But the bottom line is, the rules were violated and there's a price to pay."
