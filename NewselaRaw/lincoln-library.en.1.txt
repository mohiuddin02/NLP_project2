Every morning over breakfast, historian and author Daniel Stowell combs through the newspaper to get a head start on his workday.

He is looking for events that happened exactly 150 years ago. His news comes via iPad from the online archives of the Daily National Republican, which has not published a paper since 1866.

Stowell is the director and editor of The Papers of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois. He and his co-workers are employing modern technology to make historical Lincoln documents accessible to anyone with a computer.

They are working to let anyone with a computer, smartphone or tablet see the 150,000-plus documents written by or to the 16th U.S. president. So far, they have posted online about 100,000 legal documents from Lincoln's law career, and are chronicling as many day-to-day events in Lincoln's life as possible. So far, more than 7,100 days are documented on thelincolnlog.org, most of them from when Lincoln was an adult.

## On This Date In Abe's History

Wondering what Lincoln was doing on your birthday — or any date — more than a century ago? On March 9, 1844, he paid 25 cents for a pair of woolen mittens. On Feb. 9, 1864, he was sitting for several portraits, including the one used for the $5 bill. Not historic enough? Read the details of Nov. 19, 1863, the day he delivered the Gettysburg Address.

"Millions of people around the world are fascinated by Abraham Lincoln," said Stowell, also director of its Center For Digital Initiatives.

Even documents about Lincoln's death and those written in the present will help give people a better understanding of Lincoln. The citizenlincoln.org website allows researchers to read the condolence letters sent by leaders from around the world after Lincoln's assassination 150 years ago this April. They can also read what modern world leaders say about Lincoln today.

For example, there's a letter of sympathy from Queen Victoria to Mary Todd Lincoln on April 29, 1865, calling his assassination "so terrible a calamity." There's another letter from Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, to the museum in October. In it, he said how he drew strength from Lincoln. He noted that streets in Israel are named after Lincoln, who, according to the prime minister, had a desire to visit Jerusalem that went unfulfilled.

## Reaching Lincoln Enthusiasts

A new website, which will be launched in April — mylincoln.org — will let museum-goers participate in activities like scavenger hunts and get information about the exhibits.

"I definitely see digitalization and Internet as a way to reach a young audience," Stowell said. "But the idea is to reach out to museum-goers and Lincoln enthusiasts of all ages."

Digitizing physically preserves these fragile papers and allows people to see them, he said. He and his staff also want to help readers understand what they read by linking related letters, identifying people and events, and providing historical context.

## Dear Mr. President

Amy Henrikson and Joan Walters are among seven volunteers who work on the project deciphering and transcribing handwritten letters and documents.

Poor handwriting and hurried script can make their job challenging. And sometimes it appears the author was writing from a seat in a bumpy carriage, said Henrikson. But all of it is interesting, she said, and "much of it is moving."

She recalls a letter written to Lincoln by a Louisiana teacher who begged the president for a job up north. The man believed he was the only Republican in the state and feared for his family after speaking out against the Southern states seceding from the nation.

Walters volunteers 40 hours a week and has transcribed more than 8,000 documents.

"I think my job is terribly important because our goal is to make this accessible to everybody in the world who has a computer," she said.

She recalls transcribing a letter written by Lincoln in February 1861 to the gentleman who was going to rent his Springfield home for $350 a year.

"Here is this man, inheriting one of the most difficult times in American history, and he is taking the time to write a contract for his house," Walters said. "His feet were always planted on the ground. He never was too big for any job that needed to be done."

## "A True Genius"

Stowell said they have digitized documents scattered in more than 400 archives and more than 200 private collections worldwide. But he knows there are many more documents, particularly from the time of Lincoln's presidency, to still uncover.

Recently, Daniel Weinberg, owner of The Abraham Lincoln Book Shop in Chicago, alerted Stowell to a collection of 45 Lincoln documents in the shop. Stowell came to Chicago with his scanner to find that only eight were already in the state's database.

"I've seen a lot of Lincoln signatures," said Weinberg, who has worked in the shop since 1971. "Are there significant Lincolns still out there to be found? I can't say there aren't because every once in awhile something significant does come out."

Weinberg said he is always willing to share any newly discovered documents with the state for the sake of research and history.

"This man was a true genius," Weinberg said. "As a person, his moralities, his ethics, organization skills, use of mathematics. He's iconic. Why would we not want people worldwide to be able to learn more from him?"
