Google is getting into the car business. The technology company is hoping its new self-driving cars will turn drivers into passengers.

Google said on Tuesday that it plans to test about 200 of its own self-driving cars.

"We've been working toward the goal of vehicles that can shoulder the entire burden of driving," Google wrote on its blog. "They will take you where you want to go at the push of a button."

Google's main goal is not to be a carmaker, like General Motors or Toyota. Instead, it wants to develop self-driving technology. The company said that its self-driving software will "improve road safety and help people who can't drive."

## Buckle Up For The Ride

The testing program will start later this summer. A handful of self-driving cars will hit the roads around Google's California offices. The test cars will have manual controls. That way test drivers can take over if something goes wrong.

But Google plans to build most of the cars as fully self-driving. That means no steering wheel, no gas or brake pedal.

Inside the car will be two seats with seat belts and space for belongings. There will also be a screen showing where the car is going and buttons to start and stop.

The cars were built with safety in mind. They have sensors that get rid of blind spots and look in every direction for more than 200 yards. The top speed of the first cars will be only 25 miles per hour (mph).

## Smart Technology Behind The Wheel

"We're going to learn a lot from this experience," Google said. "If the technology develops as we hope, we'll work with partners to bring this technology into the world safely."

The small electric cars were built in Michigan. Google used parts from suppliers to major car brands. The electronics and software to control them were assembled in Silicon Valley.

Many of the largest automakers will probably now work faster on their own self-driving cars. These big car companies are also likely to be working on their own software. But smaller brands like Subaru or Jaguar/Land Rover could look to use Google's software for their cars.

Change may happen faster than people think. Many automakers expect they will have fully self-driving cars on the road by 2020. By 2025, as many as 230,000 of these self-drivers could be sold each year around the world. And that number could rise to 11.8 million 10 years later, a study found.

## Laws Are Not Quite Caught Up Yet

There could also be fewer accidents as self-driving cars become more common. That's because most of today's crashes are caused by people making mistakes, the study found.

In addition, Google's cars could help people who can't drive because of their age, disability or lack of money. Cities could have self-driving car-share programs. Users could take the cars when they need them for short trips around town.

But there are two key hurdles for self-driving cars: cost and laws.

Self-driving cars could at first cost thousands of dollars more than traditional cars.

And U.S. laws have a lot of catching up to do. Currently only four states allow self-driving vehicles on public roads: California, Nevada, Michigan and Florida. In those states, a licensed, sober driver must be in the driver's seat at all times. That driver has to be ready and willing to take control of the car.

Google's own car hopes to help the laws catch up to the technology.

"Just imagine: You can take a trip downtown at lunchtime without a 20-minute buffer to find parking," Google's blog said. "Seniors can keep their freedom even if they can't keep their car keys. And drunk and distracted driving? History."
