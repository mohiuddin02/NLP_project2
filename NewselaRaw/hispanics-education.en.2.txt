AUSTIN, Texas â€” Manuel Ramirez was the first person in his family to get a college degree. It wasn't easy.

His parents brought him to the United States illegally from Guanajuato, Mexico, when he was 8 years old. They made just enough to get by with day labor and house cleaning. They could not afford to pay their son's roughly $10,000 cost for classes at the University of Texas at Austin. Instead, Manuel earned extra money as a server in restaurants, coloring hair at a spa, translating Spanish, working in a rock quarry and building fences at a ranch.

Last year, Ramirez earned a bachelor's degree in international relations and global studies. He now works as a union organizer. He also helps professors coach low-income students and is busy lobbying against a bill that would end in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants.

"It's not even about immigration. Just make higher education affordable so all the people can get an education," Ramirez said. "If Texas is going to be competitive, it has to produce great minds and give them a job."

## More Jobs ... For Educated Workers

U.S. population growth is being driven by Hispanics. But in Texas and 24 other states, whites are at least twice as likely as Hispanics to have college degrees. States are beginning to highlight that gap as a serious problem.

More jobs are being created for educated workers. There are fewer jobs for high school graduates, let alone high school dropouts.

"It's not just the Southwest. It's increasingly true across the country," said Steve Murdock, a sociology professor at Rice University. Murdock has been arguing for decades that Texas and other states must do a better job of educating minorities, especially Hispanics. Otherwise, he said, employers will go overseas to find skilled workers.

Murdock says rising dropout rates and falling family incomes will put an increasing strain on the state if Hispanics are left behind. Murdock has estimated the state's population going forward. If he is correct, poverty rates in the state could increase from 14.4 percent in 2010 to 17.7 percent in 2050.

## Highlighting The Education Gap

Republican Governor Greg Abbott referred to the issue at his inauguration this month. "If Texas is to remain the leader at creating jobs we must become the leader at educating our children," Abbott said.

Two months ago, the Texas Association of Business rented a billboard. It criticized low graduation rates at the University of Texas at San Antonio, where about 44 percent of students are Hispanic. The organization's chief executive, Bill Hammond, said the billboard will highlight this issue.

Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which maintain aircraft in San Antonio, saw a need for college-educated skilled workers to replace retirees. They helped create a program for local high school students to work their way toward degrees.

Hispanic immigrants, documented or not, have to overcome daunting obstacles to earn college degrees. About 30 percent of Hispanics living in the state are immigrants.

## College Application Process Can Be Stressful

Teri Albrecht is director of International Student and Scholar Services at the University of Texas at Austin. She said the college application process can be especially stressful for immigrant students. For many of them it is when they find out for the first time that they're unauthorized immigrants.

"Their parents were protecting them, not telling them the full story, and then they're hit with all these barriers," Albrecht said.

But even native-born Hispanics can have a hard time earning college degrees. "Keep in mind that many of the families of Texas Hispanics have been since here before there was a Texas and before it joined the U. S.," Murdock said. "Many of our Hispanics are native-born and experienced decades of deprivation and had few opportunities to obtain competitive levels of education."

## Paying For College Is A Challenge

Native-born Hispanic college students face unusual money problems. They need advice and role models for academic achievement, said Michael Soto, a professor at Trinity University in San Antonio. Soto grew up near the Mexican border. He has degrees from Stanford and Harvard universities.

"The ability to successfully graduate from high school and successfully complete college is not rocket science. We know what works. There are a number of proven programs for students from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds," said Soto.

President Barack Obama has proposed free community college for two years. It could be a breakthrough, Soto said. The idea was pioneered in Chicago and Tennessee, he said.

"Those places have very wisely determined that it make sense to invest in at least the first two years for all students," Soto said. "It's investing in the future."
