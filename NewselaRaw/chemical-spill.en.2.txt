CHARLESTON, W.Va.  — Water was declared safe to drink in parts of West Virginia's capital on Tuesday. But life has not yet to returned to normal for many residents in Charleston. Around 300,000 people haven't been able to use running water in the five days since a chemical spill last week.

It could still be days before everyone in the area is cleared to use the water. Officials said water in certain areas is safe to drink and wash with, but people must flush out their systems first. They warned that the water may still have a slight licorice-type odor. This raised the anxieties of some residents who believed the sweet-smelling chemical might still be in their water.

"I wouldn't drink it for a while," said Wanda Blake, a worker in the electronics section of a Charleston Kmart. She is concerned that she drank some of the potentially harmful water before she knew about the spill.

By Tuesday, officials had given the green light to about 35 percent of the water customers who were affected. Last Thursday's spill affected 100,000 customers in a nine-county area, or about 300,000 people in all.

## Countless Lawsuits Filed

The crisis shuttered schools, businesses and restaurants, and truckloads of water had to be brought in from out of state. People were told to use the tap water only to flush their toilets. They were advised not to drink or wash with it. On Tuesday, hospitals were flushing out their water systems, as were schools, which hoped to open again on Wednesday.

In downtown Charleston, the first section of the city where water was declared safe, few signs of the crisis were visible on Monday. Hotel guests were informed they could use everything but the ice machines.

Yet many businesses remained closed in neighborhoods further out of the city. Anthony Majestro is a lawyer who represents several businesses that lost money while shut down during the chemical leak. He said he has lost count of the lawsuits filed over the spill.

The Fire Department continued to give away cases of bottled water for free. Late on Monday afternoon, a stream of vehicles crept through a station about a mile north of downtown to pick up water.

Fire Captain Eddie Moore estimated that firefighters, police officers and volunteers had given away more than 80,000 16-ounce bottles just on Monday – enough to fill two tractor-trailers. Firefighters loaded several cases into every vehicle that drove through the station.

Inside the station, the firefighters were surviving on frozen dinners, as they still don't want to use the running water. Fire Captain Moore said the licorice smell from the taps was especially strong on Monday.

## Three Days Without A Shower

Bernard Casdorph, 64, said he was making two trips a day to the fire station for water for his friends and family. He picked up bottles for himself, his mother, her neighbor and a cousin who uses a wheelchair.

But Casdorph said that going three days without having a shower was enough for him to set aside his fears of the chemical in the water.

"I slipped. I went ahead and took a shower anyway. Maybe I shouldn't have," Casdorph said. "I just couldn't take it. I asked everybody, 'Am I turning green or blue?'"

Officials were lifting the ban on drinking water slowly and carefully to make sure that the water system was not overwhelmed by excessive demand. This could cause more water quality and service problems.

An online map showed a very small area in blue where the water was back to normal on Monday. The map still showed a vast area across nine counties colored in the "do not use" red.

The water company gave every customer 1,000 gallons of water, which was likely more than enough to flush out a system. The average residential customer uses about 3,300 gallons a month.

The crisis started last Thursday when a chemical used for washing coal leaked into the Elk River in Charleston. The chemical spilled from a plant operated by Freedom Industries. Authorities first started receiving complaints about a sweet, licorice odor in the air. Officials then discovered the chemical leaking out of a one-inch hole in the bottom of a 40,000-gallon steel tank.

## Chemical Spill Investigation

State officials believe about 7,500 gallons leaked out from the tank, but some of the chemical was contained before flowing into the river. So it's not clear exactly how much entered the water supply.

Federal authorities have now opened an investigation into the spillage. Tests have shown that the chemical in the water was always below poisonous levels and in some samples there was no trace of the chemical at all.

Some Charleston residents put plastic bags around faucets so they were reminded not to use the water, while others left town to take a shower and find an open restaurant. Only 14 people exposed to the water were admitted to the hospital and one were in serious condition. No fish kills were reported and there was no effect on other water life.

Even in its strongest form this chemical isn't deadly. But people were warned they shouldn't wash even their clothes in the affected water. The chemical compound can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation and rashes to vomiting and diarrhea.

Freedom Industries president Gary Southern said on Friday night that the leak had been stopped. But officials from the company responsible for this chemical spillage have otherwise declined to comment.
