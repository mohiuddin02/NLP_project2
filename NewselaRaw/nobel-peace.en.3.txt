The world is facing problems such as war and brutality. It is a hard year to find people working for peace and succeeding. However, that is what the Nobel Peace Committee is looking for.

The Nobel Peace Prize is an award given to a man, woman or organization. It is one of the most well-known awards given to people or groups that have worked to keep peace between countries. The Peace Prize will be announced in the northern European country of Norway on Friday.

This year presents a big challenge. Where on Earth can a man, woman or group be found to have lessened the bloodshed? There has been violence in parts of Africa and the Middle East for many years. This year, even more places have seen war and the killings of innocent people.

## Bloody Conflicts Continue

Political officials in the Middle East failed this year and last year to stop the violence. The Middle East is a region in Western Asia.

John Kerry is an official from the U.S. He tried to stop some of the fighting in the Middle East but it did not succeed. This year, the region saw bombings and violence between Israelis and Palestinians who have been fighting over the same land for many years. This year, there were deadly bombings in the region which made the fighting more extreme.

The 4-year civil war in Syria has not ended either. Lakhdar Brahimi, a political official for the United Nations (U.N.), tried to bring an end to the war in Syria. The U.N. is an international organization to keep peace around the world. Brahimi held peace conferences to bring the two sides together to discuss a deal, but they failed. He quit in May. There has not been another peace conference since.

Controversial actions have at times led to some people receiving the Peace Prize. In the past, protesters and whistleblowers — people who share secrets about the government — have received a Nobel. But most of the people like this have already been passed over.

## A Japanese Peace Group

A former employee of the U.S., Edward Snowden, is wanted by the government for leaking private information. Snowden is currently hiding in Russia. His whistleblowing was praised by some. Others called him a traitor for sharing his country's secrets with the whole world.

Even though there weren't many obvious Peace Prize candidates, there were a record-breaking 278 nominations this year. It is 19 more people than were nominated last year. Among the nominees are 47 organizations. The committee deciding the prizes keeps this list secret for 50 years. But the people who nominate the individuals and agencies often reveal who they want to win.

The Peace Research Institute Oslo puts out a list of possible winners each year. For 2014, they suggest a Japanese peace group, an independent Russian newspaper, and Snowden, the whistleblower.

Japanese People Who Conserve Article 9 is an group that wants to keep peace. In part of Japan's constitution, the country promises to avoid military force. Military force allows the government to kill people to keep the country safe. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to change the constitution to allow military force.

## A Newspaper Nominated

Another nominee for the peace prize is the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. The newspaper has been critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin's strict rule. Six of the newspaper's journalists have been killed since the newspaper started printing in 1993.

Other nominees who also have a chance of winning the prize include activist and Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai. She was shot by the Taliban, a terror organization, that wants to prevent girls from getting an education. She ignored their strict rules and went to school anyway. Now, she fights to help girls all over the world go to school in places where they are not allowed to do so.

Another possible winner is Dr. Denis Mukwege who works as a doctor for females. He has treated thousands of female victims of violence and torture in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country in Central Africa.

The president of Uruguay and a top official from the United Nations have also been nominated.
