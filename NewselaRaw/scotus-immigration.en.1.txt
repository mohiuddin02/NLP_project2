WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to review President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration. 

The president's plan would allow up to 5 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to "come out of the shadows" and work legally in the United States. It so far has not gone into effect, as it has been challenged in the lower courts. 

The justices said they will consider undoing lower-court orders that blocked the plan from taking effect. Their announcement comes in the midst of a presidential campaign in which the issue of immigration has played a central and divisive part.

## Case Will Be Decided By Late June

The case will be argued in April. It will be decided by late June, about a month before both parties gather to nominate their candidate for this year's presidential elections.

The immigrants who would benefit from the administration's plan are mainly the parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.

Texas is leading 26 mainly Republican-dominated states in challenging the Democratic administration's immigration plan.

## States Have Won In Court – So Far

So far, the federal courts have sided with the states. Their rulings have kept the administration from issuing work permits and allowing the immigrants to begin receiving some federal benefits.

If the justices eventually side with the administration, that would leave roughly seven months in Obama's presidency to implement his plans. "We are confident that the policies will be upheld as lawful," White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said Tuesday.

The plan at issue is known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program. It was first announced in late 2014. At the time, Obama said it would allow people who have been in the U.S. more than five years and who have children who are in the country legally to "come out of the shadows and get right with the law."

## Texas Has Led The Challenge Against The Plan

Texas quickly led a legal challenge to the program and has won every round in court so far. Most recently, in November, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the states, prompting the appeal to the Supreme Court.

Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said in his court filing that allowing those rulings to stand would force millions of people "to continue to work off the books. They would be left "without the option of lawful employment to provide for their families," he said.

The administration said Texas and the other states do not even have the right to challenge the plan in federal court. The lower courts decided Texas does have the right, or standing, to sue. It has that right, the lower courts said, because at least 500,000 people living in Texas would qualify for work permits and thus become eligible for driver licenses, the cost of which are covered by the state. Texas would have "millions of dollars in costs," the state said in its brief to the Supreme Court.

The justices also said they would consider whether Obama exceeded his authority under federal laws and the Constitution.

## Future Of 11 Million Immigrants Is At Stake

Texas asked the court not to hear the case. However, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said he was pleased the justices will examine the president's constitutional power to act without congressional approval. "In deciding to hear this case, the Supreme Court recognizes the importance of the separation of powers," Paxton said.

Democratic officials and immigrant advocates praised the court's action. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said "law-abiding men and women continue to live in constant fear of being separated from their children. These families must be allowed to step out of the shadows and fully contribute to the country that they love and call home."

The future of the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally has been much discussed by Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton has pledged to go further than Obama to protect large groups of immigrants from deportation.

Republican candidate Donald Trump has proposed deporting all people who are living in the U.S. illegally. His idea has been embraced by some of his fellow Republican candidates and dismissed by others.

## Immigration Enforcement Has Shifted

Obama said he was spurred to act on his own by Congress' failure to pass comprehensive immigration legislation. 

An earlier government program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is not being challenged. It shields immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. More than 720,000 young immigrants have been granted permission under that program to live and work legally in the United States.

The White House also has shifted its enforcement actions. Its focus now is on criminals, on those who pose a threat to national security or public safety, and on recent border-crossers. People who are here illegally but who are not otherwise violating the law are now less likely to face deportation.

## Deportations Have Dropped

About 235,000 people were deported in the 12-month period between October 2014 and September 2105. That was the smallest number since 2006 and a 42 percent drop since a record high of more than 409,000 in 2012.

Still, the administration drew criticism from Democrats and immigration advocates for raids that took place this month. The raids resulted in the arrest of more than 120 immigrants from Central America who came to the country illegally since 2014. Such recent arrivals are not among immigrants who would benefit from Obama's plan.
