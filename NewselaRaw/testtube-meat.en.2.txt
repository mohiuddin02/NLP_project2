Test tube meat is the food of the future, say two Dutch professors.

They argue that man-made meat would provide the world with a plentiful, environmentally safe and humane source of protein – far better than the real thing. The two professors, bioethicist Cor van der Weele and bioprocessing engineer Johannes Tramper, are from Wageningen University.

The university is the only one in the Netherlands that focuses on healthy food and the environment. Their article was published Tuesday in the journal Trends in Biotechnology.

"As large parts of the world become more prosperous, the global consumption of meat is expected to rise enormously in the coming decades," they wrote. Raising enough animals will lead to pollution, higher energy use and animal suffering, they say.

## A Tasty Option, Considering

One way to solve the problem is a "protein transition." This probably means substituting vegetable products for meat, raising fewer animals, and possibly eating insects.

This might make hamburger grown in laboratories sound like a tastier option.

The authors envision a day when every town grows its own meat. Muscle stem cells from pigs, cows, chicken, fish or other animals would grow in 5,200-gallon bioprocessing tanks.  Stem cells can grow into any kind of cell in the body.

The cells would be grown in a substance, like algae, that provides them with nutrition. Mechanical paddles would keep the solution in motion.

When there are enough cells — perhaps in a month, the authors say — an enzyme and binding protein would be added to make them stick together. At that point, the mixing stops. The meat tissue cells will form small clumps and settle to the bottom of the tank.

Finally, the authors say, the tank is drained of the algae. The remaining "meat slurry" is pressed into a dense cakes and sold.

The idea may sound far-fetched. But consider a 2003 L'art Biotech exhibition in France in which cultured frog meat was served, van der Weele says.  The cell-donor frog was alive and well, and looking on.

## The Big Question

Meat grown in algae wouldn't save much energy, the authors wrote. But it would cut down on [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming), as well as land and water use by more than 90 percent compared to European beef.

A tank could produce about 28 tons of meat a year. That would save the lives of about 112 beef cattle. In a year, a tank could feed more than 2,500 people.

Of course, there are some very real business and technological problems. The cost of what it grows in would affect the cost of the meat. Also, producers would need healthy stem cell lines that would grow and grow.

And then, of course, there's the question of whether people will want to eat it.

The professors wrote that the fake meat would need to be "structured into a texture that is appetizing and with good mouth feel." That means it would have to feel like the real thing when a person bites into it.

The authors believe the advantages of man-made meat are clear. But they won't guarantee that people will want to eat it.
