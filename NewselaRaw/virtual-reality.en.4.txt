LAS VEGAS â€” "Virtual reality" is an imaginary world created by computers. Using virtual reality (VR) feels like like stepping inside a movie. VR users are able to move around the world they see.

Today VR is mostly used in video games. Users who put on a VR helmet feel as if they are inside the game. They might find themselves in a spaceship. They might feel as if they are driving a racing car or dodging bullets.

All that might sound like a lot of fun. However, virtual reality still has a long way to go. Helmets are still big and clunky. VR can also make many people feel sick because of how real the games feel.

## Future Might Not Be With Games

VR makers are trying to fix those problems. They are also trying to figure out other uses for VR besides video games.

This week, a number of VR makers gathered in Las Vegas. They were there to let the public see what they've been up to.

VR maker Oculus demonstrated its new headset. The headset goes around the users' head so they can hear and see using it. Users who put it on saw a T-Rex dinosaur. It looked so real they could almost feel its breath on them.

In another example, people felt like they were lifted to the top of a tall building. They could walk to the edge and lean over. They could see traffic hundreds of feet below them.

Other users saw a fight scene between two robots. They were able to follow the fight from the left, from the right and from behind.

Nate Mitchell is one of the leaders at Oculus. His company makes the headset. Mitchell says Oculus will continue to work on video games, he said. However, he also says the future of VR might not be with games. He thinks VR might be used to make movies in the future.

## New Things VR Might Do

The movie industry is already very interested in VR. At least 13 short VR movies will be shown at a film festival this month.

Another VR company, Jaunt, has created a VR camera. It allows people to make their own VR movies.

Other companies are looking at ways to use VR. One company wants to use VR to help people meet even if they are hundreds or thousands of miles away from each other.

VR might even be used to help people buy a car. It would allow customers to see the car they are interested in. They could change the car's color until they found just what they wanted.

VR could soon be used by the military for training. Police and firefighters might use it for emergency drills.

There are still problems with virtual reality movies. Very few people own VR headsets. Without a headset, they cannot watch VR movies. Because of this, companies don't yet want to make VR movies.

Mitchell from Oculus does not worry. He said companies have just started looking at virtual reality.

"It's still early days," he said.
