Encyclopaedia Britannica used to be the king of encyclopedias. It hopes to become the most important encyclopedia again.

An encyclopedia has information about many different things. It includes articles on topics like animals, science, countries and famous people. Salesmen used to go to houses and knock on doors selling Encyclopaedia Britannica. A set could include 32 books. It cost a lot of money, but many people were willing to buy them. They thought Britannica was the best encyclopedia.

## Everybody Looks Online

More than two years ago, the company stopped publishing the books. It put the whole encyclopedia on the Internet. However, Britannica online is not as popular as Wikipedia. Wikipedia is another online encyclopedia. About half of Britannica's articles are free. All of Wikipedia's articles are free.

Jorge Cauz is president of Britannica. Cauz has a plan. He wants to offer the entire encyclopedia online for free. The company hopes more people will read it.

Britannica began in Scotland nearly 250 years ago. It moved to Chicago in 1935. In 1990, the company sold more than 100,000 sets of books. It was Britannica's best year.

Book sales dropped after the Internet became popular. People stopped getting information only from books. They began getting it online as well.

## The Encyclopedia Race Is On

Wikipedia started in 2001. It was the beginning of the end of Encyclopaedia Britannica books.

In this contest, Britannica is the underdog. Wikipedia is written by volunteers. It has nearly 4.6 million articles in English. Britannica has only 106,000.

Britannica's articles are more trustworthy than Wikipedia's, Cauz said. Like Wikipedia, anyone can help write Britannica's articles. However, each Britannica article is checked by experts. These experts make sure the articles are correct. Wikipedia articles are not always checked by experts. They sometimes contain mistakes.

People know that knowledge and truth matter, Cauz said.

Britannica covers most of the same general subjects as Wikipedia. Finding its articles can be more difficult.

The Britannica page also has many ads. The ads include everything from Home Depot to a Chicago law office. The ads help support the company. Wikipedia has no paid advertising.

Cauz hopes Britannica will be an important online center. It will be for people who want "to learn and know."
