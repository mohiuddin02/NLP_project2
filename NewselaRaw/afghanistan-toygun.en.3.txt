KABUL, Afghanistan â€” Weapons can be seen almost everywhere in Afghanistan these days. After all, the country has been fighting various wars for years.

At the moment the Afghan government is fighting a group called the Taliban.

## Playing Dangerous Games

The Taliban once controlled Afghanistan, but it lost power after the U.S. and others invaded the country in 2001. Since then, it has grown strong again and has started attacking cities. Fighting has been happening in various parts of Afghanistan.

Afghan children notice what is going on around them and it shapes the way they play.

In the U.S., children sometimes play "cops and robbers." In Afghanistan they play "police and Taliban." Young Afghan children chase each other around with toy guns made to look like the real thing.

Afghan children are just pretend fighting. Still, they are getting hurt, because toy weapons can be dangerous, too.

## Shot In The Eye By Toys

A lot of people were hurt by toy guns over this year's Eid al-Fitr holiday. The holiday celebrates the end of fasting for the Muslim holiday, Ramadan. At least 184 people were hit in the eye by BB pellets or rubber bands fired from toy guns. Nearly all those hurt were children.

The Afghan government decided it was finally time to do something that would help protect children from getting hurt. It announced that from now on toy guns will be against the law.

The government ordered police to find and destroy all the toy guns.

Afghanistan's toy guns come mostly from the nearby country of Pakistan as well as China. Many were given to young boys as gifts during the Eid festival. The festival marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

## Warnings Ignored, Hospitals Busy

Before the holiday started, the government tried to warn parents about the dangers of toy guns.

A video was made telling people "how much these toy guns can be dangerous," said Dr. Abdul Rahim Majeed of the Noor Eye Hospital. "Unfortunately, the families did not take it seriously," he added. They "didn't pay attention to this important message." As a result, many people were hurt, most of them children.

Majeed said many of those hurt by toy guns came to Noor. His hospital treated 116 cases during this year's holiday. Last year, only half as many people were hurt by toy guns.

Majeed said the number of people hurt was probably higher than reported. Some people may not have gone to a hospital or may have gone to one not controlled by the government, he explained.

## Many Afghans Sick Of War

Police have begun searching shops and taking toy guns away from children. It is not clear how many of the toys have been taken so far.

Shakib Nasery is a 38-year-old father of two children. He likes the effort to destroy the toy guns. Any way to stop fighting in his war-torn country would be good, he said. It does not matter if it is just play fighting.

Kids should not be pretending to fight gun battles, Nasery said. Playing like that is not a good thing for society, he said. It trains kids to think fighting is fun and the only way to solve problems. If people keep on thinking that way the real fighting will not stop.

Children learning to like guns is one of the terrible things about Afghanistan's wars, he added.
