ATLANTA, Ga. — After the end of the Civil War, two units of black Union soldiers were assigned to the burned-out husk of Atlanta to keep the strained peace.

They were former slaves who had toiled in nearby fields. They may have been bought and sold on the slave market, which is currently the site of a commuter train station. Now, they carried guns and wore the blue suits of the victorious United States Army.

## The Black Confederate

Several miles away, "Ten Cent" Bill Yopp was trying to find his footing. Born a slave, he spent the war as a Confederate drummer, shining boots for a dime and tending to the wounds of his master, Capt. Thomas McCall Yopp.

After the war, "Ten Cent" raised money for Confederate veterans and stayed by his former master's side in the Confederate Soldiers' Home in Atlanta. When he died in 1933, "Ten Cent" became the first and only African-American to lie in the Confederate Cemetery in Marietta.

Officials at Stone Mountain park are uncovering these stories while working on their current project. They are creating a museum about the role of blacks in the Civil War.

## A Complicated Story

If the museum is indeed built, it would be only the second museum of its kind in the United States. In 2000, Frank Smith, a Washington, D.C. city councilman, opened the African American Civil War Memorial and Museum.

Choosing which stories to tell will be the challenge for the museum's curators. As convoluted as Civil War history can be, the story of the black soldier is even more complicated.

Take this argument from several weeks ago. A group of Confederate flag supporters marched on Stone Mountain to protest plans for a proposed Martin Luther King Jr. memorial. They argued that the civil rights leader had no involvement in the Civil War, so he had no place on Stone Mountain. The mountain is a Confederate memorial and contains of carvings of famous Confederate leaders.

## Blacks Fought For The Union

Instead, they said, they would support a monument for a black Confederate soldier. Unfortunately, they couldn't name even one — because there were none.

According to service records kept by the National Park Service all 209,145 black soldiers listed as having served in the Civil War fought for the Union.

There is no documented evidence that former slaves fought for the Confederacy.

Kevin Levin is a historian in Boston. He has been working on his upcoming book, "Searching for Black Confederate Soldiers," for eight years and said he has yet to find one.

After the Civil War "it would have been hard for any Confederate to acknowledge knowing or seeing any black soldiers," Levin said. "The myth of the black Confederate soldier is a recent myth that started in the late 1970s."

## "Myth That Lives On The Internet"

At that time, America was coming out of Vietnam and the end of the Civil War was more than a century in the past. Memories of the war began to shift toward an increased interest in how blacks got their freedom and their service in the Union army.

"So there was a push to counter that by looking for their own Confederate soldiers," Levin said. "If you can find black men, you can defuse the talk of emancipation. … It is a myth that lives on the Internet, but there is no reputable scholar who supports this myth."

Several confederate websites report that there were blacks who voluntarily fought for the South. One mentioned on the sites was "Ten Cent" Bill Yopp.

## Confederacy "Did Not Want To Arm Slaves"

The true story of "Ten Cent" is more in line with what the black role was for the Confederacy. Levin said he is on a short list of former servants who have been transformed into loyal Confederates.

Historian Michael Thurmond said as many as 1 million slaves worked in some way for the Confederacy, "working in the back as cooks, digging trenches, making uniforms and supporting troops."

"But that didn't make them Confederate soldiers. It made them slaves serving their masters," said Thurmond, Georgia's former labor secretary and a former school superintendent. "A soldier is someone who volunteers. A slave cannot volunteer. … The Confederacy did not want to arm slaves," Thurmond said.

## General Lee Wanted Black Soldiers

Neither did the Union, at least early on. When the war started, both sides prohibited blacks from serving.

General Robert E. Lee, whose image is carved on Stone Mountain, was actually in support of arming slaves in exchange for their freedom after the war. But the Confederate government, at the urging of its president, Jefferson Davis, who is also carved on Stone Mountain, voted it down.

"By November of 1864, the Confederacy was faced with the decision. 'Do we want to win the war or protect slavery,'" Thurmond said. "They picked slavery."

## Enlisting With The Union

It wasn't until April 1865 that the Confederate Congress voted to arm blacks.

After Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, some 200,000 blacks — 90 percent of them former slaves from Confederate states — had already turned the tide of the war by taking up arms for the Union.

Thurmond said, "The war ended before black Confederate soldiers could be deployed. It was over and there is no record of this. No official records show black soldiers in the Confederacy."
