The Sierra Nevada red fox is very rare. There are fewer than 50 left in the country. A red fox was just seen in Yosemite National Park. It was the first time in almost 100 years.

California protects 14 animals. The red fox is one of them. It is against the law to hunt or kill them.

Scientists set up video cameras at Yosemite. The cameras took pictures of the fox in December and January. The pictures might be of the same fox. Scientists do not yet know.

"The chance of running into them is very unusual," Kari Cobb said. She works for Yosemite. Yosemite is in California.

## Fox Likes Chicken

The foxes are shy. They hide from humans. They live way up in the mountains. The foxes have reddish-orange fur. They burrow in soil and logs.

Scientists do not know much about them.

In 2010, scientists took videos of a red fox. It was seen at Sonora Pass. The pass is on a high mountain road. It is north of Yosemite. The video showed the fox biting on a bag. The bag had chicken scraps.

Later, scientists checked the bag. They found spit from a red fox.

Two years ago, Kari was at the Sonora Pass. She saw a red fox.

"They are extremely cute little animals," she said.

## Keep Looking For More

Scientists are still looking for the fox. They have set hair traps. The traps do not catch animals. Instead, they catch loose hair that animals rub off. The scientists hope to find fox hair. The hair would teach them more about the foxes at the park.

Seeing a fox in Yosemite is a good sign.

The red fox may be coming back.
