In the Dominican Republic, baseball is life. It might not look that way immediately, however. In the town of San Pedro de Macoris, the streets there are dusty and busy. There are honking cars and buzzing scooters. Many people are poor.

You have to walk into the town to see the action. Past the rows of buildings with peeling paint, there is a park. Past the roads full of garbage and stray dogs, you'll see kids. They shout in Spanish and stand near the old baseball fields. Bats crack and baseballs thud into gloves as they are caught.

"I want to play in the major leagues, of course," said Richard Paulino, a baseball player on the field. "I am passionate about the game. I am focused."

## Starting Early

Baseball plays an important role in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic is a nation in the Caribbean Sea. Many people there learn baseball at a young age. Some of the best athletes are sent to the United States to play in the major leagues. The Dominican Republic sends more more players to the major leagues than any other nation besides the United States.

Kim Ng works at Major League Baseball (MLB). It is the official professional baseball league in America. Ng said the Dominican region is "tremendously important." The MLB just opened a new office there.

One reason that baseball is so popular in the Dominican Republic is that kids start early. Many drop out of high school to play. Also, major league teams from the United States have built training camps for young athletes.

The sport also gives many people hope. The Dominican Republic is poor. Becoming a baseball player can bring a good salary. The sport also creates jobs for more than just the players. Money from baseball provides jobs for landscapers who care for fields, cooks and housekeepers, even real estate agents who find places for players to live.

## 1 In 3 Players

The major leagues are a diverse place to play. Now, Latinos make up almost one third of players in the MLB. That means that about 1 in every 3 players is Latino.

By 2013, there were 510 Dominican players signing to play in the MLB. These players are earning more money than ever before, too.

There are many baseball programs across the nation. The programs provide opportunities for kids to learn and explore the sport. American leagues support many of the programs. There are player showcases, training academies, and professional leagues.

"It's a lot easier than when I used to play," said Moises Alou. He used to play baseball for the Chicago Cubs. Now he is the general manager of a Dominican team. "Everybody now plays baseball. There's a lot of programs and tryouts and there's a lot of teams competing to sign the best players available."

## "Someday"

On a recent afternoon in the Dominican Republic, thousands of people packed into a stadium to watch a game. There were nearly 10,000 people crowding together.

Kids wearing local teams' uniforms shouted in Spanish. They scrambled up the walls to see the action. Others sat on the top of the dugouts to watch the game.

Just before the game started, Richard Paulino walked into the stadium with his friends. He pushed through the crowds. Paulino passed girls selling popcorn out of a plastic garbage tub and a woman selling soda from a shoebox.

He was asked by a reporter if he was going to take the field.

He smiled. "Someday."
