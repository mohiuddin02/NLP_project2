WASHINGTON — The United States has become significantly less Christian in the last eight years, a major new study found. Meanwhile, the share of American adults who say they follow no systematic religious belief increased sharply, according to the study.

For what is likely the first time in U.S. history — certainly the first since the early days of the country — the actual number of American Christians has declined. Christianity, however, remains by far the nation's main religious tradition, according to the new report by the Pew Research Center.

The erosion in traditional religious ranks seems likely to continue. Among Americans aged 18 to 33, just slightly more than half identify themselves as Christian. That compares with roughly 8 in 10 people in the baby boom generation and older age groups, the report showed.

Moreover, in a reverse of previous patterns, younger Americans do not appear to follow traditional faiths more as they become parents. Just the opposite seems to be happening. Members of the millennial generation have grown less religious as they age.

## "Backlash" Against Linking Religion And Politics

The rapid increase in the number of adults without ties to traditional religious institutions has strong implications for other social institutions and for politics.

Whether a person attends religious services regularly is among the strongest predictors of how he or she will vote. Traditional religion is strongly tied to the Republican Party, at least among white Americans.

The decline in traditional religious belief adds to the demographic challenges facing the Republican Party. The party already faces difficulties because of its reliance on white voters in a country that has grown more racially diverse.

The interaction between religion and politics may work both ways. Some scholars believe that close links between traditional religion and conservatism, particularly on issues such as same-sex marriage, have led many younger Americans to cut their ties with organized religion.

Opposition to same-sex marriage on the part of religious conservatives "is turning off so many people from Christianity," said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College who specializes in studying secularism. "We're seeing a backlash" against the linking of religion and politics, he said.

Almost 1 in 5 American adults were raised in a religious tradition but are now unaffiliated, the study found, while only 4 percent have moved in the other direction.

## "Nonreligious As An OK Option"

A leading conservative religious figure, however, said he thought the trend could be a positive development. People who once would have been "pretend Christian" are now being more honest about their beliefs, said Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Churches should not try to water down their beliefs on issues such as marriage in order to appeal to a broader audience, he said.

Because the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask questions about religion, the massive religion surveys by the Pew Research Center have become a chief source of information on the U.S. religious landscape.

The Pew survey questioned 35,071 U.S. adults last summer. Its huge size allows detailed analysis of even fairly small religious groups. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus six-tenths of a percentage point.

The study found that the U.S. is still far more religious than most other economically advanced countries. But the significant increase in the share of Americans who do not follow a traditional religious belief mirrors trends in Europe and elsewhere.

"It's becoming much more possible, much more viable, to identify as secular" in the U.S. today, Zuckerman said. In previous generations, a lack of religious affiliation was viewed as a mark of being un-American, but now "people are starting to see being nonreligious as an OK option," he said.

## The Ranks Of The "Nones"

Nationwide, just short of 1 in 4 Americans describe themselves as being agnostic, atheist or simply "nothing in particular," up from roughly 1 in 6 in 2007, according to the new study. The ranks of the "nones," as the study labeled them, have grown in large part from people abandoning the religion in which they were raised.

That trend toward being nonreligious is particularly strong in the West, where "unaffiliated" is now the single largest religious grouping, at 28 percent, the report shows. By comparison, the South remains the most heavily Christian part of the nation.

The decline in organized religious belief has been sharpest among Americans born since the mid-1960s. And in those groups, organized religion does not appear to be gaining followers as people age.

"If you work in the church, you see it happening. We have growing numbers of congregations that are having a hard time retaining their membership numbers," said Bishop R. Guy Erwin of the Southwest California Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, based in Glendale, California.

Married people are more likely to have a religious affiliation than the unmarried, but both groups have grown less attached to organized religion in recent years, the report said.

## More Muslims And Hindus

By contrast with the growth of the religiously unaffiliated, Christian ranks have eroded. Roughly 173 million adult Americans identify themselves as Christian, just under 71 percent of the U.S. population. That's down from 178 million, or 78 percent of the United States, in 2007. The total U.S. adult population grew by about 8 percent during those eight years.

Among non-Christian faiths, Judaism remains the largest in the U.S., although only about 2 percent of the U.S. population identifies as Jewish.

Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism each have less than 1 percent of the U.S. population, although the Muslim and Hindu populations have both grown rapidly, reflecting emigration from Asia.
