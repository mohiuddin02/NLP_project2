Do high temperatures bring out the worst in man? Many have believed it to be so. But there has been no real study to test the idea.

Now three researchers have done just such a study. They looked to find whether heat leads to more war and fighting. They used examples from ancient history, baseball and even traffic jams.

The researchers were from the University of California. They pulled together information from dozens of studies.

They wrote that there could be as much as a 56 percent increase in war and rioting by 2050. The increase would be caused by higher temperatures and extreme rainfall patterns, like floods and droughts. Such weather changes are predicted by scientists who study the Earth's climate.

## Global Temperature To Rise

Personal violence could also jump. Crimes such as beatings and killing could climb as much as 16 percent, the researchers said.

They said that there was strong evidence to link [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global warming) and people fighting. It was true across the world, the researchers added.

How hot do scientists think the Earth will get? The study figures the global temperature will rise at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 50 years. That number is based on information from top scientists who study climates.

The researchers also figure that people would not do much to change their ways as the weather shifts.

The team examined 60 papers. The papers covered studies on weather, economics, government, the human mind and other fields.

Researchers in one case held up traffic at a hot Phoenix corner. They wanted to see who would get angry and honk their horns more: drivers in cars with or without air conditioning.

## Wars And Rioting To Rise Too

Scientists in another study looked at Major League Baseball. They wanted to see if a pitcher was more likely to throw at the batter when it got hotter.

Another group used information from tree rings in Southeast Asia. The goal? To decide how much a bad drought had to do with the fall of an Asian kingdom 600 years ago.

The researchers said they saw a link between temperature, rain and conflict. They saw it no matter where they looked. It was there no matter the year. Large-scale group conflict could increase 28 percent to 56 percent over the next 37 years, they decided. That means a lot more war and rioting.

Violent crime between individuals could rise 8 to 16 percent.

"The result is alarming," said Marshall Burke. He was one of the people who wrote the study. Burke specializes in how climate change affects how much food people have. But mankind can still make some changes that would make climate change less of a problem, he said.

## More Studies Are Needed

Why do higher temperatures and changes in rainfall lead to more war and killing? The authors say they can only guess.

They do not try to come up with a clear cause. They say there might be a physical link between heat and acting on anger. But they are not biologists. What they want is for their work to lead to more research and planning as the planet grows warmer.

"We like to compare it to smoking," Burke said. "In the 1930s scientists were figuring out there was this really strong relationship between smoking and lung cancer." But it took many years to figure out just how smoking was linked to cancer.
