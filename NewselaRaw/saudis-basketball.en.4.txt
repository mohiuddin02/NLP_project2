JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia â€” Saudi Arabia is a kingdom in the Middle East. It has many rules for women on what they are allowed to wear or do in public.

Now, a group of women and girls there are pushing for change. They are playing basketball.

Women's basketball is becoming popular in Saudi Arabia. For the players, basketball is not just a sport. It's also a way to fight for more rights.

Lina Almaeena started the first women's basketball team in Saudi Arabia 11 years ago. She and her teammates fought for the right to play. As a result, in 2006, Jiddah United became the first sports club in Saudi Arabia to include women. Jiddah is a city in the Middle Eastern country.

## Girls Take Their Shots

In Saudi Arabia, leaders do not believe that women should exercise. Girls in Saudi public schools are not taught physical education.

There are rules about what women can wear. For instance, they cannot be seen by men while jogging in sweat pants. Most women in Saudi Arabia hide their hair and face with a covering known as the niqab. All women are required to wear a loose black dress known as the abaya in public.

Nevertheless, Saudi women's basketball is on the rise. Women from the kingdom are even playing in other Arab countries.

Hadeer Sadagah started playing at Jiddah United eight years ago. She now plays basketball at a university in the United Arab Emirates, another Middle Eastern country.

"I wouldn't be the person I am today without the sport and the team," said Sadagah. "It made me more social. It made me confident."

At a basketball practice in Jiddah, girls played on basketball courts behind gated walls. Some were as young as 4 years old. Boys played in nearby courts. The children and their coaches stopped for daily prayers. Islam is the official religion in Saudi Arabia. People who follow Islam must pray five times per day.

## Making Friends, Learning Teamwork

Almaeena says girls like basketball because they can make friends as part of a team. Saudis also see it as more acceptable than other sports. One reason is that girls can play in loose, traditional clothes. It can also be played inside and outside.

The sport has grown into a network of teams in different cities. There is no official group of teams. Women's teams play in private tournaments.

Even in Jiddah, women's basketball still faces many challenges. For one, the kingdom has rules about keeping men and women apart. It can be very difficult for women to find places to train.

In Jiddah, the older female players practice and play in a female-only gym. They only play tournaments in front of other women. Even their male coaches do not go to games.

## Players Need A Driver

In 2009, Almaeena's team played a tournament in Jordan. The players wore modest track suits. A Saudi newspaper attacked the players for not wearing the traditional abayas. They printed pictures of them and said they were "immoral."

Jiddah has fewer rules for women than other Saudi cities. It has public spaces where women walk alongside men in sporty black robes. This is rare in Saudi Arabia. Saudi women usually exercise in private.

Even in Jiddah, though, it is mostly rich women who play sports.

Playing basketball with a club costs around $130 a month. Women also have to pay for a driver to get there. Saudi women are not allowed to drive.

Alaa AlShuwayer recently looked into a basketball practice in Jiddah. She may sign up her two young daughters.

"There's nothing wrong with girls or boys playing sports," she said. "I'd rather they play sports than buy them dresses and earrings."
