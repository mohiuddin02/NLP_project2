WASHINGTON — For nearly nine years, it has been Lonnie Bunch's job to make people believe.

Not far from the White House, Bunch is standing outside a trailer. He looks down on what for two years has been a construction site on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.

Many had doubted that the new National Museum of African American History and Culture would ever be built. Now it has a growing shape and promise.

"It's humbling," said Bunch, the head of the new museum.

## "Our Culture And History"

As Black History Month ends, construction on the new museum is half done. When finished, it will be a permanent symbol of African-Americans in U.S. history.

The grand opening of the museum is expected by the end of next year or in early 2016. Perhaps it will take place during Black History Month in February. But for Bunch, "every month is Black History Month."

The museum will be part of the Smithsonian Institution. Officials of the museum have raised about $400 million of its $500 million total cost. Media superstar Oprah Winfrey gave $12 million to build the museum. A theater inside the museum will be named in her honor.

"I want to help ensure that we both honor and preserve our culture and history. So ... the stories of who we are will live on for generations to come," Winfrey said.

President Barack Obama, the first African-American president, was there when construction started two years ago. But Bunch had to make sure people believed that the museum would be built.

"I get very emotional when I come here," he said.

It could very well be the last building to go up on the mall, sometimes referred to as the "nation's front lawn." Many people seem to agree that nothing more can be placed along the nearly 2-mile park from the U.S. Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. They believe more buildings would take away from the green space and the museums and memorials.

## Ironwork Created By Slaves

Phil Freelon is an African-American architect from Durham, N.C. He designed the building. He imagined a boxlike structure with 10 stories — five above ground, five below.

The outside will be covered bronze to make it gleam. The idea is inspired by ironwork created by slaves in Charleston, S.C., and New Orleans.

Bunch called the building's design a tribute "to those hiding in plain sight."

The museum seeks to give people a sense of the struggles and successes of African-Americans. Entering the building, for instance, museum-goers will cross a body of water. This represents the experience of slaves crossing the ocean to come to America.

Some large objects already have been put in place, and the building will be built around them.

One of them is a railroad car with different sections for whites in the front and a sign for "colored" in the back. African-American were called "colored" during the years of slavery and segregation. The railroad car is an example of how segregation laws separated blacks and whites in public places.

Visitors will be able to walk through the Southern Railway car, used from 1940 to 1960. Comfortable seating for whites are up in the front. A divider kept African-Americans in the plain seating in the back.

The rail car is one of the physical reminders from America's long years of segregation, and those objects are rare, said Peter Claussen. He works for Gulf &amp; Ohio Railways, which gave the rail car to the museum. "The separate water fountains are gone. The black and white sections of movie theaters are gone. There are very few objects that allow people to see what segregation was like, and this is one of them."

## A Tower, A Cabin

The museum includes a 21-foot guard tower from a Louisiana state prison. To Bunch, the tower is a powerful symbol of the unjust way African-Americans were treated.

Many African-Americans were rounded up as tramps and forced to work in the 1900s. This became a way to re-enslave African-Americans, Bunch said.

The guard tower and the railway car will be part of the museum's first exhibit called "Defending Freedom, Defining Freedom: Era of Segregation 1876-1968."

A slave cabin from Point of Pines Plantation on Edisto Island, S.C., tells of life during slavery. It is from the early 1800s. The small wooden cabin was taken apart piece by piece and shipped to Washington last May.

Bunch began planning the museum in 2005 with just two staff members and no museum objects. Now, his longed-for goal is within reach.

"You want people to go into this museum and be changed," he said.
