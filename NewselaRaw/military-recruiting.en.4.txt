KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” If you want to join the military, it is never too soon to get good advice. Army Sgt. 1st Class Terrence Hoard knows this is true. He needs to reach young people early to set them straight.

They think anybody can join. Many see the military as a last resort in a tough job market. But they will have a harder time joining the armed services than ever in the past 40 years.

Hoard tells them long before they leave school: Don't get caught with drugs. Work out, shed weight. And be careful about getting tattooed.

"We're turning down twice as many as before," said Hoard, who runs an Army recruiting station. He used to sign up 16 to 20 soldiers every month. Now, he only needs 10 or 12.

## Turned Down For Tattoos

Kyle Bayard wants to do well for Hoard. His dream of serving was held up for a year. He had a health problem in high school.

Mauricio Lonza maintained a B average in high school and in college. He also couldn't join the military right away. He failed an armed services skills test, the ASVAB, three times before he passed.

The ASVAB tests people on technology and on language and math. Lonza explained that math was never his favorite subject.

Hoard turned down four people for having tattoos too low on their arms. All four were turned down the week after the Army passed new tattoo rules.

The government agency that runs the military recently said it plans to shrink the Army's troop numbers from 520,000 to 490,000 by autumn 2015. Under the plan, about four of every five people who want to join won't make it.

Retired Army Lt. Col. Mike Byrd says that the military is competing with colleges and jobs. With the cutbacks, the military is looking for the same successful people that everyone else is chasing. Byrd would know: he leads a high school's young officer training program in Missouri.

It's expensive to find soldiers, he added. "We don't have the flexibility we once had to get it wrong with one kid and hope the next one works out."

## A Shrinking Army

The government wants to spend less money every year. Military cuts are part of that effort. Congress set limits on military spending last December.

The Army could shrink to its smallest active-duty size since before World War II. It could still shrink more in the future if the government says so, say military leaders.

What does this mean for young people who can't find jobs? What if they can't pay for college?

There will be fewer opportunities for them in the military, Byrd said. Fewer young soldiers means fewer people getting college paid for by the military.

One study estimated that three out of four young Americans could not join. [ Weight problems stopped a lot of people who wished to join.](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity)  Many others were kept out by old crimes, unfinished schooling, or credit card debt, the report said.

Commanders did not have to be as picky when the military was bigger. They could allow people to join with some of these problems.

Fewer new soldiers had completed high school at the height of the war in [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq). Many who had committed serious crimes were allowed in.

## Out Of Luck

Today, 99 percent of new soldiers have graduated from high school. The military expects higher scores in the ASVAB test. Even a small crime on someone's record may prevent them from joining.

A Navy official said that the quality of new sailors and soldiers is the best it's been in 40 years.

Many people who want to join don't know that. They're out of luck when they show up. Now they can't have crimes on their records. They have to finish high school. New soldiers already have to be in good shape like the military requires.

A pickier military affects the rest of the country. The military provides young people with jobs. It also helps them pay for college. Without those benefits they're likely to earn less money, studies have found.

"They call it 'scarring,'" said economist Sarah Ayres. "It's not just a right-now problem." It's a problem that will stay for "years down the road."
