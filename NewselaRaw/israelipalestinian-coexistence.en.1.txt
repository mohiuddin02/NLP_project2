CHICAGO — Taher, a 15-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank, never met an Israeli before he came to Chicago.

Shachar, also 15 and an Israeli from Jerusalem, likewise had never spoken to a Palestinian, although he lives close to the Palestinian territories.

Taher and Shachar are among more than 20 Israeli and Palestinian teens who arrived in Chicago recently on a program that seeks to build peace and understanding between the longtime enemies. Called Hands of Peace, the program brings the teens to the U.S. where they can talk freely about their experiences and forge friendships, said Julie Kanak. She is the executive director of Hands of Peace.

"It makes me feel not strong or not free," said Taher of the conflict between Palestinians and Israel and also living in the West Bank. "But here I can see Israeli kids and talk to them and send them my message. I can tell them what I can't tell them back in the West Bank."

Only the teens' first names are being used, because Kanak said they could face problems at home for their participation in the program.

## Walls Of Separation Back Home

"It's really impossible for them to meet in this format back in their home territory," Kanak said. "There's a separation wall, so there's certainly physical and geographic barriers, but there are national barriers as well."

The Palestinians are seeking their own country. They and the Israelis have been negotiating — and fighting — over the land for decades. Most recently, Israel and the militant Hamas group that governs Gaza have been in a fierce fight.

Hands of Peace was founded by Glenview Community Church in suburban Chicago 11 years ago. To date, more than 400 teenagers from the Middle East have participated in the program. While the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is often in the background, this is one of the first times the program has taken place when the two sides are actually fighting, said Roy Gordon, who works for the program.

"We were all really concerned," Gordon said. "We were wondering if there was going to be any problems with the young people being able to get out here, but everything has gone well so far."

Each morning the teens meet for two hours. They are encouraged to talk freely about their feelings, experiences, prejudices, hopes and dreams.

"Most of these young people have never had a conversation with someone on the other side because their lives are so segregated there," Gordon said. "This is their first opportunity to do that. Pretty quickly they learn that they're all just teenagers and they have a lot more in common than they have separately."

## "To Learn Something About The Other Side"

Earlier the group had a barbecue at Elder Park in suburban Winnetka. The barbecue was followed by a game of softball, a sport many of them had never played before.

But that was not the only "first" for Taher. He said he hopes he has a chance to talk to the Israeli teens about the conflict.

"I want to make change, and I want to have a voice to show to people what Palestine is and what we truly do, who are Palestinians and what we suffer," he said.

The trip was also a first for Shachar.

"A success for me would be to get to know the Palestinians better and what do they really want, and how they feel about the situation that's going on in Israel," he said. "It's so weird because we're here trying to get to know each other, and back home there's missiles. It's crazy."

Gordon dismissed with a wave of his hand anyone who might be doubtful about what the program can achieve.

"The other option is to do nothing, and to me that's not an acceptable option," he said. "Something has to be done, and this is what we chose to do. We're giving them an opportunity to learn something about the other side."
