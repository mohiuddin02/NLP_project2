HACKENSACK, N.J. — Long used by the military for secret missions, drones are now cheap enough for the average person. These remote-controlled flying machines are one of the hot presents this holiday season.

The DJI Phantom 2 Vision is a drone with four propellers and a high-definition camera. USA Today recently called this drone, which sells for $1,200, a top holiday gift for 2014.

Want a drone for less than $100? No problem. Radioshack is selling the Surveyor Drone for just $60. The Surveyor is red, it shoots videos and it's easy to fly.

Rob Powley of Mahwah, New Jersey, has so many drones that he forgets exactly how many. He bought some already built and built others himself.

## Low-Cost Fun, Simple Cameras

"I bought them because they're cool," Powley said. "It's amazing what you can do with a drone. And they're getting better all the time."

For years, drones were mostly used by the military to gather information or drop bombs.

Now, drones are available to almost anyone. They offer low-cost fun and easy-to-use cameras. But more drones in the skies also bring problems for airplane pilots, tourists in national parks and even pedestrians.

Drones increasingly face concerns over safety and privacy. There are calls for more regulation of drones by states and the federal government. The fun gift you get under the tree this year may face many tight new rules in the future.

The laws surrounding drones vary by state and local government, said Wells C. Bennett, who studies national security law at the Brookings Institution.

"It's confusing," Bennett said. "And a lot of the laws will change over the next couple of years."

## Selling Thousands A Month

Only five years ago, drones were not for sale to the average person, said Mike Blades, who works for a company that does research on the drone business.

Since then, sales of drones have skyrocketed.

Blades estimates consumers will spend $720 million on drones this year. Next year, that will double, amounting to about 200,000 drones sold every month.

Drones are easier to fly than typical radio-controlled planes and helicopters. They have four rotors and advanced microchips to help keep them stable in mid-air. Drones also move differently — they replace an airplane's smooth dips and arcs with the sharp turns of a robot.

Drones take off vertically, shooting straight up into the sky.

With old-fashioned radio-controlled planes, you need a lot of space, Powley said. But a small quadcopter drone can be flown inside a house. In fact, Powley does fly his drones around his house and office.

"You can fly with first-person video, so it looks like you're inside it. That's really cool," Powley said.

## Packed With New Technology

Many military drones were designed for stealth, made to be as quiet as possible. There's nothing sneaky about most drones for consumers, though.

Drones' propellers hum at different pitches, creating a noise like a hive of angry bees. If a drone runs out of batteries, it can fall out of the sky like a stone. Cheaper drones may fly for just a minute or two. More expensive models can fly for around 12 minutes.

The biggest difference between radio-controlled planes and drones is cameras. Today, small, light cameras such as GoPros can fly on drones and send photos and video instantly back to smartphones, tablets and computers.

New technologies such as LIDAR cameras work like radar, but using lasers. The cameras can make detailed 3-D models of territory from the sky. They can even spot people through trees, making them useful for military and police.

These technologies are getting lighter and cheaper, Blades said. "They will be be affordable for anyone to buy in the next 10 years," he said.

## Airports Are No-Drone Zones

In the near future, drones will fly higher, farther and faster than anything available to consumers today.

Concerns about the privacy and safety of consumer drones are growing.

The National Park Service has temporarily banned drones on all the land it manages. It received complaints about the small aircraft at Mount Rushmore, the Grand Canyon and Yosemite.

Since July, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is in charge of the nation's aviation safety, has been receiving 30 complaints a month from pilots who have had close calls with drones, or seen them flying in restricted airspace near airports.

On Sept. 8, for example, the pilots of three different passenger jets reported "a very close call" with a drone at about 1,900 feet as they flew into La Guardia Airport in New York City.

Even a small drone could bring down a jet.

## Hey Drone, Leave Me Alone

Others worry that drones could be used to invade people's privacy.

In September, Russell Percenti of Lower Township, New Jersey, became so angry at his neighbor for flying a drone over his house that he shot the drone down with a shotgun. Percenti was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a weapon and criminal mischief.

"With small hobbyist drones with high-definition cameras, it'll be easy enough to peek into your neighbors' backyard anytime you want to," said Jeramie Scott of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

Drone supporters say privacy concerns are exaggerated. A good pair of binoculars is a better spying tool than a drone, which can only fly for a few minutes at a time while making a loud buzzing noise, said Michael Drobac, who works for a business group that represents drone makers.
