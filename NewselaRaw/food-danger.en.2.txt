PHILADELPHIA — For the poor, food is not only scarce — often, it also can be rotting and covered in germs.

Corner stores and small supermarkets that feed many poor people who live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, offer bacteria-laced foods in unhealthy conditions, a new study shows. Eating such foods can lead to foodborne illness, or food poisoning.

Customers agree with the study.

"Potatoes and baby food are moldy, lettuce is rotten, and the mice are having a good time in boxes of noodles," said Rodney Jenkins, 47. "I ate bad fruit from a corner store and got sick."

Jenkins worries about feeding his children with so few worthwhile food choices.

"It's horrible," he said. "When we get food up here, it's like we get the end of all food, the last batch of it."

## Not Enough Grocery Stores

For years, there have been attempts to get fruits, vegetables and other main foods into so-called food deserts like North Philadelphia.

"Food desert" is a term for places where there is not a lot of access to good, fresh produce. They aren't real deserts and can be anywhere from rural small towns to poor parts of big cities. Often, a food desert will have fast-food restaurants and corner stores, but very few places for people to buy groceries.

Until now, there has never been an investigation of food safety risks that desert-dwellers face.

The new study is being conducted by scientist Jennifer Quinlan.

Quinlan studies the bacteria in food. She and her team visited nearly 400 corner stores and small supermarkets between 2008 and 2010. The goal was to study small organisms that live in milk, eggs, lunch meat, sandwiches and ready-to-eat fresh fruits and greens.

The results of the study were scary.

"We found milk likely to have more bacteria," Quinlan said. "And when we could find fresh produce, it had a lot of contamination on it."

## Food Poisoning Has Many Symptoms

Foodborne illness is tricky to detect. Some might not know they have it, since symptoms — cramps, diarrhea, vomiting — can be caused by many factors.

Fortunately, food poisoning is rarely deadly. Recent estimates show that of 9.4 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States in a year, there were fewer than 1,500 deaths.

Much of the damage done by foods gone bad in corner stores is to poor people's wallets.

For example, many corner-store owners get milk from larger stores, and transport it in their own cars. Milk spoils faster under such conditions when it is not kept cold.

Similarly, Quinlan found that newly delivered milk will often stand outside refrigerators for long periods. In many cases, there are too few employees to put it away quickly.

A customer then finds the milk goes bad much sooner than expiration dates show. Because the smell of spoiled milk keeps anyone from drinking it, the result is not foodborne illness but wasted dollars, Quinlan said.

## Even Salad In Bags Has Germs

In corner stores, she found a high amount of microbes in bagged salad, strawberries and cucumbers, indicating that the food was close to spoiling. Many times the items rotted soon after purchase, another waste.

It was not uncommon to see mice in stores, Quinlan said. As a result, many corner stores keep cats, who carry their own germs.

Additionally, Quinlan found evidence of fecal coliforms in foods.

Fecal coliform is a group of bacteria that was possibly contaminated from human or animal waste. E. coli is a fecal coliform.

People can eat fecal coliform without harm — but it may mean other disease-causing bacteria are in the food.

When Quinlan and her researchers tested ready-to-eat salad greens, they found fecal coliforms in every single batch.

Similarly, eggs in corner stores were often found to be unrefrigerated, making them a possible source of salmonella poisoning. Salmonella comes from contaminated water or food and can attack the intestines.

Along with corner stores, Quinlan also studied food handling in private homes, many of them poor.

More than 42 percent of the refrigerators were too warm, and several homes had no refrigerators at all. A few lacked hot water. More than two-thirds were infested with pests, including mice.

Poor people realize that they have few options in protecting themselves from bad food.

"If you're living on the edge and not getting enough to eat, you make riskier choices in order to eat," food microbiologist Donald Schaffner said.

## Making The Best Of Bad Food

Nutritionist Debra Palmer works on food-related issues with poor New Jersey residents.

When they are stuck with bad food, those people make the best of it, Palmer said. They wash slime off lunch meats, cut mold from cheese and bread, slice off rotten parts of fruit, then simply eat what's left.

Palmer said that people will buy warm, discounted meat from old trucks that drive through poor neighborhoods. Many report getting food from dumpsters outside restaurants.

Quinlan said she recognized the need to get impoverished people in food deserts to eat more fruits and vegetables. However, from a microbiologist's viewpoint, "if people can't store and keep food safely, you're not doing them any favors getting them that food," she said.

"There are good frozen, canned and dried food options" that may be safer, she added.

Ultimately, in the choice between eating and food safety, it's no contest.

"This population is more concerned about access to food than food safety," said Benjamin Chapman, an expert on food safety. "The first step is just getting food, whatever the means."

He added, "The biggest risk is not eating at all."
