NORTHAMPTON, Mass. â€” Audrey Olmos-Govea's parents were born in Mexico. She is the first in her family to go to college.

Audrey goes to Smith College in Massachusetts. Smith is very small. It is a very good school. It also costs a lot of money. Audrey remembers sitting in a class. The teacher asked the students if they had been to Europe.

Many of Audrey's classmates were from rich families. Most had been to Europe. It made Audrey feel like she did not belong in the class. Her family is poor. Audrey comes from a town where many people did not even finish high school.

## Speaking Up Was Good

Then Audrey spoke up. She told the class that her family did not have money to go to Europe. She said she had to work every summer.

The teacher felt bad and said she was sorry. Audrey knew she did the right thing.

Young people like Audrey are called first-generation students. They are the first in their families to go to college. Many of their parents were born in other countries.

There are not many first-generation students at the best colleges. Some small colleges are trying to change that. They are trying get more first-generation students.

## Helping Students To Do Well

It is not easy for these students. Most of them quit. The poorest students have the least chance of finishing. The colleges know why. First, the schools cost a lot of money. Next, the classes can be hard. Finally, the students might be afraid to ask for help.

These colleges are trying to get more first-generation students to come. They also want to help them to stay and do well.

The colleges are giving students money to help pay for school. They also have special programs for the students.

## The Program Is Working

Smith's program helps students to feel good about school. It helps them feel like they belong there. Most first-generation students do fine at Smith.

As a new student, Audrey did not feel very good. Now, she is much more confident. She is able to ask questions and speak out.
