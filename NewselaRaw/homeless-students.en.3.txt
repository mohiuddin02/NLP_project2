ATLANTA — College student Javon Butts had his schedule worked out pretty well.

Most days, it went like this: Start classes at 8 a.m., finish up around noon, then head off to work. His life as a student at Kennesaw State University (KSU) was far from perfect, but it was manageable.

And then his car broke down.

The car wasn't just a way to get around — it was his home as well.

## A Problem Nationwide

Butts is not alone, says Marcy Stidum, coordinator of KSU's CARE center, which helps homeless students. Most every college in the nation has students like Butts. They attend classes each day, do their schoolwork and blend in. But when other students go home at night, they have nowhere to go. They turn to their cars, school buildings and the couches or floors of friends.

Georgia is developing a program to help homeless students throughout the state. But for now, KSU is the only Georgia college with someone like Stidum whose job it is to watch out for them.

"People say these students aren't homeless, they are in college," said Stidum. It is true, she said, that the cost of their classes is covered. But it's the other things like housing they can't afford. "They are not the stereotypical homeless. These are students with clothes on their backs, with an iPad, living in their car, and starving."

Stidum came to KSU to work in the school's mental health program. A year into that job, she received a call about a homeless student. After helping almost a dozen homeless students, she realized it was a serious problem. Since fall 2011, KSU's CARE center has helped 61 homeless students, including Butts.

Butts came to KSU in August 2012 after transferring from a South Carolina college. He is in his second year studying money management.

Back then Butts, 20, lived in a university dorm with other students. In fall 2013, he was using his student loan money to pay his monthly student housing bill.

## Living On Friends' Couches

But before he paid the third month's rent, his mother and sister asked him for help with paying their bills. Butts gave them his rent money. Unable to get the money back, he got further and further behind on his rent. Eventually, he was kicked out of the dorm.

"I wanted to look out for them," he said. But, he said, he's come to realize that "you have to look out for yourself."

During the 2012–2013 school year, more than 58,150 college students nationwide said they were homeless. But the real number is probably larger. Some students living on friends' couches, for example, don't consider themselves homeless. And some others are too embarrassed to say anything.

Last year, the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth received 260 requests for help. Calls from Georgia outnumbered all other states.

Under Georgia's new program, each college would have someone like KSU's Stidum. They would be assigned to provide support for homeless students.

These days Butts keeps pretty much to himself. The less other students know about his situation, the better. He has a hotel room but can't afford it for long. With Stidum's help, he is looking for a cheaper apartment. Once he has saved up enough money he plans to move back to a KSU dorm in the fall.

## Teaching Life Skills

Other states have programs similar to Georgia's. In those states, coaches not only help homeless students deal with college. They also teach life skills, such as paying bills.

The programs help students like Samuel Robinson, 38. He has been homeless for more than a year.

He didn't start out that way. After graduating from high school, Robinson worked low-paying, unskilled jobs for a while. He left small-town Georgia for better opportunities in the Atlanta area, but again found only low-paying work. He enrolled at KSU in 2010, and was slowly working his way through school when he lost his job two years later.

Stidum is helping Robinson figure out how to pay off his debts to KSU. Robinson hopes to catch up in time to sign up for summer classes. He is still living with friends, but now has a job to pay for living expenses.

Like Butts, Robinson never told his family about his struggle.

"I don't want pity," he said. "It's embarrassing to be an adult and be homeless."
