WASHINGTON, D.C. — Many states are using technology in new ways to help clear roads this winter. The technology helps make roads safer during snow and ice storms.

States from Pennsylvania to Nevada will battle the winter weather by using high-tech tools. For example, some states have tracking gear on their snowplows. Others have snowplows with onboard cameras that send photos of current conditions.

"Technology has changed winter services across the board," said Rich Roman. He is in charge of keeping the roads clear in Pennsylvania. These days, the inside of a snow plow "almost looks like the cockpit of an airplane" he said. It has many buttons and dials.

Rick Nelson runs the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) winter road program. AASHTO represents state transportation departments in Washington. Nelson said states are putting more time and money into research and technology. They want to make sure people can get where they need to go.

## Americans Expect To Drive

People in the U.S. want to be able to drive around no matter what the weather conditions are, he said.

State transportation departments are usually responsible for maintaining roads and bridges. In many states, that means paying millions of dollars for trucks, salt and staff time.

An AASHTO survey studied the spending of 23 states. It found that they spent about $1.13 billion between October 2014 and April 2015 treating and plowing roads. That was a large portion of what they had to spend on roads all year. For example, New Hampshire spent 55 percent of its road money.

Nelson said weather forecasters do a good job predicting the weather. Still, a winter storm can be very different once it hits the ground. That's why states are turning to snow-fighting technology.

## Keeping Eyes On The Road

Many have installed their own weather stations. The stations use sensors in the pavement to notify them about the road's temperature. The sensors also can tell whether the road is wet or dry. That helps the states decide when to apply more, or fewer, chemicals to melt ice.

Some states use equipment on plow trucks that shows where the trucks are. The information is sent to headquarters instantly. A few also use the gear to track weather, road conditions and the amount of salt being used. This lets bosses know when road conditions change. It helps them get a better idea of how materials are being used and how long people are working on the roads. 

Some states use technology to see how well they perform during particular storms. They learn how quickly they cleared roads and how soon motorists were able to drive at normal speeds. They also are trying to figure out if there were fewer crashes. 

## Technology Will Save Lives

About 1,500 people a year are killed in crashes involving snow, sleet or ice, said Paul Pisano. He works for the U.S. government group and in charge of roads and highways. Pisano said the new technology helps make roads safer.  

Craig Bargfrede runs the Iowa Department of Transportation's winter operations. He said about half the state's snowplows have iPhones. They take photos of the road every five to 10 minutes. The photos are posted on a website so bosses can see how the roads look. This lets the bosses see road conditions from home and the office. They do not have to go out on the roads. It saves time and money.

In Minnesota, most of the state's plow trucks can gather information about the weather and road temperatures. Computers use the information to suggest which chemicals to spread on the road. They also say how much to use, and how frequently to plow.

Officials are also concerned about the results of using salt and anti-icing chemicals. The chemicals can be dangerous in some areas. In years' past, a plow truck operator would simply spread salt over and over. Now they use just the amount needed to do the job and no more. Officials say technology helps make that happen.
