MARYSVILLE, Wash. — Lauren Meek is learning about computer coding at her school. She writes a set of instructions with computer code. The she hits the "run" button. A character moves through a maze. Meek is 6 years old.

"Yes! This is so easy," Lauren says. She is a kindergartner at Marshall Elementary. It is near Seattle, a big city in Washington state.

This fall, most elementary students in her school district have weekly computer lessons. The lessons are part of a new idea in the United States. The idea is to teach computer science to more school children.

## Computer Classes For A Better Life

Technology leaders, companies and other groups are all helping. With their help, schools in New York, San Francisco and elsewhere are offering computer science to students.

Supporters say it is not just about learning how to code. Students are also learning how computers work. They say computer science teaches kids to think clearly. It also helps them use their imaginations. Computers will be important in the students' future, supporters say.

Computer science is just as important now as science courses like chemistry, said Hadi Partovi. He started a group called Code.org. The group gives more students a chance to try computer science. It also wants more women and minorities to work with computers.

Code.org runs a program called an "Hour of Code." It wants millions of students to try coding for an hour.

Learning about computers is a necessary skill, said Yasmin Kafai. She is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Teaching computer science in schools gives everybody a chance to learn about technology, she said.

Learning computer science also helps people get jobs. By 2020, there will be 9 million science, technology, engineering and math jobs. Half of those will be in computing, the U.S. government said.

## Critic Opposes Coding For Young Kids

Jim Taylor wrote a book about kids growing up with computers and video games. It is called "Raising Generation Tech." He says there is no proof that learning coding works. Young kids do not need to learn how to use computer technology, he added.

Computer science is different from other subjects. There are no rules for teaching it. There also are no good tests to measure learning, said Jeanne Century. She is a professor at the University of Chicago.

Still, computing is "everywhere in our lives," she said. It is also needed in many jobs.

## Wanted: Computer Science Teachers

One problem is finding enough teachers who are well-prepared to teach computer science.

Classes in computer science are taught in only about 1 of every 4 U.S. high schools. Even fewer schools teach computer science in lower grades.

Still, there has been a jump in interest. In 2015, nearly 49,000 students took the Advanced Placement exam in computer science. The number was up from about 40,000 in 2014. The exam is a test that high schoolers can take that counts in college. 

## Low-Income Kids Get An Equal Chance

At Marshall Elementary, more than half the students are from low-income families. Their families do not have much money. Principal Kelly Sheward sees teaching computer science as an opportunity. It can make sure the students are as prepared as children at other schools, Sheward said.

Teacher Sheena York asks a class of fifth-graders to find the pattern in a computer puzzle. They have to solve it using the fewest steps. She urges them to try different ideas. Then she tells them to test their work as they go along and ask each other for help.

"I'm figuring this out piece by piece to see if this works," said 10-yer-old Isiah Gibbs. "That doesn't work. So I'll try something else."
