CHICAGO â€” Holes are appearing and disappearing in the sands of Mount Baldy in Indiana. Erin Argyilan is trying to find out why.

She is one of many scientists looking for clues on where these holes come from. She has looked at soil. She has looked at how the wind was blowing. And she has made a map of the area.

The holes are about a foot wide and can be dangerous. They are there for less than a day before filling in naturally with sand.

Investigators are using special tools to look underground. But no one knows why the holes form along the surface of this park.

This week, the National Park Service said Mount Baldy will stay closed. That's because two holes were discovered.

The rest of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore park will be open. Thousands of people visit the park each year.

## Boy Trapped In Sandy Hole For Hours

Argyilan, the scientist, does not just want to solve the mystery because it's her job. She has another reason, too. In mid-July, she was working at the base of Mount Baldy when she heard parents screaming. They were pointing at the ground that swallowed their 6-year-old son. The ground was soft so he fell in.

At first, Argilyan thought they were mistaken. There should be no holes in a dune. A dune is a hill made up of grains of sand with no room for air.

Then rescue crews saved little Nathan Woessner. He had been buried for three hours under 11 feet of sand and gravel.

"I cried for three days," said Argyilan. She couldn't stop replaying in her mind the horror of the day. "I couldn't help in the moment. So now I have to do what I can to learn why this is happening."

In August, a second hole was spotted nearby. This one is about 10 inches wide and at least 5 feet deep.

Scientists think dead trees beneath the sand might be causing the holes to form.

The 126-foot dune has been moving away from the lake shore quickly, covering the old area in sand, experts have said. They think sand is drifting south and burying trees. Those trees could be rotting and creating the holes beneath the surface.

Argilyan thinks there probably won't be any holes appearing in other dunes.

"This particular dune has a complicated history," she said.

## Planting New Grass Might Help

Human actions have worn down Mount Baldy.  In the past, people mined sand to make glass jars. That could have added to the problem. So could the piers on the harbor.  Argilyan said she's looked at pictures of the area from 1938, and the changes are huge.

Most sand dunes are covered in grass and trees. But not Mount Baldy. There the trees and grass are now buried.

During the closure, the National Park Service will be planting new grass where the old grass once grew. They hope the grass will hold the sand in place. Perhaps it will also stop new holes from forming.

"We don't know exactly what's going on out there; we can't let folks out onto the area until we know it's safe," said Ken Mehne, who works at the park.

Mount Baldy will likely stay closed this summer and maybe this fall, too. The rest of the park will remain open. Officials are asking visitors stay on marked trails.
