Across the nation, there has been more and more focus on concussions in young athletes. [Concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) are minor brain injuries that result from blows to the head. Particularly if they occur repeatedly, they can have serious long-term effects.

In response to this growing concern, the White House on Wednesday unveiled several new efforts. The goal is to help prevent, track and more effectively treat concussions in children.

Officials announced that $65 million had been pledged to fund these efforts.

Of that money, $30 million came from the National College Athletic Association (NCAA). Another $25 million came from the National Football League (NFL). And another $10 million was a gift from New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch.

## The Next Level Of Prevention

Tisch's contribution is intended to help get a national tracking system for concussions off the ground.

"Hopefully, 20 years from today, athletes won't be discovering the head injuries that football players now are discovering they may have gotten when they were playing in high school and college," said Tisch. "This is kind of a new frontier."

Tisch's donation will expand a program founded in 2012. So far, that program has treated 600 young patients with brain injuries and studied the aftereffects of concussions in student athletes.

"This commitment will launch our program to the next level," said the program's director, Dr. Christopher Giza. Now, Giza said, the program will be able to reach more schools and youth sports leagues. Its goal will be to fuel advances in treatment, and to learn more about the longer-term effects of concussion.

Earlier studies have shown that concussions can cause serious long-term problems. Among these are learning problems, mental health problems and even dementia. This has made parents wary of allowing their children to participate in several sports, particularly football and hockey.

## Children Can Be Active, And Stay Safe

In late 2013, President Barack Obama reflected that growing concern: If I had a son, the president said, he would not let him play pro football.

Nonetheless, the Obamas take a strong interest in sports. Indeed, one of their goals is to get children to be more physically active. To help make sure sports are as safe as possible, the president has been eager to boost research on concussions.

A report on concussions was issued last fall by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. It found significant gaps in what is known about the effects of repeated blows to the developing brain.

The panel recommended that leagues, coaches and parents follow certain safety guidelines: A child who has been hit hard in the head should be banned from playing until he or she has been examined by a doctor. And game rules regulating safety should be strictly enforced. For instance, head-to-head contact in football and blindside hits to the head in hockey and lacrosse should not be allowed.

## Young Brains Take Hits Differently

Some researchers suggest that the young brain may recover more quickly from bumps and injuries than the brain of an older athlete. Others fear the opposite: Because the young brain is still developing, they say, repetitive blows may be more damaging. For one thing, they point out, much of a young brain's wiring does not have the protective, fatty coating seen in older brains.

There has been a steady increase in the number of concussions reported. In 2001 about 150,000 people under the age of 19 were treated for concussions. By 2009, that number had risen to 250,000. And a recent NCAA survey of 15 college sports showed that between 1989 and 2004 the rate of reported concussions doubled.

## Education And Better Head Gear

Other new efforts to combat concussions include the following:

—The NCAA and the Department of Defense will spend $30 million to fund the most extensive research to date on concussions. Another goal of this effort will be to change attitudes. For many athletes, blows to the head are seen as dings to be "shaken off."

—The NFL will spend $25 million to promote youth sports safety. The league says it will launch pilot programs to expand the number of athletic trainers in schools. Under a program called "Back to Sports," the NFL also will work to educate parents about sports safety.

—The National Institutes of Health will launch a long-term study of concussions. Specifically, it will examine the effects of repeated blows to the head.

—The National Institute of Standards and Technology will spend $5 million to develop advanced materials for helmets. Such materials, it is hoped, will better protect against concussion.
