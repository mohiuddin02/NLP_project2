CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. — At one time, the Marine Corps did not encourage their soldiers to have families. Those days are over.

More than 43,300 military soldiers and their families live on the Marine's major West Coast base at Camp Pendleton. These families enjoy all the comforts of a lively, midsize town. Camp Pendleton has nine health centers, a golf course, many swimming pools, and dozens of day care centers for children.

The Marine base even has its own hospital, a movie theater, 20 fast-food restaurants and 13 barber shops. The base's supermarket sells groceries for up to 30 percent less than at stores off the base.

Neighborhoods feature beautiful two-story houses surrounded by green lawns. The website for housing on the base emphasizes Camp Pendleton's 17 miles of ocean views.

"We build communities, just like neighborhoods outside the camp," said Robert Marshall, director of family housing. "Just because the Marines are on duty, doesn't mean their families have to be as well."

That considerate approach reflects a growing theme in the military: provide for the families as well as the warriors.

## Mega-Bases Support Generations

However, the question is this: Has the sheltered lifestyle on this military base reinforced a separation between the all-volunteer military and the nation it is meant to serve? Once, when young men were required to serve in the U.S. military through a draft system — like a lottery — many more people spent time in the armed forces and developed close ties to the military.

The United States Department of Defense runs the military, and has closed more than 350 U.S. bases in the last 20 years. Those 350 bases were combined into fewer, larger bases. It allowed for the remaining bases to run better than before and for the government to save money.

The communities that cluster around the mega-bases are almost always dominated by people who are associated with the military. Many of these people even come from families who have had generations of family members in the military.

The Defense Department is the biggest employer in San Diego County, providing more than 133,000 jobs. Another 245,000 military veterans live in the county. Last year, the government spent more than $25 billion in Oceanside and surrounding communities.

At the same time, some experts worry about this self-sufficiency. They worry that it may add to the sense of a divided society.

## The Burdens Of War, Peace

Ron Bee, a professor of political science, is concerned that so few Americans serve in the military. Bee believes that non-military members have placed the burdens of war and peace solely on the shoulders of the military.

"At universities and in everyday discussion, we tend to separate" our soldiers from ourselves, he said.

Steve Erie, another political science professor, believes that Americans truly respect the military, even if they do not join themselves. "From the public's standpoint, the all-volunteer force appears to be working fine," he said.

## Base Life Holds Sense Of Family, Safety

Here at the homes of the 1st Marine Division, many say that the upgraded living conditions helped the Marines and their families endure the strain of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: the back-to-back deployments, the uncertainty, and the tragic deaths.

"It's more of a family than living outside the base," said Jessica Konczal, 33, whose husband is Sergeant Matthew Konczal. "If you've had a hard day, you'll probably meet someone at the grocery store who understands because they're going through the same thing."

Military families strongly believe that non-military families do not understand their lives. The constant moving, the raising of children with a parent far away, and the fear of losing a loved one to war all combine to make it difficult for outsiders to understand them.

"We've lost a few friends to war," said Jolene Bopp, 25, who is also a military wife. "But you learn to live with the losses."

Like many wives, Bopp appreciates the shopping choices on the base and the sense of safety for the children. However, she says that there are times when "you just need to get away."

## Changes Are Noticeable

These days, the base does not affect nearby Oceanside as much as it once did.

Sending Camp Pendleton's Marines to the first Gulf War in 1991 to remove Iraq after it invaded Kuwait, caused many problems for Oceanside's businesses. However, 10 years later, when Marines left for Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, there were hardly any changes to local business. Families had already been doing most of their shopping on base.

Officials here argue that life inside the base is not as separate as it appears.

All unmarried Marines under the rank of sergeant live on base. However, only one-third of married Marines do. Also, the average Marine returns to a normal, service-free life after four years of active duty.

Non-military people are now even allowed to bicycle through the base. Thousands of athletes flock to the base for the yearly "mud run." Others come to play paintball and enjoy different outdoor activities.

Chelsey Kurtz welcomes all of these changes. She grew up on the base in the 1990s, when her father was in the Navy. Now that she is 30, she lives on the base again with her husband and two children.

"When my father was here, it was just a workplace," Kurtz said. "Now it's a family place."
