WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” The U.S. Capitol is a famous building in Washington, D.C. Lawmakers meet there and make laws. Workers are fixing the dome. It is a half circle on top of the building.

The dome has not been fixed in more than 50 years. Since then, it has become rusty. There are tiny holes in it. Rain and snow have made the holes bigger. The dome now has more than 1,000 cracks.

The Capitol's dome is more than 150 years old. It weighs nearly 9 million pounds.

## It All Began With A Can Of Rust

The project started with a can of rust. Alan M. Hantman worked at the Capitol from 1997 to 2007. He put some of the rust in a coffee can. Then, he showed the can to lawmakers. Alan wanted them to see how the dome was crumbling above them.

Finally lawmakers agreed to fix the dome. In May 2014, workers built a frame around the dome. It weighs 1 million pounds. The frame lets workers fix the dome. It will be taken down when they are finished. At night, the frame makes the dome glow.

The workers are fixing the dome a little at a time. Much of the work has been done on nights and weekends. That is because lawmakers still want to be able to use the building. They need to get to their meetings. They want people to visit too.

## On Time And On Budget

Zoe Lofgren is a lawmaker from California. She said they cannot let the dome fall apart.

Zoe said the project will be finished next year. Workers have already taken down part of the frame. Fixing the dome will cost almost $60 million.

In 2013, workers fixed the Washington Monument. An earthquake had damaged it. The monument honors George Washington. He was the country's first president. Workers wrapped the monument in a metal frame. It looked like a glowing rocket ship at night.

Zoe thinks the same thing about the Capitol frame. She said it also looks like a spaceship.

The building is more beautiful, though, than the metal frame, she said.
