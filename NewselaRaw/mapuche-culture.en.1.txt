SANTIAGO, Chile — Nestled between high-rise buildings on a busy street in Chile's modern capital is a straw hut. Its presence there is a sign of growing respect for the Andean country's long-disdained indigenous past.

Sick patients line up to see the Mapuche herbalist inside as part of a government program to incorporate traditional knowledge into Chile's public health system.

Mapuche culture, long looked down upon in Chile, is slowly becoming chic.

"I'm not Mapuche, but I believe in their culture," said Elba Soto, 56, who often comes to the ruka — a traditional Mapuche thatched home — looking for herbs and ointments to ease the pain in her bones. "And I love all of it."

## Fashion, Food And Music Appreciated

The geometrical designs of the Mapuche have made their way into fashion shows from New York to Paris. Their food is inspiring high-end restaurants. Also, popular singer Ana Tijoux waves the multicolored Mapuche flag during her concerts and raps about their struggle in her Grammy-nominated albums. Television stations even compete for ratings with shows about the Mapuche, the country's largest native group, who lived in the area for centuries before the Spanish conquered it.

"The Mapuche today are not just folklore. The Mapuche today are a cultural icon and a pop-cultural icon," said Pedro Cayuqueo, a Mapuche author and host of "KulMapu," a popular TV show profiling everything Mapuche that is broadcast on CNN Chile.

The Mapuche, he said, have become cool.

Mapuche means "people of the land" in their original language. They resisted invaders for centuries — first the mighty Incan empire and then the Spanish conquistadors who arrived five centuries ago in the area now known as Chile.

The Mapuche ultimately won treaties with the Chilean state recognizing their right to everything south of the Bio Bio river, the southern half of the long, thin country.

## Land Treaties Were Broken

But in the late 19th century, a new wave of European settlers arrived, and the treaties were broken, with Mapuche lands seized in violent takeovers. The survivors were pushed to the edges of settled lands.

Today, most of the more than 1 million Mapuche live in Santiago's metropolitan area and in their ancestral home in south-central Araucania, the country's poorest region.

As a group, they are far poorer and less educated than other Chileans, and tend to suffer more illness, malnutrition and discrimination.

Even with the return of some lands in recent decades, the Mapuche hold a small fraction of what they controlled until the late 19th century.

An extreme group of the Mapuche in Araucania has occupied and burned farms and lumber trucks to demand the return of lands. Police have been accused of violence, including storming into Mapuche homes during raids and shooting rubber bullets at women and children.

## Conflict Draws Attention To Native Culture

While most Chileans, and most Mapuche, reject the violence, the conflict has drawn attention to their demands and interest in their culture.

Cayuqueo said young Mapuche are curious about exploring their roots and no longer deny their origins the way their ancestors did to avoid discrimination.

Authorities in Chile also are taking some steps to encourage the culture of native peoples. Last month, the government hosted the first tournament of indigenous soccer players from all over Latin America. This month, it launched a pilot program to train professors to teach the original Mapuche tongue, Mapudungun, which is still spoken by many.

At the hut in Santiago, herbalist Natalia Ojeda Hueitra said she sees improvement in how Mapuches are treated.

"Before there was a lot of discrimination, lots of people looking down at us, and many saw the Mapuche as the lowest of the low," said Hueitra, who wears the traditional "trapelacucha," a large silver collar that spreads to the chest. "Not anymore. Today, it's about empowerment."

You'll find Mapuche influence on the menu at Borago restaurant, recently named in the prestigious World's 50 Best Restaurants list with sponsors including Diner's Club International and S. Pellegrino. It uses traditional cooking methods, such cooking in the ground with live coals, and uses ingredients such as maqui, a berry that comes from a tree that is sacred to the Mapuche.

"We're cooking the native cuisine of Chile," said Rodolfo Guzman, Borago's chef and owner. "We're the continuation of the Mapuche."

## Drama Compared To "Game Of Thrones"

VOZ, a New York fashion design company, works with Mapuche artisans in Chile and sells their hand-woven designs as far away as Asia and the Middle East. They've been displayed in Los Angeles and Paris and during New York Fashion Week.

The Mapuche work "is so beautiful and so expertly crafted," said VOZ founder Jasmine Aarons. "And the stories that the Mapuche artisans tell in their artwork is so powerful, like their culture."

Chilean state television recently began broadcasting a historical drama called "Besieged: The Other Side of the Conquest," which focuses on the battle of Curalaba in 1598, a famous victory by the Mapuche against the Spanish. The show has been so popular that some local critics refer to it as the Mapuche "Game of Thrones."

"What's happening shows that Mapuche people have a lot of wisdom to share," said Mapuche leader Hugo Alcaman. "We're proud of being indigenous because we know of the wisdom that we have to offer to the world."
