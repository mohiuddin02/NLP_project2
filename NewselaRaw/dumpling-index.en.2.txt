SHANGHAI, China — Chef-turned-food writer Christopher St. Cavish is striding toward the front door of the Welcome Revered Guests restaurant when he stops dead in his tracks. "They don't like me here," he says, frowning.

It's not that he has criticized the eatery. In fact, he gave it his highest rating. Rather, what has annoyed the staff here is the way St. Cavish judges the quintessential Shanghai snack: soup dumplings known as xiao long bao (pronounced SHOW-long-BAO). The dumplings have just a thin layer of dough, with hot soup and a meatball inside.

On his last visit to the restaurant, he ordered nine baskets of the handmade dumplings. Then, he spent the next hour studying them like a lab technician. His equipment included an electronic scale, digital calipers (to measure thickness) and special scissors.

After all his calculations, he ate only two dumplings. The other 52 went into a takeout box.

## Making An Annoying (To Some) Study Of It

With his scientific tools in hand, St. Cavish has visited dozens of restaurants to study xiao long bao. He has probed the thinness of the dough, the volume of the soup and the weight of hundreds upon hundreds of pork meatballs. He has studied how the structure of xiao long bao changes when it leaves the steamer and starts to cool.

The numbers have been crunched into what just may be the nerdiest restaurant guide ever, the Shanghai Soup Dumpling Index. Welcome Revered Guests restaurant, or Zun Ke Lai in Mandarin, came in first place.

Foodies all over the world have become obsessed with xiao long bao, which are eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner or even to satisfy the midnight munchies. The Shanghai government has listed them as one of 84 "protected traditional treasures" of the city.

St. Cavish is a 34-year-old from Florida who worked as a chef for 10 years before coming to China. He is perhaps more qualified than most to declare that the dumplings at Zun Ke Lai are superior. Since late 2013, he has visited 52 sellers of xiao long bao in an effort to find the best.

Some of the staff at Zun Ke Lai, though, have been more irritated than thrilled by St. Cavish's attention.

"They were (angry)," St. Cavish recalls, glancing through the front window to see whether the woman who had to hand-make his infuriating 54-dumpling order is behind the counter today. "When I later told her Zun Ke Lai came out on top of my index, she was totally unimpressed. She looked at me as if I had just told her I had a toenail problem," he said.

## The Shanghai Soup Dumpling Index

Still, the Shanghai Soup Dumpling Index has made St. Cavish rather famous in China.

News outlets across the country have reported on the index, which St. Cavish has published in the form of a scientific-looking foldable chart (cost: $8). The brochure is funny and technical at the same time.

Before coming to China, St. Cavish said, he didn't have a background in science and had never even eaten xiao long bao. Even today, he says they're not his favorite dish, and he doesn't cook them at home.

"I'm not obsessed with them," he says, pushing his thick black-framed glasses up the bridge of his nose. "But they happen to be a vehicle for lots of other ideas I have about food and food writing."

St. Cavish says part of his motivation was to find a new way to talk about food.

"All my previous writing about food was very subjective," he says. "It was liberating to go to a restaurant and not think: Do I like this or not like it, why or why not?"

## Think More Deeply, Talk More Precisely

Xiao long bao proved to be a good subject for St. Cavish's experiment. That's because the things that go into making a great soup dumpling can be easily measured.

St. Cavish admits that on one hand, the index is a "ridiculous project."

"It's a funny experiment; I don't want people to take it too seriously," he says, sitting in a booth at Zun Ke Lai, his measuring equipment and three baskets of dumplings in front of him. "I'm not implying that people should only cook by scales or measurements … of course the human factor is very important."

Yet at the same time, he says the index gives restaurant-goers — and himself — a way to think more deeply and talk more precisely about what makes a food satisfying or even delicious.

"As a food writer, your responsibility is to explain why you like or don't like something," he said.
