ALLENTOWN, Pa. â€” Jeff Stocker gets excited when he talks about the American Civil War. He especially likes talking about the Battle of Gettysburg.  "To be in the field at Gettysburg , it gives me chills just talking about it," he says.

Gettysburg was fought on Pennsylvania farmland just 10 miles north of the border between the North and South.

Stocker's great-grandfather dragged a wounded Union captain away from Rebel troops on that battlefield.

Stocker and his father walked that battlefield during their summers together. Stocker was also there on Monday for the 150th anniversary of the three-day battle.

## "We Fought Desperate"

Gettysburg inspired Stocker to write his latest book. The book is called "We Fought Desperate." It tells the story of the 153rd Volunteer Regiment of Pennsylvania. Stocker's great-grandfather was part of that group of untested soldiers.

Stocker has studied the letters, diaries and files of hundreds of men who were part of the unit. Many of those soldiers never made it back home. The research and writing took seven years. The people he wrote about, "Chances are, just like you," he said.

One of those people is Heinrich Feirich. He was 40. He came from Prussia and was a shoemaker. Feirich volunteered to serve nine months with the 153rd Pennsylvania in September 1862. His wife was pregnant at the time. Only four months later, Pvt. Feirich began suffering from deafness. He was reassigned as a servant for Capt. George Young.

By late June 1863, Confederate soldiers invaded the North.  The 153rd marched 10 miles on the morning of July 1 as the enemy neared. The 153rd came to a grassy hilltop on the northeast corner of Gettysburg's battlefield. But it was too far from other Union troops.  The Union soldiers got hit hard by Confederate soldiers who charged out of the trees.

Capt. Young was shot in the face. He was one of more than 250 from the unit to be wounded, killed or captured. Feirich began dragging him from the battlefield. But Young ordered him to save himself and run, Stocker's research found. Young was captured and survived the war.

## Feirich Wounded In Battle

Feirich completed his nine-month enlistment. Then he joined a different unit. He deserted, was captured, and spent two weeks in prison. The Union Army added him back to its ranks because it badly needed soldiers. Feirich was shot in the left knee in another battle. He felt the injury until he died in 1894.  He became a U.S. citizen after the war.

One of Feirich's daughters married Albert Stocker. In 1919, she gave birth to the last of her 14 children. That was Donald Stocker. He was Jeff Stocker's father. Donald Stocker fought in World War II. Then he got married and started his own family.  Jeff's dad took him to Gettysburg as soon as Jeff could walk. Donald Stocker would talk about Feirich.

Jeff Stocker loved reading about the Civil War and World War II, just like his father did. He likes copies of Civil War soldiers' diaries. In 1990, he was donating a writing about the war. A historian suggested that he try to publish it.

That writing became "From Huntsville to Appomattox, Robert T. Coles' History of the 4th Alabama." Then he wrote another book about Gettysburg.

## Manuscript In A Coffin

In 2006, Donald Stocker was in his mid-80s. He still visited Gettysburg. Jeff Stocker thought his father would get a kick out of reading about Heinrich Feirich and the 153rd.

He read every diary, newspaper account and letter that he could find. He read other documents. The research is stuffed into file folders in Stocker's office. He also kept his day job as a personal injury lawyer.

The title, "We Fought Desperate," is a quote from a soldier describing a battle fought in Virginia.

This week, thousands are gathering at Gettysburg for the anniversary. Donald Stocker will not be with them. He died last summer at the age of 93. Stocker placed a manuscript of "We Fought Desperate" in his coffin.
