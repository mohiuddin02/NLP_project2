Researchers in England reached into the past to find a cure for a deadly infection.

Recently, they rediscovered an ancient treatment that may be able to fight a modern superbug.

The recipe for the remedy comes from a thousand-year-old book called "Bald's Leechbook." It was found in the library of the University of Nottingham's Institute for Medieval Research. The medieval period, also called the Middle Ages, lasted from the year 500 to about 1500 in Europe.

The ancient treatment works against a deadly bacteria that is extremely difficult to treat. The bacteria is called Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, better known as MRSA (pronounced mersa). Most antibiotic medicines will not cure it.

## What Would Robin Hood Do?

Let's imagine that during a nighttime escape through Sherwood Forest, the legendary outlaw Robin Hood scratched his eye on a branch. It became infected, and he went to an herbalist for treatment. An herbalist is like an early pharmacist who treated illnesses with herbs. The herbalist took a brass pot and mixed together bile from a cow's stomach and Allium — a plant from the garlic family. The ointment was smeared on his infected eye.

Until recently, the recipe lay unnoticed in the fragile pages of "Bald's Leechbook."

It was rediscovered by Viking studies professor Christina Lee. She wanted to see what "Bald's Leechbook" showed about how much people knew about medicine in the Middle Ages. She also wondered how healers and herbalists chose their treatments and whether they had worked.

Lee translated the recipe for the eye treatment from the original Old English. She asked chemists at her university to make up a batch and test it.

Lee's request came at an important time. Freya Harrison, who studies small life forms like bacteria, was looking to create a new medicine.

Scientists in Harrison's lab followed the recipe precisely. They also made up a control experiment for comparison. The control batch left out the key ingredients.

In the lab, the thousand-year-old recipe was a powerful killer. Only about 1 in 1,000 MRSA bacterial cells survived the ancient drug.

Later, the researchers tested the drug in infected wounds in mice. It killed 90 percent of the MRSA bacteria.

## Testing Bald's Cure On Mice

Harrison says she was "absolutely blown away" with the recipe's effects. She had thought it might kill some of the dangerous bacteria, but not this much of it. Researchers found that some of its elements — especially copper and bile — affect bacteria. Plants in the garlic family are also known to stop bacteria like MRSA.

The combination of these elements in this ancient formula was powerful, Harrison said. It was able to break through the sticky coating of the MRSA bacteria and kill them.

Harrison's lab watered down the treatment to see whether it continued to kill bacteria. At that point, the scientists figured out how the recipe worked. Even when they added water to the treatment and it didn't kill the MRSA, it still stopped cells from talking to each other. This is important. The communication between MRSA cells allows bacteria to damage the body. Blocking these signals may be a good way to treat the infection.

"We know that MRSA-infected wounds are exceptionally difficult to treat in people," said Kendra Rumbaugh. She works at Texas Tech University's School of Medicine. Rumbaugh tested Bald's cure on mice.

Rumbaugh said that no single medicine or treatment treats MRSA every time. But she said the ancient remedy worked as well as, if not better than, modern drugs do.

The partnership between Old English remedies and biology has helped create a new program at Nottingham called AncientBiotics. Researchers will study treatments that combine the ancient healing arts and modern science.
