The 18th-century British navigator Captain James Cook is famous as the first European to explore the South Pacific. Centuries before him, however, Polynesian seafarers sailed the same waters. Their canoes crossed vast stretches of ocean. As they traveled, they settled islands from Samoa and New Zealand all the way to Hawaii.

How they managed such a feat has long been a mystery.

A recent discovery may finally shed some light. In 2012 a large piece of a 600-year-old canoe was found on New Zealand's South Island, after a storm helped dig it out of a sand dune. A 20-foot-long piece was found of the hull, or main body, of the ship. It was part of a huge canoe that was carved from a single tree.

## Wooden Canoe Called A "Waka"

The wooden ship is one of just two canoes dating back to such an early time period. It is carefully described in a new study.

Few such ships have lasted long enough to be found, because wood usually decays quickly. Fortunately the swampy spot it was buried in allowed the canoe to last through the centuries. Its shape is very unlike the Polynesian boats that European explorers of the islands saw much later.

"It was one of those situations where it sort of took your breath away," said study author Dilys Amanda Johns. "I'd never seen anything like it."

By examining the wood, the team determined that the canoe dated from around the year 1400. Known as a waka, it was probably at least 46 feet long when it was whole, Johns said.

## Carved Sea Turtle Image

The image of a sea turtle is carved into the hull. Such symbols were rarely used by the Maori, a Polynesian people who settled New Zealand after sailing from Polynesia between 1250 and 1300. Yet, sea turtle images were featured throughout other peoples in Polynesia. Sea turtles were admired in Polynesia, and were celebrated for their long ocean voyages.

A few features of the canoe hadn't been seen before in New Zealand. Among them were four ribs carved into the hull. Such ribs were found in canoes in the Southern Cook Islands, however, as late as 1913.

The New Zealand canoe also resembles a canoe found 30 years ago in the Society Islands. The Society Islands canoe is thought to be from the same time period as the New Zealand one. What is surprising is that the two canoes were discovered 2,500 miles apart. Clearly, the Polynesians knew how to get around.

Scientists are trying to understand what sort of boats would have allowed Polynesians to brave the ocean.

One thing about them has puzzled scientists. Wind patterns as we know them today suggest that the Polynesian voyagers had to travel against the wind. Being able to do that would have meant that the Polynesians had very advanced sailing canoes, some scientists believe.

## A Windy Debate

Recently, however, a team led by Ian D. Goodwin has challenged that idea. Shifting wind patterns, Goodwin claims, may have temporarily created ideal conditions for travel in certain directions. During such periods, advanced sailing canoes wouldn't have been necessary. Of course, that doesn't prove that the Polynesians didn't have such canoes â€” only that they didn't need them.

Goodwin's team reached its conclusion by reconstructing wind patterns during the time of the Polynesian voyages. They found that at key periods, the winds made travel to certain distant islands much easier. For example, they said, the winds favored sailing from central East Polynesia to New Zealand from 1140 to 1260. From 1250 to 1280, they favored travel to Easter Island.

Such sailing conditions would have allowed simple canoes to travel all of the routes.

For her part, Johns is not entirely convinced by the Goodwin study. She admits the patterns Goodwin found may have been helpful. However, she said, the end of such wind patterns doesn't appear to have stopped the Polynesians.

"We think Polynesians were really good sailors," said Johns, speaking from New Zealand. "We think they were able to sail down here with or without help."
