### PRO: Tackle tough topics, but warn students first

NEW YORK — The college classroom is the proper place to seriously discuss potentially traumatic topics. Trigger warnings don't interfere with that process — in fact, they improve upon it.

Trigger warnings started on the Internet. Originally, they were a way to alert readers about content that might be traumatic.

A rape victim, for instance, might rightly prefer to have some warning before encountering a vivid description of sexual attack. Trigger warnings generally don't spark much hostility in online writing. Some writers use them, but most don't.

Earlier this year, though, college students started pushing for the use of trigger warnings in classes. Their demand provoked a huge, angry response.

Unlike most professors, though, I found the idea fascinating. As a history professor I discuss some very difficult material in class. I think it's important to give students a clear sense of their rights.

## Having A Positive Effect

I came up with a trigger warning of my own. In my trigger warning I tell students that some of them may find some of the material we cover disturbing.

I let students know that I'm open to discussing their personal response to historical topics during class or during my office hours. I tell them that they're free to step outside briefly if they find any readings upsetting.

A few weeks ago, I wrote an essay on the subject for the online newspaper Inside Higher Ed. Many people found it helpful. Others thought my trigger warning wasn't strong enough.

What did this tell me?

Think at least three things: First, that the discussion of trigger warnings in the classroom is still in its early stages. Teachers should take calls for change as a chance for discussion.

Second, the term trigger warnings may be new. But it might not be a huge change from what we as professors are already doing.

And third, that even minor adjustments to teaching practice can have a considerable positive effect in the classroom.

### CON: Treat college students like adults, don't shield them like kids

MADISON, Wis. — Debates over free speech are gripping colleges. Many universities have begun to put in place "trigger warnings." Others are considering whether to introduce them.

Trigger warnings are verbal or written warnings. Teachers provide them about material that might trigger "trauma" in students who have experienced or witnessed traumatic events.

The danger of trauma is that it can lead to mental or emotional problems. Experiencing events like war or assault can make students upset by certain topics. When students read about issues like race, gender or sex it can bring up memories. Even reading about a country ruling another country in discussions of colonialism and imperialism could be hurtful.

Being reminded of trauma can emotionally harm the student. It can interfere with his or her ability to learn. The case for trigger warnings is that they supposedly help protect students from re-experiencing the past trauma.

## Freedom To Explore Ideas

What could be wrong with that? Alas, many significant problems lurk just beneath the surface.

First, as many people have pointed out, it is impossible to determine in advance what material deserves a warning. Complaints, threats and lawsuits are possible if professors fail to warn of some potentially upsetting material. To avoid that, many teachers would likely extend warnings to large amounts of material. Doing so would send the incorrect message that learning itself is traumatic.

Or they could cut parts of the course material in the name of sensitivity. Small cuts could lead to further ones.

Already, trigger warnings have been applied to "The Great Gatsby," "The Merchant of Venice" and other famous works of literature.

"Gatsby?" Really?! What's next? And what if a student refuses to read the flagged material, however important it is to the class?

Another danger: trigger warnings would give too much power to administrators who run colleges. They are already eager enough to make rules to protect students' feelings. It's more important to them than the freedom to explore ideas in classrooms.

Most important, formal trigger warnings are contrary to the purposes of education.

## Education Must Prepare Students

Education should expose students to the depths of the human condition. Doing so unavoidably involves matters of good and evil, life and death — what the German thinker Nietzsche called "uncomfortable truths."

And education must prepare students to be mentally strong enough to handle the clash of ideas. It is essential to a free society.

Trigger warnings assume that many students are not capable of handling the responsibilities of adult citizenship.

At the same time, it also promotes the idea that schools should act in the place of parents.

To deal with occasional cases of extreme material, leave the matter where it has always been left: to the judgment of professors.

If a formal trigger warning must be had, place these words atop a university's main webpage: "Education necessarily exposes students to ideas and experiences that are new, challenging, and sometimes painful. To be properly educated, you must learn to handle and welcome such challenges."
