SEATTLE — Sometimes it is hard for Chance Mair to show his feelings. He just is not sure how to make people know he is happy or sad. Mair also finds it hard to tell how other people are feeling. Talking to people can make him very nervous.

Mair has Asperger's syndrome. His brain works a little differently than most people's.

Mair was certainly feeling happy the other night at Marysville Arts and Technology High School. He and the school's 50 other 12th-graders were graduating. Students filed into the hall in black robes and blue scarves.

## Facing Down His Fears

Mair was not just another graduating student. He was the class valedictorian — the top student in his grade. He would be giving the valedictorian speech. Graduating at the top of the class is a big deal for anyone. Giving an important speech is a very big deal for someone with Asperger's syndrome.

Mair had never told most of his classmates that he has Asperger's.

"For the longest time I didn't want to tell people," he said. "But now that I'm graduating, I don't want to hold it back. I want people to know me for who I really am."

Mair grew up in Marysville, Washington. As a child, he spent years learning how to do things that come naturally to other children.

## Struggling To Make Friends

For years Mair did not talk much. Often he could not tell what mood other people were in. Were they being friendly, or were they annoyed at him? He just was not sure.

Talking to people was very difficult. When he wanted to play with other children he did not know what to say. He would just stand next to them quietly.

When he has to say something to someone he can "get really nervous, really scared," he said.

"Sometimes it's not even a shyness, sometimes it's like a fear."

## Bowling Got Him On A Roll

Bowling is one thing that has helped Mair get better at talking to people. Mair became interested in the sport when he was about 5 years old. He ended up playing with different teams around the Marysville area.

Mair feels at home in a bowling alley, said his father, Derek Mair. "Doesn't matter what bowling alley. He loves it."

Mair ended up joining the Marysville High bowling team. His favorite ball is a 15-pound blue Hy-Road.

"It's the one I've been using the longest and the one I can always count on to get strikes. It's never let me down," he said.

## Math Is A Big Plus

Mair also loves math.

"I can count better than I can talk sometimes," he said.

By the time he was in high school, Mair had become very, very good at math. He was so good he ended up taking courses at Everett Community College.

In August, Mair will enter Washington State University. He plans to study math there.

"I'm really happy that I've achieved so much," he said.

Many people at Marysville High only learned that Mair has Asperger's when he gave his valedictorian speech.

## A Speech From The Heart

During the speech Mair said his struggles are just like everyone else's. We all have our own problems, he said. We just have to learn how to beat them so we can move forward.

There will always be people who say "No we can't," he said. "It's up to us to decide whether or not we listen to them."

"We choose whether we sink or swim, stand up or lay down," he said. We choose whether to "fight or fall, succeed or fail."

After he finished speaking, the students, parents and teachers all cheered loudly. Asperger's could not keep Chance Mair down.
