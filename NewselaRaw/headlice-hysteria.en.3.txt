LOVELOCK, Nev. — Deborah Pontius lives in the isolated central Nevada town of Lovelock. She is chief nurse for her school district's 600 students. Over the years, she's come to know one particular pest quite well: head lice.

Head lice are grayish-white, wingless insects that live their entire lives on human scalps. They feed on blood and attach their eggs to hair follicles. Fortunately, they don't carry disease — but they do cause terrible itching.

For years, checking for lice eggs was part of Pontius' job. On some days, she'd actually pick through the hair of students found with live head lice.

But something bigger bugged Pontius: the fact that schools sent children home when they were infested with lice.

## School District Changes Its Rules

Pontius saw students with head lice miss weeks of school. And getting permission to return to class was difficult: Students couldn't come back until parents could prove that not a single bug remained on a child's head.

Sure, lice are "icky," Pontius thought. But was there really a good reason to keep kids out of school?

To find out, Pontius consulted with experts. She contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a government agency that works to stop outbreaks of illness. She also got in touch with the American Academy of Pediatrics, a group that represents doctors who treat children. She also interviewed families of students who had lice.

It turned out that in most cases students hadn't gotten the bugs while in the classroom. And lice don't fly or jump. For lice to spread, kids would have to be touching. So it seemed reasonable that students being treated for lice could remain in class. They wouldn't really be a risk to others.

Pontius persuaded the district to change its rules. Since then, a growing number of school districts have followed her district's lead.

## But Battle Far From Over

With Pontius' help, the National Association of School Nurses changed its position. It now suggests allowing students with head lice to stay in class.

But Pontius and others she worked with know the battle isn't over.

"We know people will overreact," said Sheila Story, chief nurse for the Carson City School District. "Head lice just gets everyone overexcited."

Even in Lovelock, the new rules have some people upset.

Head lice, Pontius said, get people worked up. "The best I can hope is that people accept that this condition isn't worth taking a child from school. What people really want is for the lice to go away, and that's not going to happen."

Each year up to 12 million U.S. children under 12 become infested by lice. The bugs spread where kids are close together. For example, they can crawl among children during sleepovers or play groups.

When a child is infected, Pontius calls the parents and recommends chemical treatments. She also gives out a fact sheet she jokingly calls "Lice 101: Everything You Really Didn't Want to Know About Lice." Humor helps people from getting too worked up over lice, she says.

## Lice Called Classroom Nightmare

But Pontius hasn't been able to get rid of the idea that head lice are a sign of bad parenting. "With even the mention of head lice, people itch — they scratch their heads," she said. "Many mistakenly see the bugs as signs of a dirty home."

Shea Murphy, principal at Lovelock Elementary School, at first opposed Pontius' plan. But she has since changed her mind. "We've taken the hysteria out of head lice," she said.

Some still oppose the plan, however. Lovelock teacher Dana Montes calls lice a classroom nightmare. "One girl, all she did was sit there picking out the lice and putting them on the desk." She believes the bugs move among hats and coats on racks or among students working close together.

That's how she got a case of head lice from a student six years ago: "I leaned over her at the reading table and saw lice in her hair. Then one dropped onto the desk. By then it was too late."

The bugs are gone, but not forgotten. "When I die and go to heaven," Montes said, "the first question I'm going to ask God is: 'Why did you create lice? What was that all about?'"
