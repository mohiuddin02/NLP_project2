DETROIT â€” The Detroit Institute of Arts normally houses paintings. Now, the museum will present a very different sort of art.

Vincent Van Gogh and Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso) will share their home with Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.

"Watch Me Move: The Animation Show" is an exhibition that organizers are calling the biggest "animation show ever mounted."

It will have iconic clips of Mickey Mouse, Bart Simpson and other famous cartoons. It will also have lesser-known animated works from the past 100 years or more.

## Exhibit's Title Taken From Cartoon (What Else?)

The show unites the original cartoon-creators with modern artists. It also brings in works from Walt Disney and Pixar.

"Watch Me Move" takes its name from the movie "Little Nemo." One of the first animated movies, "Little Nemo" is more than 100 years old. The movie has an on-screen message inviting viewers to "Watch Me Move."

At the show, visitors can look at 100 animated clips. This adds up to almost 12 hours of film.

All categories of animation are represented: time-lapse, stop-motion, hand-drawn and computer-generated. It's all there in six sections designed to attract art lovers and pop-culture fans alike.

## Couches Worthy Of Homer Simpson

Couches and chairs are placed around the show with headphones. It is designed to allow visitors to relax and take in the art at their own speed.

For people who enjoy learning about the films, the museum is offering a special pass.

The pass allows them to see the show as many times as they want to and to also see the related movies and talks. One talk will be delivered by Leslie Iwerks. She is an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker whose grandfather, Ub Iwerks, was an early animator for Disney. A clip from his "Silly Symphonies" is shown just after "Little Nemo" in the show's "Beginnings" section.

The "Beginnings" section is at the start of the show. It is devoted to when the first animated pictures were used in movies.

The exhibition presents more than a lengthy string of moving pictures. The show ends on a futuristic note.

Visitors can also try a video game that begins its journey in London's Underground. And in the "projection mapping" room, a program fits projected images on surfaces of different shapes.

## D-Oh! SPIDERS

In one example from the show, light splashes across jagged-edged shapes. The way the light hits gives the appearance that spiders are crawling all around.

The museum wanted to bring everyone together at the start of the show for "Beginnings" and then let people experience the art at their own speed.

They wanted visitors to come together again at the end to learn about modern animation. The goal is for people to experience the first and last parts of the exhibition together. That way, they can explore the changes animation has gone through over the years.

"This is where the technology is now," said Holly Harmon, who works at the DIA. "When you walk into this room, you really don't know how it's done."

And as Porky Pig would say: "That's all folks."
