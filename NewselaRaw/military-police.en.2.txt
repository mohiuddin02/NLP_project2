WASHINGTON â€” Photographs showed police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, wearing camouflage and pointing powerful rifles from armored vehicles at unarmed protesters. The images symbolized what many have been debating: whether the decades-old practice of donating military equipment to the nation's police departments has gone too far.

Politicians from both sides, including Attorney General Eric H. Holder and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, pointed to Ferguson. They argued against what Holder referred to this week as "unnecessarily extreme displays of force" by police.

The debate fits into a larger pattern: A huge upsurge of violence in the 1970s and 1980s led to tough-on-crime measures across the country. Now, after two decades of improvements in most places, policies such as long, automatic prison sentences and more police spying are being questioned.

People have also recently started questioning the use of military-style equipment by small-town police departments.

## Free Rifles And Helicopters! Just Come Get Them

Since 1995, the Department of Defense, which runs the U.S. military, has given $5.1 billion in extra military equipment to local police departments. The supplies include sleeping bags, cameras and office equipment. But assault rifles, helicopters and vehicles that can withstand mine blasts are also being given out, said Mark Wright, a spokesman for the Department of Defense.

The items are free of charge except for the cost of picking them up.

The Department of Homeland Security gives more than $1 billion a year to state and local police. Much of the money goes for equipment.

This year, the Defense Department program is up for review. Normally, there would have been little argument. The program would have been renewed almost automatically. Just this summer, an effort in the House of Representatives to end the program failed by a lopsided vote of 355-62.

Now, things are different. On Friday, Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the program needed to be reviewed. Congress needs "to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended," he said.

## When Free Ends Up Costing Money

Local police departments are struggling for extra funding. Meanwhile, we live in an age of mass shootings and terrorist threats. Faced with this environment, police chiefs face a huge temptation to fill their arsenals with federal freebies, said Jim Bueermann. He is president of the Police Foundation and a former chief in Redlands, California.

"A lot of departments jumped at the opportunity to acquire things they normally could not afford," Bueermann said. But "just because we can get the equipment, it doesn't mean we should use it."

In some cases, the problems become obvious very quickly.

Last year, the small police department in Banning, California, ordered an 18-ton tank complete with gun turret. A police sergeant was assigned to pick up the tank and transport it home. Along the way, a tire blew out on Interstate 10 in southern Arizona. The vehicle slid across the roadway, totaled a pickup truck and knocked out the windshield of another vehicle.

No one was injured, but the accident cost Banning $42,000. Angry city officials and residents demanded to know why police needed a tank.

In other cases, departments have acquired equipment they could not afford to maintain. For some armored vehicles, "a tire can cost $10,000 or $12,000" to replace, said Mark Lomax, who runs the National Tactical Officers Association. The nonprofit group trains SWAT teams.

## Special Training Is Necessary

SWAT teams were created in the 1960s. Los Angeles Deputy Chief Mike Downing oversees counterterrorism and other special operations. He said in a recent report that police SWAT teams have become military units.

Police departments often begin using heavy equipment for relatively routine missions such as serving warrants, he said. Using the equipment in such a manner has become "a dangerous and unnecessary temptation."

Departments need to ask: "Do we need the type of weapon they are offering?" said Chris Nanos, chief deputy of the Pima County Sheriff's Department in southern Arizona. "A 14-ton armored vehicle? I don't know what you would do with that."

Lack of training and leadership can be as big a problem as excessive equipment, said Ron McCarthy. The former Los Angeles police SWAT team supervisor now advises police departments. "If you're not going to provide the appropriate training, you shouldn't have the equipment," he said.

Armored vehicles, military uniforms, assault rifles and police dogs escalated anger in Ferguson, he said. The equipment should have been on standby, out of view, but ready to respond quickly if needed, he said.

Still, he and other police experts said that military-grade equipment has an important role when used properly.

## When And How To React

Eugene O'Donnell is professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. He said some critics were "in denial" about the need for police to use force.

"This week's story is police overreaction. Next week's story is going to be police underreaction," O'Donnell said.

The events in Ferguson showed that "there are going to have to be serious strings attached to handing out military weaponry," he said. "There are 18,000 police departments in the U.S., and some of those police departments are scary places indeed."

But, he said, "the power of looting and rioting to destroy a city is not to be sneezed at. School shootings and heavily armed people are a fact of life, and, like it or not, terrorism hangs over us."
