HOPE MILLS, N.C. â€” Alberta Currie's great-grandparents were slaves. She was born 78 years ago in a farmhouse in the middle of tobacco and cotton fields. There wasn't even a doctor on hand, just a midwife.

No birth certificate was given to her family. The only record of her birth was a handwritten entry in the Currie family Bible.

Not having a birth certificate has become a problem. It may force Currie to miss an election for the first time since 1956. A new North Carolina law says people need to get an photo ID from the state to be allowed to vote. People will need the ID for the 2016 election.

Voters do not have to pay for the ID. But they have to bring certain papers. They need an original or certified birth certificate. They also need an original Social Security card. Many voters do not have these. Currie is one of them.

## Making It Hard For Some To Vote

Republicans wanted the law. They say it stops people from voting illegally. This is called voter fraud. But others say Republicans have a different reason. They say Republicans want to make it hard for some voters to get the IDs. They say the law targets African-Americans, students and old people. These people may vote for Democrats.

Currie has spent three years trying to get a birth certificate. Because of the new law, she must track down several other papers. For someone her age, it's no easy task.

"It takes two IDs to get the ID I need, but how can I get it if I don't have those two IDs?" Currie asked at her home. She lives in farm country.

Republicans have voted for similar laws in at least 11 states since 2011. One state is Texas. The government has sued Texas to stop the law. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has threatened lawsuits against other states. North Carolina is one he might sue.

Three civil rights groups have filed lawsuits in North Carolina. They say that the law is unfair to African-Americans. One group says the new law is like the taxes black voters had to pay in the South years ago. Those taxes were part of the Jim Crow laws. The laws kept blacks and whites separate.

## Law Cuts Student Cards As ID

Student ID cards cannot be used as identification. So North Carolina's 300,000 college students have to scramble for documents. Barack Obama won the youth vote by two-thirds in 2012.

Cassandra Perkins is a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She said she voted in 2012. All she had to do was give her on-campus address. But now she's having a hard time getting the papers that the new law requires.

"It's a slap in the face," Perkins said of the law.

The law also cuts early voting by a week. People also cannot sign up to vote the day that they vote.

The number of people voting in North Carolina rose greatly from 1991 to 2012, according to reporter Rob Christensen. Two reasons were early voting and same-day registration, he said.

Republicans have not shown any evidence of voter fraud. Nor have they explained how cutting early voting and registration fights fraud.

## Young, Poor, African-American Or Old

Gov. Pat McCrory is a Republican who signed the voter ID bill into law on Aug. 12. He said it requires the same number of early voting hours as in 2012. They are just squeezed into a shorter period.

McCrory said people do not know that voter fraud is not a problem in the state. This is because the state has never required a picture ID before, he said.

More than 600,000 registered voters do not have a state driver's license or state-issued ID, according to a state survey. Many are young, poor, African-American or old.

Rosanell Eaton, 92, an African-American, has voted in every election for 70 years. She rode a mule-drawn wagon to register to vote in 1939. White election workers in North Carolina made her say the preamble to the U.S. Constitution. Eaton said it perfectly. She was the top student in her high school. The workers had to let her register. They were not happy.

"It's the same old thing," she said of the ID law. "They know if they make it hard enough for African-American folks to vote, we won't have enough people voting."
