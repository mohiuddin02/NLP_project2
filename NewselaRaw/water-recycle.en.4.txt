PLEASANTON, Calif. â€” Leon Jung's grass was brown and dying. California has not had enough rain for four years.

Jung knew he had to do something quickly to save his lawn. He grabbed some buckets and got in his pickup truck. Then he drove to a water treatment plant. He loaded his truck with recycled waste water. The water originally came from toilets and sewers.

He did not care.

"This water is making a huge difference," Jung said. He lives in Dublin, California. "I worry (my lawn) would die if I didn't give it this extra help."

## A Fun Water Invention

Earlier in April, California Governor Jerry Brown said people must use less fresh water. The water recycling center helps fight the California drought. The center is the first to offer free recycled water to people.

People just have to be willing to bring it home themselves. They use tanks, drums, barrels or jugs.

Jung said he enjoyed making his own watering system. He strapped empty barrels to the back of his truck. A pipe sucks up the water. An electric motor shoots the water through a garden hose.

Jung shot a stream of recycled water on his lawn. "I had fun coming up with this," Jung said.

## Yuck! OK, It's Not So Bad

The recycled water station opened in July. It had three water faucets. Workers had no idea if people would want to use the water. Now the station has eight water faucets. More than 610 people have signed up for it. Anyone can take the water. Some people drive in from 30 miles away.

Water officials know that recycled toilet water sounds kind of yucky. Many people really need water to keep their grass alive. So they just ignore where it comes from.

Sue Stephenson works for the water treatment center. She said the water is safe to use. But people must not drink it. They also cannot put it in their swimming pools or water pipes.

If the drought ends, most people will stop using the recycled water, said Dan Gallagher. He is in charge of the Dublin San Ramon Services District. It runs the water station. The center will probably not close. Some people will still want to use its water.
