SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, Calif. â€” Thousands of years ago, people lived on an island off the coast of California. The area is one of the first places that people settled in North America. There you can find cutting tools, beads, kitchen items and other evidence of the past.

The evidence is important to people like Torben Rick. He works for a musuem. He studies ancient people and how they lived.

On the island, Rick watched with frustration. The angry surf and storms are tearing away at the area.

The Native American people who lived here centuries ago fished. They threw nets from canoes made of wood from redwood trees. They prepared dinners on stone grills and carefully chipped out tiny shell beads. The beads were used as money.

Now, this area will almost certainly be lost unless something is done.

## A Tiny Pink Bead From Long Ago

Rick works at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The Smithsonian is a group of museums in Washington, D.C. Rick runs the collection of items from ancient people like the ones who once lived on the island.

He picked up a tiny pink bead. The bead and things like it "can help us better understand the people who lived here" and how they dealt with things we face today, he said. "The trouble is, a few more storms and all this valuable history will be washed out to sea."

Conservationists, who try to protect nature, and archaeologists are fighting back. Half a dozen scientists fanned out across the island earlier this month. They took down the first full list of archaeological sites that were in danger on the island.

The list will help guide conservation decisions at sites that are in danger. It will also enable scientists to monitor erosion, which is predicted to get worse. Erosion occurs when wind and waves wear away at beaches, causing them to disappear.

Four groups have joined in the work. Two are the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Oregon. A third group is made up of leaders from the Chumash tribe. The Chumash are Native Americans whose ancestors lived in the area.

## "Code Red" For Eight Of The Sites

The fourth group is the Nature Conservancy, which manages three-quarters of the island. Santa Cruz is the largest of eight Channel Islands. The islands lie 36 miles off Ventura, California.

The rising sea level is destroying the chance to learn about our past, said Scott Morrison. He is the Conservancy's director of conservation science. "We're trying to do something about that."

Dozens of sites were assigned one of five risk levels. Things like how high sites were from sea level and their distance to the nearest shoreline were considered. Other factors included the angle of the coast, how much soil was being eaten way and how much rain the area faced.

Eight sites were designated "code red." Those sites contain important archaeological items. They also are in immediate danger of being destroyed by rising seas.

## "Emergency Archaeological Rescue"

One of the sites is a cave that is hard to reach. The team conducted an "emergency archaeological rescue" there. They saved items buried beneath thick layers of sand and driftwood: arrowheads, simple stone tools, rope and fabric woven out of sea grass.

Also recovered in the cave was a square piece of redwood. It was smeared with brown tar. The piece was used to repair a hole in a canoe.

"The last time one of these planks was found was in the 1960s," said Jon M. Erlandson. He is an archaeologist at the University of Oregon. Erlandson is an expert on Santa Cruz Island's cultural items.

The plank is a reminder of a time when the coast was loaded with fish, waterfowl and shellfish. "The shoreline was a lot further away than it is now," Erlandson said.

"There's not enough time to save everything," he said. "We're trying to record and salvage all we can before it's too late."

## Like Losing Pages Of A History Book

Rising sea levels between 7,000 and 15,000 years ago put much of the evidence of the island's earliest residents under water. Those people traveled the water. They arrived at the end of the last ice age, when mammoths walked through inland forests.

Their people lived well in the rich marine area. In 1542, explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo counted several densely populated villages as he sailed past, and there were many more he didn't see.

The island is relatively large. There are plunging valleys, forests, steep mountains and windswept beaches.

Rick brought a four-wheel drive truck to an abrupt stop and said, "Let's go for a walk."

He was joined by Gil Unzueta, a Chumash Indian monitoring the survey effort.

"We're standing on a living history book," Unzueta said. "And we're losing pages from it every day."
