Have you ever helped your mom or dad use an iPhone? You might even be better at it. Here is why.

Doctors asked parents some questions. They asked if their kids played with iPhones and iPads. The parents said yes. Most said they let their kids use them when they were very young.

Some children learned how to use a screen when they were 1 year old. Other kids learned before that.

Only a few children waited until they were 4 years old.

## Making A Call

The babies may have just been touching the screens. But parents said some knew what they were doing.

Some children used an app before they turned 1. Others had called someone. Most started using apps at age 2. Some started playing video games at age 2.

The children liked playing with iPhones. They also liked playing with iPads.

Their parents liked it too. They said it made their children rest. Sometimes it made them fall asleep.

## Doctors Were Surprised

Children played with iPhones when their parents were busy. Parents could do work then.

Doctors say children should not use screens until they are 2 years old.

Most parents do not talk about this with doctors.
