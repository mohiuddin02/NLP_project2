QUITO, Ecuador — Freddy Ehlers has been at the center of things in this small Andean nation for decades. He has been a television star for more than 30 years, the minister of tourism, the secretary general of the Andean Community and a two-time presidential candidate. Now, at 69, Ehlers is taking on what might be his most ambitious job yet: making the country happier. ![](https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Freddy_Ehlers_26_November_2012.png)

Since 2013, Ehlers has been the State Secretary of Buen Vivir. The Spanish term roughly translates to "good living" or, as he prefers, "well-being."

## "A Matter Of Life Or Death"

Ehlers has the task of trying to increase the nation's sense of contentment. He has a staff of 30, a $2 million annual budget and a direct line to President Rafael Correa.

If the job description sometimes elicits chuckles, Ehlers is dead serious about his work.

"The difference between living better and well-being is a matter of life or death," he said. "Because if you use the word 'better' it means you're never satisfied with what you have — it's unlimited growth."

The country's emerging middle class has been focused on finding happiness through buying expensive goods, he said. Such consumerism threatens to ruin mental health, he insists. At the same time, a reckless overuse of natural resources for profit and to raise national living standards threatens to destroy the planet.

## Redefining Progress

"We have to redefine what progress means, redefine development and redefine well-being," he said. "What we're proposing is changing civilization because the one we have is going to lead us to 'eco-cide'" — short for environmental suicide.

Once relegated to bumper-stickers, songs and a line in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, happiness has become a serious subject. Most of the world's top universities, the United Nations and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are researching it.

Ecuador added the traditional Native American idea of Sumak Kawsay, or Good Life, to its 2008 constitution. When it created the secretariat five years later it became one of just a few nations — including Venezuela and Bhutan — that have made happiness-seeking an official, high-level governmental goal.

## Is A Ministry Necessary?

Scientists at Columbia University's Earth Institute, which produces the annual World Happiness Report, use six factors to measure well-being: per capita income, healthy life expectancy, generosity, a society's degree of corruption, the freedom to make key life decisions and social support. The last factor is determined by the number of friends an individual can count on in times of trouble.

Many of the factors that make a society happy are simply part of good governance, however, and cannot be decreed, said John Helliwell, co-editor of the report.

In that sense, setting up a ministry is "neither necessary nor sufficient to (create) happier lives," he said. The benefit, if any, comes from focusing attention on the issues.

## Good Lives, Healthy Environment

It is important "to set alternative goals for individual communities and nations that look beyond just income per capita," Helliwell said. "There are many other aspects of life that are more important, and there is the issue of environmental sustainability … How do you allow good lives to be led without the same environmental drain?"

Critics often picture Ehlers and his staff doing yoga in incense-filled rooms, and indeed his office does fit that image: There is a crystal sitting at the feet of the statuette of Latin American Liberator Simon Bolivar and a flickering candle beside a bust of Buddha.

However, Ehlers insists he is out to get real-world results. Earlier this year, his office began working with Ecuador's National Statistic Institute to figure out how to define, track and measure happiness.

## Green Light For Healthy Food

One of his first projects was working with health officials to create a stop-light system on all packaged food. Now, consumers can quickly see if the sugar, salt and fat content in their snacks have green, yellow or red lights.

Making it easier to eat healthy promotes general well-being, the theory goes. Even so, the system faced backlash from food companies, Ehlers said.

Some companies "have been seriously affected by this, but now they're trying to come out with products that are all green lights," he said. "It's a small example of what we're trying to do."

The backbone of the ministry's work, however, is a set of half-hour television programs that promote the happy lifestyle.

## Protesters Want To Shut It Down

One might think that happiness is something everyone could get behind. In fact, the Secretariat of Buen Vivir has come under attack.

Last week, anti-government protesters demanded the office be closed.

The government of President Correa has grown too large and wasteful, opposition Deputy Andras Paez said. He called Ehlers' department "an insult to the intelligence of Ecuadoreans."

Much of Ecuador's governmental funding comes from the sale of oil. Now that oil prices are falling, the government has been cutting costs and seeking funds. As a result, the happiness program has come under scrutiny.

## "Tragedy Of The Modern World"

"There are a lot of people who question the very existence of the ministry," political analyst Oswaldo Moreno said. "All this talk of well-being is a joke to some people but for others it's very serious."

Ehlers argues that his department is one of the smallest in the administration, despite the immense challenges of making the country a better place during difficult times.

"We have thousands of friends on Facebook and Twitter but we don't have anyone to hug; we don't have anyone to touch," he said. "That's the tragedy of the modern world. We have to make time to hug people."
