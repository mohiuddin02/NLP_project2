WASHINGTON — The new Congress has more women, African-American and Hispanic lawmakers than ever before.

Nearly all the lawmakers are white. However, both houses of Congress — the Senate and the House of Representatives — now have more lawmakers from other backgrounds. The new Congress builds on a gains achieved by the last Congress.

The Senate and the House both make up Congress, which makes the country's laws. A new Congress begins every two years. Some of the lawmakers stay the same and others get voted into or out of Congress.

## Women, And African-Americans

On Tuesday, the 114th Congress began. A total of 107 women lawmakers were sworn in. There are 79 Democrats and 28 Republicans. A total of 87 women are members of the House. There were 83 members of the House in the 113th Congress.

The number of women in the Senate is the same as last year — 20. There are two new Republicans, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia. They balance out two female Democrats who lost their Senate seats in the elections in November. They were Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.

Democrats and Republicans both belong to political parties. Members of each party share the same ideas about running the government and tend to vote in the same way.

African-Americans also made large, and historic, gains. The new Congress has 48 lawmakers who are African-American. There are 46 in the House and two in the Senate. There were 43 African-American lawmakers in the 113th Congress.

Representative Mia Love of Utah became Congress' first female African-American Republican lawmaker. Her arrival marks the first time that Congress has male and female African-Americans from both parties.

Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina made history last November. He became the first African-American senator elected in the South in more than 100 years.

## Hispanics, And Asian-Americans

The number of Hispanic lawmakers increased by one to a total of 39. There are now 27 Democratic and 12 Republican Hispanic lawmakers. Thirty-six Hispanic lawmakers vote in the House, while three serve in the Senate.

The number of Asian-Americans and people whose families came from Pacific islands also increased by one. There are now 13 Democrats and one Republican from that group in the new Congress.

Religion is an area where the new Congress remains mostly the same. About 9 out of 10 lawmakers are Christian, about the same as in the last Congress. Nearly 6 out of 10 lawmakers are Protestant, and 3 out of 10 are Catholic, according to a new study.

There is a bigger proportion of Protestants and Catholics in Congress than in the United States. About half of American adults are Protestant, and 1 out of 5 is Catholic.

The new Congress is also out of step with the public in another way. One-fifth of Americans say they do not belong to a religion. Only one member of the 114th Congress is not part of a religion. She is Representative Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona.
