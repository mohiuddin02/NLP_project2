LOS ANGELES, Calif. — In one photo, a tourist in a baseball cap stands heroically, raising a 340-ton boulder above his head. In another, a thin woman, flat on her back and legs in the air, balances the rock on her feet.

"The Boulder Holder" pose is a selfie that museum-goers take with artist Michael Heizer's "Levitated Mass" sculpture at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It is so popular that one count of pictures of the artwork on Instagram reached 175,000 people in a week.

The museum selfie is having a moment. Institutions around the globe are creating even more selfie opportunities as a way to attract visitors, especially young people.

Some museums are even designing architecture that encourages the phenomenon.

## Lining Up The Selfie Spots

The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is adding terraces with views that are partly designed to encourage selfies. The museum's curators are also discussing ways to include selfie-friendly moments in exhibitions.

"It'd be foolish for museums not to actively consider this. It plays such an essential role in terms of word of mouth," museum official Chad Coerver said. "We are definitely looking at what those iconic selfie moments are going to be."

The Centre Pompidou museum in Paris guides visitors to the best selfie spots at a new exhibit.

The Broad museum, which will open in downtown Los Angeles in September, did not consider selfies when configuring its architecture, Joanne Heyler, the museum's founding director, said. Nonetheless, selfies at distinctive spots in the building's architecture are already emerging.

"The best selfie spots seem to come about organically," Heyler said.

## What About The Actual Art?

With their visual focus, art museums are natural places for the trend to flourish. Just ask Beyonce and Jay Z, who in October famously posted selfies with "The Mona Lisa" at the Louvre in Paris.

The Philadelphia Museum of Art's selfie spots are its "Rocky" statue and the inspiring run up its stone steps, fists raised overhead. The National Gallery in Oslo has Edvard Munch's "The Scream," glutting the Internet with agonized selfies.

There is even an interactive art museum in the Philippines called Art in Island, which opened in December and is dedicated to taking selfies with artworks.

"The upside is that people share their experiences, word spreads, more people come, young people can relate," said Ann Philbin, director of the Hammer Museum in West Los Angeles. The downside: They don't often have intimate or thoughtful experiences with the art, she said. "That's what we're giving up."

## "I Was Actually Here!"

Though the selfie speaks to a culture that thrives on uniqueness and self-expression, it could also be a reaction to the digital world, where experiences are virtual rather than physical. The selfie screams: "I was actually here!"

"Social media put a huge premium on the instant sharing of experience," said Kate Flint, a University of Southern California art history professor. "And not just with immediate family and friends, but with a whole network of people who will be somewhere between envious and admiring."

Among major museums, LACMA was among the first to embrace the selfie trend. Its "Urban Light" installation by Chris Burden went up in the pre-Instagram year of 2008 and almost immediately attracted cellphone-wielded self portraits.

The sculpture is now the museum's crowd favorite for selfies, spawning nearly 10 times the photos on Instagram compared with Heizer's rock star.

LACMA has launched an interactive social media campaign. "Faces of America" is a portrait exhibition that asks visitors to take selfies with artworks, then projects selected images back to visitors on monitors.

Everyday LACMA looks for selfies to re-post, said Scott Tennent who oversees the museum's social media. "It helps lower the intimidation factor that so many museums have to wrestle with, and it inspires creativity."

## Camera Policies Are Adapting

Like many museums, the Hammer museum in Los Angeles once barred picture-taking inside its galleries. Then in February last year it reversed the policy to allow flash-free photography.

"We saw it as a necessity and as an opportunity," Philbin said. "In the last five years, museums have loosened up around this issue. People want to photograph things to remember them. Cameras are an extension of our bodies at this point."

The Hammer's spinning chairs in its main courtyard have become the unexpected selfie standout. Since they were installed in February, hundreds of visitors a week have unleashed their inner child, twirling on the chairs and documenting it in pictures.

"Once we noticed it, we created a hashtag, spunday," Philbin said. "Now every Sunday we post our favorite pictures in one of the Spun chairs."

## Can You See Me Now?

At the Getty Museum in Brentwood, California, curators last month rearranged the ornamental mirrors in the South Pavilion decorative arts galleries to make mirror selfies easier to achieve. In January, the Getty launched MusePose, asking visitors to imitate specific artworks each month and share their selfies on Instagram. Last week alone, MusePose appeared 618,000 times in users' Instagram streams.

"It's about observing what visitors are already enjoying, noticing what they're noticing, and facilitating that — showing them it's not this stuffy quiet place you can't have fun in," digital engagement manager Annelisa Stephan said.

Not everyone agrees, however.

"Museums don't need to be Disneyland," Michael Duncan, corresponding editor of Art In America, said. "They need to be places where you experience art, and selfies get in the way."
