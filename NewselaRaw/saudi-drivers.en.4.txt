RIYADH - Saudi Arabia is the one country in the world where women are not allowed to drive. On Thursday a group of Saudi women went driving anyway. They did this as a protest.

Then, they posted pictures and video clips on the internet showing them driving. The women could have been arrested for their actions.

Things are slowly getting better for Saudi women who want to drive. More people support the idea. Supporters are talking more publicly, too. On Tuesday, a female member of the important Shoura Council suggested women should be allowed to drive. The Council was appointed by Saudi Arabia's leader, King Abdullah. It advises the government.

But right now Saudi women cannot get a driver's license. Women who do drive have been arrested.

## Women Drivers Accelerating Change

The photos and videos posted Thursday showed women driving on busy streets. One clip showed a woman driving in the traditional veil, with only her eyes showing. This suggested that even old-fashioned women want to drive. Passing motorists slowed and gave her a thumbs-up sign.

One of the women was stopped by police. She was taken to a police station. It's not clear if she will be charged with a crime.

Another of the women said their goal is to change people's ideas. Posting the videos and pictures is only the first part of their protest.

For the second part, women with foreign driver's licenses will go driving. They will do this on Oct. 26.

"To drive with a license should not be against the law," the woman said. Many Saudis have become more open to the idea of women driving, she added.

"The authorities, the country, how people think has changed," she said.

## There Are Some Speed Bumps Though

But a number of powerful religious figures are still against the idea of women driving. They argue that women drivers would be around men too much. Many people in Saudi Arabia believe women shouldn't talk to men they don't know.

Others argue that it is very inconvenient that women can't drive. It makes it very hard for women to work. It is also difficult for them to pick up their children or go shopping. Many families are forced to hire expensive private drivers.

They also point out that Saudi women living outside of cities frequently drive. They usually aren't stopped by police.

The Shoura Council must now decide if it agrees with the idea that women should be allowed to drive. If it decides it does, it will pass the suggestion on to the government.

Many Saudi newspapers reported on the councilwoman's suggestion. Some even declared that women should be allowed to drive.
