WASHINGTON â€” Environmentalists are worried about the monarch butterfly. The colorful, graceful insect is disappearing fast.

The number of monarch butterflies in the United States has fallen drastically. In 2013, groups say the number of butterflies was down to almost one-tenth of its usual average.

In other words, if over the last 20 years the monarch population was around 100 butterflies, last year there were 10.

A group of people want to stop this rapid decline. They asked the government to call the monarch butterfly an endangered species. They would be protected by the Fish and Wildlife Service if they were called endangered. There are laws put in place to protect them.

## Helping Crops Is Hurting Monarchs

These environmentalists wrote a report, called a petition. They asked Fish and Wildlife to protect the disappearing insect.

They believe that a company named Monsanto is to blame for the rapid loss of monarchs. Monsanto produces chemicals that help certain plants grow stronger and faster. One of their products is called Roundup. It is a spray that farmers use on crops. Roundup helps kill weeds.

But Roundup also kills milkweed. Milkweed is the monarch caterpillar's only source of food. Farmers are destroying the monarch's food source by using Roundup. When a caterpillar starves, it cannot turn into a butterfly.

The environmentalists said that the use of Roundup and other crops has "wiped out milkweed plants."

## Monarchs Are Sensitive

However, Monsanto Company disagrees.

Charla Lord is a spokeswoman for Monsanto. She said there are many reasons the monarchs might be dying. She believes that "weather events" and "logging in Mexico" kill milkweed. She said that Monsanto would help restore the habitats.

In addition to chemicals like Roundup, other factors indeed threaten butterflies. The climate can affect butterflies. When there is a heat wave or a drought, butterflies may die because they cannot find water. Also, humans can damage butterfly habitats by building homes and cutting down trees and plants.

Scientists know that there is not much time. In the mid-1990s, there were about 1 billion butterflies in North America. In 2013, there were only 35 million.

## Butterflies Need Attention, Too

Tierra Curry, who works at the Center for Biological Diversity, hopes that good weather this year will help increase the population.

"We're at risk of losing a symbolic backyard beauty that has been part of the childhood of every generation," she said.

The environmentalists think the endangered species label will help draw attention to the butterflies and help protection them.

The Fish and Wildlife Service is required to respond to the petition within 90 days, although they may not issue a decision for up to nine months. The monarch butterfly is not yet specially protected.
