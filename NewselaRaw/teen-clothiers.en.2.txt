U.S. teen clothing retailers are closing stores by the dozens.

The spaces for years have been clubs for teens looking for preppy clothes, maybe with a flashy logo. Now, retailers such as American Eagle Outfitters, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Aeropostale are reconsidering how much space they need.

The mall-based chains for years ruled the nation's high school wardrobes. Now they are trying to make over how and where they sell clothes. They want to serve a generation with smartphones that wanders easily between digital and mall shopping. That means not just helping them shop by phone, but also selling new styles faster and at prices teens are willing to pay.

"We continue to research this customer," said Abercrombie CEO Michael S. Jeffries. "I continue to believe we are taking the brands to a place that is more relevant."

The chains may have been slow to act. But they are taking the problem seriously.

## More Stores Does Not Mean More Profits

JPMorgan analyst Brian Tunick said lower-priced chains made significant gains from 2007 to 2013. So did "fast-fashion" retailers like Forever 21, H&amp;M, Uniqlo and Zara. They've been successful by selling inexpensive fashions. They also change clothes frequently.

Most of the "fast-fashion" retailers are international companies. However, they've opened many stores in the United States.

Meanwhile, the American teen clothing chains were following the example of some of those international players. They opened a lot of stores around the world. They've done well enough that most plan to continue to add stores overseas.

Yet the problem is how to manage the huge chains that they had built across North America. Teen spending slowed during 2007 to 2009, a period known as the Great Recession. Many people lost jobs and had less money. There also haven't been any major fashion trends lately to drive sales.

Now their answer to the real estate question seems clear: More stores aren't always the way to add sales.

In mid-May, American Eagle said it will close 150 stores in North America in the next three years. It is closely watching 300 more that have leases ending. The leases are contracts to rent the spaces. After they end, the company can decide if it wants to renew the leases. Company executive Roger S. Markfield said fewer people are going to all retailers in the malls.

Tunick noted that Abercrombie had closed 260 locations since 2011. Pacific Sun closed 230 stores in that period. Aeropostale is expected to close up to 300 locations in the next few years, he said.

The cuts aren't done. Abercrombie recently said it is on track to close 60 to 70 stores this year as leases end. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Thomas A. Filandro pointed out that more than 500 of Abercrombie's store leases are up for renewal through 2016.

Randal J. Konik is an analyst for financial firm Jefferies. He said 30 percent of teen market store space could be closed over the next three years.

## Most Sales Are Still Made In Stores

Still, the timing might not be bad for the shopping center industry. Things hit a low point in 2010 and 2011 as the recession played out. Now regional malls have an average of 93 percent of their space filled. Shopping centers overall are at 92 percent, said Jesse Tron, a spokesman for New York trade group International Council of Shopping Centers.

That's back to where levels were before the Great Recession, he said.

At the group's annual trade show last month in Las Vegas, Tron said activity had picked up since the recession. He noted 94 percent of sales in the United States are still made through physical stores. The remaining 6 percent are made online or through smartphones or tablets.

The industry's new focus is on "omni-channel" retailing. The term that refers to seamlessly combining online and offline stores. That could bring store closures, but Tron noted there are other retailers, like Uniqlo and H&amp;M, adding locations. Also, some online-only merchants are finding they want physical spaces to bring attention to their brands and give customers a different shopping experience.

## Shoppers Need To See What's Inside

"Experience" is likely to be a popular word going forward. Retailers hope to keep physical stores contributing to sales results by making them welcoming and the visits worth the effort.

In the past, Abercrombie's stores had windows covered by blinds. Meanwhile, the company's Hollister chain stores were distinctive for their beach shack entrances that made it hard to see inside.

Now the company is testing a remodeled version of the Hollister stores. About 75 to 100 are expected to be done by year's end. Jonathan E. Ramsden, a top executive at Abercrombie, said that it's evident why the new storefronts are effective.

"I mean it's very fresh and new," he said. "You can see into the store. You can see the merchandise â€¦ We're certainly pulling more customers into the store, which is clearly one of our core objectives over the next few years."
