DETROIT â€” Tracy Peasant began crying in court Monday because her water service had been shut off by the city. She had to buy bottled water for herself, her four children and four grandchildren.

"It was hard," Peasant said, wiping her eyes.

Peasant was the first witness to talk in court to Judge Steven Rhodes. Rhodes is a bankruptcy judge. Several groups have asked him to stop Detroit from shutting off water for unpaid bills.

In 2013, Detroit declared bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is when a person, company or city doesn't have enough money to pay what it owes. Detroit owes more than $18 billion in unpaid bills. The bankruptcy will allow Detroit to sell off some of its property. Bankruptcy will also excuse the city from paying back all the money.

## Charged For A Water Leak?

The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) shut off Peasant's water in September 2013. She owed more than $8,500 to the department. Peasant told the judge the bill was so high because of a water leak. Peasant was turned down for a program that would help her pay her bill. She owed too much. Peasant said she makes $259 a month.

"No, I'm not looking for free water," Peasant said. "I'm just looking for affordability, to afford it."

The city has cut water service to 19,000 homes in Detroit recently.

Several groups asked the judge to halt the water shut-offs. They include the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization and the Peoples Water Board. They argue that the city shut off water unfairly. It did not give homeowners enough warning. The groups also said the city should give more help to poor people. They do not have enough money to pay their bills.

## Water Is Not Free

However, lawyers for the city said Detroit cannot provide free water.

Sonal Mithani is a lawyer for Detroit. She said that stopping the shut-offs would actually hurt customers who have not paid their water bills. Their bills would pile up.

"The city has a responsibility to all of its residents," Mithani said. She said it's also not fair to people who are paying their bills. They would have to pay more money to cover the unpaid bills of others.

Peasant said her water was turned back on in June. A woman, whom she thought was a DWSD worker, came to her neighborhood. The woman was there to make sure the water was still off. However, the worker had a change of heart when she got there.

"She said, 'I can't do this with these kids and stuff. This is wrong,'" Peasant said. "When she left, she said, 'You have some water now.'"

Sue McCormick is the head of the Water Department. She spoke in court about the shut-offs.

## Changing The Rules?

McCormick said the old rules for cutting off service are on the department's website. They were written in 2003. They say that a Water Department worker has to speak with a customer before shutting off the water. This year, though, the department hired an outside company to shut off the water. The outside workers often did not talk to customers before shutting off their water.

The judge paid attention to the difference between the rules and what actually happened. He asked McCormick if it is legal for a department to cut off water without following its rules.

He also asked if she thinks a department could "simply ignore" its own rules.

McCormick said the department stopped letting customers know in person about the shut-offs. However, she was not sure when that began.

McCormick said she believes it was legal for the department to change its rules.

She said the department shut off water to nearly 44,000 homes since 2013. She could not say how many homes had children. She didn't know how many homes had people with health problems.

McCormick told the judge she makes $190,000 a year. She makes about 63 times more per year than what Peasant makes.
