WASHINGTON  â€” The United States got ready for parts of the government to shut down on Tuesday. Each political party blames the other side for letting the budget fight get to this point.

The deadline for a deal to keep paying for the government is midnight Monday. Otherwise, a wide range of programs would be affected, from national parks to the Pentagon.

The Republicans run the House. It approved a new plan on Sunday. The plan would have delayed a key part of the new health care law by a year. It also would have gotten rid of a tax on medical devices. In return, a shutdown would have been avoided.

President Barack Obama and the leader of the Democratic-controlled Senate said the plan was no good. The White House said Republicans were "pushing the government toward shutdown."

## Same Old Arguments On Obamacare

Lawmakers from each side spoke on the Sunday talk shows. But they did not seem to be talking to each other. They repeated the same old arguments about the health care law. Still, the law has already been approved by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the nation edged toward the first government shutdown in 17 years.

"I agree we should have this debate, but we shouldn't connect it to a government shutdown," said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. That is the biggest disagreement between the two sides, he said.

The House's vote was 231-192. Almost everybody voted with their political party. Now the action moves to the Senate.

Congress needs to pass laws to pay for the government by midnight Monday. But even if it doesn't, some important services would keep operating. Among them are border patrols, meat inspection and air traffic control. Social Security benefits would be sent. Health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals.

The Senate was not scheduled to meet until midafternoon Monday. There will be just 10 hours before a shutdown would begin. Even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage as the deadline approached.

## Shutdown Or Lose The Budget Fight?

If so, the House Republican members would have a choice to make. Do they trigger a shutdown or come away empty-handed from their latest confrontation with Obama? Keep in mind that several Republican members are supported by the anti-government tea party.

"We will not shut the government down," said the No. 3 House Republican leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California. Republicans will bargain "a little longer" if they need to, he said, though he did not explain what he meant.

He suggested the House would "get back together in enough time" and send the Senate another possible law to pay for the government. The House bill would have different ideas for the Senate to look at, he said.

McCarthy said the House would not give up demands for basic changes to Obamacare that can protect the economy.

Republicans said the law was costing jobs and driving up costs.

"The American people overwhelmingly reject Obamacare," claimed Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. "They understand it's not working. The only people who aren't listening to the argument are the career politicians in Washington."

## Bill Would Delay Some Parts Of Obamacare

Obama has said he won't let the law be stripped. It is one his biggest achievements. Democrats say Republicans are obsessed with attacking the law, which is aimed at providing health coverage for millions of uninsured Americans.

Republicans have criticized rules imposed on insurers. But the House bill did contain new wins for Democrats.

Republicans said their measure would leave in place most parts of the law that have taken effect. Those include requiring insurance companies to let people with medical problems buy insurance. They would also have to let families' insurance plans cover children up to age 26.

But it would delay a rule that says people would have to pay a fine if they did not buy insurance. It would also delay the opening of marketplaces, which are supposed to start working this Tuesday. People could buy insurance from private companies in the marketplaces.

McCarthy and Kaine were on "Fox News Sunday," while Cruz appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press."
