They spotted a 25-foot-long young adult humpback. At first, nothing seemed wrong with it.

But unlike the other whales, this one stayed near the surface. Humpbacks come to the bay to feast on krill, a tiny crustacean. They dive down to feed on the krill. This one didn't.

"It wouldn't fluke up," said Nancy Black, an ocean scientist. She was on board the Point Sur ship that day. Black was speaking of the tail flip that humpbacks perform before diving to feed. Looking closer, she also noticed several buoys were trailing behind the whale.

Black called the U.S. Coast Guard and they discovered that the whale was caught in a crab pot line. That led to a weeks-long rescue effort involving the government, nature groups and several businesses. Dozens of volunteers battled rough seas from Monterey to Santa Barbara.

## Whales And Crabs Clash

Whales were hunted for hundreds of years. Their numbers dropped greatly. Now, the number of humpbacks and other whales is climbing again off the California coast. Whale rescues will likely become more common now.

The humpbacks swim north during the spring and summer to feed. Their migration clashes with the end of crab season.

Most of the largest crabs are taken by winter. By then, most crab pots are removed from the water, said Pete Kalvass. He's an ocean scientist who works for California's government.

In the past, he said, whales rarely tangled with crab fishing gear. But in recent weeks, four entangled whales were reported off the West Coast. Two were freed. Crews were unable to attach tags to two others. The tags would have let scientists track them by satellite. The two whales have not been spotted again.

## Calling All Teams Together

It wasn't easy to free the whale, the rescuers said. It was quite an adventure.

Black called the Coast Guard that Sunday. Afterward, the Guard activated the Whale Entanglement Team (WET), a trained volunteer squad.

The WET team clipped a satellite tag to the gear already wrapped around the whale. Now, wherever the humpback went, they could find it.

Early the next morning the team found the whale again. The seas were choppy in Monterey Bay. The whale was still struggling, breathing often at the surface and swimming slowly.

Armed with long poles and knives, the crew leaned over the rocking boats. They managed to remove the crab pot and 300 feet of line. But another 50 feet of line remained wrapped around the whale's tail. The animal dragged several buoys behind it.

The waves grew to 10 feet high. The boats were getting tossed up and down.

"I'm calling over, 'You've got to stop,'" said Peggy Stap, a WET member.

Fearing for their safety, the crew turned back.

## Tracking The Whale's Travels

Team members spent the next several evenings trying to find a way to free the whale.

Meanwhile, the whale swam south. The line that clenched its tail became a burden. As the winds continued to blow, the humpback zigged and zagged. On May 1, it strayed too far offshore to mount a rescue.

Seven days later, rescuers drove south to Point Arguello. The high seas prevented them from launching a rescue.

By now, the whale was shedding weight, said Pieter Folkens, the WET team leader.

As the days passed, the whale's chances of living dropped. The tissue in its tail had begun to die.

Finally, on the morning of May 14, about 20 rescuers gathered near Santa Barbara. They rode in four boats. The water was finally calm and the whale was close.

Using hooks and knives, the crews worked for more than an hour. Finally the last loop was removed.

It had been 17 days since the whale had first been spotted. After swimming some 700 miles snagged in rope, the whale was free.
