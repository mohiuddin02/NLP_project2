Tan Huiyan grew up in southern China in a town called Shaoshan. During the winter, it would get very cold inside her house.

When she would come home, she would have to change her clothes and dress warmer for being inside. She would take off her winter jacket and put on thick pajamas. Her sneakers were not warm enough to wear indoors. So she would put on boots with fur to wear when she was in the house.

The winters can be very cold in Shaoshan. In January, the temperatures drop to about 23 degrees. Not everyone in China has heaters in their homes. This makes the winters feel even colder for many families. About 60 years ago, the Chinese government split the country into two sections. They created a line that separates the two areas. It is called the Qin-Huai line. Homes on one side of the line have heat. Homes on the other side of the line do not. Tan's house was on the cold side of the line. They did not have heat inside their house.

## Flip The Heat Switch!

On Nov. 15 each year, the government turns the heat on for the cities north of the line. People who live there will celebrate as their houses and apartments warm up quickly. People who live south of the line will have a very cold season.

Around 1950, the Chinese government decided to build heating systems in peoples' homes and apartments. However, there was not enough heat for everyone. So the government decided that only some houses would receive heat and that others would not.

The Qin-Huai line divides two of China's largest cities, Shanghai and Beijing. Shanghai is located below the line. The homes there do not have central heat. Beijing is in the north. Residents who live there do get heat from the government. It is much colder in Beijing than in Shanghai during the winter.

## Everyone Should Have Equal Heat

Today, the line causes problems for people across the country. Sometimes, the electricity goes out during the winter in cities that do not get heat from the government. The people there have to use special tools called space heaters to stay warm. When there are too many space heaters plugged in at the same time, the electricity in the city may shut down. This is called a blackout.

A professor from Shanghai does not think the line is a good idea today. He said that people who live in cold areas should get heat. It should not matter if they live above or below the line.

Tan, who grew up in Shaoshan, did not have central heat when she was a child. She moved to Beijing in 2004. She does not go back to her hometown very often. It gets too cold inside her parents' house. She does not like the cold temperatures there during the winter.

Now, she only spends Chinese New Year with her parents once every two years. When she visits, she only stays with them for a few days each time. "It's really impossible for me to stand how cold it is indoors there," she said.
