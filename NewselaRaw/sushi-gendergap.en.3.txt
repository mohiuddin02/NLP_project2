TOKYO, Japan â€” In Japan, some jobs are only for men. Making sushi, a popular raw fish dish, is one of them. It has been that way for a long time.

Sushi is always served cold. Some people think women's bodies are too warm to make sushi. They say it might not taste as good.

Sushi chefs are also known for acting tough. They cut their hair short and use proud language.

Some women are trying to change things in Japan. They are learning the art of making sushi.

## "They Are Kind And Gentle"

Now is a good time for women to become sushi chefs. The number of people working in Japan is getting smaller. The Japanese government is worried. Japan is encouraging more women to start working at companies.

Yuki Chidui, 28, is a sushi chef. She runs the Nadeshico sushi restaurant in Tokyo. Chidui only hires women to work at Nadeshico. She says her restaurant is "fresh and kawaii," which means "cute."

Chidui does not look or act like most male sushi chefs. She speaks softly and wears a kimono with pink flowers on it. Ads for the restaurant show her as a "manga" character. The artist drew her with big, lovable eyes. Manga are comic books in Japan.

"I think women are better at communicating with customers," Chidui said. "They are kind and gentle," she added.

Chidui used to work at a department store. She felt stuck in a rut and did not like it. Then she took a chance and started her own business.

Chidui's restaurant has been open for five years. It has not been easy for her. She has had to put up with lots of questions and, sometimes, insults from customers. Some of the male customers are rude to her.

## Close-Minded And Old-Fashioned

Becoming a sushi chef is very difficult. It takes a long time to learn sushi-making skills. New chefs usually are not allowed to use knives in their first year. They spend most of their time washing dishes and making deliveries.

Masayuki Tsukada, 34, learned to make sushi when he was 18. He says Japanese people have been closed-minded about women making sushi.

Tsukada says that making good sushi takes experience. He says you have to be able to do several things at once. It can be confusing to talk and keep all of the orders straight at the same time. Making the sushi in front of the customer can also be challenging.

Tokyo Sushi Academy offers two-month crash courses in sushi-making. About one-fifth of the Japanese students are female. One-third of the students from other countries are women.

Sachiko Goto is the academy's principal. He says it is easier for women to find sushi-making jobs in casual restaurants or in other countries. Fancy Japanese restaurants are the most old-fashioned. Women are not always welcome as chefs there.

## "This Tastes So Good"

Tsukada's restaurant serves special fish that are hard to find. Meals there are very expensive. One dinner could cost $100 or more.

Meals at Nadeshico cost about three times less than that. Chidui's food is not as fancy, but her customers still like it.

"This tastes so good," said a customer visiting from out of town.

Chidui says making sushi seems simple, but it takes a lot of work. She chops things up ahead of time so she can put them together quickly. It can be tricky to get just the right taste.

Chidui says some Japanese people are forgetting about what makes sushi so special. She is disappointed to see people eating sushi that was made by machines. Some people even eat pizza or beef and rice instead of sushi.

Still, Chidui says she is having fun. She feels like she is finally getting good at making sushi and hopes more women will give it a try.
