STOCKHOLM — For the past four days, Sweden has been looking for a mystery vessel. The Swedish government claims a foreign submarine may have entered Swedish waters illegally. The search has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.

Sweden's search is bringing back memories of the Cold War.

Stretching from 1945 to 1991, the Cold War wasn't a standard war. Instead, it was more of a tense standoff. On one side were U.S.-led Western countries; on the other side were Eastern countries led by the former Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union, in turn, was dominated by Russia. When the Soviet Union broke up, Russia lost control of many of the former Soviet republics, such as Ukraine and the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

## Stirring Memories Of The Cold War

On several occasions during the Cold War, Soviet submarines entered Swedish waters. The most serious incident occurred in 1981, when a Soviet submarine became stranded off Sweden's southeastern coast. The sub was armed with nuclear weapons. The incident caused an 11-day standoff. Eventually, Swedish authorities allowed the submarine to return home.

Suddenly it's looking like the Cold War all over again. On Monday, Swedish naval ships, helicopters and ground troops continued to search for signs of a foreign submarine.

Sweden hasn't accused any country specifically — and Moscow denies involvement. Still, the incident sent a chill through the Baltic Sea region. For many, Russia is the natural suspect. In recent months, Russian forces have been accused of a series of border violations on land, sea and air.

Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday. On Sunday, they released a photograph taken at a distance of what they said could be the mystery vessel. The photo shows a dark speck surrounded by foaming water.

Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said more than 200 people were involved in the operation. However, he stressed that the search wasn't like Sweden's submarine hunts in the 1980s. Unlike back then, the military wasn't using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.

## Sub Search Spooks Baltic States

The search made headlines in countries across the Baltic region, including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. All three are former Soviet republics that have been spooked by Russia's actions in Ukraine. Earlier this year, Russia seized the Crimea region of Ukraine. Since then, it has continued to back pro-Russia rebels within the country.

Russia maintains its actions in Ukraine were necessary. It claims it had to act to protect Ukrainians with a Russian background, who it said were being discriminated against. Many feel that claim was just an excuse for a land grab.

Recently, a top Russian official made similar claims about the Baltic states. He charged that people of Russian background are being mistreated in those countries too. The Baltic states have been alarmed by such talk. In addition, Russia recently arrested an Estonian official, who it charged with spying. It also seized a Lithuanian fishing boat. Russia claims the boat illegally entered Russian waters.

There is now growing fear that Russia may make some move against Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania. For its part, Russia denies it has any such plans.

Estonia has stepped up its monitoring of its territorial waters. Its border guard is on the lookout for unusual activities, spokesman Priit Parkna said.

## Russia Says Swedes Have Found Nothing

Meanwhile, Russian media claimed the Swedes were overreacting. One newspaper even suggested that the submarine hunt could be a trick. The Swedish military, it said, could be faking the whole thing in order to get more money from the government. Sweden's military has undergone a series of cuts since the Cold War.

Russia's official government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta questioned whether there was any submarine at all. It noted the Swedes hadn't found anything.

The paper offered two possible explanations. Swedish tracking equipment could be working badly, it said, or perhaps nervousness was making people see threats that weren't really there. "As the old saying goes," the paper wrote, "the eyes of fear see danger everywhere."

A Russian official pointed fingers at a Dutch submarine. It had participated in an exercise with the Swedish navy last week. The official suggested Sweden ask the Netherlands for an explanation.

The Dutch navy denied having anything to do with the mystery vessel. Their submarine, they said, had left Sweden on Thursday. They said it had been in Estonia since early Friday.
