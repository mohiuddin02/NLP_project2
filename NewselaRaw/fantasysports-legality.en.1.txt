LAS VEGAS, Nev. — A former congressman says is it "sheer chutzpah" — or nerve — for online fantasy sports sites to pretend a law makes them legal.

Former Representative Jim Leach said lawmakers had no idea daily fantasy sports would "morph into today's cauldron of daily betting." In fantasy sports, people pay an entry fee to put together fantasy teams. They play against each other, and winnings are based on how well the real-life players do.

Daily fantasy sites have become very popular for betting because they often take place over a single day of competition. Traditional fantasy sports take place over a full sports season.

Leach wrote the 2006 legislation that two of the sites use to prove their legitimacy. He said his anti-gambling law was supposed to stop gambling on the Internet, not promote it.

Fantasy sports is the exception in Leach's Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). However, he said other federal and state laws that could prevent the fantasy sports sites from operating.

"The only unique legal basis provided fantasy sports by UIGEA is its exemption from one law enforcement mechanism," Leach said. "But it is sheer chutzpah for a fantasy sports company to cite the law as a legal basis for existing. Quite precisely, UIGEA does not exempt fantasy sports companies from any other obligation to any other law."

## Only Five State Ban Online Fantasy Sports

Daily fantasy sites have long claimed that the fantasy sports exemption in the anti-gambling law allows them to operate freely in the 45 states that don't specifically ban them. Sports betting and other types of gambling on the Internet are mostly illegal in the United States. However, horse racing was allowed in the 2006 law.

The two sites, FanDuel and DraftKings, both promote themselves as offering games of skill, avoiding the label of gambling.

"The legality of daily fantasy sports is the same as that of season-long fantasy sports," DraftKings says on its website.

Millions of dollars are bet daily in fantasy sports contests. Leach said the industry argument that the contests are a game of skill, not chance, is invalid.

"There is no credible way fantasy sports betting can be described as not gambling," said Leach, a Republican from Iowa.

## Fantasy Has Become Powerful In World Of Sports

A scandal that erupted last week over a $350,000 win by a DraftKings employee on FanDuel. People thought he might have had an unfair advantage or some inside knowledge. Also, the ever-present commercials promising to make millionaires out of casual fantasy players have put a spotlight on an industry that seemingly sprouted out of nowhere. Fantasy sports has become a powerhouse in the sports community. Major League Baseball owns a small part of DraftKings. NFL teams and other leagues all have relationships with DraftKings and FanDuel.

The 2006 law led to the eventual shut down of online poker and other gambling sites. Leach said he wrote the law to stop online betting, but it doesn't give a clear definition of Internet gambling and refers instead to federal and state laws with different interpretations.

The law has been used to stop online poker. It specifically prevents banks and other financial institutions from processing money, like credit card payments, related to illegal gambling.

## Fantasy Industry Not Exempt From The Law

Leach said there are still many laws and regulations that can be applied to the fantasy industry.

"All citizens can make their own judgment whether America is better off with or without a dominating gambling ethic," he said. In 2006, Leach lost his election bid after 15 terms in office and left Congress. He said it is obvious fantasy sports was exempted from UIGEA "but not from the broad sweep of law itself."

Fantasy sports companies still must follow state and federal laws on sports betting, among others, he said.

**UPDATE:** Nevada regulators ordered daily fantasy sports sites like DraftKings and FanDuel to shut down last Thursday. They say the sites cannot operate in the state without a gambling license.
