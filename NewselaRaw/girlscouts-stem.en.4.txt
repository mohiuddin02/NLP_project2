IRVINE, Calif. — "Hi, girls!" Janice Stanley says. 

Janice is a nurse. She cares for people in a hospital.

Today she is speaking to Girl Scouts. They are 11 to 14 years old. 

The girls hope to be awarded the new STEM badge for Girl Scouts. The badge proves their STEM skills. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math. 

Right now more boys are interested in STEM than girls. More men have STEM jobs than women. 

People want more women to get STEM jobs. They say girls need to learn about STEM when they are young. Also, girls need to be treated nicer in STEM classes.

## Learning STEM In Fun Ways

Janice talks to the girls. She tells them about what jobs are like. Janice says STEM jobs can make them more money. Then they could help their families. 

The Girl Scouts works with companies. They made a learning program. It teaches girls to use STEM in fun ways. They look inside computers.

The girls with Janice played with a "SimMan 3G" robot. They checked his heart. Then they made the robot say, "Go away."

The Girl Scouts take trips, too. One trip is to the beach. They get to study fish and plants up close.

## Changing Times

Nancy Nygren loves science. She is a leader for the Girl Scouts. 

Nancy's first job was with the space shuttle program. Her next job was making computer programs. At all her jobs, Nancy has been one of only a few girls.

Times may be changing.

Taylor Duzel is 12 years old. After her day with Janice, Taylor felt more sure about becoming a doctor. Taylor wants to get over one problem first. The sight of blood sometimes makes her feel sick. 

"But," Taylor says, "I think I can do it."
