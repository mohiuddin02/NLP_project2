WASHINGTON â€“ Americans are feeling really badly about how the country is doing. And they're fed up with leaders in Washington. So more people than ever before say they do not like the job President Barack Obama is doing.

People gave our leaders unusually low marks, says a new McClatchy-Marist study, which asks people how they feel about things. About one in three rated them "D." About another one in three gave them an "F."

Lee Miringoff says people don't believe their leaders can make things better. He is the head of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York.

More than half the people said they don't like the job Obama is doing. That is the most since he took office.

Some people are Democrats and other people are Republicans. President Obama is a Democrat. It's not surprising that three of every four other Democrats thought he's doing a good job. But nine of 10 Republicans did not like what he's doing as president.

## Americans Unhappy With Congress

The president works with other leaders in Congress. And even more people thought Congress is doing a bad job.

Three out of four voters said they don't like the job the Republicans are doing in Congress. That's the most since the question was first asked in April 2011. People aren't happy with Democrats in Congress either. About six out of 10 people did not like the job they are doing.

The main reason for the glum feelings is how people feel about getting jobs. They are also worried about being able to pay their bills.

## Difference Of Opinion

Democrats felt much better about how things are going. More than half thought the country was moving in the right direction. But nine out of 10 Republicans said the country is going the wrong way.

Obama got low marks for making sure that people have jobs and are able to pay for what they need. More than half did not like the job he's doing. Only four out of 10 did. But more people said Americans are having problems with money because of Republicans.

Obama suffered in two other areas where he had done well before. One is working with other countries and the other is if people like him as a person.
