The sound of a white police officer's gunshots in Ferguson, Missouri. A black 18-year-old named Michael Brown killed on a street near his home.

Angry black residents were tired of poverty, tired of getting pulled over, tired of being fined for seemingly senseless traffic stops. They finally hit their breaking point as Brown lay in a pool of his own blood.

On August, 9, 2014, Officer Darren Wilson shot Brown after a struggle in the street. It was only the first chapter of a story with no end in sight.

A year later, Brown's death and the protests that shook the St. Louis suburb have changed hundreds of lives. They also began a national debate on race and policing that continues today. Meanwhile, Ferguson quietly struggles forward.

## Residents Still Looking For Justice

"Things have changed, a lot," said David Whitt, who lives near where Brown was killed. But "the issue remains that somebody was killed by police, and people say, "We haven't got justice," he said.

The shooting enraged a group of young people across they country. They have helped turned the protest slogan "Black Lives Matter" into a national movement that has had an impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential race.

A U.S. Justice Department investigation found that Ferguson police stopped cars driven by black people because they were black. The police also raised money for the city by ticketing and jailing poor residents, which has led to reforms throughout Missouri and a deeper discussion of the issues.

"We are making progress," said Jerryl Christmas, a lawyer who represents several activists arrested during demonstrations in Ferguson. "A lot of issues have been raised and a lot of conversation is going on, but we still need more action."

## Other Cities Learn From Ferguson's Example

Investigations found that Wilson had done nothing criminal. But now police shootings around the country are being examined closely as public officials look at their policies and push for body cameras, which officers wear, in hopes of keeping their communities from becoming another Ferguson.

The nation saw what happened in Ferguson and attitudes changed. Surveys showed a sharp increase in the number of whites who now agree with what black Americans have long been saying: Race is still a problem in America.

In Ferguson, the city has tried to go back to normal, or toward something better than normal, but the results have been mixed.

"I think we're going to come out of this, and eventually we're going to come out of it even stronger, in my opinion," said Wesley Bell. He is one of two black members newly elected to the formerly white-dominated Ferguson City Council.

## A New Normal Returns To Site Of Protests

The businesses burned down during protests have been swept away. Some shops on West Florissant Avenue, once the site of nightly clashes between demonstrators and police, have welcomed returning customers.

"We're starting to get back into the swing of things, people starting to come slowly but surely," says Antonio Henley, a barber and the owner of Prime Time Barber Shop. "We were down 20, 40, 50 percent when it first happened. But we survived."

A memorial sign has replaced a pile of signs and stuffed animals that marked the spot where Brown died. But Whitt said there are some in Ferguson who would rather forget what happened last August.

"They're trying to erase this memory of this tragedy that happened right here in Canfield," Whitt said.

Although change has also come to the city government, some say it is not enough.

## Police Chief, City Manager Replaced But Mayor Remains

A Justice Department report revealed that city officials sent racist emails, and several resigned. Now Ferguson has a new police chief and city manager, but it still has the same mayor, who is white, and who does not want to resign.

The six-seat city council had only one black member before Brown's shooting, and now it has three.

City officials are talking with Department of Justice officials about reforming the city's police department.

Thomas Harvey is the executive director of ArchCity Defenders, a nonprofit group. He says that Ferguson's new municipal judge, Donald McCullin, is treating people with respect.

## Despite Changes, Old Problems Are Still There

Harvey added, "It doesn't change the fact the people are being pulled over and ticketed for essentially what amounts to being poor and black."

Ferguson is just one small town surrounded by other small towns. They all have their own police departments and their own municipal courts and have many of the same problems.

"If you ask a person who lives in St. Louis County what's different, they'll say nothing," Harvey said.

Brown's parents have filed a lawsuit in hopes of holding Wilson accountable for the death of their son. Although investigators doubted that Brown was killed after he surrendered, activists remain angry at Wilson.
