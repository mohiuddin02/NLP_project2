FERGUSON, Mo. â€” On Tuesday, voters brought big changes to the city of Ferguson. They elected two blacks to the City Council. The council helps run the city. It has six members. For the first time ever, it will have as many blacks as whites.

Dwayne James was the only black council member before. Now he will be joined by two other African-Americans: Wesley Bell and Ella Jones.

Many people in Ferguson are very angry at the police. Protests began last summer after a policeman killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Many here feel that the police and courts treat blacks very unfairly.

## 3 New Council Members

Ferguson is mostly black. However, before now there have been very few blacks in city government. Many people think that the police and courts will not change until more blacks are elected.

Tuesday's election is a step in that direction. However, it was only partly a victory for protesters, some said.

Voters chose three new council members. Only one was the person protesters hoped would win.

Bob Hudgins and Lee Smith were supported by many who are angry at Ferguson's police and courts. Still, both lost.

Hudgins lost to Brian Fletcher, who is white. Fletcher was once the mayor of Ferguson.

"I guess the signal was sent tonight that this old dog has a few tricks," Fletcher said. "Experience isn't a bad thing. It can be a good thing."

## The Protesters' Pick

Smith lost to Bell.

Bell is African-American. However, he is a judge. Many feel the courts are very unfair to blacks. For that reason, protesters did not support Bell. Still, Bell says he wants to change the way Ferguson's police officers behave.

Jones was the protesters' pick. She won almost half of the votes in her race.

Jones began to run for city council long before Michael Brown was killed. She decided to run after seeing how Ferguson police officers treat young black men.

Voter Sharon Bell-Price said this year's election was very important.

"I'm hopeful we'll get the change we're looking for," she added.

## "Knocking On Doors"

The fact that Bell is a judge did not seem to hurt him on Tuesday. He won even though many here are angry at the courts.

Dan Peterson ran Bell's campaign. Bell won because he and his team talked directly to voters, Peterson said.

"It was knocking on doors talking to people in person," Peterson said. "We talked about why Wesley was the best candidate."

Ferguson now needs to find a new chief of police. Its old police chief, Thomas Jackson, quit. He left office after the U.S. government put out a report on Ferguson police. The report gave said the police department had often treated black people badly.

Several different people will now try out for the police chief's job. Whoever wants it "better be doing his homework," Bell said.
