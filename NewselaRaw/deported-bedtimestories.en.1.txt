TIJUANA, Mexico — Bedtime has always been the same for Emma Sanchez Paulsen and her three sons: They pile onto her bed as she begins to weave a tale.

The bedtime stories in their home in Vista, California, used to be about her childhood in Mexico — running through green pastures or strolling through city plazas. Then, nine years ago, when Alex was 5, Ryan was 3 and Brannon was just 2 months old, she was forced to leave the United States. They stayed with their father, and the only time they could cuddle on her bed was when they visited her in Tijuana, just across the border in Mexico.

Instead of telling stories about Mexico, Sanchez Paulsen found herself fielding questions from three children who did not understand why a border stood between their parents.

And then the boys became the ones creating stories.

They devised a series of childish schemes to get their mother back to the United States. One of their ideas involved a trampoline to bounce over the border wall. Or maybe they could attach a bunch of balloons to her limbs. Or put her in a box.

One time, when Brannon was about 3, he asked if it would be OK to turn her into little pieces of paper.

"This way I can take you with me across the line," he said. "And then I can put you together with glue when we get back home."

## The Most Important Bedtime Story

On the many nights she spent alone, Sanchez Paulsen wrote what she describes as the most important bedtime story she will ever tell: a fantastical tale about a young elf who joins with his brothers to battle dragons as they visit their mother in the land of the fairies.

That narrative, "The Little Elf," is now part of a collection of bedtime stories written by mothers and fathers living in Tijuana who have been separated from their families. The book project is called "Cuentos Para Dormir," or "Bedtime Stories."

For nearly a year, educator and activist Sophia Sobko has crossed the border to Tijuana almost weekly. She helps the parents turn their stories into books that can be given to children and family members in the United States.

"I went to the library and could not find a single book explaining deportation to a child," she said. "This showed me that there is a need. So many kids are growing up so confused and so affected by this."

## Her Husband Is A U.S. Citizen

Sanchez Paulsen's story says: "But even though, for the little elf, his life seemed normal, he knew his family was not like others. His friends had a dad and a mom and he did not. His brothers tried to help him with his confusion. They said, 'We think it's normal, but we know it's not a normal life,' and they were right — it wasn't normal to grow up without a mother."

In 2006, Sanchez Paulsen was so certain she would get permission to come to the U.S. that she had already told the boys they would celebrate the next day at Disneyland.

Instead, immigration officials denied her re-entry and banned her from the United States for 10 years, the usual punishment for entering the country illegally.

It didn't matter that her husband, Michael Paulsen, was a U.S. citizen, or that she had lived in the country for more than five years, or that the couple had three children together.

## Her Boys Live In The U.S.

When Sanchez Paulsen was barred from returning to the United States, the plan was to have the boys stay with her in Mexico. But it proved too difficult to raise children in a country where she believed neither the schools nor the standard of living were as good as in the U.S., she said.

Now she spends most of her days taking care of her nephew, writing and knitting hats she can sell to neighbors. And she works on finishing "The Little Elf."

She said it gives her a chance to explain a situation she found hard to clarify for her children, using symbolism, metaphor and images.

## Staring Across The Border

Her story continues: "The city where mother firefly was locked into smelled of salt, loneliness and a lot of love from the parents separated from their children. The atmosphere was gloomy and sad, and even though she felt much anguish, she also had a lot of faith that one day they would be together again in the happiest city in the world where they were once very happy."

Sobko said the group has raised $2,000 through crowdsourcing, enough money to make books for 10 parents. She hopes to have some of the books placed in libraries throughout the country.

Sanchez Paulsen said she often thinks about the milestones she has missed in her boys' lives, like their first days of school, graduations, award presentations.

They visit her about twice a month in Tijuana, and they still pile onto her bed for a bedtime story when they spend the night.

On the nights she is alone without a bedtime story to tell, she stares out her bedroom window toward Otay Mountain, across the border in California. Lights perched atop the border fence break up the darkness. She knows her husband and boys are on the other side.
