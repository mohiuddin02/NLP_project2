BAND-E AMIR NATIONAL PARK, Afghanistan — People in Afghanistan have seen a lot of unusual, bad things because of a very long war. But one of the most unusual things is actually pretty fun — swan boats.

Nearly 40 of the boats cruised the blue waters of the main lake on a recent day. The boats, which are shaped like birds, were packed with families. They have foot pedals so people can make them move.

Women laughed loudly on several of the boats. That is a very rare sound in public in the country.

Afghans have long believed that the waters of the six lakes known as Band-e Amir can cure illness. Now the lakes help people relax. They can get away from the horrors of bombs, suicide attacks and corrupt police.
## Country's First National Park

The area is peaceful and beautiful. It sits high in central Afghanistan. Four years ago it became Afghanistan's first national park.

More and more Afghans have been coming here. They come even though many have to drive a day or more. And they have to travel through areas filled with rebels.

In 2008 about 200 visitors came each month during May to September, said David Bradfield. He works for the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. He's based at the park. The society helped develop a plan for the park with the U.S. government. This year, average attendance on Fridays, the Muslim holy day, is 4,000 to 5,000.

The park is very special for women and children. They have few places in the country to go outside and enjoy life.  Worries about bombs, gunfights or controlling males make being out in public difficult. About half the visitors are children and 35 percent are women, said Mirza Hussain, the chief ranger.

"This is my first time ever out of Kabul, and this place makes me feel really happy and calm," said Mustura Baqer. She drove several hours from the capital. Traveling with her were her husband, Mohammed, a construction manager, and their 9-month-old son.
## Powers Of The Waters

They were sitting with Mohammed's brother and sister-in-law, Tamana Noori, inside a tent. The tent blocked the chill from the high altitude. They were nibbling on salad, flatbread and chicken in a dark tomato sauce.

Noori said she, her husband and their three children had visited the park 11 times. They'd made three trips so far this year.

"It is a nice place for everybody, and the most beautiful place in the country," she said. "Kids can play around, and we feel safer here than any other place. People are afraid of attacks in Kabul and other places, but not here."

A visit to Band-e Amir often is mixed with religion. The same is true with a lot of things in Afghanistan. The Baqers' son has epilepsy. They hoped that the powers of the mineral waters would help.

People say that Ali, the cousin of the Prophet Muhammad, created the lakes. That is why people think the lakes have the power to heal. Muhammad is Islam's great prophet.

People say Ali created the lakes through amazing feats. He carved out the valley with his sword. Then he made dams out of cheese.
## Private Area For Women

The six lakes of the park are indeed blocked out with something filled with holes. It looks like cheese. But it is really rock. It is made from the minerals in the water.

The dams have small waterfalls spilling over them. They make the series of lakes seem like huge, watery steps that stretch for miles. Each one appears higher than the next.

Women must wear clothes when they plunge into the chilly lake water. And they must do so out of the sight of men. So, a walled area is being built so that women may take dips privately.

The Afghan government just approved the hiring of the park's first women rangers. This should help the women visitors a lot.
