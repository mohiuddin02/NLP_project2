KIEV, Ukraine â€” The 3-month-old uprising against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich flared to a deadly level Tuesday. First, anti-government protesters set fire to the ruling party's headquarters. Then, government security forces stormed the protesters' tent camp in what officials called "an anti-terror operation."

The government reported that at least nine people were killed: two police officers, an official of the ruling party, and six protesters. Opposition leader Oleksandra Kuzhel said the death toll had grown to 15 after security forces stormed the tent camp with stun grenades and water cannons. Other reports put the number as high as 19 dead.

Even the lower death toll would make it the worst one-day loss of life in the battle for the country's future. At issue is one basic question: Will Ukraine be a nation tied more closely to Russia or to Western Europe?

Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union, a union of republics controlled by Russia with Moscow as its capital. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine gained its independence. It has remained closely linked to Russia ever since.

In recent years, however, there have been increasing calls within Ukraine for a new direction: Some feel the country should shift itself toward Western Europe. Supporters of that approach claim closer ties to the West would bring more jobs and increased freedom and democracy.

## Police In Riot Gear Storm Maidan

On Tuesday, fiery explosions lit up the protesters' tent city in Kiev's Independence Square, also known as Maidan. The conflict began after protesters ignored a warning to clear out. Around 8 p.m., police in riot gear stormed the area. Officers set fire to tents and tossed tear-gas canisters into the crowds of protesters.

Clouds of smoke wafted over the chaotic scene, which was eerily lit by an orange glow. The light spread out from the blasts, and from burning sandbags and wreckage. Despite the choking fumes, thousands of people remained in the square.

Unrest also broke out elsewhere in western Ukraine. In a number of areas, protesters attacked local government offices.

Ukrainians in favor of closer ties with the West have been demanding Yanukovich's resignation. Their anger was ignited by his decision last November to scrap an agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, a group of 28 European countries that have agreements with each other and trade together. Yanukovich chose instead to maintain close ties with Russia.

Russia, meanwhile, has promised Ukraine $15 billion in aid. The opposition sees this as an attempt to buy Yanukovich's loyalty. They also see it as an effort to steer Ukraine into joining the proposed Eurasian Union. The Moscow-directed alliance of countries that would trade together has been touted by Russia as an alternative to the European Union.

## Protesters Remain Defiant

Opposition leaders told journalists in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, that they had requested negotiations with the government to defuse the growing violence. The nation's leadership, they said, had agreed to meet with them Wednesday. However, police continued to set fire to the tent camp well into the night.

Protest leaders remained defiant. Opposition leader Arseny Yatsenyuk appealed to Yanukovich to "spare Ukraine from becoming a country covered with blood." He called on the president to pull back security forces and stick to a cease-fire if he wanted dialogue with his opponents.

"This is an island of freedom and we will defend it," vowed Vitali Klitschko, another opposition leader and former world heavyweight boxing champion. He urged the protesters to hold their ground against police attacks.

The government also held its hard line against the unrest, which it blamed on protesters.

"Today we were able to see that only the government is interested in peaceful resolution of the situation," government official Viktor Pshonka said. "Opposition leaders should take the responsibility for everything happening in the street of Kiev today."

In Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney called on Yanukovich to restart negotiations with the protesters. Negotiations, he said, would serve "to immediately de-escalate the situation."

## A Short-Lived Truce

The surge in violence followed a short-lived agreement between protesters and the government. Authorities had released the last of 234 protesters it had detained and promised to drop criminal charges against them. In exchange, the opposition removed themselves from Kiev City Hall, which they had been occupying.

But protesters were intent on pressing their demands. They's still asking for Yanukovich's resignation. They also demanded that parliament act to curb his powers. On Tuesday afternoon, protesters marched toward the parliament building, calling for the 2004 constitution to be brought back. This had been amended in 2010, following Yanukovich's election. The changes reduced the authority of parliament and increased the powers of the president.

The demonstrators grew angry when the government postponed debate on the constitutional changes wanted by the opposition. Police then tried to block a procession of about 20,000 people who attempted to enter the parliament. Some of the protesters managed to penetrate the security barrier around the building. Others succeeded in breaking into the ruling party's headquarters, which was set on fire.

Marchers pulled cobblestones from the streets to hurl at police. Officers then tossed tear gas back at the protesters.

The short-lived truce over the weekend apparently collapsed because of worries on both sides. Protesters and the government seemingly agree on only one thing: The fight over the future of Ukraine isn't over.
