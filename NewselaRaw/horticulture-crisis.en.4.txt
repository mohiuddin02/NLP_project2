PHILADELPHIA â€” Six people who studied horticulture wrote a surprising letter in December. They claimed that their field, the study of plants, is in trouble.

The experts said something must be done soon to get more people into the field. Or else horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science.

They sent the letter to 800 schools and colleges. It also went to government agencies, and growers of everything from almonds to onions to zucchini.

The letter calls for:

Showing the numbers of people in the field to show the problem really exists;

Coming up with a plan to teach horticulture in schools and in college;

Making people understand why horticulture is important. Explaining what kind of jobs there are in horticulture.

## Explaining Horticulture

"We have to come up with a game plan. Period," said Paul Redman, who has been in horticulture for 30 years. He still has to explain to people what horticulture means.

This may be the first hurdle this effort faces. What is horticulture, anyway?

Horticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers and decorative plants.

Many people don't really understand. They think "it's a guy with a pickup truck and a lawn mower," said Mary H. Meyer. She says people think it's a low-paying job, and you do not have to go to college to do it. She's a horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota.

There are many kinds of jobs in horticulture, she said. She named a few, including plant breeding, producing plants in greenhouses and food. Others grow flowers, make nicely cut lawns and run nurseries. People can also care for public gardens, parks and sports fields.

And there are a number of things people can study if they are interested in plants. They can study plant insects and diseases, water quality, making fuel out of plants, and food safety. They can also study making medicines out of plants.

The problem is not only in the United States, as Meyer discovered while teaching in England over the summer. England, the world's horticultural powerhouse, faces the same problems.

Horticulturists in both countries say the problem has been building for years. Partly it's because people have moved from farms to the cities. Also, they do not feel as connected to the land.

## A Growing Interest

Matthew Bond, 21, who studies plant sciences at Cornell University, found his future the old-fashioned way. He grew up in farm country in Ogdensburg, New York. His father and grandmother were excited about gardening.

Bond has been a leader of a group called the National Junior Horticultural Association since 2009. The group's membership has plummeted from 1,000 in the '60s to half that number 15 years ago to 300 today. He suggests today's heavily scheduled kids have no time for hobbies like gardening. "They don't even go outside," he said.

But Bond said there are good signs. More young people are interested in finding ways to farm in cities and producing food naturally.

A challenge is getting people interested in horticulture early. There's nothing cool about plant science until you make it so for kids, said Jessica McAtamney. She teaches environmental science and gardening in cities at W.B. Saul High School in Philadelphia. "Once you do, they're hooked," she said.

Hydeia Brown, 17, from Philadelphia's Germantown, could be the poster child for an idealized horticultural future. There would not only be more people in horticulture, but more diversity, too. She is studying environmental science and wants to work with plants.

"I love science," she said on the phone. She was at the Morris Arboretum in Philadelphia. Her class was photographing and cataloging the Latin botanical names of pitch pine, American holly, and other trees.

Brown, whose family left their South Carolina farm to move north before she was born, wishes "other kids would come out and experience this. Not a lot of them know about the outdoors. They like electronics and stuff like that."

Douglas C. Needham, education department head at Longwood, said, "I'm passionate about this. I don't want to see the art, science, and craft of horticulture die out."
