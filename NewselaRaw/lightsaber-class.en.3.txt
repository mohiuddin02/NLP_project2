DORAL, Fla. — Many "Star Wars" fans have done it all. They have seen the movies, read the books and bought the toys. What is next? Some fans in Florida have decided it is time to learn to move like a Jedi. 

A group of "Star Wars" fans meets every other Saturday. They call themselves Magic City Jedi. They gather for a new yoga-meets-dance class that mixes "Star Wars" Jedi moves with martial arts. 

The classes are held at a yoga studio in Doral, Florida. Alfred Smith and Santiago Martinez teach the class.

Martinez works at a bank. "We knew there was going to be interest because there are 'Star Wars' fans everywhere," he said.

"What kid doesn't want to be Luke Skywalker or Han Solo? What kid doesn't want to swing a stick like a laser? This is something that allows me to forget what is going on in my life and go into the class and live out a fantasy."

## Make-Believe Muscle Building

Smith said he studied the moves that lightsaber groups in San Francisco, California, and New York City, New York, performed. Based on what he saw, he put together his own class with Santiago. They have been working on the class for a while. In December, the new "Star Wars" movie came out. Smith said it made them work even harder.

Smith is a yoga teacher in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. "I have been following this for some time, lightsaber combat in general," he said. "I'm a big 'Star Wars' fan."

On a recent Saturday, 17 men, women and children came to class. Some students brought their own fancy toy lightsabers that light up and make sounds. Others used the class sabers made of pipes wrapped in pool noodles.

"Star Wars"-themed shirts were everywhere. A teen girl wore one that read: "Physically, I'm here, mentally I'm in a galaxy far, far away."

## Before The Sweat, A Little Mental Prep

Before they could learn Yoda's moves, the students practiced meditation and yoga. Yoga poses helped them pay attention. They started balancing on one leg. They stood like a tree. Smith said that a Jedi knows what is going on around him or her. Jedis need good balance too.

Next, the teachers reviewed easy lightsaber moves. Students moved their sabers down to each side, and then up to the middle and then to the head.

Each lesson has a Jedi theme. Smith said that a Jedi knows what is going on around him or her. "Not just what they are focusing on but also their surroundings."

Although the teachers were serious, some of the wannabe Jedis in class giggled. One student wore a GoPro camera on his headband to capture every step.

## Finding Yoda After Yoga

The students learned several new moves. One was called a "flourish," when the person moves forward or back while twirling the lightsaber. They also learned how to "bash," which is a fast forward attack that ends by pulling back.

"If you think of a snake, it's a quick strike," said Santiago, as he taught the move. "Every 'Star Wars' movie starts with a bash. … It's a hit and pull back."

Class ended with a final meditation. The students sat quietly and focused on breathing. 

Everyone ended the class with a smile. Most agreed it made for a fun workout.

"You really feel like a Jedi," said Valerie Villar, age 26.
