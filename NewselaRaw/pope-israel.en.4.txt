JERUSALEM â€” The building has been holy to three religions.

According to tradition, Jesus ate a Passover meal there before he was killed. On the first floor is a Jewish shrine to King David of the Bible. The minaret of a former mosque rises from the top floor.

The ancient building also shows the trouble competing religions can cause.

On Monday, Pope Francis said Mass in the room of the Last Supper. The room is also called the Cenacle after the Latin word for dinner. The pope's visit followed weeks of protests by ultra-Orthodox Jews. Ultra-Orthodox Jews follow the strictest interpretation of Judaism.

The protests were sparked by discussions between Israel and the Catholic Church. The discussions involve allowing more frequent Catholic services in the Last Supper room. Christians can say private prayers in the Last Supper room any time they want. But organized services can be held there only twice a year.

## Fear Of Catholic Takeover

The ultra-Orthodox Jews fear the Roman Catholics want to take over the building. It is also holy to them.

Christian priests say there has been increasing anger against them.

"I've been spat at. I've been cursed in the street," said the Rev. David Neuhaus, a Catholic priest. "I think most Christians who walk around in traditional Christian garb have met with this kind of behavior."

Israeli officials say the rumors about the Last Supper room are untrue. Yigal Palmo is the Israeli Foreign Ministry. He said called it "crazy."

"We've been dealing with it for years and denying it time after time," Palmor said. "We've been negotiating church prayers. They want (more) organized religious (services). And it has nothing to do with property rights or ownership."

Alberto Joan Pari is a Franciscan monk. He would like Christians to be able to attend regular services where the Church began.  Jesus is believed to have said "This is my body" and "This is my blood" in the Cenacle. His words are used in the Consecration during Mass.

"It's exciting. It's very deep," Pari said of the room. "If you think that everything started from here. This is a place where you feel a lot of energy."

## An Ancient Site

Little remains of the original room. Pari said one wall contained several bricks from the first building. It dates back to the time of Jesus. The room smelled of wet paint from last-minute improvements before the pope's visit.

To enter, Pari rang a hidden doorbell. If the doorbell was out in the open, unfriendly neighbors would ring it day and night.

Jerusalem City Council member Arieh King sees things differently. King is the head of the United Jerusalem party. He arrived at David's Tomb on a motorcycle.

King said Judaism has a historic connection to the land.

King pointed to a smooth paved courtyard. Underneath, he said, were the tombs of David and other ancient Jewish kings. A doorway from the courtyard led to a small synagogue. There, men prayed in Hebrew.

He does not want to add more Christian services in the Last Supper room.

## "The Tomb Of David"

"Jews will not be able to pray here. And this is something no Jew can accept," he said.

Hana Bendcowsky is with the Jerusalem Center for Jewish-Christian Relations. She is worried about the atmosphere in the area.

Posters warned that the pope was coming "to pass the Tomb of David to the hands of the Christian Church." Recently, Jewish troublemakers wrote anti-Christian messages on a church. They also scrawled graffiti where the pope stayed.

Pari said he was a bit afraid of what will happen after the pope's visit.

If he was able to meet the pope, "I will ask him to please pray for us," Pari said. "Because when he leaves Israel the situation will change."
