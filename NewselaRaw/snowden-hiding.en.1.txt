MOSCOW, Russia — Somewhere in the thousands of towering apartment blocks that ring the Russian capital, whistleblower Edward Snowden remains in hiding. He is still there two years after outraging U.S. intelligence agencies by publicizing their snooping into the cellphone calls and Internet use of millions of ordinary citizens.

Snowden also released classified files he took from his National Security Agency contractor's job. The leaks triggered a global debate on government trampling of personal liberties and led to last month's congressional action to end the mass collection of telephone records. The decision was the first major restriction on spy agency powers in decades.

The journalists, to whom Snowden passed the information, have been awarded their profession's highest honors. Director Laura Poitras won an Academy Award for her documentary on Snowden, "CitizenFour."

But Snowden has gained little more from his disclosures beyond the sense of accomplishment he is said to feel, according to the few people in and outside Russia with whom he has occasional contact. In rare interviews, he has said he would like to return to America but not to prison.

## In A Survey, Majority Dislike Him

Snowden, 32, who has been charged with espionage, appears to believe he can set the terms for his return to the United States. He may be counting on a shift in public opinion that is not as likely as he thinks it is.

Although many younger Americans applaud what he did, the majority express dislike for him. In a U.S. News &amp; World Report poll in April, 64 percent of people familiar with Snowden said they held a negative view of him.

Even those helping him try to get home acknowledge that the prospects look grim.

"Edward loves America and he would definitely like to return home," said Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden's Moscow lawyer. "But it is our position, and a very simple one, that as long as his case is politicized and commented on as it is by politicians of all levels, that his return to his motherland is impossible."

Kucherena said Snowden won't negotiate with U.S. authorities as long as they refuse to provide "a guarantee that he will not go to jail for 100 years."

The Russian lawyer points out that what Snowden did could have been worse. He did not defect to Russia or give the classified material to Russian intelligence agents.

"It is 1,000 percent true that he did this as an act of conscience," Kucherena insisted, noting that Snowden has said he left all the documents with journalists in Hong Kong.

## "Under The Espionage Act"

Intelligence and security experts say Snowden committed treason by leaking classified information and finding refuge in Russia. They also say he deserves the felony espionage charges against him.

"Whether he intended to become a foreign agent, he has become one," said Kori Schake. She was a National Security Council member in the George W. Bush administration and is now with Stanford's Hoover Institution.

She said more of the classified information he stole could be made public either by Snowden or by others with access to the information.

"If what Snowden did isn't prosecutable under the Espionage Act, I can't imagine what would be," Schake said.

Snowden did not set out to seek asylum in Russia. Two years ago, he was reportedly attempting to fly to a sympathetic Latin American country — Cuba or Ecuador — via Moscow. The U.S. government suspended Snowden's passport, leaving him stranded at the Moscow airport.

Sergei Markov, an ardent nationalist and Kremlin adviser on diplomacy and international affairs, said Snowden was in need of Russia's protection.

"We can't send him back just because America demands it," Markov said, describing the American justice officials seeking his return as a "mafia" intent on revenge.

## Security Versus Privacy

Ronald Goldfarb, a former federal prosecutor, put together "After Snowden," a book of essays on security versus privacy in the Information Age.

"He has raised profoundly important issues," said Goldfarb, who advocates a more moderate prosecution of Snowden because of the reforms that have come from his disclosures.

Determining what information Snowden stole and whether it fell into the hands of hostile governments is also necessary, he said. Goldfarb said it's important to figure out "what damage he caused other than embarrassment" of intelligence officials who lied about the extent of the snooping.

Goldfarb thinks it would be best if Snowden returned to the United States and pleaded guilty. "There is no question he took property he shouldn't have taken," Goldfarb said.

"Let's give the government the benefit of a doubt," Goldfarb said. "If Snowden has hurt us in ways we don't know yet, we need to take that in mind. If not, the case can be made for a modest as opposed to severe sentence."

## The Window Is Closing

Even if Snowden was willing to return to the United States and face trial with assurances of a light sentence and a possible pardon, that window is closing.

Any deal could become a hot button issue in the presidential campaign. It seems unlikely that candidates with a serious chance of getting nominated would risk standing up for the man responsible for one of the biggest national security data thefts in history.

"This is the wrong time for the politics of it," Goldfarb said.

Ben Wizner, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union representing Snowden, acknowledges that his client isn't likely to be going home soon.

"Right now he has two choices: Stay indefinitely there or report to a U.S. prison," Wizner said, referring to the treason charges that could bring a 30-year prison sentence.
