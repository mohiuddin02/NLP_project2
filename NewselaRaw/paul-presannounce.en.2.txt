LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Senator Rand Paul, the maverick senator known for his independence, formally announced that he would seek to become the 2016 Republican candidate for president. Still in his first term in Congress, Paul rode a wave of anger with Washington, D.C., politics to jump from being a Kentucky eye doctor to senator in 2010.

"We have come to take our country back!" Paul told a crowd at his campaign launch in Louisville. "We have come to take our country back from the special interests that use Washington as their personal piggy bank, the special interests that are more concerned with their personal welfare than the general welfare."

Standing on a stage flanked by American flags, Paul emphasized a message of diversity and including all people. His speech was part of his aim to attract people who typically do not vote Republican.

"The message of liberty, opportunity and justice is for all Americans, whether you wear a suit, a uniform or overalls, whether you're white or black, rich or poor," Paul said. "Many Americans, though, are being left behind. The reward of work seems beyond their grasp. Under the watch of both parties — the poor seem to get poorer and the rich get richer."

## Choosing Sides

Paul's announcement makes him the second major Republican candidate to officially jump into the 2016 race. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas announced his plans to run in March.

A fiercely independent thinker, Paul is a libertarian. Unlike traditional conservatives, he believes in greater personal freedom of choice, which can lead him to side with Democrats on occasion. His views have drawn notice since he first entered Congress. He has clashed with leaders in the Republican party and proposed his own overhaul of the federal budget — the government's annual plan for spending money.

In 2013, he spoke on the floor of Congress for almost 13 hours straight in a filibuster — a way of stalling a vote. He had opposed President Obama's use of unmanned drone planes, and the possibility they could drop bombs on U.S. citizens.

The filibuster catapulted him to stardom among younger Republican voters who have craved a new voice.

## Knocking The Parties

Paul frequently knocked the Republican Party throughout his remarks Tuesday, accusing his own party of being part of the problem. At the same time, he called for policies that favor less money spent by the government, and less debt when the government spends money it does not have. Instead he would like to lower taxes to keep more money in people's hands — and spur spending by people to create jobs.

"It seems to me that both parties and the entire political system are to blame," he said. "Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration. And it's now tripling under Barack Obama's watch."

An ophthalmologist who still performs free eye surgeries, Paul did not hold elected office until ascending to the Senate in 2010. Yet he has been steeped in politics for his entire life as the son of one of America's most famous libertarian politicians. He helped father Ron Paul's Senate campaigns and his two campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination.

## How To Broaden Appeal

On the campaign trail, the Kentucky senator is expected to continue his familiar pitch: that the Republican Party needs to broaden its appeal to voters who have traditionally avoided it.

"White, black, brown, rich, poor, with tattoos and without tattoos, with earrings and without earrings," Paul said at a conference in February. "We need to take our message where it's not been before."

On Capitol Hill, Paul has been known for his unlikely alliances with Democrats. He has co-authored bills on reforming the criminal justice system with Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey. He has also been trying to appeal to black voters by pushing for more money to rebuild Detroit, a city with many black residents.

"There is still significant segregation in our society," Paul said last month at Bowie State University, a traditionally black university in Maryland.

Paul has repeatedly sparred with some of his Republican colleagues. But as he has approached his presidential run, Paul has been mending relations with many Republican colleagues.

Paul has been looking to broaden his appeal outside of Washington as well. He has been meeting with evangelical pastors to woo the Christian community.

## "Time For A New Way"

On foreign policy, his view that the United States should not get involved in international conflicts has shifted. Paul now voices support for a strong U.S. military. He has given more mention to the threat of terrorism in the Middle East, in particular the Islamic State group, also known as ISIL or ISIS.

Paul has also been tirelessly reaching out to young people. For the last year and a half he has been speaking at colleges and universities around the country. According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, Paul runs three times as well among voters younger than 50 than over 50. And he is reaching out to the tech sector, opening an office in Silicon Valley and using platforms like Snapchat to win over younger voters who may not respond to traditional political ads. Paul is also trying to get donations from tech-industry millionaires.

"It's time for a new way, a new set of ideas, a new leader," Paul said in February. "Above all, it's time for a new president."
