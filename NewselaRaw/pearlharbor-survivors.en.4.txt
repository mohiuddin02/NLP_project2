PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii â€” In December 1941, the United States was attacked. Japanese airplanes bombed a military base in Hawaii. They killed 2,400 sailors, Marines and soldiers who were there. About 1,177 of those were on a battleship that was sunk in the attack.

Nine of the survivors of the battleship attack are alive. Four of them came together again in Hawaii.

Every year on the day of the attack, the men gather in Pearl Harbor. They come to mark the event. They come to honor the many who died that day. The survivors are now in their 90s. Still, they promised that this year's reunion won't be their last.

## At The Memorial

The men gathered on Tuesday near a memorial for the Arizona. The memorial sits on top of the sunken battleship.

The event was the last official gathering of their survivors group. However, the men said they still plan to get together.

"I don't think this is going to be our last. ... We've still got time to go," said survivor Louis Conter, who is 93. "We'll be back out here no matter whether the rest of the crowd can make it or not."

Donald Stratton is 92 years old. He is another of the four survivors. He was in the front part of the ship when the Arizona was hit.

During the bombing, Stratton was working with a group of men. Most of the others were killed.

Stratton survived the bombing, but he was badly hurt. More than half his body was burned. He was hospitalized for over a year. A year later, he rejoined the Navy.

"The good Lord saved just a few of us," he said.

## Military Salutes And Music

On Sunday, the four men will meet privately. They will say a toast in honor of their fallen shipmates.

The men arrived at the Pearl Harbor visitor center on Tuesday. They were met with military salutes and music from a Navy band. Nearby tourists took their pictures.

The four men discussed their memories of the attack.

"I learned something about faith," said John Anderson, who is 97. Anderson recalled that he had just gone to church. He was heading to breakfast when someone said they saw the planes coming. He became teary-eyed as he discussed his twin brother, who was also on the ship. His brother died during the attack.

"It's always like yesterday when we're out here," Conter said.

## Near Their Shipmates

On Tuesday, the survivors also watched a live video. It showed divers swimming underwater. The divers moved alongside the Arizona's hull, or main body.

The bodies of more than 900 men who were killed in the attack remain there.

The ashes of 38 survivors are buried in the ship as well. They died years after the attack. The men asked to be buried near their shipmates who had been killed that day.

Survivor Lauren Bruner is 94 years old. When he dies, he plans to have his ashes placed down in the hull. Conter does too.

Bruner explained why he chose not to be buried in an ordinary graveyard. The dead in such places are often quickly forgotten, he said.

"It seems like after a while nobody pays attention to them anymore, after about five years," he said. "I hope a lot of people will still be ... coming over to the Arizona" for many, many years.
