BOYLE HEIGHTS, Calif. â€” Luisa is 11 years old. She plays on one of California's best soccer teams. She hopes to be a soccer player when she grows up.

Luisa lives in Boyle Heights. Every day she goes to Pasadena. It takes five hours to go back and forth. Her brother, Erick, and mother, Erika, go with her. They take a train and a bus. They even walk part of the way.

Luisa's family wants a better life. Her father is a truck driver. He can only come home four nights every month.

Their apartment is in a dark, old building. Erika fixed it up. She painted the walls. She put her two birds in a cage out back. She bought fans for hot weather.

## On The Train

On Friday nights, Erika teaches her children Spanish. She wants them to speak English and Spanish.

Years ago, Luisa was bullied. Kids made fun of her crooked teeth. Erika moved Luisa to another school. The new school cost money. Erika did not have enough. The school agreed to let her pay less. Still, it was hard to get by.

She tries hard to make money. They all do. Erick recycles bottles and cans. He picks them up during soccer practices. Luisa makes fake flowers to sell at school. Erika sells bracelets, purses and hair bows. Sometimes she works at a bakery.

Luisa's days start at 6 a.m. They end at 10 p.m. She eats dinner, does homework, and naps. It all happens on the train.

## "On The Field"

Her grades are all A's. She wants to go to a good high school.

"I just have to push myself," she said. "A lot of kids in Boyle Heights never have a chance to leave."

Erika teaches her: Do not take no for an answer.

Her coach is Cherif Zein. He said Luisa can make it as far as she wants.

"On the field, they are all the same," the coach said. "It does not matter how much you make or where you live or who you are."

Maybe that is why Luisa loves playing soccer.
