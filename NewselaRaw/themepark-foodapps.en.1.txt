ORLANDO, Fla. — Theme parks are using technology to reduce waits, but not just for rides.

They have started to let customers skip the cashier and order food ahead of time.

First, Disney World made online ordering available for its Be Our Guest restaurant so that guests can plan their meals in advance. Now it is trying smartphone ordering with food apps at the Backlot Express restaurant and during the Fantasmic! night-time show.

Smartphone ordering has also been added at SeaWorld Orlando's Seaport Pizza. SeaWorld Entertainment plans to expand the food apps system into more of its restaurants and theme parks this summer.

"It's very convenient, and that's what we're hearing from our guests," said Cathy Valeriano, a SeaWorld executive in charge of food services. "It's definitely kind of the wave of the future."

## More Customers Crave Convenience

Theme park restaurants are just starting to explore online ordering, but the trend is already in full swing across the rest of the restaurant industry. Chains like Panera Bread have popular online ordering systems and have even added computer stations in their restaurants to reduce the amount of time people spend waiting in line. Sit-down restaurants like Olive Garden have added online ordering options for to-go orders. Publix supermarkets have been using online ordering systems for deli subs and wraps since 2013.

Restaurants and theme parks say they are responding to consumers who are increasingly tech-savvy and hungry for convenience.

According to Boston University hospitality professor Chris Muller, restaurants and theme parks are also trying to save money. Even though an online ordering system might be expensive to get started, it reduces the number of cashiers a restaurant needs to pay.

Reducing waits for attractions and rides is considered one of the biggest challenges for theme parks. Tackling the lines in eateries is less important, said Robert Niles, editor of the blog Theme Park Insider.

"For a restaurant, getting the food is the primary thing. In a theme park, more often than not, food is secondary to the attraction," he said. "They've really been focusing on line skipping for the rides and shows."

Niles said theme parks also have to be careful not to confuse customers by launching too many line-skipping options in the same park.

## Disney Magic: Order Meals 30 Days Ahead

A Disney spokeswoman said that the company is responding to changing guest expectations. She noted that Disney's billion-dollar MyMagic+ technology project makes it easier to explore digital options. The MyMagic+ program rewards guests for frequent visits and aims to make their Disney experiences more personalized and efficient.

In February, the Be Our Guest restaurant in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom began allowing guests to preorder meals up to 30 days in advance. Diners must use a credit card to reserve their meals, but they will not actually pay for them until they visit the restaurant in person.

Be Our Guest also has touchscreen computer stations for lunch guests.

Disney has looked at adding other electronic conveniences like personalized digital menus. It has even considered having employees with computer tablets take orders from people while they are standing in line for rides.

Introducing new technology to visitors in the theme parks can be tricky, though, Niles said.

"It's very difficult to change guests' behaviors in the theme-park environment because people are on vacation and don't want to be trying to analyze anything," Niles said.

That's why tying such features into a system such as Disney's MyMagic+ — which guests use to make reservations ahead of time — would be wise, Niles said.

"It asks people to do a lot of that planning when they're back at home," he said. That makes more sense than "hitting them with a bunch of options once they get into the park."

## Few Choices On SeaWorld's Phone App

It is unclear how much of a difference preordering options are making at theme park restaurants.

During a recent lunch hour at SeaWorld, no one was picking up any meals at Seaport Pizza's window for customers who preordered with the app. SeaWorld would not say how many customers have used the order-ahead service. Park officials did say that the preordering feature gets more use during peak vacation periods.

The Seaport Pizza preorder service launched with limited options, allowing the purchase of family sized pizzas for $29.99, but not individual slices. SeaWorld said it will make more items available online this summer.

## Some Say SeaWorld's Cash-Only Line Is Best

Self-service computer ordering stations called kiosks are also popping up at SeaWorld. At its new Manta Soft Serve ice-cream stand, customers can order and pay with credit cards.

However, many guests skipped that option, choosing the cash-only line staffed by a cashier instead. British tourists Toni Crews and Simon Wilkin tried the electronic option and liked it, though.

The only complaint, Wilkin said: "We had to take off our sunglasses" because of the sun's glare.

Crews liked the fact that she did not have to wait in line.

"It was really easy," she said.
