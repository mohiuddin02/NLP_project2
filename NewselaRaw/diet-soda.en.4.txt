WASHINGTON â€” Diet sodas are supposed to help people lose weight. However, new research studies show they may make you fatter instead.

Now, a new group called Right to Know is asking the government to step in. The group says Coca-Cola and Pepsi are not being truthful. It wants the government to force the companies to stop putting the word "diet" on their sodas.

Right to Know is particularly concerned with Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi. Both popular sodas are sold as a way to help people lose weight. However, many studies show this claim is not true, the group said. In fact, they show that diet sodas can make you gain weight.

## Beverage Makers Dispute Claims

The American Beverage Association represents soda makers. It strongly denied Right to Know's claims. It said many studies show that diet sodas can help people lose weight.

Coca-Cola and Pepsi use artificial, or fake, sweeteners instead of natural sugars. They claim the sweeteners are not fattening. Sodas containing artificial sweeteners can help people lose pounds, they say.

Aspartame is the most popular artificial sugar. It is used in more than 5,000 drinks and foods.

Both Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi contain aspartame. The sweetener is also known as NutraSweet. It is used all over the world.

## Studies: Diet Drinks Don't Work For Weight Loss

New studies suggest artificial sweeteners do not help people lose weight. In fact, they might actually make people fatter.

One research study looked at 164 children over two years. It found that overweight kids drank more diet sodas than normal-weight children.

Another study looked at more than 10,000 children. It found that drinking diet soda made boys gain weight.

However, not all scientists think the new studies are right. They say that artificial sweeteners do not make people fatter. For example, Dr. James O. Hill does not agree. He has done his own study of artificial sweeteners.

"There's no way they are causing weight gain," Hill said. People should not be worried about drinking diet sodas, he added.

## For Weight Loss, Diet Drinks Better Than Water?

Hill's research study found that people who drank diet soda lost weight. In fact, they lost more weight than those who drank water. Hill admitted the American Beverage Association paid for his study. However, he said the Association did not tell him how to do his research.

Right to Know understands that not all research studies agree. However, it said studies paid for by soda companies should not be trusted.

The government has not yet said anything about Right to Know's charges against the soda makers. One spokesman said the government is always on the lookout for false advertising.
