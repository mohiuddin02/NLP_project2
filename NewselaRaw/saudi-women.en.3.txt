RIYADH, Saudi Arabia â€” Sofana Dahlan wanted to become a lawyer. She had a problem, though. In her country, Saudi Arabia, schools did not allow women to study law. She had to go to Egypt to follow her dreams.

Nearly 20 years later, Dahlan is back home in Saudi Arabia. She is now a successful lawyer here.

For many years, women in Saudi Arabia were not allowed to work outside the home. They were only supposed to cook, clean and take care of the children.

Dahlan is evidence that Saudi Arabia is changing, slowly but surely. Things are getting better for women in this very, very old-fashioned Muslim kingdom.

Women still need the permission of a male relative to go to college, get married or travel outside the country. Even so, more and more of them are taking jobs. Women are feeling better about themselves and better able to take care of themselves.

## Clothing Rules Must Be Followed

Saudi women are supposed to cover themselves up when they go out, so that men will not see too much of their bodies. They dress in long black robes known as abayas. Some cover their faces with a veil, leaving only their eyes showing.

Women are not letting those clothing rules stop them. They are now wearing their abayas to jobs in shops, restaurants, offices and even factories.

In 2011 Khalid Alkhudair started a company called Glowork, which helps women find jobs. He came up with the idea after his sister had a hard time getting a job.

It can still be very hard for Saudi women to find jobs. Many companies do not want to hire women. Their bosses are old-fashioned and think women should stay at home.

## Men And Women Have Separate Spaces

Another problem is that Saudi Arabia has strong laws about men and women being together in public. Men and women who are not related are not allowed to spend much time together. The fear is that they will get into trouble if they do. For example, a married man might become interested in another woman and forget about his wife.

Companies are now finding new ways to deal with these rules.

Some companies put in screens to make separate work spaces for women. A few factories hire only women to do the work. Other companies let women work from home on their computers.

Saudi women still have a much harder time finding work than men do. Only 1 in 10 jobs are held by women.

Glowork is busy trying to help more women find jobs. It looks for women who are ready to work and bosses who are willing to hire women.

Every time Glowork places a woman in a job, a bell is rung and the entire office applauds. By now the bell has sounded thousands of times.

## More Jobs Now Open In Stores

Glowork has run into problems, though. When a supermarket hired 11 women through Glowork, there was a public outcry. People stopped shopping at the supermarket's stores, because they were upset that men and women were mixing together.

"They actually had to let go of these women because of the outcry," Alkhudair said.

People are getting used to the idea of women working in stores, however. The change began with certain types of stores. Several years ago many people began demanding that women be allowed to work in stores selling women's underwear or makeup.

Many Saudi women had long disliked having to buy underwear from men. They found it embarrassing. Even very old-fashioned people could see why it made sense for women to work in women's underwear stores.

People soon got used to the idea of women working in underwear and makeup stores. Soon more and more people started to accept the idea of women working in other kinds of stores as well.

There are now women working in shopping malls across the country. Some of those women have even become bosses.
