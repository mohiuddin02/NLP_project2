BALTIMORE, Md. — Under Armour wants customers to connect star athletes' personal stories to the shirts on their backs and the shoes on their feet.

"No Art for Art's Sake" is the slogan that the Baltimore, Maryland, sporting goods company came up with to market its stylish fitness apparel and athletic shoes. The slogan is intended to give meaning to its products, which feature designs and colors that symbolize the stories of celebrity athletes endorsed by the sportswear company. Under Armour hopes an emotional connection to the athletes will inspire customers to buy more gear.

"We always strive to tell a story," said Adam Clement, the company's senior creative director for team sports.

## Their Favorite Things

Basketball player Stephen Curry loves sour candy. Baseball's Bryce Harper drives a black Camaro, and football star Cam Newton played ball for a college with a famous sports rivalry. Under Armour has designed shoes and uniforms to reflect all three famous athletes and some of their favorite things. 

Curry is the Most Valuable Player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and two different shoes designed for him make a reference to Bible verses. He is deeply religious. Another shoe displays a color pattern related to his father. Yet another shoe is bright yellow, green and red. It is called "Candy Reign" because the bright colors match the Sour Patch Kids candy that Curry loves so much.

The basketball star's popularity has been good for Under Armour, which markets him as an underdog. Curry was bypassed by many college basketball recruiters because he is not big for his position.

Curry recently extended his sponsorship deal with Under Armour through 2024. He said he looks forward to being part of the brand's story "for the rest of my playing career and beyond."

Harper plays Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals. Next season, Under Armour says the star will debut a black baseball shoe signifying Harper's devotion to his custom-built black Chevrolet Camaro. Harper is from Nevada, and the gold shoes he wore during the 2013 Home Run Derby, an MLB hitting contest, represented the glittering Las Vegas, Nevada, skyline.

"We did a quick flash sale and it sold out within minutes," said Josh Rattet, Under Armour's vice president for footwear.

Newton is a quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, a National Football League (NFL) team. He wears football cleats in practice that highlight some of his favorite causes such as breast cancer and military service. Newton also played college ball for Auburn University in Alabama. He wore a shoe in November to support his alma mater in the Iron Bowl, a rivalry game against the University of Alabama. 

Under Armour said it has also designed cleats for Newton in traditional Christmas colors for the holiday season, and colors that represent the state of Georgia, where he grew up. However, in his NFL games, Newton must wear shoes only in the colors tied to his NFL team.

## An Underdog Bites Back

Under Armour often markets itself as an underdog like Curry. Big competitor Nike, Inc., out of Oregon, sells far more apparel and footwear, but Under Armour is growing rapidly. Under Armour has a goal of reaching $7.5 billion in annual sales by 2018. Footwear and international sales as well as sales to women and online fitness applications are all driving Under Armour's growth, adding up to $3 billion in sales last year.

Nike also links its products and sportswear to athletes' stories.

Analysts say the two companies are competing to sell apparel and shoes, sign elite athletes for endorsement deals and uncover sports stars' inspiring narratives.

## Mixed Reviews

George Kiel runs a sneaker blog called NiceKicks.com. He said that with Curry and others, Under Armour goes deeper into a star athlete's personal story than other brands.

"Now athletes express themselves through their footwear," Kiel said. "It's kind of a competition to see who brings the best footwear out." 

Nike did not respond to requests for comment.

Under Armour's designs do not always get favorable reviews. Earlier this year, one sports news website said, "Under Armour is trying way too hard to be cool," and went on to say that the company has ugly shoes and dumb slogans.

Under Armour designed new uniforms based on the colors of the Maryland state flag for the Maryland Terrapins. When the college football team showed off their new uniforms in 2011, NBA superstar LeBron James tweeted, "Ewwwww." 

Shortly afterward, Clement hired workers for a project at his home, and said one asked if he worked for Under Armour, then commented that the guy who designed the Maryland uniforms must be on drugs. Clement said he responded: "Well, you're looking at him, and I'm not."

The key, Under Armour officials say, is to unearth themes that will create an emotional connection for athletes, teams and their fans.

## The Cheetah And The Snake

In 2013, Under Armour developed attire for Natasha Hastings, an American track star.

"The cheetah is her favorite animal since it's the fastest animal," Clement said. "We placed the cheetah on the back so all those behind her would know the race leader couldn't be caught, that the cheetah was out in front of them."

Under Armour went with a different animal for the U.S. Naval Academy men's basketball team. The custom uniforms have a logo that says, "Don't Tread on Me," inspired by the United States Navy flag, with a snake above red and white stripes, meant to symbolize the American fight for freedom.

"If you design something just because it's on trend or different or cool, or because black is what everyone's wearing, it's not going to stand the test of time," Clement said.

Ideas, however, endure, he said.
