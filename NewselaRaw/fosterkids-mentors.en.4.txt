When parents do not make safe homes for their children, the government finds another place for the kids to stay. Some live with family members. Some are taken in by other families. This is called foster care.

When Michael McKernan was growing up, his father was in prison. When he was a teen, his mother abandoned him and his brothers and sisters. They all went into foster care. His younger siblings ended up in a different foster home than him. McKernan also lived with different family members for a few years.

Without a stable home life, McKernan dropped out of high school. He started working overnights at Wal-Mart. When he turned 18, he still had a lot to learn. McKernan was living with his grandmother. He did not have parents to help guide him.

Luckily, he met a social worked named William Childress.

## First Step Is To Pass The Test

Social workers help people like McKernan who need support. Childress works with a program called YVLifeSet. The program offers extra help to foster kids who are just becoming adults. Childress helped push McKernan toward a brighter future.

Childress encouraged him to join YVLifeSet, and McKernan accepted. Childress became McKernan's counselor. He nudged him, the way a father would. He checked in with McKernan regularly and gave him steady encouragement and advice.

McKernan set his sights on college. He wanted to go further than his parents.

Because he had been in foster care, the government might help him pay for college. First, he would first have to pass the GED. The GED is a test students can take to make up for not finishing high school.

## Gloomy Mood Is Lifted

He studied hard, staying up late with thick practice books. The test was set to take place on Dec. 11. His heart was pounding as he walked up to the sign-in table and gave his name. The woman checked her list and told him that she could not find his name. He was not registered.

McKernan was sure he had registered for the test, but there was nothing he could do. He went home, feeling hopeless. He could take the test in a year, but by then it would be too late to get help paying for college. He could not pay for it on his own.

Childress happened to be in town that same day. When he stopped by McKernan's grandmother's house to check in, he saw the gloomy look on the teenager's face. He knew something was wrong. McKernan told him what had happened.

"Now wait," Childress told him, "Let's see what we can do."

Childress made some calls and learned about an exam the following week in another area. McKernan would get to take the test after all.

McKernan took the GED exam and passed.

## Many Kids Succeed With Help

Since then, things have been going well for him. He started college and is enjoying his classes. He now dreams of studying in another country.

McKernan is not alone. YVLifeSet and other programs like it have helped thousands of foster kids.

Erin Valentine is an expert in foster care. She measured how useful YVLifeSet is for foster kids by doing a study of them. She discovered that YVLifeSet increased foster kids' chances of finding homes and good jobs as grownups.

She said that the social workers at YVLifeSet act almost like parents. Having that support can make a big difference.
