Taylor Swift has been in the news for her new album. Soon after, she took her music off of Spotify. The app and website is a streaming service that lets fans listen to any song they like.

Over the summer, Swift wrote an article for a financial newspaper. She shared her hopeful view of the music business. "The music industry is not dying ... it's just coming alive," she wrote.

Many people think the music business is not making money. Before the Internet, the music business was making a lot of money. People would buy music on big discs called records or on tapes or CDs. When more people started getting computers, things changed.

People could download music for free. It was against the law, but many people stole music from their favorite musicians.

## Spotify's Low Pay

Now, Swift thinks the music business will get better. "Music should not be free," she wrote.

Many people think this is easy for Swift to say. She is very successful. She has made $64 million this year. She will make even more money when fans buy her album, "1989." For every $1 her fans spend on "1989," she gets about 70 cents. On Spotify, she got less than a penny for every song her fans listened to.

Many in the music business like Spotify. They like the money it and other streaming services are making. Before Spotify, fans were downloading music for free. But musicians don't like the low pay of Spotify.

Some big artists have started taking down some or all of their music from Spotify, like Beyonc√© and the Beatles.

In her article last summer, Swift wrote: "Music is art, art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for." Many people believe Swift's idea is nice. It would be easier for musicians if the Internet had never happened. Although, without the Internet, Swift wouldn't have 46 million followers.

## Swift And Her Fans

Her big point is that musicians shouldn't give their music away if they don't have to.

Still, smaller bands have a difficult choice. Unknown bands need to get people to hear their songs any way they can. Some bands make money by playing concerts. Some get paid when their songs are used on TV or in video games. They just need people to hear their songs first so they need Spotify or YouTube.

Fans have a problem with Spotify, too. They do not own their own music anymore. The songs they listen to belong to the music companies. Music is becoming more like Netflix. Fans can hear any song whenever they would like, but they must pay. Sometimes fans pay by giving Spotify money. Other times, fans must listen to an advertisement before hearing their favorite song.

Fans also have a lot more choices. It can be hard for them to bond with bands or singers they like. Concerts have become important because they give fans a chance to see and connect with the artists they love.

Swift is an expert at connecting with her fans. Even pulling her music off of Spotify brought her fans closer to her. Instead of streaming her songs, they are buying her album to prove how much they love her.
