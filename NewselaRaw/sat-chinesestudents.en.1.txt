BEIJING — Chinese students are big fans of American colleges. More than 235,000 of them enrolled at U.S. universities last year.

Like American students, to apply for the schools they must take the SATs. An announcement that the SATs could start including documents from American history is leaving people in China concerned that the test might impose American values on China's best and brightest students. Soon, these students may be reading the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights instead of traditional Chinese historical documents.

## Political And Philosophical Differences

The U.S. College Board in March announced plans to redesign the SAT to include U.S. founding documents in one portion of the test, known as the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing. This will be one of several changes going into effect in spring 2016.

"Including content from America's founding documents in a revised U.S. college entry exam has drawn attention in China," China's official New China News Agency said this week. The concern, the agency explained, is that the new content may spread American ideology. If students preparing for the SAT read the works of American thinkers, they may be more likely to agree with American points of view. This could make them less likely to agree with their own government.

The College Board acknowledges that the revised test will contain powerful ideas. Documents like the Bill of Rights include political and philosophical arguments that could influence students' values. The U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, for example, discusses the rights of citizens to speak out against their government.

"The vital issues central to these documents — freedom, justice, and human dignity among them — have motivated numerous people in the United States and around the globe," the College Board said in a statement.

Those are some of the values of which the Chinese Communist Party is suspicious. Many Chinese activists have tried to promote greater freedom in China only to have been silenced. In 2012, human rights activist Xu Zhiyong initiated the "New Citizens' Movement." The movement argued for greater civil rights for China's 1.3 billion citizens. This January, Zhiyong was sent to prison for four years. Many believe that he was imprisoned because government leaders were afraid he was turning people against them.

## Who Has Real Ideological Control?

The Chinese government's response to the SAT's changes follows a similar logic. The new SAT may influence Chinese students in a way that their government dislikes. Writing in the South China Morning Post newspaper, Kelly Yang argued that the new focus on civil liberties may "change the mindset and world view of an entire generation of Chinese youth." It is the threat of large-scale political influence that makes some Chinese leaders uncomfortable with the new test.

Some Chinese intellectuals, however, have argued that it is hypocritical for the government to point fingers at the SAT. These critics have suggested that China's leaders should ease their ideological control on students rather than make accusations against a foreign exam. In other words, Chinese students are already influenced by political and ideological teaching. If the SAT is guilty of propaganda, so is China's government.

The Chinese Communist Party works hard to shape the beliefs and values of China's youth. Chinese students are required to take "thoughts and morals" lessons to study Communist ideology as early as first grade. In China's college entrance exams, questions regarding core Communist theories such as Marxism and Maoism are essential to a student's success.

## Be More Free-Thinking

Zhang Ming, a political science professor at Renmin University, argues that the government should not worry about American brainwashing and instead, it should allow students to think more freely. "I don't think they have grounds to question what's in the SAT before they cancel all the 'political classes' in Chinese schools," he said.

Whatever its effects on students' beliefs, the SAT is likely to continue to be popular in China. In recent years, thanks to a booming economy, hundreds of thousands of Chinese families have sent their children to study in the United States and other Western countries.

According to the Institute of International Education, the number of Chinese students at U.S. universities has grown 20 percent annually for over six years. Since 2010, China has sent more students to the United States each year than any other country.

Hoping to be admitted to prestigious American universities, many Chinese high school students will continue to take the SAT. Starting in spring 2016, this will mean that they will study some of America's founding documents, whether or not their government approves.
