BEIJING, China — The city of Beijing, China, has some of the world's worst air pollution. Air purifiers can help by making the air less toxic. The Chinese government has refused to give these machines to public schools. They are common in the city's expensive private schools.

Sara Zhang is like many people who live in Beijing. She has done things at home to protect herself from pollution. She has also taken steps to protect her two children. Yet her 7-year-old son's public school has not installed any air purifiers. The students in her son's school have to breathe the dirty air.

## Smoggy City Makes It Hard To Breathe

Zhang and some other parents offered a few air purifiers to the school for free, but school leaders refused to take them. They said the government had not approved them. This led to a frustrating experience for Zhang.

She and the other parents called around schools in Beijing. They also called leaders in the Chinese government. "We got different answers from everyone who picked up the phone," Zhang said. "But everyone basically told us that it's impossible to have (air purifiers) installed."

December was a bad month for breathing in Beijing. The pollution was very bad. There were  two "red alert" smog warnings. Smog is a mixture of pollution and fog. The warnings are issued when pollution is at dangerous levels. Schools were closed across the city.

## Parents Are Angry That Schools Do Nothing

Even on days with no warnings, the city was covered with smog. Parents were angry that their children's schools did not have air purifiers. They were also angry that the Chinese government could not deal with the pollution.

One school leader in Beijing spoke about the problem. She said schools are not encouraged to accept air purifiers from parents. Instead, schools are encouraged to close when pollution is bad.

She added that schools are working on the problem. She said schools are trying to come up with a plan that will help clean the air in schools. She did not say when the plan would be put in place.

## Pollution Is Making People Sick

Experts say China's air pollution is very bad for human health. They say thousands of people die each year because of smog. 

A Chinese newspaper wrote about the problem. It said pollution has become so bad that many government offices have air purifiers. Yet there are few air purifiers in public schools. The newspaper wondered if the government cares more about its leaders than it does about school children.  

One woman said her stepdaughter's school had not installed air purifiers. She said the smog has been so bad that she decided to move her family away from Beijing. They are moving to Hainan in southern China. The island has some of the country's cleanest air.   

"Smoggy days in Beijing are so, so common now. This happens at least once or twice a week," the woman said. "They can't make students stay at home every week indefinitely. And a lot of parents work full time. They can't stay home from work once or twice a week to take care of their children.

"The pollution is so bad it makes life in this city practically unlivable," she said. "This is such a massive problem, and the government isn't solving it. So what kinds of problems is the government here to solve?"
