LOS ANGELES â€” The Pacific Crest Trail is very challenging for hikers. In fact, it is one of the most difficult trails in the world. It goes up the entire length of California and all the way to Canada. From end to end, it runs for 2,650 rugged miles.

Luckily, hikers get some help along the way.

Sandy and Barney Mann live in San Diego near the southern end of the trail. They open their home to up to 60 hikers a night.

The Manns even pick up hikers from the airport. They will also drive them to the trail's starting point.

Donna and Jeff Saufley live up the trail in Agua Dulce. They provide a night of rest to more than 1,000 hikers a season. They even offer food and shelter to the hikers' dogs and horses.

Hank Magnuski lives east of San Francisco. His home is near a very tough 300-mile stretch of the trail. Magnuski gives hot coffee and food to tired, hungry hikers.

All these people are known as "trail angels."

## Big Payback: Grateful Smiles

Trail angels help hikers along the Pacific Crest Trail. They offer food, shelter, medicine and hot showers.

There are fewer than 100 trail angels. All are volunteers. They pay for everything they offer hikers. Mostly, their only reward is a grateful smile.

Donna Saufley is the best-known of the trail angels.

Each April, she and her husband set up tents and a trailer for the hikers. Their home is known as "Hiker Heaven."

Saufley says she loves getting to know the hikers. "These are some of the most interesting people on the planet," she said.

Other trail angels also say they get something very rewarding from what they do. In fact, they think they get as much as the hikers themselves.

Pea Hicks lives in San Diego. She helps hikers get started at the Mexican border.

Being a trail angel helps her stay involved in hiking, Hicks says. She walked the trail herself in 2006.

## Challenging, Yet Popular

Over time, the trail angels have gotten busier.

Saufley began helping hikers in 1997. She said she hosted 50 hikers that whole year. Last year, she often had that many staying each night. About 1,200 stayed with her over the summer.

Saufley loves it when her home is filled with hikers. Hearing all the talking and laughter makes her happy.

The Pacific Crest Trail has become very popular with hikers. However, it remains a very difficult challenge.

The trail is often blocked by rockslides or huge fallen trees. Hikers must climb uphill part of the way. Sometimes they are forced to climb as much as 10,000 feet.

Some hikers complete the trail several times. Others add their own special twist. Two years ago, Ron Ulrich hiked the whole thing dressed in a wedding gown.

## Keep In Touch!

The Manns began helping hikers 10 years ago. They say many hikers stay in touch with notes and cards.

Barney Mann confesses that being a trail angel is not always easy. Helping so many strangers can get very exhausting.

Still, he said, "We are so lucky to be able to do this."
