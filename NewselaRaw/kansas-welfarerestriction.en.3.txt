TOPEKA, Kan. â€” As in every state, poor people in Kansas can apply to get help from their state government. The money they receive is known as welfare.

On Thursday, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed a new law that creates stricter rules for Kansans getting welfare. The law shortens the time a person is allowed to receive money. It also places new limits on where welfare money can be spent.

Brownback, a Republican, hailed the law as a way to get people to take care of themselves. He said it will lift people out of poverty by pushing them back to work.

The law requires those receiving welfare to work at least 20 hours a week or go through a job training program. It also puts many restrictions on where welfare money can be spent. For example, it cannot be used at movie theaters or swimming pools.

The purpose of the law is "to get people back to work," Brownback said.

## It's Mean, Critics Say

Some parts of the law have been heavily criticized. For example, if a person lies in order to receive welfare, every adult living in the same home would be prevented for life from receiving welfare. It would not matter if they knew about the cheating or not.

Another new rule in the law has also been heavily criticized. It says that if Kansans are arrested for drugs two times, they will not be allowed to receive welfare for the rest of their lives.

Brownback said he is open to changing the law if problems arise.

"I'm open to revisiting all of it, if it's not working," the Republican governor said. If it helps to get people back to work, though, he wants the state to keep on supporting it, he added.

Democrats, who typically support more government money for poor people, have been critical of the law, which they say is mean-spirited.

"Child poverty and homelessness in Kansas are at record levels," Democratic Senator Anthony Hensley said. The new law simply punishes the poor and looks down on them, he said.

The law will "make it harder for Kansans in need" to escape poverty, Hensley said. "This is just one more example of how Sam Brownback is out of touch with the real world and has our state on the wrong path."

Democratic Congressman Tom Burroughs said the law "does nothing to address the root causes of poverty in our state."

He said Kansas should instead be "providing quality education" and creating jobs to "ensure that all Kansans have a fair chance to succeed."

## A Strict Allowance

The new law also limits the amount of welfare money people can withdraw from a cash machine. They will now only be allowed to take out up to $25 a day.

Republican state lawmaker Travis Couture-Lovelady believes this rule is a good idea. It helps make sure that welfare money is spent on necessities like food, he said.

When asked whether he thought poor people could not be trusted to spend their welfare money responsibly, Couture-Lovelady responded, "Most can. Absolutely most can."

However, there are some people who spend welfare money on the wrong things, he said. Their behavior "hurts the folks who are using the program in the correct manner."

## Law Hurts Children, Group Says

Shannon Cotsoradis is president of the group Kansas Action for Children. She said the new law is bad for mothers and young children. It requires a woman receiving welfare to return to work shortly after having a baby.

Women who do not go back to working quickly enough will stop receiving welfare. Mothers will be forced to choose between staying home with their young children and having enough money to get by. Either way, children will lose out, Cotsoradis thinks.

"Governor Brownback has added to the burden that the poorest Kansans already carry," Cotsoradis said. "It's always been hard to be poor in Kansas. Now, it's going to be a lot harder."
