SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Hoping to move the heavens, scientists are busy planning to pluck, push and park a spinning asteroid between here and the moon.

Most of us hope to dodge space rocks. But NASA has unveiled an ambitious plan to build a spaceship to drag one closer to Earth. The Space Age project has a price tag of $105 million and may be a first step in our future voyage to Mars.

"Our goal is to go out there and rendezvous - then get it into the hands of the people who can understand it," said David Korsmeyer, a director at NASA's Ames Research Center.  Scientists and engineers at Ames will contribute to the project.

Asteroids command our respect because a big one could play us like a billiard ball. In February, a little one rocked Russia and a bigger one barely missed Earth, only adding to our asteroid anxiety.

## A Stepping-Stone into Space

But asteroids are also valuable, and pursuing one could launch us into deeper space.

That's because we'll need a vehicle a lot better than a fuel-driven rocket. Engineers hope new money from NASA will allow them to design a futuristic solar-electric ship that would make a slow, steady and sustainable trip to find an asteroid. It's the journey that thrills scientists â€“ not the destination

After finding a suitable space rock orbiting our way, the spaceship might push, tug or harpoon the asteroid. Or it might stuff the rock into a big bag. Perhaps it may even lasso it in some 21st century version of a cowboy rope trick.

## Waiting for Stars to Align in Washington

"As a space-faring country it has been more than 40 years since we have been to deep space," where the asteroids are, said G. Scott Hubbard, a Stanford University professor. Hubbard had the original idea for the Mars Pathfinder mission. "We need to regain our 'chops,'" he said. "It's a demonstration of space exploration technologies for the future."

The "Asteroid Retrieval Mission" is still under development in Washington, D.C. It is a major new goal for an agency that has stopped flying its fleet of shuttles and has grounded a moon-landing plan.

The idea was first proposed last year by the California Institute of Technology, and it has even found favor at the White House. In his only speech about space, President Barack Obama vowed we would land on an asteroid by 2025. There's less enthusiasm for the plan in the Congress, where there is fierce debate about spending.

## Sky-High Prices

Developing the technology to bring home an asteroid will hike costs, warned Hubbard. The $105 million is just a down payment on a project that could cost billions of dollars.

"I would caution the developers to be very clear-minded and open-eyed about what the ultimate cost ... might be," he said. In the summer, Ames and other NASA research centers will work out the details.

At Ames, "we can provide tools that make the mission more successful," Korsmeyer said. For instance, he said, Ames scientists could devise tools similar to their CheMin device aboard the Mars rover that analyzes the composition of Martian rocks. Ames could also build sensors to help find an asteroid. Most asteroids travel too far away to be useful. And some are huge.

But petite ones - say, the size of a dump truck - might be practical to grab using unmanned spaceships, NASA says.

## Lining It All Up

Asteroids are the rubble left from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. They hold clues about our origins and, perhaps, valuable metals. The main goal is not to protect the Earth from a runaway space rock. But the technology developed "could prove useful in diverting a larger, rogue asteroid," said Tom Jones. He should know:  the planetary scientist and former astronaut is an adviser to the asteroid-seeking B612 Foundation.

The hunt won't be easy: The perfect asteroid will be tough to find because it will be too small to reflect light. Not only that, it doesn't want to be captured. NASA calls it "an uncooperative object." It will be moving at 17,000 miles per hour, content in its own orbit, and spinning like a top. It may not even be solid, like granite, but just a tumbling bunch of rocky ice.

Then there's the challenge of catching it. Korsmeyer calls it "a multivariable math game." Think of catching a baseball while on a Ferris wheel.

Once captured, it would be slowly pushed or pulled, and nudged close to the moon. There, remote-controlled ships would arrive to chip off chunks for study. Eventually, astronauts would visit it.

"It's not a trivial undertaking," Korsmeyer said. "You are lining up a whole set of moving balls to try to put one in the pocket."
