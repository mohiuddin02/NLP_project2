PHILADELPHIA â€” The University of Pennsylvania is at the cutting edge of a drive to experiment with free online courses that are open to anyone. But its own study found out that, so far, the courses have had mixed results.

The courses are known as MOOCs. That stands for Massive Open Online Courses. They have attracted millions of viewers and have been promoted as a possible way to address skyrocketing education costs. Yet, only 4 out of every 100 students actually complete the courses, according to a new study by the University of Pennsylvania.

Many who sign up drop off after the first week or two, the study found. About half who signed up viewed one lecture or more.

The results come on the heels of another Penn study, released last month. It showed that most students enrolled in MOOCs already had college degrees. People are taking the courses mostly to get ahead in their jobs.

## Learning New Job Skills

People believed that MOOCs would help make degrees possible for people who couldn't afford it. This doesn't seem to be happening.

"The technology offers some promise of a new approach to addressing both" costs and getting education for poor people, said Laura Perna. She helped run the new study. But she said no one knows yet how well it will actually work.

The researchers looked at 1 million users. They registered for 16 free courses offered from June 2012 to June 2013. The classes were taught by Penn professors and offered in partnership with an online education company.

The study looked into when users enter and leave courses. And it looked at when and how they take part in classes. The courses varied in how quizzes were used and in homework and instruction time. Students in courses with smaller workloads were slightly more likely to complete the course.

Most courses focused on learning to improve yourself or learning new job skills. One such class was on how to save someone who is having a heart attack.

Perna said she was a bit surprised by the results.

"I didn't expect it to be quite this low," she said of the number of people who finished the courses.

## Learning For Fun

But Ed Rock, who heads Penn's MOOC classes, disagrees. He called the findings "entirely unsurprising and not at all troubling." There are 1.6 million current users of MOOCs. Even if only 4 out of every 100 people complete them, that is still 80,000 people.

Rock says that "80,000 people is a huge number to educate."

He also said those who did not complete the courses had gotten something from the experience.

Most MOOC users are doing it to learn for fun or to get ahead in their jobs. So, it's not surprising that few finish, said Cathy Sandeen of the American Council on Education.

She says there is a place for MOOCs to help people earn degrees. But the opportunity is probably smaller than originally thought, she said.

Rock admits that educators have a way to go in learning how to fit MOOCs into the educational mission. So Penn has partnered with 10 high schools. Teachers in those schools are using a Penn online course in addition to classroom learning.

"Our hope is our material will be of value. We won't know that unless (high school teachers) try it out and tell us," he said.

Perna agreed that MOOCs could benefit society. She mentioned the case of a neighbor who is taking a MOOC with co-workers. Each week they meet to discuss what they've learned.

"I think there is something there," she said. But we need to understand better what MOOCs' place is in education, she added.
