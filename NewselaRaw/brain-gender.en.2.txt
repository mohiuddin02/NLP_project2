Male and female brains may be built differently, but they think alike. Scientists say that human brains cannot be categorized as typically male or female, although there are differences. 

Researchers looked at results from more than 100 studies. They found differences in areas of the brain that control language, memory, emotion and behavior.

The report appeared in a scientific magazine in 2014. Scientists noted that male brains are built differently than female brains, and the volume of a man's brain is about 8 to 13 percent greater than that of a woman. 

The scientists then wanted to find out if those physical differences meant there were also differences in how men and women think. 

## Studying Multiple Areas Of The Brain

Daphna Joel is a scientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. She and a team of researchers looked at brain scans of more than 1,400 men and women but could not find any patterns that make men and women different. The team looked at a variety of scans, different parts of the brain, and different groups of people.

Joel's team found that there are male and female differences in brain structure. However, they wrote, "Brains do not fall into two classes, one typical of males and the other typical of females." 

The team published their study recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a magazine for scientists. In it, they said that each brain has a unique set of features, "some of which may be more common in females compared with males, others may be more common in males compared with females." Scientists also said that they found common features in both male and female brains.

To figure out more, the team did more research, searching for examples of brain elements that were either clearly male or clearly female. They looked for measurements that appeared to go one way for men and another way for women, without much common ground. After identifying the elements, researchers looked to see whether women always tended to have one version of the element and men tended to have another.

## Most Subjects Had Male And Female Brains

The scientists first measured the volume of gray matter in the brain. They did this with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI is a scan that records detailed images inside the body. 

The scientists put together a test group made up of 112 men and 169 women between the ages of 18 and 79. On their scans, researchers examined 116 separate parts of the brain. Then they looked closely at 10 parts of the brain. Those parts showed the greatest difference between men and women. In each case, the scans were divided into three categories: male, female and somewhere in the middle.

Only 6 percent consistently showed up as male or female in all 10 parts of the brain while 35 percent showed up in the middle. The middle group had male traits in some parts of the brain and female traits in others.

Brains with both male and female features far outnumbered brains that were just male or female.

Next, they ran brain scans that measured the thickness of the outer layer of the cerebrum. It controls the movements of the body and the five senses. They also measured the connections between different parts of the brain and other features. Still, they found that consistently male or consistently female brains were rare. Brains with features related to both were common.

## Bringing Teen Brains Into The Mix

Joel and her team then applied the same method to two large studies of American teens. The studies interviewed youths to see how their social environments — friends, family, school — led to their behaviors as teens. Then the studies looked at how the choices they made as teens led to their health and achievements as young adults. 

First, the scientists looked at 570 participants in a study called the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context. They found that only 1.8 percent of them scored consistently male or consistently female. Fifty-nine percent showed that they had traits of both genders.  

The difference was even greater in the second study, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. It focused on a group of 4,860 teenagers. Less than 1 percent scored just male or female. Seventy percent scored in the middle.

## Majority Of College Students Showed Traits Of Both

Finally, the scientists looked at older students. They asked 263 college students about activities that are often considered to be more female or more male, like watching talk shows on television or playing video games. With their answers, researchers found that only 1.2 percent of the students could be classified as exclusively male or exclusively female. Fifty-five percent showed traits of both.

Joel and her team say the results undermine any attempt to distinguish between a male and a female form for specific brain features.
