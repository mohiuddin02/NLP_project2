Jake Olson is completely blind. He also loves football. Olson has long dreamed of playing with one of his favorite teams, the Trojans. The Trojans are the football team of the University of Southern California (USC).

Olson lost his sight when he was 12. To save his life doctors had to remove his right eye. His left eye had already been removed when he was a baby.

## Losing His Eyes, Keeping His Dream

Olson spent some of his last days with sight visiting and watching the Trojans. The players were very inspired by his courage.

Olson is now in his last year at Orange Lutheran High School.

At first, Olson only sat in the stands during high school football games. He never stopped wanting to play, though.

Olson began thinking there might be a way he could play football. He could become a long snapper. The position is the only one for which a player does not need to see the ball or other players.

A long snapper passes the ball backward to a player behind him at the start of a play. The player who catches the ball then holds it, and another player kicks it forward. If he kicks it between the goal posts he scores a field goal.

## Mom And Coach Had Doubts

Olson's mother was not happy about his plan to try to become a long snapper. She was afraid he might be turned down — or hurt.

Still, late in 2012 Olson went to see Orange Lutheran Coach Chuck Petersen. He asked Coach Petersen if he could join the team. Petersen told him to return after the team finished the season.

"I didn't want to kill the kid's spirit, so I just said 'Oh, OK'… and thought I'll probably never hear about this again,'" Petersen said.

In the spring Olson went back to see Petersen and again asked for a chance to play. This time, the coach said he would give Olson a try. However, Olson would have to prove he was good enough to play, the coach said.

"You're going to have to earn your spot," Petersen said.

## Working To Make The Team

Things were tough for Olson at first. However, he practiced over and over. His snaps improved enormously. Eventually he made the team.

Teammates guide Olson onto the field. Then they help him line up with the ball. Other than that, Olson is no different from any other player.

"We didn't see him as a blind person," kicker Jerry Fitschen said. "We saw him as a football player."

## Part Of A Crucial Play

Olson had an unforgettable moment last season. His team was playing against Servite High. Orange Lutheran were way behind but fought back to within three points. The score was 25–22.

With a few minutes left, Olson came on for the snap. "Everything kind of got quieter," he said. He remembered thinking, "Well this is pretty cool."

The snap and the kick were both perfect and Orange Lutheran tied the score.

## Hoping To Play For The Trojans

In the fall Olson will enter USC as a student. He is looking forward to being at the home of his favorite football team.

Olson has not been picked for the team yet. However, he may be called out onto the field one day.

Steve Sarkisian is USC's football coach. He said he would not be surprised if a movie is made about Olson. Helping the Trojans score a field goal could be part of the story.

"Someday, he's going to snap in a game for us," Sarkisian said. "When? I don't know — but it will happen."

He added, "When that day comes, it will be awesome."

Olson is not expecting special treatment.

All he wants is the chance "to prove myself like anyone else," he said.
