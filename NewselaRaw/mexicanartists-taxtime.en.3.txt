MEXICO CITY — When tax time comes, artist Teresa Cito doesn't worry. She knows the government isn't after a single peso.

Instead, what the taxman wants is one of her artworks. Governments take part of what people make each year, which goes to help pay for the government.

In Mexico, artists are allowed to give pieces of art instead of money.

The idea, which is known as Payment in Kind, dates back to 1957. It has helped the government build a huge collection of modern art. It has also left artists such as Cito happy: They are free from the bother of tax forms and the worry of owing large sums of money to the government.

## Some Artists Give Their Best Pieces

The number of artworks artists must give changes from year to year: It depends on how much art they have sold in a year. No artist, though, is required to give more than six works a year.

Cito specializes in colorful oil paintings, as well as chalk drawings on paper. She doesn't try to give the state her lesser works. She knows whatever she gives will be exhibited. It may end up in a government building or a museum, or even be shown in another country.

Cito said she always tries to offer the government "a nice piece." She had much praise for the Payment in Kind program. "I admire it very, very, very much. The government says, 'Pay your taxes in artwork. Keep on painting.'"

Nearly every artist who takes part in the program agrees.

"I think it's fantastic," said artist Naomi Siegmann. The works she has given can be seen "all over the country," in "government offices as well as public buildings."

Siegmann said she got a thrill when she saw one of her pieces in a public space.

"I walk in and see my work," Siegmann said, and "I think, 'How nice!'"

She added, "Every big artist is in this program — I mean the top, top artists. It's not just the new artists, the beginners."

## A Great Idea Was Born

The program came out of a 1957 meeting between two men: tax official Hugo B. Margain and artist David Alfaro Siqueiros. Siqueiros told Margain that an artist friend was facing jail time for not paying taxes.

Siqueiros argued that "a painter knows nothing" about "tax law," Margain later wrote. "The only thing we have," Siqueiros said, "are pictures." Perhaps, he suggested, artists could take care of what they owed the government "with the delivery of some paintings."

"It doesn't seem like a bad idea, I told him," Margain wrote.

The idea was soon accepted by the Mexican government. Since then, it has taken in well over 4,000 works of art.

A committee of art experts looks at artworks that have been offered. Their goal is to decide whether they fairly represent the work of a given artist.

The program has helped build a splendid collection of works by some of Mexico's best-known artists. In addition, it has helped beautify many public buildings.

## Can There Be Too Much Art?

If the program has a fault, it's that the state takes too much art. Some of that art isn't very good.

Of course, not every artist who makes a living from selling his or her work is enormously talented. Bad artists, too, have a right to take part in the program.

Still, the overall collection contains many great works. They come from some of Mexico's most famous artists.

What's more, widely known artists try to give work they're proud of.

"They are aware that their pieces may be exhibited," said government official Jose San Cristobal Larrea. "They don't dare" give "works of bad quality."

San Cristobal said the government is careful not to pass judgment on the work collected from artists. After all, great artistic talent can't always be spotted immediately.

"Artists who aren't important today might be important tomorrow," he said.
