WASHINGTON â€” First, Michelle Obama got kids around the nation to get up and move to be more physically fit. Now, the first lady is telling them to eat home-cooked meals to slim down.

Obama said Friday that a new focus of her anti-childhood obesity effort will be to encourage people to cook more of their meals at home. Home-cooked meals are healthier, and they're cheaper, too, said Obama at a health conference in Washington.

The first lady said home-cooked meals have less fat, sodium, cholesterol and calories than meals prepared in restaurants.

She said too many people think they don't have the time or the skills to cook for themselves. But plenty of meals can be pulled together in less than 30 minutes for cheaper than takeout.

## Home Cooking

Obama began focusing on the problem of overweight children as soon as she got to the White House in 2009. She pledged Friday to stick with the issue even after her husband leaves office.

"We cannot walk away from this issue until obesity rates drop for children of every age and every background," she said. [Obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) is when a person has too much body fat. Obese children are more likely to have heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes later as adults.

"We cannot walk away until every child in this country has a shot at a healthy life," she said. "And that's why I'm in this thing for the long haul, and I mean long after I leave the White House, because I believe in finishing what I start."

Obama praised recent government numbers showing a sharp decline in obesity rates among children ages 2 to 5. She called it a small, though important, achievement, but still not enough evidence to declare the problem solved. She urged everyone to keep working on solutions, especially among older kids.

"Now is not the time to take our foot off the gas and congratulate ourselves on a job well done," Obama said. "Just the opposite. Now is the time to fight even harder, because we now know it is possible to make a difference on this issue. We know that our strategies are beginning to work."

Her plan largely has been to convince food and beverage makers, restaurants and others to make healthier products. Nationwide laws and rules are leading to healthier school breakfast and lunch programs. An updated "Nutrition Facts" label, which lists information about a food's nutritional value, will be part of thousands of packaged products before the end of the decade. The label will list the latest scientific information about the link between food and health.

## Cooking Classes

In her remarks, the first lady talked about working with supermarkets to distribute recipes and offer cooking demonstrations. She is also asking schools to develop classes that give students basic cooking skills and is asking chefs to offer affordable cooking classes in their restaurants.

Obama said research shows that eating meals cooked at home is one of the best ways families can be healthier.

Growing up, she said her mother kept a strict food budget. Her mother planned her meals weekly and shopped for groceries every Saturday.

"The question is 'How do we help families start cooking again, even if it's just one or two meals a week?'" she told the audience at the conference organized by the Partnership for a Healthier America. Participants included public health professionals, nutritionists and business leaders.

Obama is honorary chairwoman of the nonprofit organization, which was created in conjunction with "Let's Move," the program she began to fight childhood obesity. The partnership works to support the goals of Let's Move. It also works with businesses to get them to help improve the health of Americans.

It so far has more than 70 promises to participate from companies of all sizes, said Larry Soler, its CEO.

Among them was yogurt maker Dannon. The company announced Friday that it will begin reducing the amount of sugar and fat in all its products.
