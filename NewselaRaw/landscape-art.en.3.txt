WASHINGTON â€” This October, tourists have an extra reason to visit the National Mall in Washington, D.C.

The National Mall is the stretch of parks, museums and memorials that extends from the Lincoln Memorial to the U.S. Capitol building. Its nickname is "the nation's front lawn." It is called this because it is a green, open space and sits between two of the country's most important government buildings.

A new art project has just been completed at the National Mall. It is made out of dirt, sand and gravel and is spread across 6 acres of the ground. Up close, it just looks like swirls of alternating lines. From above, however, visitors can see that it is actually the face of a young man.

## See It Before It Gets Covered Up

The artwork can be seen until Oct. 31. It is called "E Pluribus Unum" and is the work of Cuban-American artist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada.

The title is taken from one of the nation's best-known mottoes. In English, "E Pluribus Unum" means "Out of many, one." It can be found on U.S. money. The motto refers to the fact that the American states are separate, but together they make a single country. It also suggests that even though Americans are different in many ways, they are also united.

## Thirty Faces Represent One

The artwork expresses the same idea. To design the face, Rodriguez-Gerada photographed 30 men of all races, ages 18 to 25. He then mixed their faces, taking pieces from each and ending up with a single picture. The face he ended up with was a mix of the 30 men. In this way, it represents the many faces of the American people.

"It's one of hundreds of millions of faces that America has," he said. "They're all us."

Rodriguez-Gerada positioned the face at an angle with one eye peering out. The effect is that no matter what angle visitors see the face from, the eye will always appear to be watching them.

"It took me a month and a half to get it right," said Rodriguez-Gerada. "It's always looking at you."

Once he knew exactly how he wanted the face to look, the next step was building it. He figured out where to place 10,000 small markers to trace the lines of the face. Picture a huge connect-the-dots drawing, with 10,000 dots spread out across 6 acres with 8 miles of string connecting them.

Next, 2,500 tons of sand and 800 tons of topsoil were added. These gave the face its color and shading.

## A Bold, Meaningful Project

The project was dreamed up by Kim Sajet, who is in charge of one of the museums along the National Mall. Sajet came up with the idea earlier this year and asked the Park Service for permission. "When they said yes, we said, 'Really?'" she recalled. She was surprised that such a bold project would be allowed in one of the nation's most famous parks.

She added that the artwork was not just beautiful, but also had an important meaning. It is about American unity. For this reason, it is a good fit for the National Mall.

Even though it took months of hard work to make "E Pluribus Unum," the artwork will only be up for one month. After that time, it will be taken down and covered over with grass.

This fact does not bother the artist. Most visitors will only see the artwork once before it disappears. For this reason, they may feel that the experience of seeing the face in person is particularly special.
