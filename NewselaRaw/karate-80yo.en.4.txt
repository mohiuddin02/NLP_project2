Helen Dugan is 80 years old. She has gray hair and wrinkles. She has 17 great-grandchildren.

Dugan has a black belt in American karate. A black belt is the highest level.

She can still break boards with her feet.

"Want to know what my grandsons say about me?" she asks. "They say, 'My grandma can beat up your dad!'"

Laugh if you want. This karate grandma is no joke.

## Champs Achievers

Dugan teaches karate to kids with special needs. The kids may have problems speaking or seeing. These kids do not have much of a chance to learn karate. Other karate classes may not accept them. Her school is called Champs Achievers.

"Helen is an amazing woman," said Angela Degnan. She has a 3-year-old son named Aiden. He learns karate at Champs. "She has dedicated her life to children with special needs. My son has special needs."

She said, "It's been a wonderful experience for him."

## Strong Body, Strong Mind

Dugan began taking karate lessons with her two sons. Her kids quit after four years. She kept practicing karate.

Karate made her body stronger. It also made her mind stronger. It gave her confidence.

As a child, Dugan also had problems. She had a hard time learning. She failed many of her classes. Dugan was creative. Yet, she could not do math. She had memory problems.

Dugan later became a nurse. She still struggles, though. She has a hard time recognizing faces, even of family and friends. It is hard for her to remember her students' faces. She takes pictures of them so she remembers.

## Forever Young

In class, children stand in a line on red-and-blue mats. Up above them hang karate belts. The belts are in 14 colors.

Dugan plans to teach as long as she can.

"Put me with the kids," she said. "They keep you young."
