MECCA, Saudi Arabia â€” Muslims from across the world poured into a sprawling tent city in the Saudi desert on Sunday. It was the start of the yearly Islamic religious journey to this holy city. It is called the hajj. But the number of the pilgrims this year has been reduced. People are worried about a virus in the area.

More than 2 million pilgrims left the city of Mecca. There were about 1 million fewer than last year. They went to a huge tent camp in Mina. It is a city about 3 miles away. In Mina, they began preparations for the hajj with a day of prayer.

The Saudi officials cut back on travel papers. They did not give as many to old people or people who had long-term illnesses. They were trying to guard against a new virus related to the SARS disease. It has killed more than 50 people in the kingdom this past year. The Saudi health minister said that no cases of the coronavirus infection have been found among pilgrims.

SARS killed hundreds in a global outbreak in 2003. It belongs to a family of viruses that most often causes the common cold.

## Mountain Of Mercy

The hajj is a central part of Islam. It is a four-day religious cleansing. It is based on how people have looked at the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad for centuries. Able-bodied Muslims must make it once in their lives.

Muslims traditionally visit the mosque where Muhammad is buried. That is in the city of Medina. They begin the hajj in Mecca at the Kaaba. It is a cube-shaped structure in the city's Grand Mosque that Muslims around the world face in prayer five times a day. Muslims circle the Kaaba counterclockwise with their hearts tilted toward it.

"Labayk Allahuma Labayk," or "Here I am, God, answering your call. Here I am," chant thousands of Muslims. Single voices become drowned in a sea of worshippers. They are all dressed in seamless white terrycloth robes and shoes. They are required to wear the outfit. It is meant to make people feel unified, equal and humble.

The pilgrims headed from Mina on Monday to the area of Mount Arafat. It is near a hill called Jabal al-Rahman, meaning Mountain of Mercy.

## Health Centers Along Journey Route

Muslims believe Muhammad gave an important lesson at Mount Arafat. He called on people to end their feuds and forget their differences. The mountain is about 12 miles east of Mecca. Muslims believe the gates of heaven are open there. Prayers are supposed to be answered at this time and place.

This year, some pilgrims are wearing masks. They were protecting themselves from the virus. It has sickened nearly 100 people, most of them in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.

There are worries of a possible outbreak among pilgrims. So Saudi authorities decided to let 20 percent fewer people come to the country for the hajj this year. Ismail bin Mohammed runs the Health Department in Mecca. He said there were eight hospitals and 24 health centers set up at points along the journey route.

The hajj also has reflected the concerns of unrest and bloodshed across the Arab world in recent years. Like the civil war in Syria which has claimed more than 100,000 lives. It has also sent millions of people fleeing across borders.

## "I Ask God ... Lift The Suffering"

"Syria is suffering and that means that the Arabs and the Muslims are also suffering," said Abdel-Karim Ahmed while in Mecca before heading to Mina. "I ask God ... to lift the suffering of the Syrian people and stop the bloodshed."

Egyptian pilgrim Essam Hassouna said he is praying for his country. It saw its worst violence in August. More than 1,000 people were killed in clashes. The Egyptian military ousted President Mohammed Morsi from power.

The hajj is an ancient practice. But there are changes. Now, people use touch screen technology to read the Quran instead of carrying the holy book.
