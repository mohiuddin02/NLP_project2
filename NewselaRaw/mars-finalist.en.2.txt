BALTIMORE — Laura Smith-Velazquez has been dreaming of going to space since the first time she looked into a telescope as an 8-year-old. She grew up watching "Star Trek" and imagined herself commanding a starship.

Every year, she tries for a shot at becoming an astronaut at NASA, the U.S. space agency, but with no luck.

But now, Smith-Velazquez's chances of getting to space may have improved. A Dutch organization called Mars One selected the 38-year-old engineer as one of 100 semi-finalists for a new kind of space mission. Mars One wants to send people to establish a permanent colony on Mars by 2025.

## In Support Of The Dream

Smith-Velazquez and her husband, 43-year-old aerospace engineer Matthew Velazquez, applied for the program together in 2013. When they signed up, the couple agreed that they would either go to Mars together or neither of them would go.

About 200,000 people signed up to be a part of the Mars One program. Smith-Velazquez made the cut, but her husband did not. Now Smith-Velazquez says she is prepared to leave him behind and her husband says he understands.

"Do you demand that you continue to have a wife on this planet, or do you let your wife do something she's always wanted to do?" he said. "You have to be supportive of that."

## Wanted: Curious, Creative Astronauts

Mars One says it is looking for astronauts who are curious, trusting and creative. They need people who are good at solving problems and bouncing back from challenges. Candidates must also be at least 18 years old and physically capable. They must go through a long sign-up process that includes writing essays, making a video and studying 40 pages of facts about Mars.

Smith-Velazquez was also interviewed by Dr. Norbert Kraft, Mars One's chief medical officer and a legend in selecting astronauts for NASA. Dr. Kraft asked Smith-Velazquez whether she would ever come back from Mars and why. She quickly answered no, "because the people you go with become your family."

Smith-Velazquez knows the Mars One team can tell she is serious about the mission. But she isn't exactly sure why she has gotten so far in the selection process. She has a pilot's license and designs parts for planes, so she is used to confined spaces and zooming through the air. Smith-Velazquez said her Cherokee Indian background and ability to get along with others might also have helped her to stand out.

Even if she makes the final cut, Smith-Velazquez knows her chances of ending up on Mars are still quite slim. Many say the Mars One mission is nothing more than a publicity stunt. The Dutch space scientist who devised it plans to pay for the project by making it into a TV show.

## Staying Alive Could Be Tricky

NASA refuses to comment on Mars One, but the scientists who are willing to talk about it say the project's timeline sounds far too short.

"To get to Mars you need rockets (and) spaceships," said John M. Logsdon, a professor at George Washington University who studies space policy. "None of that exists."

Mars' atmosphere is also dramatically different from Earth's, so oceans cannot form on its surface. Mars radiates heat away more effectively than Earth. Temperatures on Mars range from a comfortable 50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the sunshine, to 100 degrees below zero at night.

"How do you pack in enough supplies and figure out how to generate your own supplies — air, heat and oxygen — when you get there?" astrophysicist Frank Summers asked. "That's the major problem to solve."

A study by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that Mars One needs to rework some of its plans to keep settlers alive. For example, the team plans to pull water out of the soil on Mars. They also plan to grow crops that will give off oxygen. According to MIT, those plans will only work for a couple months at best.

## Location, Location, Location

Mars One admits that the mission is incredibly ambitious and will require constant efforts to prevent delays and failures. The team plans to start with a demonstration mission in 2018. That's how they will prove that they have the technology for humans to survive there.

In 2020, Mars One plans to send rover vehicles to select the best location for settlement. The rovers would also prepare the surface for the arrival of more equipment in 2022. Four-person crews are scheduled to start leaving in 2024. It will take each crew seven months just to get from Earth to Mars.

Mars One faces another big challenge — money. Mars One estimates it will cost $6 billion just to get its first crew to Mars. The team plans to raise money through sponsorships, partnerships, TV rights and individual investors. So far, Mars One has struggled to find support.

Still, Smith-Velazquez and other Mars One supporters are not giving up. Smith-Velazquez says it has taken lots of failed missions to bring space exploration to the point where it is today. In fact, she believes that all of the people who say the project will never work are making Mars One stronger because they are bringing up good points. She also says we will never get there if we do not try.

"Yeah, there's a lot of risk, but there's a lot of risk no matter what you do," she said. "I'm willing to take that risk."
