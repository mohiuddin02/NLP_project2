Smoking cigarettes can make you very sick. China is a country where many people smoke.

Beijing is the biggest city in China. Beijing just made new rules against smoking. Now, people cannot smoke in places like train stations. They also cannot smoke at work. They can still smoke in some places outside and at home.

Rule-breakers have to pay a fine. A fine is money a person pays for breaking a rule or a law.

If this happens three times, people's names will be posted on the Internet. The city has a website where rule-breakers are listed. Everyone can see who they are.

## Being Named Online Is Not Good

That might make some of those people feel bad. The government hopes that it will make everyone follow the rules.

Getting named online might not sound so bad. But it could cause a person a lot of trouble. If a person's name is online, friends and family might see it. Neighbors might see it. Some people might start to be mean to that person.

Also, people online are not always nice. The rule-breakers might start to get angry messages telling them to follow the rules.

## The Rules Are Important

One time, a woman in South Korea would not clean up after her dog. She was caught in photos that were posted online. People quickly figured out who she was. They posted her name. Many people started to be mean to her. It was so bad that she quit school.

Beijing wants people to follow the new rules. Smoking is a big problem there.

The country has the most smokers in the world. There are more than 300 million people in China who smoke. That is almost as many people as live in the whole United States.

About 740 million other people are around second-hand smoke. That is when people breathe in the smoke from other people's cigarettes.

Smoking is making many Chinese people sick. Many people in the country die because of cigarettes each year.

## Many Places Now Say "No Smoking"

Beijing started making smoking rules in 2008. That summer, the city hosted the Olympic Games. The city did not want the air to be too smokey when everyone came for the Olympics. So they made smoking rules before the games started.

Those rules created no-smoking rooms at places like restaurants. Now, all rooms at restaurants will be no-smoking.
