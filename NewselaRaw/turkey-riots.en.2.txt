ISTANBUL â€” Violent battles between police and protesters continued this week in Turkey. For nearly two weeks anti-government demonstrators have gathered in Istanbul's Taksim Square. Police tried once again to remove them on Tuesday. Officers fired tear gas into a group of around 10,000 people.

Three protesters and one policeman have been killed since the clashes began on May 28. The Turkish Medical Association believes that nearly 5,000 people have been injured.

## City On Two Continents

Istanbul is home to 13.9 million residents and is one of the largest cities in the world. It also provides a vital link between two continents. One half of Istanbul is in Europe while the other half of the city is in Asia. The city (and continents) are joined by bridges and ferries across the Bosphorus Strait. The waterway is one of the busiest on the planet. Istanbul plays a major role in global trade, transportation and communication. Turkey is also a strong ally to the U.S. and a supporter in the war on terror.

Istanbul is a very modern and Westernized city, but other parts of Turkey are less developed and more conservative. Around 99 percent of Turks have a Muslim background. But since 1928 Turkey has been a secular country, where religion is officially separated from politics.

The current leader of the Turkish government is Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Some people feel that he has tried to push religious laws onto the people. Turkey is a secular society, where religion and government are kept separate. Concern that religion is influencing the government is just one of the reasons for the continued demonstrations.

## Pulling Down A Park For A Shopping Mall

The protests started as a demonstration against the demolition of a popular park. The authorities plan to build a shopping center in its place. Gezi Park is the last piece of green land left in the center of this huge city. The park is next door to the famous Taksim Square. It has been a favorite place for many generations of Turkish people. One of the protesters held a sign that read: "What if they tried to demolish Central Park in New York to build a mall? That's happening here."

That environmental demonstration was violently evicted from the park by riot police with water cannons and tear gas. After that, the movement mushroomed in size. The demonstrators are now standing against police brutality, Erdogan's conservative policies, and the way his government is trying to control the population. The demonstrators are both young and old, and from all walks of life. Teachers, lawyers, office workers and students are all protesting together against their government.

## Violent Removal

Just after dawn on Tuesday morning, riot police once again used tear gas, water cannons and armored vehicles to force demonstrators out of the square. Government reports claimed there had been just a few injuries. Yet a doctors' association said that several hundred people were injured.

Several ambulances were seen at the scene. Online videos showed protesters panicking as they breathed in the tear gas that makes you cough and splutter.

## Secret Police Starting A Fight?

The protests had been mostly peaceful. But TV images from Tuesday showed people throwing fire bombs at police. The protesters said they hadn't seen the people who attacked the police ever before. Other photos showed the bombers holding walkie-talkies. This led to speculation that these people were government agents or undercover police. They could have been sent to the protest to deliberately provoke a fight.

Police also stormed Istanbul's central court after lawyers protested against Erdogan there. At least 44 demonstrating lawyers were arrested. The President of the Turkish Lawyers' Association, Metin Feyzioglu, told reporters that there were "terrible scenes." Thousands of lawyers came onto the streets on Wednesday to support their colleagues and protest their treatment.

## "What Should We Have Done?"

Prime Minister Erdogan defended the latest use of police force against the protests. He paid tribute to the officers and accused the demonstrators of widespread vandalism.

Erdogan promised to "pursue" the demonstrators who he described as "terrorists." No one will escape, he also threatened. "What should we have done?" the prime minister asked. "Kneeled down in front of these people and asked them to please remove their banners?"

Erdogan said the protests are organized by a foreign country to damage Turkey economically. Another government member said that they could hold a public vote to decide on the future of the park.

The U.N. and U.S. government told the Turkish authorities to respect protesters' rights. "We are concerned by any attempts to punish individuals for exercising their right to free speech," U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called for a conversation between the opposing sides to resolve the protests.
