WASHINGTON â€” Aircraft that fly without pilots and shoot missiles have been used to kill enemies of the United States in its war on terror. Such strikes have become more common since President Barack Obama entered the White House. But on Thursday, Obama announced he would limit the use of the strikes.

The unmanned airplanes are known as [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone). They can be controlled from thousands of miles away. Missiles can be fired with the touch of a button from another country. The drones have been a major part of Obama's plan to fight terrorism. But Congress and other countries have criticized the drones. Some complain innocent people have been killed by them. Others say the program is too secretive.

The president said he would still order a drone strike if a terror attack was about to take place. But the new rules will mean the U.S. military and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will not be able to use drones to kill anyone at any time in any place.

Under the old rules, anyone who was considered to be a major threat could be a target of a drone strike. Now, a drone strike will only be allowed against fighters who are planning a terror attack.

Obama made the announcement in a speech about America's battle with al-Qaida. He was speaking at the National Defense University. Al-Qaida is the terrorist group that was behind the 9/11 attack.

## Protecting The Innocent

Before a drone strike can be approved, it must be certain that no innocent people will be killed or injured, a top White House official said.

The rules for striking against foreign fighters are the same as those for striking against U.S. citizens who have joined forces with al-Qaida, the official said. On Wednesday, the White House said that drone strikes have killed four U.S. citizens. One of the victims was the 16-year-old son of a terrorist suspect.

Just because something is legal, doesn't mean "it is wise or moral" in every case, Obama said.

The new rules mean there will be fewer secret drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, an aide said. Such strikes have been common since Obama became president. However, the president still wants to be able to order the deadly attacks anywhere the White House finds a threat from al-Qaida.

Obama didn't spell out exactly why he was cutting back on drones. He inherited the program from President George W. Bush and then greatly expanded it.

Congress has had doubts about the drone program. It held a series of meetings about the targeted  killings. No other countries that are friendly with the United States have fully accepted the White House's reason for the drone strikes.

## Drones, Who Needs Them?

The reasons for the rule change may be that drone strikes are just not needed any more. The top al-Qaida leaders in Pakistan are all nearly defeated, an aide said. The war in nearby Afghanistan is winding down. The United States will not have as much  reason to fire missiles at groups of suspected fighters.

Obama mentioned this indirectly in his speech. The U.S. and its partners are set to leave Afghanistan in 2014. Obama said the United States must continue to support the troops until then. That means it will continue to take strikes against top al-Qaida targets, but also against fighters who are gathering to attack the U.S troops and their partners. "However, by the end of 2014, we will no longer have the same need for force protection," Obama said.

Many of the U.S. drone strikes have taken place in Yemen. A new pro-American government is now in power there. It is making progress against the al-Qaida fighters. U.S. officials said that is making U.S. drone strikes less needed.
