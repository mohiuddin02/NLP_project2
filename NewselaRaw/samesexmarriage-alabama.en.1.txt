BALDWIN COUNTY, Ala. — Later this year, the Supreme Court of the United States will decide whether states should be allowed to ban gay marriage, as several now do. One state that has had a ban is Alabama, but now the situation there has changed dramatically.

On Jan. 23, U.S. District Court Judge Callie Granade issued a ruling that struck down Alabama's gay marriage ban. Granade, a federal judge in the Southern District of Alabama, called the state ban unconstitutional. Her ruling was immediately challenged and her opponents asked the federal Supreme Court to postpone the order until the high court decides the issue later this year.

## Rebellion, Celebration, Boredom

On Feb. 9, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that it would not delay her order. Its decision has opened the way for gay marriage in Alabama.

The court's refusal to delay Granade's order created uproar, celebration, rebellion and, sometimes, bored shrugs throughout the state. It also split the state's judges into opposing camps.

Some judges followed the prodding of their own state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who ordered state judges not to obey Judge Granade's ruling.

Others agreed with the federal court's decision and started marrying same-sex couples in the morning.

Then, there were those judges who tried to stand in the middle as best they could, or who perhaps just hoped to stall for time.

## Slow Change Coming

"We are accepting applications for marriage but we are not processing any right now," said Judge Tim Russell in Baldwin County.

The implications of the high court's refusal to reimpose the gay marriage ban echoed across the country. For many, the decision signaled that change had finally come to the heart of the Deep South, where change has often seemed to come slowly and grudgingly.

Fifty years ago — within the memory of many Alabama residents — Governor George C. Wallace stood on the steps of Foster Auditorium to stop two black students from enrolling at the University of Alabama. He was opposing federal orders that mandated the desegregation of Alabama schools and was fulfilling his campaign promise: "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever."

Wallace's angry call of defiance defined the state for decades as a stubborn holdout against social change.

## "It's About Time"

This time, reaction included abstract discussions of constitutional law, hesitation, opposition and outbursts of relief and joy.

Ecstatic couples, some of whom had been waiting for hours, received marriage licenses in scenes similar to those in many other states that have legalized same-sex marriage.

"It's about time," said Shante Wolfe, 21. She and Tori Sisson of Tuskegee had camped out in a blue and white tent and became the first in Montgomery County to receive a marriage license.

In Birmingham, a marriage license went to Dee and Laura Bush, who have been together seven years and have five children between them.

"It is great that we were able to be part of history," Dee Bush said. After receiving the license, she and Laura walked outside to a park where a minister was performing wedding ceremonies.

## Following Orders

However, many probate judges, who are responsible for granting marriage licenses in Alabama, said they would refuse to issue same-sex marriage licenses.

"Right now we're not going to do it," Probate Judge Jerry Powell said. "We have direct orders from the state Supreme Court here in Alabama, and I'm going to adhere to it."

Susan Watson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, said probate judges risk lawsuits for refusing to issue the licenses.

"I would really think long and hard before defying a federal court order," she said.

Alabama Governor Robert Bentley was not like the former Governor George Wallace in his reaction to the news. Bentley said he was disappointed that the courts had overturned the gay marriage ban, but added that he would not take action against any judge who issued a license to same-sex couples.

"We will follow the rule of law in Alabama, and allow the issue of same-sex marriage to be worked out through the proper legal channels," Bentley said.

## "More Confusion" Ahead

State Attorney General Luther Strange echoed the governor's disappointment: "I regret the Supreme Court's decision," he said.  Without the delay on Judge Granade's order, "there will likely be more confusion in the coming months" before the federal court makes its final decision about the legality of same-sex marriage.

However, the most notable effect of the Supreme Court's action — in a state keenly aware of its past — is what did not happen.

There were few protests, and there seemed to be no disturbances in the major cities. In Birmingham, a police spokesperson said "a dozen or so" protesters stood outside the courthouse, but they did not interfere with gay couples seeking licenses.

In Montgomery, a police spokesperson answered questions about protests and arrests with the puzzled response, "Protests about what?"

Pastors across Alabama reacted in varying ways to the arrival of same-sex marriage in the state.

## Church-State Questions

At the southern end of the state, in coastal Fairhope, the Reverend Jerry Henry expressed disapproval and pondered what the changes might mean for the church.

"We don't believe the Scripture condones marriage between two people of the same gender," he said.

Beyond the immediate question of wedding ceremonies, Reverend Henry said, the judges' decisions could set up a larger clash between church and state.

"If we go against the law" by refusing to marry same-sex couples, "we could lose our tax-exempt status," he said. "There are some serious implications here."

At the other end of the state, in Huntsville, Baptist minister Ellin Jimmerson had presided over two weddings by lunchtime.

She had received no word, good or bad, from the Southern Baptist Convention, which opposes same-sex marriage, she said.

"It's been a good day," Jimmerson said.
