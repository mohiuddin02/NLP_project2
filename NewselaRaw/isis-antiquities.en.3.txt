BAGHDAD, Iraq â€” The Islamic State group has destroyed ancient monuments with bulldozers and power tools. People around the world became very angry when they saw the destruction.

But the group has also been doing something else with some ancient objects. It has quietly sold smaller items it took from Iraq and Syria. The group has made millions of dollars from the sales, experts said.

Islamic State is an extremist group. It has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Another name is Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It wants to set up its own country that would be run by Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria and some of northern and western Iraq.

## A Danger To History

The items the Islamic State group has destroyed or is selling are very old pieces that show the area's culture and history. The group has said it smashed them because they are reminders of cultures that came before Islam. The objects are from a time when people prayed to idols, or religious statues, the Islamic State group said. Idol worship is against the group's religion.

At the same time, the group has been quietly selling some of the objects.

The Islamic State group took over Mosul, Iraq a year ago. The growing business of selling ancient cultural items is a sign of how the group has become more in charge since then.

The group recently captured Syria's 2,000-year-old ruins in the ancient city of Palmyra. The ruins are all that remains of old buildings after so many years. The capture drew attention to how the group could be dangerous to the region's rich cultural history. Palmyra is said to be just one of 4,500 sites under the group's control.

"They steal everything that they can sell," said Qais Hussein Rasheed. If they cannot sell it, they destroy it, he said. Rasheed is in the Iraqi government and is in charge of items, or antiquities, from ancient times. People have been sneaking more antiquities out of Iraq to keep them safe since Mosul was captured, he said.

## World Watched The Destruction

The Islamic State group also seized the ancient city of Nineveh, Iraq, around the same time. In a video released earlier this year, the Islamic State group showed its fighters drilling off the faces of giant winged-bulls made of stone. The bulls were on the gates of the city. The fighters also recorded themselves destroying statues at Mosul's museum. However, many of those items were actually copies, Iraqi officials said. But anything real and small enough to move was probably sold or stored by the militant group, they said.

Islamic State's looting, or stealing, began when they first took over part of Syria. The activity has become more organized as the group has taken control of more land.

Iraqi officials say selling antiquities is the group's second-most-important business. The first is selling oil. The group makes many millions of dollars from the sales of the ancient items.

Rounding up and selling the items is an easy way to make money, said Michael Danti, a professor at Boston University.

Danti works with the U.S. government. He gives advice about the stolen antiquities trade from Iraq and Syria. He said some looted objects have gone to the United States and Europe. Many of them are cheaper items, such as stone seals with ancient writing on them.

## Buyer Beware

The Islamic State group will probably try to make it seem as if larger items were found legally. This can take years. The process involves making forged documents, which are fake papers about how the objects were found and sold. To be traded legally, the items must have been dug up or moved from Iraq or Syria before 1970. The United Nations is a group of nations that work together. It wrote a rule against buying and selling such items that went into effect in 1970. But the rule is not well enforced.

A lot of smaller items from Iraq and Syria are now being sold online, said Deborah Lehr. She helps run the Antiquities Coalition, a group that wants to end illegal sales of antiquities.

Lehr says people need to be educated about the problem and rules need to be enforced. People need to know that they could be funding terrorists by buying the items, she said.
