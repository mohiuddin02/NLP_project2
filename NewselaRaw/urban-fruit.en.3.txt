CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Breanne Heath saw some land that wasn't being used and wanted to do something about it. She had a big idea. She wanted to turn the land into a farm where visitors can pick their own fruit.

The site is nearly half an acre. It is located on the South Side of Chicago. Heath has turned it into a mini farm in the city. The farm, which will be called The Pie Patch, will offer fresh raspberries, cherries, rhubarb, pumpkin and other produce. It will open this summer.

Heath loves gardening and helping others in the community. She got the idea for the garden after realizing that there were no places to pick fruit near Chicago. She liked picking apples and strawberries. When she wanted them, though, she had to drive to another state. There was no place to go near Chicago.

The Pie Patch has a simple goal. It wants to get more food to more people.

## Helping Hands: The Garden And A Charity

The Pie Patch is on a plot of land owned by Su Casa Catholic Worker. Su Casa is a charity that helps women and children in Chicago. Heath and Su Casa will work together to maintain the garden. Heath will donate some of the food she grows back to Su Casa. Su Casa will use the food to feed the women and children they help.

Su Casa and Heath are using the land creatively. Before they came along, the land was just an empty plot. By working together, Heath says they are giving back to the community.

## Making Healthy Food Easy To Find

Heath does not expect to make money by running the farm. She is OK with that. There are many other reasons for starting The Pie Patch.

Heath believes that people will find value in the garden. She thinks it is important to serve a need in her community. Many people who live in the area cannot get healthy food easily.

The Pie Patch is an urban farm because it is located in a city. While there are other urban farms in Chicago, the idea is still unique. Many people are interested in local food they can pick.

## Lessons From The Ground Up

Sarah Krieger is a dietitian and nutritionist. Her job is to help people make healthy choices when they eat. She thinks the idea of a garden like The Pie Patch is great. It is educational and helps people learn about their food.

Krieger also thinks it's important for kids to learn lessons about where their food comes from. If they only see fruits and vegetables in the store, they might think these foods grow inside the grocery store. When children can get into the dirt and pick food off the vine, they will see where it really comes from.

An urban farm like The Pie Patch may help people make healthier choices. Produce is a better choice than processed or fast food.

The goal of The Pie Patch is to provide low-cost, healthy options to people who live nearby.

## Sweet Potatoes From A Peaceful Place

The Pie Patch will sell many different types of produce depending on the season: raspberries, rhubarb, grapes, strawberries, sweet potatoes, sweet pumpkin and squash. The farm will open around June.

The Pie Patch is a special place. It is peaceful. Heath hopes the farm is a place people like to visit and enjoy. It will be a nice place to explore and pick fruit.
