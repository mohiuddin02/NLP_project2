Roller Coasters may look scary. They may seem dangerous.

But injuries on Southern California amusement park rides are rare. And when they do happen, the most common ones actually are fainting, feeling sick and getting dizzy.

This comes from a report on amusement parks by the Los Angeles Times. The newspaper looked at injury reports from 57 theme parks in Southern California. In total, there were 2,089 injury reports. The reports were filed from 2007 to 2012 with the state.

The largest number of reports involved motion sickness. Those people fainted, felt sick to their stomachs or were dizzy. Back and neck pain ranked second. Head injuries came in third.

Together, the parks reported about 350 injuries a year. More than 40 million people visited the parks each year.

## Some Statistics

Other findings include:

—More women reported injuries than men. Most injuries came from roller coasters and water slides.

—Many of the injured visitors already had health problems.

—People are more likely to get hurt on older rides than on newer ones. About 1 in 8 injuries happen when riders are getting on or off a ride.

—Three men died after the rides. Two of them had serious medical conditions before going on the rides. That likely caused their deaths. The cause of the third man was unknown.

Operators of permanent theme park rides must file accident reports with the state.

One of the riders who filed a report was Adrienne Sacks of Maryland. She became sick after riding Disneyland's Space Mountain in 2012.

The 59-year-old teacher said she threw up at the park's first aid station. Eventually, she was treated by emergency care workers. "I got really violently ill, like I've never been before," Sacks said.

## Injury Reports Required

In 2000, California decided that amusement parks must report injuries and illnesses. This came after a Disneyland visitor was killed.

About 120 people filed reports about getting sick or injured on Space Mountain. That was the highest number of any ride. There was one injury on it for every 367,000 riders during the six-year period. The GhostRider roller coaster at Knott's Berry Farm came in second, with 92 reports.

Of the 10 rides with the most injury reports, nine were at Disneyland or Disney California Adventure Park. They are the region's most popular theme parks. In 2012, they had 23.7 million visitors.

To compare, one person in a thousand gets hurt in the bathroom and goes to the hospital.

Disneyland says its rides are safe.

"We are at the top of the (injury) list because we are the top of the list for attendance," said Greg Hale. He is in charge of safety for Disney's theme parks.

## Newer Rides Called Safer

In 2012, Joan Brown rode Space Mountain with her family.

When she got off the ride, she kept asking, "Where are we going?" said her husband. Later, the doctors said she had lost her memory for a short time.

Space Mountain opened in 1977. Its age may be connected to its number of injuries. Older rides seem to cause more injuries than newer ones. Of the 10 rides with the most injuries, six are at least 20 years old. Only one was built in the last 10 years.

Rides are safer than they used to be 30 or 40 years ago, said Dennis Speigel. He is president of International Theme Park Services in Ohio. The worst injures happen when rides are broken. In 2009, a cable broke on the Xcelerator roller coaster at Knot's Berry Farm in California. It ripped through the ride's car. A 12-year-old boy was hurt.

California investigated about half of the injuries. In most cases, it ordered small repairs. Or it told theme parks to give its workers extra training.

Theme parks and water parks post signs that people ride at their own risk.

Daniel D. Geoulla is a lawyer in California. He said people know they could get hurt when they ride a roller coaster.
