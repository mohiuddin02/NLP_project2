VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. — One wonders what Mark Twain himself would make of the news: The Gold Rush-era newspaper for which he once wrote stories and witticisms on frontier life as a young journalist is once again in print after a decadeslong break.

The Territorial Enterprise, once the region's premier recorder of gossip, scandal, humor and tall tales — before Nevada was even a state — is back. The newspaper, which has run out of money on several occasions, is now a traditional monthly magazine. There is also an online edition, territorialenterprise.com.

Would Twain use Twitter to complain about the sad state of the press, as he once did with pen and ink? "If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed. If you do read the newspaper, you're misinformed."

Or would he gnash his teeth at the leaders of the media today? "I am not the editor of a newspaper and shall always try to do the right thing and be good so that God will not make me one."

Even the Enterprise's new editor, Elizabeth Thompson, guesses that Samuel Clemens – Twain's real name – would have a field day.

"He'd have something to say," she said. "He'd get a kick out of it."

## All The Wild West News Fit To Print

With a daily circulation of 15,000 at its peak in the 1860s, the Enterprise was Nevada's first newspaper and the largest west of the Mississippi River. It chronicled the frenzy and financial fallout of the Comstock Lode of silver ore discovered on the eastern slope of Mount Davidson.

After the mining boom died, the paper continued to tell the story of a rough town where unwashed men settled scores with six-shooters. The original Enterprise ceased publication in 1893.

Since then, the paper has been revived numerous times, mostly notably by railroad historian Lucius Beebe, who sold it in 1961. Behind the current attempt is Scott Faughn, also publisher of the Missouri Times, which focuses on politics and policy.

## Carrying On Tradition

In its heyday, the Enterprise not only covered the news, it made news.

Reporters included William "Dan De Quille" Wright, James "Lying James" Townsend and Samuel "Mark Twain" Clemens. They "perfected the art of the Western tall tale with articles that became legendary for their wit," editors recently wrote.

Thompson said the paper aims to carry on that tradition.

The first new edition was published in March and includes news and an interview with Governor Brian Sandoval, as well as a modern version of the so-called "sagebrush humor" Twain helped make famous before he became America's favorite man of letters.

Legend has it that Twain's first-ever piece for the newspaper began: "A thunderstorm made Beranger a poet, a mother's kiss made Benjamin West a painter and a salary of $15 a week makes us a journalist."

## "Mark Twain" Origins

Clemens had traveled west from Missouri with his brother, Orion Clemens, who became secretary of the Nevada Territory before the area achieved statehood in 1864. Historians say Clemens first used the pen name "Mark Twain" while at the Enterprise.

In three years, he wrote stories about territory politicians, shoot-'em-ups and the stock market — some of which were reprinted in his 1872 book "Roughing It."

In Virginia City, reaction to the rebirth of the Enterprise has been positive.

"I'm excited about it; it tickles me," said Sandi Sweetwater, who manages a gift shop and offers tours of the newspaper's original offices one floor below.

She pointed to Twain's original desk, an in-office toilet and a spittoon. There is even an original bottle of Perry Davis' Pain Killer, from which Twain supposedly took occasional drinks.

## Matching Wits

Across the street at the Mark Twain Saloon, owner John Schafer said that even the pen name Mark Twain might have Nevada roots. While historians believe the name comes from Clemens' Mississippi riverboat days — a river man's phrase for water two fathoms deep — the bar owner says there is another theory.

"There's talk Clemens got the name Mark Twain in Virginia City saloons," he said. "The phrase comes from ordering two drinks at once and asking that they be served on credit."

Thompson has high hopes for the paper, which began with a circulation of 2,500 copies. She has spent recent months researching Twain and the time period in which he wrote and is ready to try and match, if not precisely the wit, then at least the spirit of those days, and said she thinks Twain would be pleased.

"We hope he's smiling upon this venture from either above or below," Thompson said.
