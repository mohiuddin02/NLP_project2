WASHINGTON â€” Communities in the South are starting to change. Thousands of Asian-Americans are moving from the coasts, where they have lived for generations, to the South.

Between 2000 and 2010, Asian-Americans were the fastest-growing ethnic group in the South. The Asian-American population there increased 69 percent during that period, according to numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau, the government agency that counts the country's population. By comparison, the Latino population rose 57 percent in the South.

The Asian-American population grew faster in the South than any other region of the country. The South includes 16 states from Maryland and Delaware to Florida to Texas and Oklahoma. The District of Columbia is also included as part of the region.

The average growth of the Asian-American population among the 16 states and the District of Columbia was 63 percent.

## Language Barriers Showing Up In Schools

State by state, the growth is even more striking. In some states the Asian-American population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010. In Georgia and North Carolina that population soared more than 80 percent.

The growth in certain metropolitan areas was even more dramatic, even if the Asian-American percentage of the overall population remains small.

In Atlanta, Georgia, Asian-Americans make up just 5 percent of the population, while Latinos make up 10 percent. The city's overall population grew 24 percent between 2000 and 2010. During that time, the Asian-American population increased 88 percent and the Latino population more than doubled.

The explosive growth presents several challenges for state and local governments. Language barriers are perhaps the most prominent example.

Communities in the South now have to educate students who do not speak English as a first language. There are 111 different languages spoken near one Georgia school district.

Some cities in Georgia are encouraging Asian-American-owned businesses to put up signs in English, so police will know where to go in an emergency. Public officials must translate official documents to help house refugees. Some Southern states have little experience hosting large immigrant communities.

## Other Ethnics Groups Moving South Also

An older Asian-American population is another challenge. Experts say the number of elderly Asian-Americans in the region is increasing as well. As the cheaper cost of living draws retirees, an increasing demand for elder care and health care can pose challenges.

The Asian-American newcomers could affect the South's politics. In Virginia, for example, the number of Asian-Americans that voted jumped 180 percent from 2004 to 2012. In Georgia, votes by Asian-Americans increased 168 percent.

Most new arrivals bring different viewpoints with them when they move to the South.

Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are not counted as Asians by the Census. However, they also saw a population increase of 66 percent in the South. Arkansas saw growth of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders of 151 percent from 2000 to 2010.

There are many reasons for the population shift, because so many different groups are moving. The Census Bureau tracks 23 different ethnic groups under the Asian-American umbrella. Nineteen others are counted as part of the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders population.

That variety makes pinpointing one explanation for the growth difficult. Marita Etcubanez of Asian Americans Advancing Justice says many people move to the South for job opportunities and a cheaper cost of living.

"People are willing to settle wherever opportunity is available to them," Etcubanez said.

## How A State Responds To Change

The jobs pursued can vary widely, though, Etcubanez and other experts said. For example, refugees from parts of Southeast Asia are likely to have different backgrounds and skills than a highly educated professional from India.

C.N. Le is a professor specializing in Asian &amp; Asian American Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He mentioned prominent universities in North Carolina as a draw for more educated Asian-Americans that contributed to the state's 85 percent growth, the highest in the region.

How well each state is positioned to deal with these issues and others will vary. It will depend on each state's culture, politics and history of immigration. Some, like Tennessee, have long been a destination for refugees, and might be better positioned to respond to a changing population.

"Many of these states don't have as long of history of immigration," said Chris Kromm of the Institute for Southern Studies, a civil rights advocacy group. "A lot of them are catching up, and it takes a lot more to turn the ship."

## Paying Attention To Politics

Members of political parties are already trying to take advantage of the changes and meet the demands of a new and fast-growing population. Political allegiances of Asian-American communities could be up for grabs.

Asian-Americans, like most minority voting groups, tend to vote Democratic. Those who study the community's politics believe Republicans may be able to chip away at the Democratic advantage.

There are already two high-profile Asian-American politicians in the South. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley are both Republicans who have downplayed their ethnicity.

Southern politicians need to pay attention to Asian-Americans in the future, said Janelle Wong, director of Asian American studies at the University of Maryland.

For the first time, the location of Asian-American communities will help them get political attention, she said. "That could change a lot."
