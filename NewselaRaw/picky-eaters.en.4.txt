Many children do not like eating some foods. Some do not like to eat vegetables because of the way they feel. Others do not like the taste of fish. They think it is smelly!

Scientists do not know much about picky eating. It is a problem for many parents. People used to think picky eaters were all the same. Now scientists say different children have different reasons for not liking some foods. If children do not want to eat something, maybe it is because of how they feel. Parents need to know which kind of picky eater their child is. It may help them to find ways to help picky eaters try new kinds of food.

## Let's See What They Like To Eat

Scientists decided to study a large group of children. They were between 2 and 4 years old. Half of them were choosy about what they liked to eat. The other half were not picky at all. Parents fed their family special meals designed by the scientists. Then they watched how children acted around mealtimes.

Children who were not picky ate more. They did not have a problem eating different things. Picky children acted differently before and during meals. Some even refused to come to the table. Others looked like they were not quite sure about the food. A few children even acted like they were afraid of the food.

## It's Not Really About The Taste

We all eat in different ways. For some children, a food like broccoli tastes really bad. Another child might love eating vegetables. It is impossible to change that. There are always going to be foods some children just do not like eating.

Some children do not want to eat their food for other reasons. It may not be about how something tastes. It might be about something else. Some kids do not want their foods touching on the plate. A child may be angry because mealtime takes place at the same time she is playing a game. So she gets mad and refuses to eat.

Children might need to try a food 10 times before they like it.
