WASHINGTON — National and state parks will be open for business this summer, but it won't be business as usual. Washington's steep budget cuts and fewer state dollars will result in overflowing trash cans, closed visitor centers and fewer Junior Ranger programs. Many vacationers will walk over runaway vines, wait in long lines at park entrances and miss out on campfire talks.

Visitors will feel the effects of the spending cuts at some of the nation's most revered natural and historic sites.

Almost 8,000 state parks attract more than 741 million visitors a year. Many had to cut staff and shorten hours during the recession. In states that are still struggling, those cuts have not been reversed. Meanwhile, the automatic federal budget cuts called sequestration took effect March 1. Sequestration forced the National Park Service to cut its budget 5 percent. It also trimmed 5 percent from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, which helps states fund their state parks.

Overall, sequestration will cut about $150 million from the National Park Service. Four-hundred and one national parks, monuments, battlefields, historic sites, seashores and other national sites could all be affected. The Park Service, which employs 22,000 people year-round, has put hiring on hold. It will leave 900 jobs unfilled. In a normal summer, the Park Service hires an additional 10,000 people to handle the larger crowds. But this year, it will reduce that number by 1,000. The smaller workforce will result in less frequent mowing, sand-covered bike paths, messier restrooms and fewer guides.

## Some State Parks Get Help From Donors

State parks have been tightening their belts for several years, but some are in better shape than others.

In some states, private help has made a difference. California was able to keep open all of its 280 state beaches, reserves and parks, thanks in part to more than $3 million raised by private donor groups.

Even with the private help, California's state parks must cut down on maintenance and reduce park hours. Five hundred fewer rangers, environmental scientists and other workers will be on the job, said Department of Parks and Recreation spokesman Roy Stearns.

In Washington state's 117 parks, there will be fewer workers, shorter hours and fewer guided tours, said Virginia Painter, public affairs director for the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission. Some park maintenance and repairs will have to be put off. A new entrance fee — $10 per day and $30 for an annual pass—has generated only about half of the money that was expected. The park system has had to make other reductions to meet the legislature-imposed cuts.

## "Doing Less With Less"

The conditions at national parks also will vary. At Grand Canyon National Park, for example, the visitor center will open an hour later and close an hour earlier, and fewer entrance workers will lead to longer lines at the gates. "We have said for a long time we'll continue to do more with less. We're beyond that. We're going to do less with less," park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said.

National parks in 2011 brought $13 billion in visitor spending to their nearby communities, a study found. Park tourism supported 162,400 local jobs, according to the same study.

Local businesses from the towns of Jackson and Cody, Wyoming, came to the rescue when Yellowstone National Park officials announced they would wait an extra two weeks to open two snowy park entrances. The two communities reap $334 million a year from 3.6 million Yellowstone visitors. The towns figured the two-week closure could cost them as much as $4 million in lost hotel, restaurant and other revenue. The chambers of commerce and businesses raised $175,000 for snowplowing to open the roads on time.

After snowplow savings, Yellowstone still had a $1.75 million shortfall. It met the gap with layoffs that visitors at the sprawling park probably won't notice, said spokesman Dan Hottle.

## Shorter Park Hours, Less Cleanup

Yosemite National Park is absorbing much of its $1.8 million budget cut by leaving about 20 management jobs unfilled, said park spokesman Scott Gediman. Visitor centers will close an hour earlier, at 5 p.m. Visitors will be on their own in Mariposa Grove, with no Yosemite rangers leading walks amid the towering sequoias.

And in the nation's capital, the Fourth of July will be a more muted affair on the National Mall. The popular Washington Monument concert will be canceled. The mountains of litter will take longer to collect, due to cuts in cleanup-crew overtime.

Other national parks around the country also have had to make budget-related changes: At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, a $1.2 million cut means that six buildings, including the house where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, will be closed. The Liberty Bell and Independence Hall are canceling evening visitor hours.

To deal with a $359,000 cut, the Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida and Mississippi will shut three visitor centers a few days each week and close some restrooms. Most trash cans are history, replaced by a take-out-your-own-garbage policy.

## Jobs Left Vacant

The Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky has absorbed a $324,000 cut by leaving four jobs vacant, including the park electrician. Long response times for any electric problem deep in the cave means that tours to the most remote sections will be canceled. Last year saw 28,000 visitors take the tours.

Because of a $700,000 cut, Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming has canceled Junior Ranger programs and reduced campfire programs and guided walks. Waits could be longer for medical response and backcountry searches, said spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs. As for backcountry closures, "We've already started hearing from the people who go there, people who have their beloved secret places," she said.
