IRONWOOD, Mich. — John Koski pulls back the old blanket to uncover two cows. There's not much left of them. More than half of each is picked clean. There's no trace of flesh. The bones are almost polished white. Some of the ribs are snapped.

Koski is a farmer at war with wolves. The dead cattle were the latest victims. Koski's farm is in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. In the past three years, wolves have killed or hurt 119 of his cows.

"I think this is the last year I'm going to keep cattle here because I'm losing so many," Koski said.

Michigan is going to try something new to solve the problem. It will have its first-ever wolf hunt. Not everyone in the state supports it. But many people in the city of Ironwood like the idea.

## "Wolf Problem In The Area"

Scott Erickson is the city manager. Over the last few years, Ironwood has seen growth in the number of wolves, he said.

"There's a wolf problem in the area — I think everybody understands that," he said.

David Bolen recalled his wolf story. He spotted one last fall.

"I live in a senior apartment complex by a Little League baseball field," said Bolen. "I watched a wolf come from an area we call The Caves right across the field — on Vaughn Street, right in town. It was probably 20, 30 yards from the senior apartments."

The 73-year-old has lived in the Ironwood area his entire life. "That was no coyote," he said.

Ironwood resident Al Clemens said the wolves have killed off deer in the area. Deer hunting is a popular activity. The hunt brings money to the community. In recent years, hunters at his deer camp have seen much fewer deer than they used to see, he said.

## Wolf In Native American Culture

Wolves are important to [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) culture. The Anishinaabe people tell a story about when the first man was on Earth. He had a wolf as a companion. Together, they named all the plants and creatures on Earth. When they were done, the Creator told them to travel separate paths. But the man and wolf would stay linked, the Creator said.

Roger LaBine is a leader among the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians. He says the wolf's sad-sounding howl comes from sorrow. "He wishes he still had that communication and partnership with (the tribes)," LaBine said.

Wolves were all but [extinct](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) in much of the U.S. by the 1930s. Michigan lost almost all of its wolves by the end of the 1950s.

In 1973, Congress enacted the Endangered Species Act. The wolf became a protected species that same year. The number of wolves began to grow. In 1989 there were only three wolves in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Now, the population stands at 653 wolves.

Nancy Warren works for the National Wolfwatcher Coalition. Her group is wants to save wolves from extinction. The reason wolves are back in numbers is because of the protections they were given, she explained. Warren is against the hunt.

Wolves were taken off the endangered species list in January 2012. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder last December signed a law that said wolves were a hunting species. Then the state was able to approve a hunt for November and December this year.

## Will The Hunt Solve The Problem?

John Vucetich teaches wildlife ecology at Michigan Technological University. He's not sure the hunt will solve the problem.

"These wolves are territorial, and they are going to keep other wolves away. They are like the landlords. The thing you can hope for is to train the wolves not to harm livestock in the area," he said. If wolves get shot, the pack will scatter and other wolves will come in, he added.

Biologists say there are other ways to keep farm animals safe.  Farmers can try fences, guard dogs, loud noises or flashing lights.

LaBine said the Anishinaabe have welcomed the return of their "wolf brother." He is against the wolf hunt. He says fear leads to misunderstanding of the wolf. But by respecting the wolf, people would no longer have such fear.
