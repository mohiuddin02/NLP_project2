The words are about graves and broken bones.

The poetry coming out of the Syrian war speaks of families broken apart. It tells stories of boys who fight back with rifles. It is the writing of people who struggle to live with destructive madmen and ruined cities.

## Turning Pain Into Poems

The Syrian war began in 2011. More than 200,000 people have been killed. More than 4 million others have left Syria without a home. Almost 8 million people inside Syria do not have a home. The war has become a confusing game of air strikes, attacks, and Islamic fighters. The future of Syrian President Bashar Assad is uncertain.

The Syrian writers are doctors, mothers and protesters. They all write about the suffering in their land.

Amal Kassir summons her grandmother's farm in a poem called "My Grandmother's Farm." The farm was destroyed by a cruel leader. The "tyrant" will "learn his" death.

_My grandmother knows Syria better than anyone._

_She had a farm whose dust she knew by name._

_â€¦ And the tyrant,_

_The dirt is waiting for him._

_He will learn his grave,_

_Feel the weight of the entire country on his chest._

## "Color And Scent And Sound"

Kassir is 20 years old. She is a Syrian-American student. Kassir's family left Syria in 2005. Now Kassir travels the world speaking about Syria. When Kassir reads her writing, her voice sounds both youthful and wise.

The war has "captivated all of my poetry," Kassir said. For Kassir, poetry is important because "there is color and scent and sound involved."

Years of war have at times stopped Kassir from writing. Kassir could not write for nine months because she felt "the world had betrayed us."

A poem can show what is happening with words. Khawla Dunia does this in her poem named "Sniper." The speaker describes a moment with a sniper. A sniper is a person who kills others with a rifle.

## Poem About A Sniper

_This moment which joins us:_

_your eye,_

_a bullet,_

_and me_

_It is this moment, then,_

_that unites us._

_It divides me from my dream_

_and gives you your name,_

_Sniper._

## Writers Show "A Lot Of Courage"

Syria's streets have long been filled storytellers. However, many writers suffered under President Assad. It was difficult for them to speak out against the government. Then the Arab Spring happened in 2011. People were fed up with their country's leaders. Anti-government protests swept across the Middle East.

"We Syrians had been silenced for a very long time," said Ghada Alatrash, who translates poetry from the war into English. After the Arab Spring, Alatrash saw a "new language" in writing. The writing showed "a lot of courage."

Now, many Syrians feel discouraged from years of war. They feel that their nation has been cut off by other countries and that the war does not have clear purpose.

Writing shows the terrible problems "that are taking place on the Syrian ground," said Alatrash. "Now, it's sons going off to war and not returning. It's become more real."

## Rapping Against The War

Omar Offendum is a Syrian-American hip-hop artist. His new song speaks to how mind-numbing the war has become.

_Now they say Syria's confusing_

_Can't decide which of the sides_

_They really should be choosing_

_Here's a thought:_

_How 'bout you recognize we're all losing_

Offendum waited to put out an anti-government song until people in his family escaped from Syria. "I had to hold my tongue for a long time," he said. He could not let people hear his song without his family's "blessing."
