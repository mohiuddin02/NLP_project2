NEW YORK — Until recently, Bernie Sanders' digital strategy to win over young voters played out on Twitter. His posts were taken straight from his long, speeches and videos explaining income and wealth inequality, and what kind of policies he would put in place as president.

Then the Democratic presidential candidate joined Snapchat, an app that claims to have a sizable share of America's young likely voters in its audience. His bet is that the social media platform can help him further capitalize on his advantage with younger voters.

## "What Is This?"

At first glance, Sanders seems like a strange fit for Snapchat, where users can send photos and short videos to their friends that later evaporate. "What is this Snapshot thing and why do I only get 10 seconds?" Sanders tweeted on Monday to announce his new account. He is a late adopter. His Democratic rivals, Martin O'Malley and Hillary Clinton, have been on the platform for several weeks, as has every major Republican candidate except Jeb Bush, Donald Trump and Rick Santorum.

But there is some data to indicate that, while 2016 might not be the Snapchat election, it is, at least, a natural fit for Sanders. About 37 percent of the app's 100 million daily users are between 18 and 24 years old, according to the company. After the Aug. 6 Republican debate, Snapchat said 18- to 24-year-olds were more likely to watch the platform's five-minute "live story" of the debate than watch the debate live on television. Two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-old Snapchat users are likely voters. And about one-third of all 18- to 34-year-old likely voters use the app, according to an online poll commissioned by Snapchat in October.

"Compared to other kinds of social media, Snapchat really gives a true behind-the-scenes look at campaigns and candidates," said Robert Blizzard. He is a partner at Public Opinion Strategies. "And those campaign and candidates who use Snapchat effectively have a different avenue to reaching these likely voters."

## Voters Snap It Up

Unlike network television, Snapchat's live stories cover the entire evening of the debates. They go from pre-debate rally to spin room, where reporters speak with candidates after the debate. Snapchat's live stories also offer more commentary and humor. In one scene from the live story of the Nov. 14 Democratic debate, Snapchat head of news Peter Hamby laid out what happens in the spin room. In another clip, an enthusiastic Sanders supporter repeatedly screamed "Oh my God, oh my God" after the candidate touched her hand as he left the debate.

Sanders' first story featured scenes from a Cleveland rally and short statements from the candidate. His second story showed aides taping a video to promote the upcoming announcement of his immigration plan.

In comparison, Clinton, who joined Snapchat in early August, has been praised for her amusing account. It often features throwback photos of the candidate or images mocking her Republican opponents.

## Young Voters Are Excited

Kenneth Pennington directs how the Sanders campaign uses technology to reach voters. He said Sanders is "uniquely positioned" to turn out young voters due to his early popularity with them. A national McClatchy-Marist poll released Nov. 13 found that while Clinton led Sanders 57 percent to 39 percent, Sanders led among 18- to 29-year-olds by 58 percent to 35 percent. He also had a similar advantage among 18- to 34-year-olds in the latest Bloomberg Politics national poll.

"What we're seeing in our rallies and in social media and in every metric that's out there is that young people are, many of them for the first time in their lives, getting really excited about the senator's candidacy," Pennington said. "And it's not because the senator is some cool hip guy, it's just because his ideas are really appealing to millennials."

Sanders will likely use the account to focus on issues young voters care about. Some of those issues include the high cost of college, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, and racial justice, Pennington said.

## "The Cutest Thing Ever"

Sierra Smith is a 19-year-old sophomore journalism student at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. She is just the sort of young voter the campaign hopes to reach. She was one of many fans who tweeted approval of Sanders' new Snapchat account. She called it "the cutest thing ever." In an interview, Smith said she thought the app was a good way to keep people her age informed about Sanders' campaign. She plans to vote for him in her state's primary election in March and said she probably would not go to the polls if not for him.

"I think a lot of the things that he says are things that people our age believe in, and he's the only one who's really just saying them," Smith said.

## "A Huge Difference"

To win the nomination, Sanders has to build his base of support. And, like President Barack Obama, he needs to get high numbers of young people to the voting polls. In 2008, the youth voter turnout rate in the Democratic primary nearly doubled from 2000. Obama won 60 percent of the vote and went on to win 66 percent of the youth vote in the general election. At least 2 million more 18- to 29-year-olds voted in 2008 compared with 2004, when 19 million young voters turned out.

Sanders adviser Tad Devine said that historically, campaigns have neglected young voters. But Obama did not make that mistake and neither will Sanders, Devine said.

"We believe that these young people who are now supporting him in very large numbers can be persuaded to participate in large numbers as well," Devine said. "And that can make a huge difference in terms of the outcome."
