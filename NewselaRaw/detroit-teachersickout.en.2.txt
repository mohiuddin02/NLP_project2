More than 85 of Detroit, Michigan's 100 public schools were closed Wednesday as teachers staged a sickout. A sickout is a form of protest in which many employees call in sick at the same time. Teachers are allowed a certain number of sick days each year.

The teachers said they were protesting overcrowded classrooms and crumbling buildings.

Teachers say they are fed up with working in schools that are not fit for them or their students. Classrooms are plagued by rats, cockroaches and mold. Ceilings are full of holes and classrooms are often unheated even on cold days. Teachers say they do not have textbooks or other supplies they need to teach. On top of everything else they have not had a raise in 10 years.

"We felt it was time to take a stand. No more. Enough is enough," said teacher Marietta Elliott. "We need better working environments for our students to be educated in. We need supplies to be able to adequately educate them." Teachers also want fair pay for the work they do, she added.

## Protest Closed Most Schools

Ann Mitchell runs a local teachers group, the Detroit Federation of Teachers. She said that some Detroit teachers have 45 kids in a class. A class that size is around two times the national average.

Wednesday's teacher sickout was the largest in a series of sickouts this month. It was the second to close most of the schools in the 46,000-student system.

Elliott said the protest was planned by a group called Detroit Public School Teachers Fight Back. 

One of the teachers' key demands is a return to local control over the school system. For the last six years, Detroit's public schools have been under the control of a series of state emergency managers.

Outside managers were brought in by the state government because the city's school system was said to be failing. Teachers claim they have done nothing to help.

## "From Bad To Worse"

Every year and with each new emergency manager, "things have just gone from bad to worse," said Mitchell. "The schools are just totally neglected."

The schools' current emergency manager is Darnell Earley. He has been criticized for his previous term as emergency manager of Flint, Michigan, from 2013 until January 2015\. It was during that period that Flint began using the Flint River as its drinking water source. The result of that move was elevated lead levels in drinking water and a public health crisis.

Earley claims he was not to blame for Flint's crisis. He says the decision to switch water sources was made before he took over in Flint.

Teachers were angered by comments Earley made after a Jan. 11 sickout that closed 64 schools. Earley claimed the tactic is unfair and unprincipled because teachers are depriving students of a school day to win something for themselves.

## Governor, Mayor Respond

Hearing Earley call the sickouts unfair was just too much to take, said teacher Vanessa Dawson. Just look at what "he's done in Flint and the condition of our schools," she said.

Dawson admitted the sickout was extreme, but said it was absolutely necessary. "At this point someone had to hear what we were saying."

The teachers' Jan. 11 sickout drew national media attention and responses from state and local lawmakers. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan toured several schools and declared that conditions in some of them "break your heart." The mayor said city officials will inspect every building by April. Duggan also set up a way for parents, teachers and students to report unsafe and unhealthy conditions in schools.

State lawmakers are working on ways to help solve the Detroit school system's problems. Next week new state legislation will be introduced which, if it passes, would split the school district into two. The current school system would be in charge of paying off debt. At the same time a new district would actually operate the schools. It would be run by a school board whose members would be appointed by the governor and the mayor.

During his State of the State address Tuesday night, Governor Rick Snyder urged lawmakers to act quickly to help fix schools. "The Detroit Public Schools are in a crisis," he said. "Too many schools are failing at their central task."
