FORT WORTH, Texas — Fleeing poverty in Kentucky, Rose Will Monroe piled her son and daughter into a bus in 1942. It was not long after her husband had been killed in a car wreck.

Monroe was determined to find work at the Willow Run airplane plant in Ypsilanti, Mich. She wanted to fly planes, but with two kids, the military kept the 22-year-old widow on the ground.

So Monroe, a "tomboy" daughter of a carpenter, went to work at Willow Run. She wielded a 6.8-pound rivet hammer on the mammoth assembly line there and drove rivets into B-24 bombers to hold them together.

Monroe was just one of 6 million American women who entered the workforce during World War II, about half of them in the defense industry. But she came to represent them all. Monroe became "Rosie the Riveter," the image of the tough, hardworking American woman who helped win the war.

## From Song To Factory Floor

Vicki Croston of Conroe, Texas, Monroe's surviving child, who was born in 1954, now tells her mother's story. And on March 20 in Fort Worth, Texas, she spoke to a roomful of modern "Rosie the Riveters."

Fort Worth is a long way from Ypsilanti, where Monroe and her co-workers built 8,685 bombers, or one about every 56 minutes during the war. But "Rosies" in Fort Worth helped perform a similar feat. They built 1,803 planes at Consolidated Vultee Aircraft's bomber plant, now owned by Lockheed Martin Corp.

About 30,000 people worked in the plant during the war, but Lockheed Martin officials aren't sure how many were women.

"Rosie the Riveter" was actually a combination of the experiences of many women. "Rosie" was first popularized by a song, and she soon came to represent all women working in defense jobs. "There were quite a few faces of Rosie," said Croston, who spoke in honor of Women's History Month at Lockheed Martin.

Geraldine Hoff Doyle was the strong-armed model for the "We Can Do It" poster produced by  Westinghouse Electric Corp. Doyle, a cellist, worked only a few weeks in a defense plant, until she realized how easily it could damage her hands, Croston said.

The striking poster was little-known during the war, but rose to prominence in the early 1980s as a symbol of women seeking empowerment and equal pay with men.

## The War Effort

The best-known "Rosie" was Monroe, who starred in a series of promotional films designed to raise money for the war effort, after she was discovered in 1944 by the actor Walter Pidgeon, who visited Willow Run to shoot part of a film. When he learned that there really was a riveter named Rose on the job, he made her a showpiece of his films.

"She had the right name, the right job and was in the right place at the right time. You can't plan that," Croston said.

There was nothing glamorous, though, about the hard work during the two years she worked at the plant. During the week, her son and daughter stayed at a co-worker's home and she lived in workers' housing at the plant.

After going back home, she had a variety of jobs before she became a home builder in southern Indiana.

She also lived out her dream to fly in 1972, when she got her pilot's license and taught her daughter to fly.

Monroe's story is inspiring for today's "Rosies" at Lockheed Martin, said Gayle Roland, a senior manager there. "They were so willing to pitch in and help. That patriotism is so amazing," Roland said. "That strong human will to support the war effort is beyond anything that I can fathom."

## Professional, And Personal, Connections

The "Rosies" also pioneered the path for women in defense industry jobs. Today, 2,667 women are part of Lockheed Martin's workforce of 12,500 in west Fort Worth, said Ken Ross, a company spokesman.

Among them are Lorraine Martin, the F-35 program manager in Fort Worth, and Janet Nash, vice president for F-35 production. Another woman, Marillyn Hewson,  took over as CEO of the Bethesda, Md.-based company last year.

"The work they did was incredible. Can you imagine holding that 6.8-pound rivet hammer for eight hours?" said Nash, noting that a modern rivet hammer weighs 2.5 pounds.

For Nash, the connection to women like Monroe isn't just professional — it's personal.

Nash's grandmother was a "Rosie," who filed metal burrs off parts in a defense plant.

"Those 'Rosies,' when they went home, they were tired," said Nash. She has risen through the ranks at Lockheed since starting as an engineer 32 years ago, and is one of 12 female vice presidents. She supervises about 2,000 people who work on the plant's more than mile-long F-35 production line.

"Women's roles in aerospace have changed a lot since I started. I was the first female production vice president in this company," said Nash. "You hold a responsibility when you are the first of something to make sure you do the right things."
