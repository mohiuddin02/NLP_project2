RIO DE JANEIRO â€” A green boat cut through polluted waters in Brazil. It sailed in Rio de Janeiro's Guanabara Bay on Monday. Alongside it were local fishing boats. But instead of grouper and swordfish, this green boat caught plastic bags, soda bottles and an old toilet seat.

The green boat is one of three so-called "eco-boats." These are floating garbage ships. They are a key part of the plan to clean up Rio's Guanabara Bay. Authorities promised it will be clean in time for the bay and other Rio waterways to host events during the 2016 Olympic Games. But some people say the boats don't do enough to deal with the more important problem of sewage.

There isn't much in the way of trash and sewage services in Rio. And this is a huge city of 6 million people. Tons of garbage and raw waste flow down its rivers daily. They empty into the bay, where Olympic and Paralympic sailing events will be held.

At low tide, you can see mountains of household trash. There are old sofas and even washing machines.

## Water Safe For Sailing?

The Associated Press looked at more than 10 years of government tests on waterways. In all of them, fecal bacterial pollution levels were far above those considered safe by Brazilian or U.S. law.

Nearly all the beaches on the large bay were abandoned by swimmers long ago. Some health experts warn of risks to athletes who come into contact with the water. Expert sailors have warned about high-speed crashes. They worry that floating trash could damage or even sink sailboats during the Olympics.

Water pollution made headlines in Brazil's local press recently. Thick patches of brown foam appeared along the city's most popular beaches. Beaches like Copacabana are overwhelmed with holiday visitors during their summer, which happens at the same time as winter in the U.S.

The beaches have been flooded with trash. Much of it is just floating in water only a few feet from the sand.

That's where authorities hope the eco-boats will make a difference. The boats are rectangular ships made of steel and fitted with powerful speedboat motors. They have a net that traps garbage floating up to 18 inches below the water's surface. It captures everything from household trash to bigger items like abandoned television sets and refrigerators. The trash is dumped into the boat, where recyclables are sorted out.

The boats don't deal with sewage. But authorities insist they'll make a big dent in the overall pollution.

## A Call For "Eco-Barriers"

The goal is to "not to have floating garbage in Guanabara Bay," said Gelson Serva. He heads the state government's bay cleanup program. The program is an $840 million project that includes efforts to expand the city's sewage treatment system, which is already under pressure. Only 30 percent of Rio's sewage is treated. The rest flows into area rivers, the bay, local lagoons and its world-famous beaches.

"Those who live around the bay can already notice a difference over the past two years," Serva said. Behind him, the net clanked as it dumped garbage into the ship.

Three mid-sized boats rented from a local company began operating on Friday. They weigh 4 tons and have the capacity to hold 37 square feet (3.5 square meters) of trash. Each boat costs $842 a day to operate. This includes fuel and a three-person crew consisting of two sailors and a garbage collector. Serva said six small boats and one large barge will join them by March.

Mario Moscatelli is a scientist and outspoken environmentalist. He said that the eco-boats are a positive step in the right direction, but are too little, too late.

"At this point, for the patient that is Guanabara Bay, over-the-counter medicines won't do," he said. What's needed now are more extreme treatments, he believes.

Moscatelli said heavyweight "eco-barriers" should be put in place at the major rivers flowing into the bay to keep out the garbage at the source. The "eco-barriers" already being used on some rivers are too weak and allow most of the trash through, he said.

"This sort of manual collection is great for photos," he said of the boats that are now gathering trash. "But it doesn't even begin to address the root of the problem."
