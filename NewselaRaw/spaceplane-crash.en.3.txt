LOS ANGELES — A plane headed to the edge of space crashed during a test on Friday and broke into several pieces. One test pilot was killed and another was injured.

The vehicle, SpaceShipTwo, is not owned by the United States or any other government. It is owned by a company called Virgin Galactic. The company, started by a British billionaire named Richard Branson, has been working for almost 10 years to send ordinary people on short trips to the edge of space.

"Space is hard and today was a tough day," said George Whitesides, the head of Virgin Galactic.

Two pilots were aboard SpaceShipTwo. Police said two people were found near the crash in the desert north of California City and east of Mojave. One of the pilots had parachuted out of the aircraft. The other was located at the scene.

## Rocket-Powered Test Flight

SpaceShipTwo was carried by the WhiteKnightTwo aircraft. WhiteKnight Two landed safely.

Police said the crash site was spread over a 2- to 3-mile area.

Friday's test was Virgin's first rocket-powered test flight in nine months. A company called Scaled Composites helped organize the test flight in partnership with Virgin Galactic. A leader at Scaled Composites said the flight was using a new fuel type that had been tested on the ground. In January, SpaceShipTwo reached 71,000 feet. It was the highest altitude the plane had ever reached.

The crash was the second disaster in the space industry in a week. On Tuesday night, a rocket exploded just seconds after it launched in Virginia. It was carrying supplies to the space station. Nobody was on the rocket and no one was injured in that explosion.

Virgin Galactic's plans have been repeatedly delayed. Branson said earlier this month that it was close to going to space. He did not say when that would happen.

## A 90-Second Pause

Stuart Witt is in charge of Mojave Space and Air Port, where Virgin had its testing. He said he did not see an explosion or hear anything unusual.

"If there was a huge explosion, I didn't hear it," Witt said. A 90-second pause led him to think something had gone wrong, he said.

"It's when I wasn't hearing anything that I became concerned," he said.

WhiteKnightTwo is supposed to carry SpaceShipTwo to 50,000 feet. There the spaceship separates and blasts off. Virgin has said that the rocket motor will power the spaceship to nearly 2,500 miles per hour (mph). The plane is supposed to take the pilot — and up to six passengers — to the edge of space, or more than 60 miles above the Earth's surface.

Passengers would feel weightless at that altitude. They would see the curve of the Earth. Then the spaceship would re-enter the atmosphere and glide back to a runway. The company planned to charge $250,000 for the experience.

## "It's Dangerous, It's Risky"

Virgin Galactic said people have given them more than $80 million for about 700 reservations for the ride. Stars like Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Leonardo DiCaprio bought tickets. So did Jim Clash, a writer and resident of New York City. He reserved his ticket four years ago and says he still wants to take the trip.

"It's rocket science. It's dangerous, it's risky, it's complicated. Most of us who bought tickets know that," he said.

Marco Caceres works for the Teal Group. His company looks at aerospace and defense companies to determine whether they are valuable. He said that having two crashes in a week could make it harder to get people to be excited about the company. They might not want to buy tickets for a ride that could be deadly.

Any time a person dies, it sends the message of how dangerous these ventures are, Caceres said. Virgin will now have a harder time attracting customers, he said. Virgin's space plane had looked safer than a rocket to the public, he said.

"People will now realize this is space travel," Caceres said, "and you're getting into a rocket."

Friday's accident was not the first for the program. In 2007, during a test of the spaceship's rocket system, an explosion at the Mojave Desert airport killed three workers and injured three others.
