Companies that make airplanes are changing the way they do things: They no longer build wings and jet bodies out of metal. Instead, they build them out of carbon-fiber composites. This lightweight material is made from a blend of carbon and plastic. Just like cloth, it is woven together.

One thing is hard to find, though: good tools to cut and shape the new material.

Now, a Washington engineering firm called Electroimpact says it has built a better tool. It says its new machine can handle carbon-fiber composites better than anything else out there.

The new invention is known as an automated fiber placement, or AFP, machine. What makes it special is its round robotic head. This has many spools of half-inch carbon-fiber ribbon attached to it. It can move around any shape very exactly. And it works at very, very fast speeds.

## How It Works

First, a laser measures the surface the fiber is to be laid on. Next, a computer works out a series of instructions. These guide the machine as it tailors the fiber.

Then, the head starts moving back and forth. As it moves, it lays down strips of fiber. The surface the strips are laid on rotates as needed.

The machine can reach an amazing top speed: 595 pounds of carbon fiber laid down per hour.

That is "a very large number. ... probably the fastest we've seen," said journalist Jeff Sloan. Typically, a speed of 90 pounds per hour would be fast, he said.

Bill Hasenjaeger works for a company called CGTech. His company developed the computer software that guides the new machine. He claims perfection is more important than speed. If the new machine can do the work perfectly, he said, 595 pounds per hour is "a pretty darned impressive number."

## Making Wings Next?

Ben Hempstead is chief of staff at Electroimpact. He insists no one can match the company's AFP machine.

"You won't see this anywhere else on the planet," he said.

Todd Rudberg is Electroimpact's project manager. He would like to see the company's AFP machines used to make wing skins and wing spars. Spars are two long beams that run the length of a wing. One is in the front of the wing; the other is in the rear. Each is more than 100 feet long.

The Electroimpact machine could make each of those spars as a single piece, Rudberg said. They would be an "uninterrupted beautiful structure."

The AFP machine used in a recent demonstration is Electroimpact's smallest model. It costs $5 million. The company has built bigger models that cost up to $25 million.

## Secret Projects

Electroimpact is already making equipment for all the world's major plane makers, like Boeing and Airbus. Some of the projects are secret.

Peter Zieve is Electroimpact's founder and boss. He said he hopes to add two big new buildings to the six the company already has. He plans to empty out the largest of the old ones. That way, it can be "filled with a huge Boeing project."

He wouldn't say which project.
