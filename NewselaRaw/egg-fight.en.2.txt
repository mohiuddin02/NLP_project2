WASHINGTON — California is being sued in court because of its ban on the sale of eggs from hens kept in cramped cages. Six states are suing California in a case that could affect farmers and shoppers nationwide.

Alabama, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma argue that the law forces farmers in other states to make expensive changes, like buying new cages and barns. They think this goes against the part of the U.S. Constitution that allows for free trade between states.

"We don't want a trade war in America but we think that California is dead wrong on this," said Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. Iowa is the country's top egg-producing state.

"In Alabama, consumers are free to make their own choice of which eggs to buy at their grocery stores." Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said. It is "wrong for California to tell Alabama how we must produce eggs. If California can get away with this, it won't be long before the environmentalists in California tell us how we must build cars, grow crops, and raise cattle, too."

## Smaller Than A Sheet Of Paper

California voters approved a law in 2008 that prohibited the state's farmers from confining hens. Now hens must be able to turn around freely, lie down, stand up and fully extend their limbs. That law just applied to California farmers.

Two years later, California lawmakers passed another law. This one banned the sale of eggs produced by hens in small cages from any state. It was passed after it become clear that the ban would cost California farmers more than farmers in other states. The ban goes into effect Jan. 1, 2015.

The tiny cages most hens live in are called "battery" cages. Battery cages give each hen an average of only 67 square inches of floor space. That's smaller than an 8x10 sheet of paper.

About 95 percent of eggs in the U.S. are produced in battery cages. Farmers put hens inside battery cages in the 1950s as a way to reduce disease. They also wanted to produce a cleaner egg. Barnyard chickens used to peck in filth. But animal welfare supporters have long said that battery cages are cruel. They say hens kept in battery cages are unable to behave naturally.

## Two Sides Of The Debate

The European Union banned battery cages in 1999, and gave farmers 12 years to follow the new law.

"What farmers and ranchers need to recognize is that consumers are demanding higher animal welfare," said Joe Maxwell. He is a farmer and also vice president of the Humane Society, an animal-rights group.

Some people are willing to pay higher prices for eggs if they know the hens were well treated, Maxwell said.

On the other side of the debate is Blake Hurst, also a farmer, and president of the Missouri Farm Bureau. He said he worries about people who may care about animal welfare but can't afford to pay a higher price for eggs.

"That's the person who doesn't get a voice," he said.

Missouri farmers export one-third of their eggs to California. Now they must decide if they are going to spend more than $120 million on new henhouses to follow California's law. The alternative is to stop selling to the largest egg market in the country, said Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster.

## Some Follow California's Lead

The lawsuit is the second one brought by the states. On Oct. 6, a court threw out the states' first lawsuit. The judge said the law affects only some farmers — those who are not planning to follow California's law. Now the states are fighting that ruling in court.

Meanwhile, some other states are following California's lead. Michigan, Oregon and Washington have passed laws mandating more space for hens, and Ohio has banned the construction of new battery cages. Lawmakers in New York and Massachusetts also have considered laws.

While the six-state appeal makes its way through the court, egg producers around the country are scrambling to meet California's rules by Jan. 1. The 2010 law did not say what size or type of cage is acceptable, which has led to confusion. Many in the industry believe the EU standard of 116 square inches per hen is about right. It gives each hen space slightly smaller than a sheet of legal paper, which is 8.5x14 inches.

"We're in new territory," said Dermot Hayes. He is an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. Hayes estimates that 40 percent of the laying hens in Iowa will be killed, to make room in henhouses for the larger cages.

"Egg prices will go up everywhere — California, too, for a while," Hayes predicted. Then, egg producers will build new henhouses and barns, produce more eggs, and prices will settle down.
