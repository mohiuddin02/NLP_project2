CONAKRY, Guinea — The country of Guinea is in West Africa. For the past two years it has had a terrible problem. Many people there have gotten sick with a disease called Ebola. Thousands have died.

Ebola spreads from person to person. Many who catch it die very quickly. About half get better.

Doctors from around the world have been working hard to stop Ebola from spreading. Their hard work has paid off. 

On Tuesday, doctors said Guinea is now free of Ebola. No one has gotten sick with Ebola in the last six weeks.

## Where Disease Started To Spread

The Ebola outbreak began in Guinea in December 2013. Then it quickly spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Both countries are right next to Guinea. 

The outbreak was the deadliest Ebola outbreak ever. More than 11,300 people have died.

Now, things are finally getting better. 

Sierra Leone has been free of Ebola since Nov. 7. Liberia probably is, too. Doctors just want to wait a little longer to be sure.

## More People Still Could Get Sick

Doctors say Ebola could return, though.

"We definitely cannot let our guard down," said Dr. Tom Frieden. "It's certainly possible we will have more cases," he said.

On Tuesday, about 50 people who beat Ebola gathered in the Guinean city of Conakry. They were joined by the families of some who died. Reporters were there as well.

"Guinea is a blessed country," said Ibrahima Sow, who beat Ebola. Sow said he hopes Ebola never strikes the country again. 

Mariam Camara started crying. She said the country had lost some of its best people to Ebola. Camara's mother and brother both died. The two were among more than 2,500 people who died in Guinea.

Ebola took away "that which is most beautiful to me in my life," she said. "But it's over."

## Country Will Have A Big Party

People across the country are very happy Ebola has been beaten. Guinea will hold a big party Wednesday. Popular West African music stars such as Youssou N'Dour and Tiken Jah Fakoly will play.

The problem may not be completely over, though. 

Doctors warn there could still be animals with Ebola. If so, people could catch it from them. Then, Ebola could spread from person to person again.

Doctors are working hard to stop that from happening. They are making sure Guinea has ways to quickly spot Ebola before it spreads.
