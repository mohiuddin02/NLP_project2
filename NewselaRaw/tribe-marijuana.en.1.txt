TOPPENISH, Wash. — The Yakama Nation sits in the fertile heart of illegal marijuana country.

The soil is rich and the growing season is long. The biggest illegal pot grow in state history was seized here on sacred forested acres where the tribe hunts and gathers food in the shadow of Mount Adams.

A year has passed since Washington state legalized recreational marijuana use. Previously, people could only use marijuana for medical reasons. State officials are about to issue licenses to grow, process and sell what once was illegal.

The Yakama, after battling substance abuse on their reservation, want no part of what will be one of the first legal recreational pot markets in America.

## A Warning Issued

Which is why George Colby stepped up to the microphone during a loud autumn meeting of the state Liquor Control Board. He issued a stern warning to state officials and those who want to start businesses growing marijuana.

The mild-mannered attorney said, "I'm here to tell you that if you want to spend half a million dollars on growing marijuana in central Washington, I suggest you don't do that." His 10,000 clients own 14 million acres east of the Cascade Mountains.

"The Yakama Nation will come after you," Colby promised the crowd. "And under our treaty, all we have to do is pick up the phone and call the federal government and tell you to get off of our land."

Local governments throughout Washington have considered measures to keep recreational marijuana out, after voters passed Initiative 502. An initiative, which is a proposal that goes to the voters, passed 56 percent to 44 percent last year. It legalized pot and thrust the Evergreen State into uncharted territory.

The tribe is ruled by a 158-year-old treaty prohibiting hard alcohol within its boundaries. It runs one of the few casinos in America where no alcohol is served. Yet the harsh toll of drug and alcohol abuse scars nearly every family on the reservation, from Yakama Chairman Harry Smiskin's on down.

"We do not want our people, or anyone else, to use, grow or sell marijuana on our lands," Smiskin wrote in a recent opinion article on the seattlepi.com website. "We have had a long and unpleasant history with marijuana — just as we have had with alcohol. We fight them both on our lands."

## Treaty Rules Entire Area

Concern about substance abuse dates from at least the 19th century, when the Yakama signed the Treaty of 1855. Today, the treaty is the tribe's sole governing document. Protecting the Yakama's interests, it is celebrated every summer with two parades, a powwow, a rodeo and a royal court.

Under the agreement, the Yakama reservation consists of just over a million acres; the tribe ceded more than 12 million acres to the federal government but retained the right to fish, hunt and gather traditional foods there.

The treaty, which rules the entire area, includes a ban on hard alcohol and no liquor stores exist within the reservation's boundaries.  The Yakama Law and Order Code and federal law bans marijuana.

Applicants have filled out the paperwork for marijuana production facilities and processing plants in Toppenish and Wapato. Applications also have been filed for pot operations just outside the border of the Yakama reservation in the tiny towns of Granger, Mabton and Zillah.

Colby said the tribe will be filing about 200 objections in 10 counties, both on its reservation and on the ceded land. "The citizens of the state of Washington don't have the right to vote on what happens on tribal land," he said.

Every summer, Brian Frederickson soars above the reservation in a federal Drug Enforcement Administration helicopter.

A lieutenant with the Yakama Nation tribal police force, Frederickson is one of the most skilled "spotters" in a task force aimed at getting rid of illegal pot statewide. Each year the team has been more successful. But each year the job has become more difficult, as growers with ties to Mexico go to greater lengths to hide their efforts.

"This is the different planting style they're using now," the burly lieutenant said as his computer screen filled with an aerial photograph showing a thick canopy of pine trees and a few pot plants peeking out beneath them. "In this grow they put a lot of effort into it. All the drip irrigation line was buried. You couldn't see it from the air."

## "More Damage To Our People"

Like most in and around the reservation, Frederickson said he opposed legalizing a substance he has worked so hard to get rid of.

"Alcohol has such an impact here," said Frederickson. "I don't see how anyone can logically think marijuana won't have an impact. We went from one substance that's legal. Now we have two to deal with."

Eleanor Davis had a personal reason to vote against Initiative 502. A tribal elder, she spent 20 years at the Youth Treatment Center here, counseling young men and women with substance abuse problems.

Davis, 67, comes from "five or six generations of alcoholism." Sadly, she said, it's easier to tally her sober family members than the ones who are still struggling. Then there are those she's lost — a list that includes the 23-year-old daughter, who died of alcohol poisoning, and it includes her dead daughter's 21-year-old boy.

The 21-year-old grandson, whose Indian name was Kush-a,  got drunk and got behind the wheel of his car after a party. He has been gone for five years now, and a small white cross marks the place on the highway where he died.

Davis, who has been sober for 27 years, remembered what her grandmother said after he passed away. "You have to go out in the community, and you have to let people know," she said. By that, she meant warning people about alcohol, and now, about marijuana, because it will be as easy to buy a joint as a six-pack.

 "It's just going to create more damage to our people," she said. "And they just don't need that."
