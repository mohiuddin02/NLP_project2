ISLAMABAD, Pakistan â€” Pakistan's army said Friday that it has arrested 10 fighters suspected of involvement in the 2012 attack on teenage activist Malala Yousafzai, a famous advocate for gender equality. Malala won worldwide acclaim after she was shot in the head by the Taliban for fighting to educate women.

Army spokesman General Asim Saleem Bajwa said the captured men attacked Malala, who was 15 years old at the time. They were acting on orders from Mullah Fazlullah, the head of the Pakistani Taliban. The Pakistani army is currently fighting the extremist group in North Waziristan, a tribal region along the border with Afghanistan. The area has long been a stronghold for the extremist fighters.

"The entire gang involved in the murder attempt ... has been busted," Bajwa said, adding that the "terrorists" were part of Tehrik-e-Taliban, a larger group made up of several violent terror organizations from across the tribal areas.

## Girls' Education Was Controversial

Malala, a precocious teenage activist, had called for expanding girls' education in deeply conservative areas of Pakistan. Her views were considered to be very controversial to those who believe women should stay at home. Many of the Islamic extremists in Pakistan view girls' education as an evil imported from the West.

Because of her views, she was shot in the head in October 2012 while returning from school. Two other girls were also wounded in the attack.

Malala was initially treated in Pakistan, but was later flown to a hospital in Britain, where she now lives with her family.

"This is good news for our family and most importantly, for the people of Pakistan and the civilized world. This first step of apprehending Malala's attackers signifies the beginning of real hope for the hundreds of thousands of people whose lives have been affected by terrorism," Malala's father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, said in a statement.

## On The Run

Malala is from the northwestern Swat Valley of Parkistan. The area was once also home to Mullah Fazlullah, the head of the Pakistani Taliban. Fazlullah became the Taliban leader after the previous leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone attack in North Waziristan.

Fazlullah has been on the run since 2009, when Pakistan started attacking the Swat Valley to kill the fighters. The Taliban fighters were trying to overthrow the government and impose an extreme version of Islamic law.

Pakistan believes Fazlullah is hiding in Afghanistan, and Bajwa said Pakistan's government had raised the issue with the Afghan government. Both Pakistan and Afghanistan have long accused each other of ignoring fighters who launch cross-border attacks from their territory.

## Attack On Airport Shocked The Nation

"We will continue our efforts until (Fazlullah) is arrested or killed," Bajwa told a televised news conference in the militarized city of Rawalpindi.

He did not say when or where the men were captured, but said security agencies captured all 10 in a coordinated operation acting on information from one of the members of the group. He said the head of the group had also been arrested.

"The group acted upon the instructions of Mullah Fazlullah who, while based in Kunar, Afghanistan, passed instructions through his two associates," he said. He added that it was a "known fact" that Fazlullah and other "terrorists" are hiding in Afghanistan.

The arrests come at a time when Pakistan's military is carrying out a major attack against Taliban fighters in North Waziristan. Pakistan launched the June 15 operation after the fighters attacked one of the country's busiest airports, in the southern city of Karachi, shocking the nation.

The military says it has so far killed at least 975 fighters and that the operation is progressing as planned.
