When she was 4, Doris Pilkington Garimara was taken from her home by the Australian government by force and sent to a lonely settlement. There, she grew up believing she had been abandoned and forgotten by her mother.

Decades passed before she learned the full story. It would not only answer painful questions about her past but help Australians understand one of the ugliest chapters of their history.

Pilkington Garimara and her mother belonged to "the stolen generations." These are the estimated 100,000 children of mixed aboriginal and white parents who by government law were snatched from their homes and reared in lonely settlements. The aboriginals are the native people of Australia and had lived there long before the British settled the Australian continent.

The white Australian government thought that the aboriginal culture and traditions were inferior. By separating lighter-skinned aboriginal children from their darker-skinned family members, the government tried to erase their aboriginal identity and raise them as white.

## "Previously Hidden History"

The forced removals occurred through most of the last century, ending only in the 1970s. But they were kept hidden far longer. This was in part because the aboriginal children accepted what the government told them, that aboriginal people were dirty and evil.

"I actually despised my own traditional culture because we were taught to," Pilkington Garimara once said. "I was taught to deny my own people."

But Pilkington Garimara eventually reclaimed her heritage. She told the moving tale of her mother's escape from the government camp and 1,000-mile walk home in her 1996 book "Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence."

Pilkington Garimara was believed to be 76 when she died of cancer April 10 in Perth, Australia.

"She helped Australians understand and come to terms with our previously hidden history," said film director Phillip Noyce. In 2002, Noyce, who was born and raised in Australia, made a highly praised movie based on Pilkington Garimara's book. In part because of the movie, the Australian government formally apologized to the aboriginal  community in 2008.

For Pilkington Garimara, the story began in 1931, when government agents seized her mother, Molly, her mother's sister, Daisy, and a cousin from their home in the tiny town of Jigalong. The girls were sent to the Moore River Settlement 1,000 miles away.

At the camp there were bars on the windows, locks on the doors and buckets for toilets. Anyone who tried to run away was beaten.

## Fleeing The Camp

After one night, Molly persuaded the other two girls to escape with her. Pretending they were going to the edge of the camp to empty their toilet buckets, they fled when no one was looking.

Chased by trackers, they headed toward a fence built in the early 1900s to protect farmland from rabbits. This "rabbit-proof fence" ran the length of the continent.

They greeted this fence, Pilkington Garimara wrote, "like a long-lost friend ... a beacon that would lead them out of the rugged wilderness across a strange country to their homeland." Following the fence, Molly and Daisy found their way home. Their cousin had turned herself in.

Molly married and had two children, the eldest of whom was a girl she named Nugi Garimara, later renamed Doris. Doris was born in 1937. But because the government did not record aboriginal births, her exact birth date is unknown.

The year Doris was born, a government official, A.O. Neville, said, "We have power ... to take any child from its mother at any stage of its life." He asked whether Australia would have a population of 1 million blacks -- aborigines were considered black -- "or are we going to merge them into our white community and eventually forget that there ever were any aborigines in Australia?"

In 1941, Neville ordered agents to grab Molly's daughters and send them to the Moore River Settlement.

At Moore River, Doris was beaten for speaking her native Mardudjara language. When she was 12 she was sent to a farm run by missionaries where she came to hate her aboriginal culture.

## Nurse And Writer

Doris worked for many years as a nurse, and later studied journalism.

She is survived by four children, 31 grandchildren and 80 great-grandchildren, said her daughter, Bernadine Pilkington.

Pilkington Garimara later said she grew up thinking, "my mother didn't want me and gave me away." But she gradually learned the truth, and eventually wrote four books, of which "Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence" was best known.

Australian filmmaker Christine Olsen persuaded Noyce to put aside a project with actor Harrison Ford for a film about three aboriginal girls torn away from their families. It is called "Rabbit-Proof Fence."

The movie's success led Pilkington Garimara to join former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser as a leader of a national campaign of reconciliation between whites and aboriginals. It is called Journey of Healing.

She had taken her own healing journey decades earlier, when she was in her mid-20s and traveled back to Jigalong to find her mother.

"I asked her, 'Why did you give me away?'" Pilkington Garimara recalled. "She just broke down and said, 'I never did, the government came and took you away.' She had no rights as a mother or an aboriginal woman."
