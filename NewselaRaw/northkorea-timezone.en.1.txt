PYONGYANG, North Korea â€” North Korea, already isolated and at odds with its neighbors, now has its own time zone.

On Aug. 15 at midnight, bells were rung and celebrations were held as the nation's clocks were set back 30 minutes. The day was chosen to mark the anniversary of the Korean Peninsula's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/AP_462948318428.png" />

Korea's liberation came on Aug. 15, 1945, at the end of World War II. Communist North Korea split off from South Korea a scant three years later, in 1948.

Prior to the North's switchover, both Koreas and Japan shared the same time zone, which is nine hours ahead of the standard Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The shared time zone was established under Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule.

## South Korea Criticizes Surprise Decision

North Korea's decision to change its time zone, announced last week, came as a surprise even to South Korea. Park Geun-hye, South Korea's president, criticized Pyongyang for making the change without consulting the South.

Nonetheless, the effort to erase a holdover of the colonial period will likely be viewed favorably by many Koreans, in both the North and South. Many Koreans who remember the harsh rule of the Japanese are still deeply resentful toward Tokyo.

"This is a great event in the history of the Korean nation," the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency declared. "It is of great significance in completely eradicating the leftovers of the Japanese imperialists in all fabrics of social life."

## Time Zone Has Roots In History

North Korea has named the new time zone "Pyongyang Time," after the nation's capital city.

The time zone has actually been used before. It was adopted by the then-unified Korea in 1908, but changed to the Japanese time zone on Jan. 1, 1912, two years after the Korean peninsula was colonized. South Korea briefly revived the old time zone from 1954 to 1961, while North Korea stuck with the Japanese time zone until now.

Pyongyang's decision to create a 30-minute difference in time is unusual but not unique. Countries such as India, Iran and Myanmar have half-hour differences from their neighbors, while Nepal has a 45-minute lag.

Jong Sok, chief astronomer at the Pyongyang Observatory, said the change suits North Korea's natural conditions.

## Global Time Standard Set In England

"With the time standard that we have used up until now, the time when the sun is at its highest position is not correctly noon," he said. "I think it is the lawful right of a sovereign state" to make such a change, he added. "Our republic, to mark the 70th anniversary of our liberation and the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Japanese imperialism, has announced our time as Pyongyang Time, the same as our ancestors used and which was robbed from us by the Japanese imperialists."

Time zones were first proposed in the 19th century as global travel and communication became more important. They were standardized in the early 20th century around Greenwich Mean Time, named after the meridian, or line of longitude, which runs through an observatory in Greenwich, England.

## Zone Could Isolate Country Even More

In using clocks to make a political statement, North Korea may be borrowing a page from the Chinese Communist Party playbook. China stretches 3,100 miles from east to west, but after taking power in 1949, the Communists put the whole country under one single time zone, called Beijing Time. The change was in part a means of emphasizing their control over the huge country.

The new time zone change may further isolate North Korea, which is already one of the most isolated places on earth. However, it gives the country something to rally around as it commemorates the defeat of the Japanese.

The North has been quick to criticize South Korea for not similarly abandoning for good the Japanese time zone.

North Korea also has a different way of counting the years than the West does. Instead of 2015, this is Juche 104 on North Korean calendars, which begin from the birth of the country's founder and first president, Kim Il Sung. Dates before that are in the Western style.
