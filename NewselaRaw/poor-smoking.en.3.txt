PHILADELPHIA — Many people smoke after they've eaten. Lindell Harvey smokes because he hasn't eaten.

"You smoke out of anxiety because you don't have the food you need," said Harvey, 54. He lives alone in eastern Pennsylvania. He served in the Navy and now he is disabled. The Navy sends some money, but he is still very poor. In fact, he lives on $2,000 a year less than what the government views as the level for officially being poor. That amount, $11,490 for one person, is known as the poverty line.

Harvey relies on Newport cigarettes to see him through hard days. "In my mind, the smoking becomes a comfort as I try to create ways to get food."

The poor lack nearly everything important — food, jobs, health care, and a safe place to live. But, they do have too much of one thing: Nicotine. It's the chemical in tobacco which causes people to become addicted to cigarettes.

## Smoking To Relax Or Feel Better

The poor are more likely to smoke than those who have enough to support themselves.

In Philadelphia, there is more smoking among the poor than among people who aren't poor, according to Giridhar Mallya. He works for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.

Philadelphia is the poorest of the 10 largest U.S. cities. A health department report shows Philadelphia also has one of the highest rates of smoking of any big city.

Being poor can be very hard on a person's mind. It is not easy to relax, or to feel positive. The poor smoke to help themselves deal with these mental effects of their poverty, Mallya said.

The poor may also smoke more because they often live in places with no grocery stores and have to shop at corner stores. They see many cigarette ads in those types of stores, Mallya said.

Mariana Chilton is an expert on hunger. She sees a link between smoking and poverty.

Not having money causes terrible suffering, Chilton said. It can hurt a person's mind. "One of the fastest, most convenient ways to help is a cigarette. It'll keep you sane, and keep you from hurting yourself or others."

## One Cigarette, Then Straight To Bed

Smoking is also a way to deal with hunger, Chilton said. Families without enough to eat are more likely to smoke than families with plenty to eat, she said.

"Smoking treats hunger pangs," Chilton said. "Instead of having lunch, mothers will feed their children, then smoke."

That's how it works for Elaine Styles, 51, a day care worker who lost her job.

"I smoke so I don't have to eat," Styles said. She makes sure her family eats and then she smokes one cigarette. Afterwards, she goes straight to bed.

Because smoking is expensive, people ask, aren't the poor being irresponsible by spending money on cigarettes? Shouldn't they spend that money on food instead?

Poor smokers spend about one-sixth of what they make on cigarettes, Mallya said. In Philadelphia, the average smoker spends about $1,000 a year on cigarettes, he added.

Mallya says it is a shame that cigarettes in Philadelphia are cheap. They sell for $5 to $6 a pack.  In other cities taxes make them more expensive. The more cigarettes cost, the fewer are smoked, he said.

## Hard To Stop

Most poor people want to quit smoking, surveys show. But poverty, combined with the power of nicotine, makes stopping hard.

"People smoke knowing it is not good for them," said Frank Leone at the University of Pennsylvania. Leone is a lung doctor. "Nicotine gets into the part of the brain stem that creates a sense of safety, comfort, warmth." If you have to decide between buying bread or cigarettes, he said, your brain may tell you to "just smoke."

Elijah Anderson works at Yale University studying the way people live. He said people shouldn't "blame the victim" by simply criticizing smoking behavior. It's important to understand the effect of poverty and its causes. He added that many poor people don't see a future for themselves. For this reason, many see no point in protecting their health.

Among the poor, especially poor African-Americans, minty menthol cigarettes make the smoking problem worse.

Menthol is a flavor added to cigarettes. It makes the cigarette taste smoother, which causes the smoker to smoke faster and more deeply, Mallya said.

That, in turn, increases the harm of cigarettes.

For 50 years, menthol cigarettes were pushed in black neighborhoods. Now, nine out of 10 African-American smokers in Philadelphia smoke menthol cigarettes, Mallya said.
