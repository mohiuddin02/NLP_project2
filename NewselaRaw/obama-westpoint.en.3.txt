WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama called Wednesday for the U.S. to depend less on military force as it deals with other countries. Obama instead promoted diplomacy and international partnerships. He sees working with other countries as a better approach to tackling global terrorism.

"This is American leadership. This is American strength," he said. Obama spoke about efforts to work with Europe to isolate Russia for its intervention in Ukraine and to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear pursuit. He acknowledged that neither crisis has yet been fixed. Obama argued, however, that there's an opportunity to resolve them peacefully.

Obama's comments came in a speech to graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. The president used the speech to take on critics. Some have accused him of a foreign policy that has scaled back U.S. power. Obama declared that the U.S. remains necessary. And if its interests are threatened, it will strike.

"America must always lead on the world stage. If we don't, no one else will," he said. Obama told the cadets that the U.S. military "is and always will be the backbone of that leadership."

## Cadets Cheer Speech

The speech comes as Obama's cautious approach to conflict has been attacked. Critics say his policies have strengthened U.S. rivals such as Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier this year, Russia took the Crimea region of Ukraine. It's now part of Russia. The U.S. threatened to block trade from Russia, but it didn't stop Putin.

Obama argued that a military response "cannot be the only" solution to every conflict. It cannot even be just the "primary" solution.

Since World War II, he said, "some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint, but from our willingness to rush into military adventures." In those mistakes, the U.S. acted "without thinking."

The speech came a day after Obama announced that combat operations in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) would end before 2015. The president said the cadets would be the first graduating class since Sept. 11, 2001, not to be sent into combat in [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq) or Afghanistan. Cadets cheered the news.

The president did pledge to work with Congress to ramp up support for groups opposing Syria's government. However, he has decided not to send U.S. troops to Syria. Obama defended that decision to not to use troops to try to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria. He said there's "no military solution that can eliminate the terrible suffering anytime soon."

## Helping Countries Fight Terror

A senior White House official said the administration would consider a U.S. military role in helping Syrian rebels. The official said Obama wanted to discuss the idea with Congress.

Obama said the U.S.'s biggest threat was no longer a centralized al-Qaida capable of a large-scale attack on the U.S. The danger now comes from small branches of al-Qaida and extremists. Many target countries where they operate, the president said. But they can strike U.S. military and government workers overseas. He pointed to the 2012 Benghazi attacks on U.S. officials working in Libya.

Obama was elected in 2008 in part because of his opposition to the war in Iraq. He said it's unrealistic to invade every country that harbors terrorist networks. Instead, he has argued that the U.S. should partner with countries fighting rebels.

To that end, he called on Congress to approve $5 billion to fight terrorism. The money would go to help countries in the Middle East and North Africa that are fighting extremists. Yemen, which is battling al-Qaida, would receive money.

Republicans said U.S. allies were already concerned with what they said were Obama's failures to make good on his threats.

## A Course Of Action

"Too often, strong words have been followed by weak actions or no actions," said Rep. Ed Royce, a Republican from California. He chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "President Obama's diplomatic efforts cannot work if our allies lack confidence in U.S. commitments, and our opponents do not fear U.S. warnings."

Obama sought to reserve his right to conduct targeted killings such as strikes by unmanned [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) planes. "There are times when those actions are necessary," he said. Obama said so too is military action, when the U.S. or its allies are in danger.

But he said the standard should be higher when the U.S. isn't threatened directly. The U.S. needs to be more careful to use force in cases that simply "stir our conscience or push the world in a more dangerous direction."

In those cases, he argued, working with other countries is more likely to succeed. That course of action is "less likely to lead to costly mistakes."
