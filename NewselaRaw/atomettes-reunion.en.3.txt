A group of women sat together in the West Los Angeles home of their friend Rose Honda. They were looking through some things from their past.

There were old photos, shoes and dress gloves. There was an airline ticket from 1951 and a handwritten invitation to Christmas dinner.

The women shared their memories of all the times they shared over the years.

The group of ladies call themselves the Atomettes. They have been friends for the last 65 years.

## "It's Always Like Yesterday"

The group started in 1949 when seven Japanese-American girls decided to form a social club. Each has brought something different to the group. Taye Inadomi is the brainy one. Susan Uemura, happy and generous. Sadie Hifumi, the talented writer and leader. Kathi Yamazaki, the creative only child. Frances Yonemori, the funny one. Karlene Koketsu, the artist. Michi Yamaji, who was quiet but lighthearted, died several years ago.

They were each looking for friends and comfort. At the time, Japanese-Americans faced many hardships, like being excluded and judged for their race. The group has stuck together for all these years.

"When we get together, it's always like yesterday," said Honda, 87, who has been a leader in the group from the beginning. "We talk and talk and talk and don't want to say goodbye."

Social groups like the Atomettes were popular after World War II. Many were formed by Japanese-Americans who had been born in the United States and whose parents were from Japan. They provided members a safe community.

The groups were an important place to turn as members were growing older. The clubs protected kids and teenagers from the hurtful judgment and actions of others who disliked Japanese people. The groups were fun too.

## The Tough Times

After World War II, community leaders encouraged Japanese-Americans to join the clubs. They were seen as a helpful way to assist people who came back from the internment camps. Japanese-Americans were forced to live in those camps during the war. Many clubs were sponsored by religious organizations like churches.

Now, kids are not as interested in the clubs as they used to be. It is hard for the groups to find new members. There are so many other opportunities for kids, like sports teams and social activities.

It is common for interest in traditions to fade over time. As immigrants have children, who then start their own families, they often grow less connected to the past. Most of the Atomettes' children haven't married other Japanese-Americans or attended Japanese-language school. They do not support community institutions as much as their parents.

"I'm glad that my children are comfortable with who they are," Hifumi said. "But at the same time, I'm a little sad that they and their children are losing the qualities that make them unique as Japanese-Americans."

When the Atomettes started, times were very different than they are now. Harry S. Truman was president. People who moved to America from Japan were not allowed to own land. There were also rules on who they could marry.

## Prayers, Plants And Love

The church and the social groups helped support the girls during this hard time. Their parents were often very busy and struggled to make enough money for their families. But the girls were able to turn to the clubs for friendships and memorable American experiences.

As the girls grew up, they graduated from college. They began to meet at birthdays, weddings and baby showers. One of their favorite memories is a surprise retirement party for one member in 1989. They made her a quilt with patches representing the different stages of her life.

The friends have also faced difficult challenges together. Some members have had sicknesses, like brain injuries and surgeries. The group helps one another with prayers, plants, food and love.

The group has remained very close over all these years. Some think that the Japanese tradition of group harmony and teamwork has kept them together. Others think their personalities all fit together well from the first time they got together.

"It's a sisterhood," Inadomi said. "When we get back together, it's like we're young again."
