LOS ANGELES â€” Few Los Angeles residents doubt that more bad guys would get away without police helicopters to chase them.

Now the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is pioneering the use of helicopters to stop crimes before they start. With 17 helicopters, the LAPD has the largest police helicopter fleet in the nation.

Tapping into a new policing trend that is driven by data, the department is using heat maps, technology and years of crime figures to identify crime "hot spots." Pilots spend their spare time flying over them. The theory is that would-be criminals will stay straight when there's a helicopter hovering overhead.

However, what some see as a creative tool for keeping the peace, others call loud and annoying.

The LAPD began exploring the preventive approach a few years ago with a new model called predictive policing. It sent officers and patrol cars to areas where data suggested crime was more likely to occur.

## Flights Up, Crimes Down

Criminologists say the use of helicopters is a natural, if highly unusual, expansion of that policing scenario.

So far, LAPD officials say, the crime figures show that helicopters are working. The number of serious crimes reported in an area of South Los Angeles fell during weeks when the helicopters conducted more flights.

"It's extremely cutting edge," says Captain Gary Walters, who heads the LAPD's air support unit. "It's different. It's nothing that we've ever done before with this specificity."

During the week in June 2013, the helicopter unit flew 36 times over the area, during which time 125 crimes were reported. During another week in July, the number of flights rose to 91 and the number of crimes dropped to 86.

The most pronounced difference came last September. During the week of Sept. 13, the helicopter unit flew over the same area 65 times and police recorded 90 crimes. A week later, the number of flights dropped to 40 and the number of reported crimes skyrocketed to 136. Almost all types of crime went up, including burglary, car theft and thefts from vehicles.

Craig Uchida is a policing expert who analyzes data for the LAPD and offers advice on how to prevent crime. He says it is too early to prove a definite link between the flights and drops in crime, but so far, he said, the results are encouraging.

"Certainly it provides another layer and blanket of security for our folks," says Captain Ed Prokop, who recently oversaw the area.

## Stopping Ravers And Robbers

And the project sometimes had unexpected results.

In March 2014, a pilot was checking a hot spot where crooks had been stealing vehicles, burglarizing cars and attacking people, says Sergeant Tony DeMolina, a veteran LAPD pilot. While keeping an eye out for crime, the pilot spotted something else: strobe lights spilling from an illegal dance party inside a massive warehouse.

The partygoers would park their cars in nearby alleys, becoming easy prey for would-be thieves. After the raves ended, DeMolina says, ravers themselves were robbed.

Once the pilot connected the raves to the crimes, extra patrols shut future raves down, he says.

Professor Geoffrey Alpert of the University of South Carolina is a policing expert who has studied the use of police helicopters in Miami and Baltimore. He says the choppers can prevent crime in the short term, but criminals will likely return when the helicopters are not around.

"You are deterring the criminals, but you aren't getting rid of them and their intent," he says. "Those criminals could strike in a different time and place."

## Of Drones And Dread

Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, an associate professor of law at the University of the District of Columbia, agrees. Helicopters have a "great deterrent value," he says. But, during a time of public concern about police using military tactics, a loud and visible helicopter could make residents feel like the police are a military force.

Police departments increasingly say that one of their goals is to "engage the community" and a hovering helicopter can get in the way of that, Ferguson says. Americans "are sending a message that they don't want our police militarized. They don't want that occupying army feel. And the use of helicopters fits in that frame."

Peter Bibring is a senior attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's Southern California chapter. He says using helicopters to monitor neighborhoods could set a problematic standard for how the LAPD monitors other areas.

Critics challenged the LAPD last year when it received two drones from Seattle police. The department does not use the unmanned aircraft. They remain locked away until the Police Commission decides if and how they might be used, but some people are concerned that drones flying overhead could violate people's privacy.

"If this experience is successful," Bibring says of the helicopters, "this could be a preview of how one day the LAPD could use drones for this purpose."

Commander Sean Malinowski, who helped develop predictive policing, says the helicopter project represents how innovative crime fighting has become. He says there is "untapped potential" for similar projects.

"The future of this thing is going to be how creative cops can be in using predictive or other data-driven strategies," he says. "That gets people pumped up to do something different. It kind of injects life into the crime fighting."
