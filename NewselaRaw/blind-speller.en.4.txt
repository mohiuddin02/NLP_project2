ST. LOUIS, Mo. â€” Richie Tienter is a good speller. He is also blind.

Richie is in the fourth grade. He won his school's spelling contest, or game. The contest is called a spelling bee. The winning word was "magician."

Richie heard the kids who were watching clap when he won. He felt very happy.

## He Loves To Read

Richie was only a baby when his parents learned he was blind. He cannot read the same way other kids can. He cannot see words. Instead, Richie uses Braille. Braille is a way that blind people can read. They move their fingers over raised bumps. The raised bumps stand for letters.

Richie loves to read. He likes history books. He enjoys books about the kings and queens of Europe.

Ritchie's mom began reading to Richie when he was little. She read to him after they found out that he was blind. Soon the books changed. She started using Braille books.

Now Richie is 9. His school is near St. Louis in Missouri. His teachers say Richie is smart. He reads like a high school student. He knows more words than his classmates.

## A Bigger Contest

Richie has been in other contests. Last summer, he finished in third place at a big contest for blind students. Kids from first grade through high school were there. There were games for reading, spelling and other subjects.

Richie uses Braille to read at school.

Not long ago, Richie and his class were matching nouns with verbs. The other kids used papers and pencils. Richie read a Braille sheet with the words. He then typed out the answers with a special tool. It helped him take notes in Braille.

Richie will go to a bigger contest. He will be in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Spelling Bee.

The winner there will go to the National Spelling Bee. Kids from all over the country will try to win the contest. Other kids who are blind have been in the national bee. One was a girl from Oklahoma. She did well at the contest.
