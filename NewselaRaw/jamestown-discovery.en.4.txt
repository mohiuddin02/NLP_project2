WASHINGTON â€” Jamestown was England's first colony in America. Archaeologists found the bones of four early leaders. They died more than 400 years ago.

The graves were under a dirt floor. The floor was once part of Jamestown's church. Jamestown is in Virginia.

Pocahontas got married in that church. She was the daughter of an American Indian chief. She married John Rolfe of England.

## The Four Graves

Archaeologists also found a box in a grave. Pieces of bones were in it. Experts think they were relics. Relics are the bones belonging to saints. Saints are important people in the Catholic Church.

The archaeologists have studied the church since 1994. Archaeologists dig up old buildings and objects. They do this to learn more about human history.

The team found the bones of the Reverend Robert Hunt. He was Jamestown's first minister. He was known as a peacemaker. They also found the bones of Captain Gabriel Archer.

Sir Ferdinando Wainman was the third man. He was likely the first knight buried in America. The last man was Captain William West. In his grave, archaeologists found a silk belt. Its edges were made of silver. The belt was falling apart. It could not be dug up. Instead, the archaeologists removed an entire block of dirt.

William died in a fight with Indians. The three other men died from illnesses.

## Important Information

The objects will go on display soon. They will be in a museum at "Historic Jamestowne."

A museum made a 3-D scan of the ground, the bones and objects. They will be put online soon.

Douglas Owsley works at the Smithsonian Museum. It is in Washington, D.C. He studies human bones. Douglas said he discovers important things from bones. History books do not have all the information. The bones give important details, too.
