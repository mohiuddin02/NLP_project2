WICHITA, Kan. — Seth Ogden is 8 years old. When he was younger, his grandma asked him about the roses in her backyard.

"I thought she was joking with me," Seth said. "Once I got closer I could see the roses."

Seth is colorblind. It doesn't mean he can't see any color at all, like a black-and-white movie. It means he has trouble seeing the difference between certain colors. Usually kids are born with colorblindness. It's passed down genetically from their parents.  

Sometimes Seth mismatches clothes or confuses soccer jerseys. His mom, Heidi, worries that it's one of the reasons he has never liked doing art. However, it's not a serious problem.

## Boy And Mom Enter Contest

Seth and his mom, who live in Wichita, Kansas, recently made a YouTube video for a contest. It was run by EnChroma, a company that created glasses that can help people like Seth see color. 

Color vision experts like to call Seth's condition "color vision deficiency" rather than colorblindness. People like Seth, they say, can see most basic colors, typically between 10,000 and 100,000 colors in total. Most people can make out 1 million colors. The world doesn't appear gray to Seth, but when colors are close together he struggles to tell the difference.

After Seth won the contest, EnChroma sent him a free pair of its color-correcting glasses. They usually cost hundreds of dollars.

Earlier this month, he tried them on for the first time. 

## Videos Show People Trying Glasses

"Whoa," he said, with his parents looking on. Everything was golden, he said, as the sun shimmered through tree branches that had lost their leaves for the winter.

Seth and his mom first heard about the glasses by watching YouTube videos, some of which have hundreds of thousands of views. Many of the men in the videos went out to beautiful places in nature. They also cursed out of shock when they first tried on the glasses. Seth's mom reminded him ahead of time that that wouldn't be necessary.

His parents asked if the greens looked greener. "A little bit," he said. "The sky looks a lot different."

Although the sky was full of many colors at sunset, it was mostly blue, a color Seth shouldn't have trouble seeing without the glasses. He walked over to a bush behind his house. Seth excitedly said that he could see berries on it that he'd never seen before.

## Some Colors Seem The Same

Seth walked around his backyard, looking at grass and leaves, bird feeders and plant pots. At one point he picked up a dead leaf and saw speckles of red that he hadn't seen before. The dried leaves on the trees looked like clumps before but now looked clearer, he said.

His mom asked whether he could see one color or another, and often he said he could, though not always. At one point Seth said that orange looked much brighter with the glasses on. His mom laughed and reminded him that the sunglasses make everything look a little darker.

"What color is the umbrella?" his parents asked.

"It's green, kind of a dark green," Seth said.

"What color does it look without the glasses?" they asked again.

"It still looks green," Seth said. He decided that he's just better at seeing green than red, whether the glasses were on or not.

## Grandpa Also Colorblind

Seth's grandpa, who is also colorblind, wasn't impressed by the glasses. "I've been colorblind my whole life," he said.

Before heading back inside to finish homework and play video games, Seth said the glasses helped him see the difference between colors but the colors didn't "show out" as much as he had expected.

"Does it make you wish you weren't colorblind in the first place so you didn't have to wear them?" his parents asked.

No, he said, this was more fun. Regular kids had always seen color and would never get to see colors this way for the first time.
