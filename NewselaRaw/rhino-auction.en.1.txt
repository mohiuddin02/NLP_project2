HOUSTON, Texas â€” Organizers of a charity auction expect to raise more than $1 million to help protect the endangered black rhino.

The item to be auctioned? A permit that will allow a hunter to kill one of only about 1,800 black rhinos left in the African country of Namibia.

Some animal preservation groups are bashing the idea.

"More than ridiculous," said Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States.

## Advanced, Or Absurd, Plan?

"It's absurd. You're going to help an [endangered animal](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) by killing an endangered member of that population?" said Pacelle. Especially at a time when the global conservation community is protecting the elephant and rhino from people with high-powered weapons, "this action sends exactly the wrong signal," he said.

In October, the Dallas Safari Club announced it would put the permit up for auction and sell it to the highest bidder. The permit is one of only five offered each year by Namibia, and the first being sold outside of that country. The money raised from the auction will pay for conservation efforts to protect the black rhino in Namibia.

"This is advanced, state-of-the-art wildlife conservation and management techniques," said John J. Jackson III, a Louisiana-based international wildlife attorney and a member of the safari club. "It's not something the (regular person) understands, but they should," Jackson said.

He called the group's rhino auction the best strategy to preserve the endangered species. "The conservation hunt is a hero in the hunting community."

An estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild. This number is down from 70,000 in the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 of them are in Namibia, according to the safari club.

## An Old Rhino To Be Hunted

Poachers, people who illegally kill or capture wild animals, long have targeted the rhino, primarily for its horn, which is valuable on the international black market for endangered animals and animal parts. Made of the protein keratin, the main material of fingernails and hooves, the horn has been used in carvings and for medicinal purposes, mostly in Asia. The destruction of their habitat is another reason rhinos are nearly extinct.

The auction is scheduled for the Dallas Safari Club's annual convention in January.

According to Jackson, the hunt will involve one of five black rhinos selected by a committee and approved by the Namibian government. The five will all be older males, incapable of reproducing and likely "troublemakers ... bad guys that are killing other rhinos," he said. Jackson said he's been working on the auction project with federal wildlife officials.

Jackson claimed that killing an older, violent rhino results in more rhino calves being born and increasing the population.

He said all of the money from the auction would go into a bank account, which will be held until the hunting permit is approved by Namibia. At that point, the money will then be sent to the government of Namibia for the sole purpose of protecting rhinos and their habitat.

Safari Club President Ben Carter said the money will be "enormously meaningful in Namibia's fight to ensure the future of its black rhino populations."

## Auction "Totally Irresponsible"

Jeffrey Flocken, the North American regional director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, disagrees wholeheartedly. He described the club's argument as bizarre.

He says the club is actually creating a bidding frenzy for the opportunity to shoot one of the last rhinos in existence. Flocken called the auction "totally irresponsible." He said it's an attempt to exploit "a horrific situation where rhino poaching is out of control and fuel excitement around being able to kill an animal whose future existence is already hanging in the balance."

Rick Barongi, director of the Houston Zoo and vice president of the International Rhino Foundation, said the hunt was not illegal. But it "sends a mixed message."

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced it was in contact with the safari club on whether it would agree to a permit that would allow the winning bidder to bring the dead rhino to the United States as a trophy. The permit is required under federal law.

The permit will be granted if the agency determines the rhino is killed as part of a "well-managed conservation program" that will help the species survive in the long run, it said.

## An Ugly Alternative

Earlier this year, the service granted a permit for a sport-hunted black rhino taken in Namibia in 2009.

Pacelle said the Humane Society would work to oppose the permit.

An administrator at the Namibian Embassy in Washington referred questions about the hunt and auction to its government's tourism office. There was no response to an email from The Associated Press.

"The two hot issues here are the fact it's an endangered species, and the second thing is it's a trophy," Barongi, the zoo director, said. If the money raised from the rhino auction will save hundreds of rhinos, that may be the best option. "Then you go with your best option," Barongi said.

"Because the alternative is you can lose them all," he said.
