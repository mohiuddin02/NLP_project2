Adidas is offering to help high schools around the country stop using Native American mascots.

Adidas officials said Thursday it will help the schools create new mascots, nicknames, images or symbols. It also promised to help cover the cost to make sure that the change is not too expensive.

Adidas announced the project as the White House Tribal Nations Conference met in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Adidas executives were among those attending the meeting, which included leaders from 567 Native American tribes.

Adidas also said it will be a founding member of a group that deals with the problem of Native American mascots in sports. The German company makes shoes and clothing. Its North American headquarters is in Portland, Oregon.

About 2,000 schools nationwide have Native American mascots, according to the group Change the Mascot.

## 12 Down, 20 More Thinking About Change

The advocacy group said about a dozen schools have dropped these mascots over the past two years. An additional 20 are considering a change.

Eric Liedtke is the Adidas head of global brands. He said that sports must include everyone.

"Today's announcement is a great way for us to offer up our resources to schools that want to do what's right," said Liedtke, who attended the conference. "Our intention is to help break down any barriers to change."

He said the company wants to give help to "all administrators, teachers, students and athletes who want to make a difference in their lives and in their world."

## Working Toward Respect For All

He said the change "can lead to a more respectful" environment for all American athletes.

Schools would work together with the company's design team to create sports logos and uniforms. Each one can decide whether or not it wants to participate in the program. All sports would be included.

Native American mascots have drawn more attention and controversy in recent years. Native American and civil rights groups have asked NFL's Washington Redskins to change their name and mascot. The football team has refused.

## Colleges Told To Drop Native American Mascots

In 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) warned colleges that they would face penalties if they did not change Native American logos or nicknames. Some colleges kept their nicknames by getting permission from tribes. Two teams that received permission were the Florida State Seminoles and the University of Utah Utes.

Some states have taken action against Native American mascots in high schools. Last month California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law that prevents schools from using the term "Redskins."

Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper recently ordered that a new commission study the use of Native American mascots. It would also come up with a list of recommendations for possible laws.

In Oregon, the state Board of Education in 2012 ordered high schools to ban the mascots or risk losing state money. The schools have until 2017 to obey.

## Adidas Held Up As Role Model

Change the Mascot's Jackie Pata is the executive director of the National Congress of American Indians. Both she and Oneida Nation leader Ray Halbritter applauded Adidas' announcemenr in a statement.

The statement said the two hope that other companies including FedEx "will step forward and follow Adidas's lead." The company paid millions to name the Redskins' stadium FedEx Field.

"Adidas clearly understands that in 2015, businesses cannot sit on the sideline on this issue and that they must choose which side they are on," the statement said. It also said it is inspiring that Adidas chose to respect and include everyone. The company "has set an example for others to follow."
