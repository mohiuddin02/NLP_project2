A lot of people got a new electronic device for Christmas this year. But what happens to the older devices they replaced?

The old electronics can become a pollution problem. Some contain materials that can be dangerous.

Some devices end up at Absolute Green Electronics Recycling in California. Computers are broken apart there. The parts are sorted into cardboard bins.

Bins stretch in rows across a huge warehouse. There are bins for cellphones and camcorders. There are bins for digital cameras, cables and network switches.

"Everything gets separated," Victor Kianipay said. He owns the company. "There are so many layers and layers of product."

## E-Waste's Dangerous Substances

This is electronic waste, or e-waste.  Kianipay makes money from it. He moved 25,000 pounds of discarded electronics last January. But e-waste also is a global environmental problem. Electronic junk now totals nearly 50 million tons a year worldwide, according to the Solving the E-Waste Problem Initiative. The group includes governments, scientists and business groups based in Germany.

The annual figure may reach 65 million tons in five years, the group estimates. That is enough to fill trucks parked bumper to bumper that reach around three-quarters of the Earth. The waste is a particular concern in part because much of it contains lead, mercury and other dangerous substances. Those substances are released when the waste is melted down to remove gold, silver and copper.

A lot of companies send electronic waste to poor countries. Now there are big scrap businesses in poor parts of China and Africa. But doing this has also exposed large numbers of people to poisons that are dangerous to their health.

Thousands of women and young children work melting circuit boards, said Jim Puckett. Circuit boards are the "brains" of electronic devices. Puckett started the Seattle-based Basel Action Network. The group is named after a Swiss city. International agreements were written there in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The rules were meant to stop the "digital dumping."

Thirty-five nations have signed on to the ideas of the Basel Convention, Puckett said. But the United States has not. And it is the largest producer of e-waste by far.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said most electronics that are thrown out wind up in U.S. landfills.  No one is sure how much electronic waste the U.S. exports, the EPA says. But the government is worried that the electronics are not handled well overseas. This can cause  "serious public health and environmental" problems, EPA said.

## Old TVs And Computer Screens

Puckett has spent years investigating the problem. He says that about half to two-thirds of what is handed over to recyclers is exported.

Congress and state governments are trying to make sure that e-waste gets properly recycled here. A proposed law was introduced in July. It would make it against the law to export electronic junk with poisons to nations that cannot deal with them safely.

California passed a recycling law in 2003. The law created a system of payments to prevent most video-display devices from being put into landfills. The law especially targets old TVs and computer screens.

The old TVs are particularly bad. They contain both lead and mercury, said Mark Oldfield. He is a spokesman for the state's Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery.

More than 1.5 billion pounds of video-display equipment has been collected because of the law since 2005, Oldfield said.

Chris Chun owns EZPC Recycle in California. His workers test discarded computers. Devices that still work are sold. Computers are offered at a very low prices to schools and churches.

"I have kids. I want them to have a clean, safe environment," said Chun. If electronic equipment gets tossed into a dump, "it just stays there," Chun said.

## Explosion Of New Devices

Still, e-waste is never particularly easy or clean even when handled properly. Taking apart some equipment requires removing up to 50 screws, Chun said.

Huge shredders turn circuit boards and hard drives into large bits of glass, metal and plastics. Those pieces then have to be melted to separate valuable metals, said Ted Smith. He started the Electronics TakeBack Coalition. It is located in San Francisco.

The melting happens in machines called smelters.

"There are no smelters that do this in the U.S.," due to the environmental effects of smelting, Smith said. The shredding companies send the metal to a smelter in Canada.

So far, nearly half the states have passed e-waste recycling laws. Still, environmentalists fear they are only losing ground because of the astonishing explosion of devices.
