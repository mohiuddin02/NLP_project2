WASHINGTON — Harry Potter, Elvis Presley and Bugs Bunny share one thing in common: They are not at all popular with traditional stamp collectors.

Some philatelists — as stamp collectors are known — say the committee that helps pick new stamps is favoring pop stars and fictional characters. Such choices mean that cultural sites and historical figures are appearing less often. The result, they say, is the undermining of a long tradition.

"Harry Potter is a perfect example," said Ken Martin, director of the American Philatelic Society, a stamp-collecting group that says it has 44,000 members. He does not approve of a stamp showing the fictional boy wizard or his British creator, J.K. Rowling.

"Why do you honor a British author's book?" Martin asked. "Wouldn't it be much more appropriate to honor something that reflects our country's heritage, not the product of another country?"

The answer, by all accounts, is money. "Spider-Man" and "Star Wars" stamps vastly outsell those commemorating the Civil War, insects and spiders, and Pacific Coast lighthouses.

## No Apologies For Pop Culture

The cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service released its Harry Potter stamps last November in 20-stamp booklets, and found another hit.

The stamps display scenes from some of the eight wildly popular films. Among them are images of Harry reading his acceptance letter to Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards, and firing his wand in battle. Magical creatures like Dobby the house elf and Hedwig the owl are also featured.

The Postal Service issued its latest limited-edition commemorative stamp Friday. It honors legendary blues rocker Janis Joplin, the hard-drinking lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company who died at age 27.

Postal officials make no apologies for embracing pop culture, given the service's snail-mail image in the digital age. They especially hope to lure young people into collecting stamps.

"We need to change and improve to serve the changing needs of the American public," said Toni DeLancey, a Postal Service spokeswoman. "Those current Americans that we want interested in stamps, these are probably the images they want to see."

DeLancey said the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, a 12-member group that evaluates future stamp issues, is just keeping up with the times.

## Getting People Interested In Stamps

Not everyone agrees, however. Last month, Benjamin Bailar, who served as postmaster general from 1975 to 1978, angrily resigned from the committee after accusing the postal service of trading the integrity of its stamps program for money.

In a letter to the current postmaster general, Bailar suggested the committee be abolished if it is going to recommend things like cartoons.

"The stamp program should celebrate the things that are great about the United States and serve as a medium to communicate those things to a worldwide audience," Bailar wrote.

In an interview, Bailar said the stamp program "deserves more than comic-strip characters and pop-music characters."

The committee chair, Janet Klug, said she was disappointed by Bailar's resignation and does not think he represents others in the group. The committee's goal, she said, is to increase public interest in stamp collecting.

"I don't even know if the post office is making more money," she said. "I'm sure they would like to make more money — who wouldn't? But it's also trying to engage a broader public and get them interested in stamps."

The Postal Service reported a net loss of $1.9 billion in the second quarter of its 2014 financial year. It has reported financial losses in 20 of the last 22 quarters.
