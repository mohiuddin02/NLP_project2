WASHINGTON — In 2006 Army Capt. Brian Dowling was leading his Special Forces team through a steep mountain pass in eastern Afghanistan. Suddenly, enemy fighters ambushed his patrol. Two of his soldiers were left pinned down with life-threatening wounds.

After a furious firefight, the two men were rescued. But that day would change Dowling's life.

He is now part of an effort by the U.S. Special Operations Command to produce a radically new protective suit for elite soldiers to wear into battle. The goal is a suit with a range of special features: bionic limbs, head-to-toe armor, a built-in power supply and live information feeds projected inside the helmet.

They call it — what else? — the "Iron Man suit."

## From Hollywood To Battlefield

The plan is to bring the Iron Man idea from the movies and make it closer to being real, Dowling said. Tony Stark is a character in the movies and Marvel Comics. Stark is a master engineer who builds a rocket-powered exoskeleton — essentially, a high-tech suit of armor. By putting it on, he turns himself into the superhero Iron Man.

Military officials say they are trying to produce a working model within the next 12 months.

The metal suit the Pentagon wants would certainly be awe-inspiring. Bullets would bounce off it harmlessly. It would also be able to continuously download live video from remote-controlled airplanes — so-called [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) — flying overhead. Tiny motors in the exoskeleton would allow a soldier to run and jump without strain while carrying 100 or more pounds.

The suit would also be able to treat small wounds — in the unlikely event the armor is pierced. It would carry a built-in oxygen supply in case of poison gas. A cooling system would keep soldiers comfortable. Sensors would send information about the wearer's heartbeat, pulse rate and other vital signs back to headquarters.

"They want an Iron Man-like suit; they've been quite open about that," said engineer Adarsh Ayyar. "You won't get all of it. It's not going to fly. But I think it's doable."

## Salute To A Bronze Warrior

Even the project's formal name is a tribute to armored warriors. It's called the "tactical assault light operator suit," or TALOS. In Greek mythology, Talos was a giant bronze warrior who defended the island of Crete from invaders.

At a conference in August, Adm. William McRaven, head of the Special Operations Command, had a message for engineers: think about a special operations soldier preparing to attack a house.

"He has to open that door not knowing what's on the other side," McRaven said. "He's got to be able to shoot, move and communicate. He's got to be able to survive in that environment." A TALOS suit, he said, "will reduce the operation's risks."

Armored suits, of course, go back to ancient times. The new updated model the Army wants may seem a bit far out. But it shouldn't be forgotten that the Pentagon has a history of developing advanced technology.

This year the Army produced an animated video showcasing the Iron Man suit. It shows a soldier fully encased in heavy armor running down a narrow alley. Behind a huge door unseen enemies wait. Only the barrels of their four AK-47 rifles are visible.

Suddenly the soldier smashes through the door. He stands menacingly as dozens of rounds bounce harmlessly off his suit and helmet.

## Power Rangers

How much of this is Hollywood and how much is truly possible is uncertain, designers admit. For now, there are only ideas. A real working suit has yet to be built.

U.S. soldiers such as the Rangers already wear heavy armored vests and Kevlar helmets. The goal now is to produce something that provides better protection. It also has to do this without being so bulky that it prevents soldiers from moving in combat.

To make the suit work, designers will need to include a battery. Too big a battery would weigh down the suit. Too small and it could run out of juice in the middle of a mission. In the movies, Iron Man is powered by a fictional "arc reactor" stuck in Tony Stark's chest. The reactor sometimes fails and sends him tumbling to Earth.

"The Iron Man movies got it right," said engineer Russ Angold. "Power is the Achilles' heel with all these devices."
