WASHINGTON — The F-22 Raptor fighter jet flew in combat for the first time this week, participating in airstrikes over Syria. For nearly 10 years the aircraft was criticized for being dangerous to fly and used as an example of wasteful military spending.

U.S. military leaders at the Pentagon said the warplane flew with other fighter jets and bombers. They targeted enemy fighters' strongholds and buildings in northern Syria.

The United States is leading attacks against the group Islamic State (ISIL). The extremist group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

The militant group wants to take over land in the Middle East and create a strict religious government. The group has already taken control of land in Iraq and Syria.

General William Mayville runs operations for the top U.S. military command. He said the aircraft helped drop GPS-guided bombs on many targets, including fighters' headquarters, training camps, housing and combat vehicles.

The F-22's seeming success is a sharp turnaround from three years ago. The jet wasn't allowed to fly for nearly five months. The cause was safety problems stemming from a poorly functioning oxygen supply system.

For a while, the plane's future was very much in doubt.

## Companies Compete To Build

The diamond-winged fighter was first imagined back when the United States' main rival was the Soviet Union, a huge country that included Russia. The idea was to make a plane that could beat a new generation of Soviet jets in dogfights. But after the Soviet Union collapsed, Moscow never built those fighters.

The story of the F-22 began during the Cold War, a tense time between Washington and the Soviets. The Air Force held a final contest between two companies. Lockheed Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. were the world leaders in stealth technology. Stealth aircraft can avoid being spotted by radar. The two companies designed models — the Lockheed YF-22 in Burbank and the Northrop YF-23 in Hawthorne — and built them in Palmdale in the Los Angeles area.

The contest wasn't just decided on the qualities of each aircraft. Northrop was already building the then-secret B-2 Stealth bomber. If it had also won the fighter contest, it would have made almost all Air Force combat jets and had a monopoly. At the same time, Northrop's reputation was damaged by government investigations. This put Lockheed in a stronger position to build political support in Congress.

## Faster Than The Speed Of Sound

The F-22 got its final approval from Congress in 1991. It was designed in part in Burbank and built in Marietta, Georgia. Lockheed used lobbyists, people who work to get Congress to do what their clients want. Lockheed has nearly 1,100 subcontractors in 44 states, which made the jet appealing to many different members of Congress.

The plane can fly faster than the speed of sound without using afterburners. This lets it fly faster and farther than other aircraft. It carries cutting-edge radar and sensors, supposedly enabling a pilot to track and shoot an enemy aircraft before the target aircraft can detect the F-22.

The Air Force says the plane is essential to the United States remaining the strongest Air Force around the world. But it faced a huge problem.

The Pentagon said it was too advanced for low-tech enemies. It sat in hangars while other U.S. warplanes pummeled targets in Afghanistan. It went unused during the war in Iraq. There was no call for it in the conflict above Libya.

## Most Expensive Fighter Jet Ever

Two decades ago, the Pentagon planned to buy 648 F-22s for $139 million apiece. But the cost ultimately soared to $412 million, government accountants said. It was the most expensive fighter jet ever.

In 2009, then-Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates ended the purchases at 188 planes, saying they were too expensive. The Air Force received the last F-22 in 2012.

The plane was originally intended to replace F-15 combat jets that were designed in the early 1970s. But those F-15s still represent the majority of a so-called "air superiority fleet" — the jets that are supposed to overpower enemy aircraft and gain control of the sky.

When the Air Force got its F-22s in 2005, it didn't take long before it needed repairs and had other problems.

## F-22 Hits Its Targets

Over the years, F-22 pilots have reported dozens of incidents in which the jet's systems were not feeding them enough oxygen, causing wooziness. One pilot died in 2010 when his oxygen system failed.

The problem led officials to ground all F-22s for nearly five months in 2011. The next year, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta directed the Air Force to allow F-22s to fly only near landing sites. This was in case a pilot experienced oxygen loss.

The plane returned to regular service three months later. It drew no notice until a news conference Tuesday at the Pentagon. Mayville displayed black-and-white photographs showing several targets before and after the airstrikes in Syria.

In one image, a building that was said to belong to the ISIL was seen with its rooftop communications systems destroyed. The rest of the building was left nearly untouched.

The bombs that blew up the systems were delivered by F-22 Raptors, Mayville said.
