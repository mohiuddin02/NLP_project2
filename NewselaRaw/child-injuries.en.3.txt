Almost 1 million children go to emergency rooms with broken bones every year.

Most of them are not treated correctly, according to a new study.

When a child breaks an arm or leg, the first step is to put a splint on it.  The splint holds the bone in place. Splints usually include a strip of a hard material and soft padding. A bandage holds it all together.

Most of the time, splints are not put on correctly, the study found. That can lead to swelling or sores. Broken bones can take longer to heal.

Dr. Joshua M. Abzug said he began the study because he saw a lot of splints put on wrong. "I didn't think it would be that high," he said.

## Teaching Doctors The Correct Way

"The next step is education," Abzug said. He works at the University of Maryland Medical Center.

Most of the time, a splint is good enough, Abzug said. The patient will usually see a doctor within a few days and the doctor will put on a cast.

If it takes too long to get to a doctor, there can be serious problems, he said. People can develop bad sores. They might also need an operation to reset the bone.

Abzug studied 275 children and teenagers with broken bones in the Baltimore area. In most of the cases, the splint was not put on correctly. Also, in about half the cases, the splints were the wrong length.

About four out of 10 kids ended up with sores and other problems.

Abzug is worried. Nearly half of all boys break a bone before age 16. Nearly one-quarter of girls break a bone.

Almost 1 million kids younger than 15 break an arm or leg each year.

Abzug suspects the splints are not put on right either.

## Reminders Are Helpful

The researchers plan to show doctors how to put splints on correctly. They also want to give out posters and cards as reminders. Afterward, they will redo the study to see if their work made a difference.

Dr. Robert G. Graw Jr. is the founder of the Righttime Medical Care. The company runs 13 urgent-care centers in Maryland. An urgent-care center treats illnesses or emergencies that do not need an emergency room visit. Graw said he would welcome the extra training.

The types of splints change, Graw said. People lose skills that they do not use often and updates are important. Graw said families also need to be warned not to take off a splint. They may not put it back on right.

## It Takes Longer To Heal

One-year-old Hudson was hurt last month in an accident. X-ray pictures showed a broken shinbone.

His leg was splinted at the emergency room. Once, he crawled out of the splint. Another time, his mother took it off so he could sleep. Hudson developed a sore on his heel.

Now, the cast is off. Hudson and his twin brother are learning to walk. His mother, Jessica Ryan, still thinks about what happened.

"I wonder how many emergency rooms even know this is happening," she said.

Ryan said she felt terrible. She worries it was her fault that Hudson took longer to heal.

Dr. Jennifer M. Weiss is a doctor in Los Angeles. She has seen many splints that were not put on correctly. Doctors are not given much training, she said. Most of them learn on the job from someone who might or might not know how to do it correctly.

The study provides good evidence of the need for more training.

Just like a broken bone, she added, "I think this is fixable."
