Math and reading are important skills to learn at school. A research study found "soft skills" also matter. An example of a soft skill is how to get along with others. The study found that these skills can help kids. Soft skills can help students stay out of trouble when they get older.

## Fast Track To Soft Skills

Duke University scientists looked at a program called Fast Track. The program was started in the early 1990s. It was for children whose teachers and parents thought might have problems later in life. Teachers were worried about problems like bad behavior.

The students were put into two groups. Half took part in the special program and the other half did not. The program involved lessons in soft skills. It also taught things like self-control. Students learned how to control or manage their feelings. The program lasted from first grade through 10th grade. It reduced bad behavior as the students got older. They had less trouble with the law and police. Students in the program also had fewer health problems. They did not go to the doctor as much.

## Soft Skills = Less Crime

Scientists looked at why this was happening. They studied nearly 900 students. The scientists found that the soft skills helped the students. They learned the soft skills from ages 6 to 11. 

Hard skills were different. They did not change students' behavior as much. Teaching kids to work together is an example of a soft skill. Teaching math is an example of a hard skill.

Kenneth Dodge is a professor at Duke. He thinks that these soft skills should be more important in school. Dodge was the main scientist in this study. He also worked with Fast Track. Parents and schools should work on these skills with students, Dodge says.

## Understanding Other People

Neil Bernstein is a psychologist in Washington, D.C. He focuses on child and teenage problems. To him, the findings seem to go along with what he has seen. He has been working with children for more than 30 years. He thinks kids should also learn about empathy. Empathy is the skill of understanding another person's feelings.

When you have empathy, "you're much less likely to hurt someone else's feelings," says Bernstein.
