KERN RIVER CANYON, Calif. — Gold prospector David Fiori stood waist-deep in the chilly Kern River. He braced against the current and stabbed a shovel into the river bottom. As he tossed the muck downstream, his eyes wandered to a spot on the opposite bank of the river.

There, the water suddenly slowed as it tumbled over underwater boulders — a perfect place for finding gold.

The spot couldn't be reached. Not on this day — the water was too deep, too fast — but soon. California is in the third year of a severe drought — 2013 was the driest since the 1500s, according to one study. Across the state, the drought has reduced the flow of rivers and creeks to the point that a new wave of gold prospectors are able to get to spots they haven't been able to reach in decades.

The prospectors aren't happy about the pain the drought has caused their state. But they are gleeful about their new quest, to find flecks of gold.

"That's where I'm going next, as soon as I can," Fiori said, nodding toward the other side of the river "Another couple months, this thing will be down to a trickle. It's going to be amazing."

## A Boon For Gold Prospectors

This summer will be hot, officials predict. And the state's snowpack that typically provides about a third of the water by the state is at just 18 percent of its average.

This means a loss of $1.7 billion to the state. Farmland sits unplowed and thousands of jobs are lost. The salmon eggs in California's fisheries are left exposed to the air and the harsh sun, killing them.

But for one small, proud community — gold prospectors — the drought has been a boon.

Gold prices are still high at more than $1,250 an ounce. Mining supply stores have seen a surge in sales and people are signing up for gold prospecting class. The bug is even spreading to dry areas that haven't been underwater for many years.

This is not a new gold rush. During the real thing in the mid-1800s, about 300,000 people were drawn to the gold fields of California. There was so much gold that prospectors sometimes just bent down and plucked nuggets of gold off the ground. Today, most modern-day prospectors won't strike it rich.

It's less than a rush and more like a fever.

"It's not the normal, that's for sure," said Farris Farnsworth. The retired fix-it man swirled a handful of river sand and water in a mining pan on a recent weekend morning. "If somebody was to walk up and see us down here, they'd probably think we were a little nuts."

## Several Hours Spent Stooped Over

Most days, you wouldn't find a soul around here. But on this morning, nine people stood shoulder to shoulder in the middle of the river, all prospecting for gold. The shore was littered with buckets, mining pans and shovels.

"Not all that long ago, this would have been underwater," said Jeanne Nelle.

The opening to the river was a mud bath. Prospectors climbed back to land by grabbing onto overhead branches. Some of them held their backs in pain after several hours of stooping over the river.

"It's not for everybody," Farnsworth said. "If it was easy, everybody would be doing it."

It's more a labor of love, really — a throwback to the slow pace of another age.

On this morning, they shoveled muck from the bottom of the river through the sluices to get the "black sand," the material closer to the bottom. Sluices are large metal trays with holes made to filter soil. Gold is heavy. It is eight times heavier than sand and 19 times heavier than water, and falls to the bottom.

"The gold just sits there and waits for somebody to get it — like me," said Adolph Lostaunau, president of the Golden Valley Prospectors Association.

## Looking For Tiny Flakes Of Gold

The black sand was taken in buckets to land. There, it was sifted, handful by handful, and swirled with water until a prospector could "see color" — tiny flakes of gold.

Most prospectors see gold nearly every time, but nuggets are almost never found. Typically, the luckiest ones score a "picker." That's what they call a gold flake heavy enough to make a tiny ping when it lands in a mining pan.

Those who do find actual nuggets speak of them in almost magical terms.

"I found one that big," said Jay O'Dell, holding up a small pebble. O'Dell, who has been prospecting for 40 years, made a pendant out of his nugget. He's never worn it, because he's afraid he'll lose it.

Today, the gold in his pan wouldn't fetch enough money to pay for his gas to get back home. But you never know when you'll find a big one, and that's a notion that has been drawing prospectors to these rivers for a long time.

"Grab a pan, man, and jump in," Farnsworth called over his shoulder as he headed back into the river. "You never know — you might get you a big old nugget."
