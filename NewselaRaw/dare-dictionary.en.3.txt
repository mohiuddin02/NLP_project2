The end may be near for the 50-year-old Dictionary of American Regional English. In a few months, the money to keep it going will run out and people will lose their jobs.

The dictionary is often referred to by its acronym DARE. It includes words from 1,002 communities across the country. These words come from newspapers, books, maps, diaries, newspaper death notices, and long interviews with people.

The dictionary shows the variety of the English language across the United States. There are many different words that mean the same thing. For example, the word dragonfly has 79 regional terms that come from different parts of America. The dictionary explains America's story. The nation is made up of many immigrants who came from other countries. These immigrants brought new words with them. The Irish brought the word brogan, which is a heavy work shoe; the Italians brought vino, a term for wine; the Germans gave us hausfrau for housewife; and the Polish brought over paczki, a filled doughnut.

## Ticklebox Discovery

Discovering such words may seem like a strange goal, but it can be useful.

A couple of months ago, Douglas Kelling, a 68-year-old doctor in North Carolina, was examining an 80-year-old woman who asked: "Doc, how's my ticklebox?" The confused doctor asked what she meant by "ticklebox." "Well, my heart," the woman answered.

In almost 40 years of practice, the doctor has heard patients use many regional terms for illnesses. This was a new one. Kelling believes the dictionary is valuable in helping him understand his patients better.

The dictionary's first editor, Frederic Gomes Cassidy, planned the project. It lasted much longer than its original deadline of 1976. Cassidy died in 2000 at the age of 92.

## Funky Words From A To Z

DARE, based at the University of Wisconsin, finally reached the final volume including "Z words" in 2012. A digital dictionary was published in December 2013.

For years, DARE has had problems with money, but they always managed to find last-minute donations. This time, though, the project will begin its year with less than $100,000. That is less than one-quarter of its usual yearly amount of money.

John Karl Scholz, head of the university's College of Letters and Science, would not comment on the dictionary's situation. Head Editor Joan Houston Hall has spent almost 40 years on the project. She recently sent notices to all four DARE staff members that they might lose their jobs. Without more money for the dictionary, she also will lose her job.

If she cannot find more funding, Hall said she may work for 20 percent of her salary and spend the next year organizing the dictionary's contents.

"I believe in this project. It has been an important gift to the nation and there is still work to be done," Hall said.

## Lots Of Words Are Still Out There

The sense of doom is not obvious at the dictionary's offices where research continues.

Hall scans the digital edition of DARE, looking up the word bittern. It describes a marsh bird, and she admires the more than 50 regional alternatives, including belcher-squelcher, dunkadoo, conk-onk, fly-up-the-creek and wollerkertoot.

There is a belief that the country is losing its diversity of words. These examples demonstrate that there are still a lot of different words out there coming from various regions of America.

The dictionary shows that words continue to travel across the country. Hall has discovered that since the dictionary began, people in Wisconsin have started to change what their word is for a soft drink.

"Fifty years ago it was almost totally pop," Hall said, pointing to a map of the state. "Now soda is coming from the eastern United States and it's pushing out pop."

For years, fishermen and word experts could not agree on what the word scrod meant. They thought it was a type of fish. Instead, Editor George Goebel discovered it was not a term for fish. It actually described the process of lightly salting and grilling a fish.

## Entries Go From Paper To Computer

Goebel also has been working to update the dictionary's storage and editing systems. Many of the entries are still kept on the original paper slips collected in the 1960s by DARE workers who were traveling across America interviewing people and finding new words. Now, Goebel will be putting this information into the computer.

He is doing this to save the dictionary's future, he said. "If there is one. We have to go as if there is."
