BRUSSELS â€” President Barack Obama laid a wreath at the World War I memorial at Flanders Field in Belgium on Wednesday. It was a symbol meant to honor soldiers who died in the war. Obama noted that the war that tore Europe apart, and involved U.S. military forces, still echoes in conflicts 100 years later.

"The lessons of that war speak to us still," Obama said in his first stop since arriving in Belgium late Tuesday.

The president is in Brussels for a summit with European Union leaders. He's also scheduled to meet with the secretary-general of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military alliance of countries that agree to protect each other. Obama will also deliver a speech at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, Belgium's capital.

The agenda, like much of Obama's European trip this week, is expected to be dominated by talk of what is seen as a new threat on Europe's doorstep. Obama and European leaders are to discuss Russia's armed seizure of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine. Obama and Western European countries are seeking to prevent Moscow from moving farther into Ukraine.

## Russia And Ukraine Dominate Talks

Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union, a group of republics controlled by Russia. Ukraine gained its independence when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Ukraine's region of Crimea has a majority of Russians, some of whom want to join Russia. Russia invaded Crimea and is claiming it as part of Russia.

On Tuesday, Obama repeated threats of more painful economic sanctions, or penalties, if Russian President Vladimir Putin sends troops into other regions of Ukraine. Sanctions have already been placed against top Russian officials, freezing the money in some bank accounts and preventing officials from traveling to certain countries. But the president also acknowledged that, for now, Crimea is likely to remain in Russian control. "There's no expectation that they will be dislodged by force," he said in a news conference in The Hague.

Still, Russia's neighbors are looking for assurance that NATO will make good on its obligations to defend them. Other European nations are worried about the effect that deeper sanctions would have on their own fragile economies. Obama's remarks later Wednesday are expected to address such concerns. At the same time, he wants to avoid the type of angry discussions that were common between the United States and Russia during the Cold War era, officials have said.

The president's visit comes 100 years after the outbreak of World War I, an anniversary being widely marked in Europe. Nearly 400 of the more than 1,000 Americans killed in Belgium in World War I are honored at the grassy, 6-acre battlefield at Flanders.

A ceremony was held at the cemetery, the site of a significant WWI battle. Obama, Belgian King Philippe and Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo placed wreaths at a monument erected to the missing dead. In remarks afterward, all three leaders made reference to lessons of the war that apply today.

## "In Flanders Fields"

"Our countries have learned the hard way that national sovereignty quickly reaches its limits when met with heavily armed adversaries," the king said. He noted that his great-grandfather, King Albert, fought in the war. World War I was also called The Great War, and The War To End All Wars.

Di Rupo warned that "those who ignore the past are taking the risk to relive it."

Obama noted that chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, were used to "devastating effect" on Flanders Field. He emphasized that today, in Syria and elsewhere, the world still struggles to eliminate their use.

"We thought we had banished their use to history, and our efforts send a powerful message that these weapons have no place in a civilized world. This is one of the ways that we can honor those who fell here," Obama said. "This visit, this hallowed ground, reminds us that we must never, ever take our progress for granted."

The president also read from the poem "In Flanders Fields" that famously memorialized the fighting at Flanders. Written by John McCrae, a Canadian army doctor, the verse called on history to carry the legacy of the war forward:

_To you from failing hands we throw_  
_The torch; be yours to hold it high_  
_If ye break faith with us who die_  
_We shall not sleep, though poppies grow_  
_In Flanders fields_.
