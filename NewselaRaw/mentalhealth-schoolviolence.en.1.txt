PITTSBURGH — Teaching students alternatives to violence and improving their access to mental-health services are among the ideas officials say they have for preventing school shootings and stabbings that have plagued the U.S.

But they say progress on limiting school violence nationwide has been hindered by a lack of funding. At the same time, the rollout of school-safety programs hasn't worked and schools have failed to properly train staff and students.

"We're 15 years after Columbine, and you'd have thought we would have solved that problem," said John Matthews, who heads up the Texas-based Community Safety Institute. He's referring to the 1999 rampage at Columbine High School in Colorado. In that attack, seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fatally shot 12 students and a teacher and injured about 20 others before committing suicide.

A new Vanderbilt University study suggests that teaching younger students conflict-resolution skills — to think before they act — could be more effective than other techniques for reducing violence.

## The Earlier The Better

The study included a review of 27 school-safety programs nationwide. Discussion sessions were run with Nashville, Tenn., youths who were victims of violence. Researcher Manny Sethi, a trauma surgeon and a Vanderbilt professor, said it may be necessary to teach those problem-solving skills before the high school years.

"At that point, it's very hard to kind of change behavior," Sethi said.

While conflict-resolution skills may help, demand also is growing for improved mental-health services in and out of school.

"There's a lot of hurting kids in our schools," said Beverly Kingston, director of the Center for the Study of the Prevention of Violence at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Like Sethi, Kingston said the earlier that kids are helped, the better. "We need to put in place social-emotional learning programs, starting in preschool," she said.

After the mass stabbings at Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pa., Gov. Tom Corbett emphasized the need to focus on mental-health services. But mental-health professionals in Pennsylvania schools say funding cuts in recent years have prompted reductions in the number of mental health workers. There are now fewer school counselors, social workers and psychologists — doctors who treat mental illnesses.

"The logical response to all of this is to recognize that schools are the first line of defense for mental-health supports for students and to recognize that we are at a shortage" for school counselors, said Julia Szarko, president of the Association of School Psychologists in Pennsylvania.

Szarko said the School District of Philadelphia last year eliminated all of its school counselors to save enough money to maintain its academic program.

## Violence "Rarely Spontaneous"

Steven Berkowitz co-chairs the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry's Disaster and Trauma Committee. He said politicians often follow school tragedies with speeches about dealing with mental health. The problem is they don't follow up with legislation or financial commitments, he said.

"Politicians often aren't specific about these plans because it sounds good, but they are not willing to pay for it," said Berkowitz, also a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., has been encouraging Congress to overhaul mental-health services. He's pushing for a new law, the Helping Families in Crisis Mental Health Act. If passed, it would attempt to improve access to psychiatric care by integrating it into primary-care and pediatric practices.

Violent acts in schools "are rarely spontaneous," Murphy said. Many had "been developing over a long period of time." He says this offers opportunities to step in to fix mental health problems before they become a crisis.

Schools have embraced a variety of measures to keep schools safe. They've tried everything from anti-bullying and zero-tolerance programs to metal detectors and programs that allow students to report threats anonymously.

But some simply don't work, Sethi said. After reviewing data on 27 programs, he and his team decided to try one of them in a violence-plagued Nashville middle school.

Before the study, the students completed questionnaires regarding their beliefs about violence and ability to manage explosive situations. Over several weeks, students used role-playing to learn how to avoid violence at heated moments. Scenarios they worked through included when one student calls another a name or hits on a peer's girlfriend.

## Need For Training

Sethi said the exercises helped students in "understanding conflict and how it progresses and how to get yourself out of it."

After the exercises, researchers handed out a second questionnaire. Students reported that they were less likely than before to be a target of bullying, and less likely to hit or push others. They were also less likely to cheer if a fight broke out and more likely to try to defuse a potential fight.

Even if schools identify them as troubled, students often don't get the help they need, especially not on a consistent, long-term basis, Matthews said. He said Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people and himself during a 2007 shooting rampage at Virginia Tech, received care and monitoring at home.

"When he went to college, that was all out the door, and you saw that downward spiral," Matthews said.

Despite many high-profile incidents of school violence, educators and others have fallen short in key areas, said Matthews.

Instead of tailoring safety plans to their campuses, school officials often use generic plans. The problem is compounded by improper training of staff and students. Crises can occur at the beginning of the school day — such was the case at Franklin Regional. Matthews said schools should drill for crises that might occur then, or in gyms and cafeterias.

"The staff training is minimal at best, and for students, it's even worse," he said.
