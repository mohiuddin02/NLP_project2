An apple can kill, a sprinkle of sprouts can send you to the hospital and your delicious, pan-seared red snapper may actually be a different fish altogether.

Contamination rates by salmonella and other pathogens, or things that cause infections, have not fallen despite increased concerns about food safety. Some are actually on the rise, according to a 2013 report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Each year, foodborne illnesses sicken 48 million Americans, send 128,000 to hospitals and kill 3,000, according to the agency.

Food fraud is also increasing. In 2014, Oceana, an international conservation organization, published a study that found that one-third of food samples it looked at were mislabeled.

Tools to analyze DNA in food items may soon help eliminate these problems.

## Food Organism Databases

Scientists worldwide are working to create databases of tiny organisms found in food, sequence the most common pathogens and tag foods so they can be traced immediately. The new plan promises to speed investigations and reduce foodborne illnesses and deaths. The techniques could also spot fake food.

Genome Trakr is a five-year collaboration between the University of California, Davis; the Agilent Technologies company, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The program promises to perform whole genome sequencing on 100,000 types of common foodborne pathogens.

The technology maps the entire DNA sequence of a microbe. It allows scientists to distinguish one strain from another, allowing earlier elimination of outbreaks around the world. The project began in March 2012 and the database, hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, will be available online and at no cost to researchers and public health officials. The zoom-in detail of a sequenced genome will make it possible to distinguish different strains of a microbe that are otherwise indistinguishable. It will let scientists trace back a small outbreak before it becomes widespread.

Right now that kind of trace-back is difficult without detailed information about people becoming sick. A recent study from Cornell University suggests the new technology is an effective and faster replacement. Using whole genome sequencing, researchers were able to find double the number of cases from a 2010 salmonella outbreak at a long-term health care facility in New York City. They even found cases outside the region.

## Outbreaks Nipped In The Bud

Whole genome sequencing has already helped stop serious food outbreaks. In 2012, researchers isolated the specific strain in a salmonella outbreak in tuna sushi that made 258 people sick. The salmonella was tracked back to a processing plant in India. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated the plant and found 10 sanitation slip-ups, including four outright violations of safety rules.

In 2014, the FDA was able to halt a U.S. Listeria outbreak that had killed one and sickened seven others. They genotyped and linked the strain to soft Hispanic-style cheeses manufactured by a company that was later shut down by the FDA.

The gigantic Genome Trakr database should speed up this kind of detective work by providing an enormous volume of information that has already been analyzed. The project's director, U.C. Davis microbiologist Bart Weimer, said, "We've just extended the project to China, and they will map another 10,000 genomes and deposit them."

## Project Goal On Track

Sequencing a whole genome is only one of the new approaches to food safety. Food fraud prevention is also benefiting from a large international project called the International Barcode of Life (iBOL). The project is building a genetic library of all life on Earth. It offers a global online database of DNA labels, sort of like the bar codes on food packaging.

The project has already created more than 2.6 million bar-code records for almost 200,000 species of plants and animals. The project's goal is to reach 500,000 by the end of 2015. The iBOL can already distinguish farmed from wild salmon because they are two different species.

A 2015 report from the CDC used bar coding to identify imported poisonous puffer fish that were being sold in the United States as nonpoisonous varieties. "DNA testing is often the only way to correctly identify food and medicinal products," said researcher Mark Stoeckle.

## Quick-Read Codes

Finally, inspired by the bar-coding idea, one new company, DNATrek, is creating synthetic bar codes for food items. The technology consists of DNA sequences extracted from plants; it is an odorless, colorless and tasteless material that can be mixed with waxes and oils already used and then sprayed on foods. The DNA sequences act like invisible bar codes and can be applied at different points where food is moved: the farm, the sorting facility, the distributor, the packer and even the retailer.

"When an outbreak occurs," said company founder Anthony Zografos, the tags can be read in about 20 minutes. The food can then be traced back to where it came from immediately, not in weeks or months like before, he said.

The codes can also help check the authenticity of a product like Italian extra virgin olive oil, which is often diluted by cheaper oils. DNATrek's technology has been approved by the FDA, and this year will be tested in the U.S. food system.

DNA Trek's Zografos thinks that smartphones may one day have apps that can actually detect bacterial contamination or viruses. Then we can hold our phones over a fish fillet to make sure we know what we are eating.
