CHICAGO â€” Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel began his second term as mayor on Monday. He took the unusual step of focusing his inaugural address on a single problem: The city's disadvantaged young people.

The mayor's decision to home in on one of Chicago's most troublesome problems meant he only spoke briefly about the city's money problems. These problems have left the city's pension plan without enough money in it. Pension plans provide money to public workers like firefighters, police and teachers when they retire from working, or become injured and can no longer work.

Second inaugural speeches tend to be trickier for elected officials than the first. The first time, they often talk about what they will do in office. The second time, they often talk about what good things they've done and list what is important for the second term. Emanuel's decision to draw attention to a single problem is not common.

## A Divided City?

The mayor chose to focus on the lack of opportunities in many of the neighborhoods that the city's minorities live in, by talking about the city's young people. By doing this, Emanuel took on one of the top complaints against him during the campaign: He's a mayor who has let Chicago stay divided between the rich and everyone else.

The mayor spoke about the city's troubled youths, describing them as children who live in poverty. He said they fail to receive a proper education and may turn to a life of crime.

During his speech, Emanuel said it is a problem that is often ignored. He said that he wanted to bring attention to it, so that the city's young people do not become "another lost generation."

Emanuel listed a number of programs he said had made a difference for kids from poorer families. He pointed to examples of students who have succeeded in such situations.

One example was the story of Marcus Norris. He was sitting in his house as a 9-year-old when a "gunshot came through the window and knocked out four of his teeth."

For the next nine years, the mayor said, Norris was too embarrassed to smile. Then, he entered the Becoming a Man program. There, his counselor Timothy Jackson gave Norris confidence and raised money to get the student's teeth fixed.

## Chicago's Money Problems

Still, Emanuel said, much more has to be done.

Before Monday's speech, much of the attention had been on Chicago's money problems.

Both the city and Chicago Public Schools owe large amounts of money. Emanuel is having difficulties getting money to fund the pension plan. The city and school district's credit ratings have been called "junk," which means ratings agencies on Wall Street think the city will have a hard time paying back the money it owes, or its debt. Also, Emanuel is trying to figure out a new job agreement between the city and its teachers so they don't go on strike.

The mayor didn't mention most of that Monday. He touched on the city's money problems only briefly at the beginning of his speech.

Alderman Scott Waguespack noticed. He is on the City Council and is against Emanuel. He said that it was a "nice speech," but Emanuel failed to mention the pension and money problems. He said he is worried that Emanuel hasn't come up with anything yet.

## "To Spark Hope"

Alderman Joe Moore also found the speech surprising, though, he said "in a good way."

He said that everyone expected him to talk about the money problems facing the city. Instead Emanuel spoke about the problems young people in Chicago face. This could be an equally if not more important challenge, said Moore, who supports Emanuel.

Former President Bill Clinton attended the ceremony, and more people clapped for Clinton than Emanuel when he was introduced.

Emanuel briefly mentioned that the city had made progress on schools, safety and some money problems. The rest of Emanuel's address discussed Chicago's children. However, he did not offer many new ideas to address the problems with crime, money and education in Chicago.

Instead, Emanuel tried to use his speech to make the youth the city's main problem to solve.

"Over the next four years, I will do everything in my power to spark hope in the eyes of every Chicagoan," Emanuel said. "Today I challenge every citizen of this great city: You must do your part."
