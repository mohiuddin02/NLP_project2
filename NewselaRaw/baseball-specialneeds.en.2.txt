CHICAGO — Nicole Giambalvo and Kathryn Dungan had met together three times, but Dungan hadn't spoken to her yet. Giambalvo was worried that she wouldn't be able to connect with Dungan.

The girls were paired in the Rising Stars Buddy Baseball program in suburban Wheaton, Illinois. The program matches students with special needs with partners on the field. At the time they met, Dungan, then 13, was shy. She preferred nail polish and Disney princesses to running bases and wearing a batting helmet.

Today, Giambalvo and Dungan are both 18. Now, they count down the days each week until they can see each other again on a baseball field. The pair gets together for five Tuesdays in July and August. They hold hands as Giambalvo leads Dungan to first base after her hit goes airborne, and they giggle together in the outfield while waiting to make a catch.

The girls' bond doesn't end on the baseball field. It spills over to Taylor Swift concerts, trips to the local swimming pool and other activities. The girls have been friends for five years now.

## Understanding And Openness

Buddy Baseball exposes young people with special needs to sports with the help of kids without similar challenges.

The number of "buddy" or "inclusion companion" sporting opportunities is multiplying across the country. Supporters of children with special needs say they allow young people today to grow up with a better understanding and openness toward people with disabilities. Generations before them weren't as open-minded.

Special Olympics Unified Sports is an international program. It puts athletes with special needs on the same fields as athletes who can play normally. Since the mid-1980s, it has grown to include 115,000 people in the U.S. and 700,000 around the world, according to Amie Dugan of Special Olympics North America.

"Being a teammate and playing together on a team is one of the fastest shortcuts to friendship and understanding," Dugan said.

## Making A Connection

In Wheaton, the Buddy Baseball program is now in its 23rd season. Many of the 80 players and 100 buddies keep returning after many years. Surrounded by family and friends, who pull up lawn chairs and pack coolers to cheer them on, buddies and players on eight teams compete against each other on baseball fields at Briar Patch Park.

Every player bats once in each inning. The teams, which are more interested in having fun than keeping score, play until the games end at a set time.

"It is awesome," said Becky Herbold, chairman of the Wheaton Junior Women's Club Buddy Baseball program. "Even as the participants get older and could move on, they keep coming back."

Giambalvo was inspired to become a buddy at the Wheaton program after watching her older brother participate. She recalls being unsure of how to gain the trust of Dungan when they were introduced.

Dungan has cognitive and expressive delays, which makes her slow to speak and express herself. During the buddies' first several meetings, she stayed quiet. However, in time, Giambalvo learned she could motivate her new friend by pretending they are princesses, not baseball players. She listened to the way Dungan interacted with her parents and two brothers, then used similar phrasing to prompt a response, she said.

## A Lasting Friendship

MK Dungan, Kathryn's mother, said she searched for years to find meaningful activities for her daughter. After finding Buddy Baseball, she was thrilled to see Kathryn enjoying the weekly baseball outing. Kathryn even talked about it for days beforehand.

"As a parent, you just want your kids to be happy no matter what their needs are," she said. "But when your kid clicks with someone who really cares about them and wants to make them happy … there is nothing like it." She's "so thankful that this exists for them."

Some pairs have been together for several years, returning home from college and even full-time jobs to be back on the field with their old friend. There is no age limit for participants.

Giambalvo is now a student at Elmhurst College. She said she plans to keep returning to Briar Patch Park in Wheaton each summer for as long as she can to spend time with Dungan, whom she now counts among her closest friends.

"She's taught me probably more than I've taught her," Giambalvo said.
