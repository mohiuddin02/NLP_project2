COMPTON, Calif. — Compton student Edgar Ruelas is in eighth grade. He wants to be the first in his family to go to college.

He has some help from talent agents from Hollywood. The agents work with famous actors, musicians and sports players. They help them get jobs. They also help them make good money.

## Helping Students Do Well

Now, they're helping students do well in school. They are mentoring them. A mentor is like a coach, helping someone do well.

Agents from William Morris Endeavor (WME) have been meeting with students. They work with two Compton schools.

Students visit William Morris in Beverly Hills. It is a Hollywood agency. It works with stars like Ben Affleck, Oprah Winfrey and Justin Timberlake. The stars are their clients.

"At first I was pretty nervous about meeting WME. I was scared. I didn't really know any mentors," said Edgar. He goes to Whaley Middle School. "But now I do — we are pretty close now — and they are like my friends."

## Fixing Up A School

The program is a special project for William Morris.

WME has spent more than $1 million on the schools. Most of the money went to Stephen C. Foster Elementary School. The library and playground were fixed up and improved. Murals were painted on the walls. The bathrooms were fixed. WME also got its stars to give their time and money.

Before WME started helping, Foster had serious problems.

The bathrooms were in bad shape. Some kids were holding it because they didn't want to use the bathroom.

## Helping With Homework

But the program is really about one-on-one mentoring. Every other Wednesday, the students go to WWE's office. They have meals with the agents.

"They help you with your homework. Once you are done, you can have fun," said Tytis Barnett. He is a seventh-grader at Whaley.

Agency leaders say the idea is simple: Treat the school like a Hollywood client.

"When you have an actor, you say, 'How can we move his career along?' We are problem solvers," said Patrick Whitesell of WME. "We say, 'What are Foster's problems?'"

## Dreaming Of College

Edgar talked about getting through middle school with good grades. Agent Nancy Josephson is his mentor. She encouraged him. Then Edgar shared his dream of going to college.

William Morris agents are proud of the program. They hope it will be used by other businesses.

Maybe some of the students will join William Morris someday. A few students hope to become talent agents.
