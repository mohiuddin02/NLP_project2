WASHINGTON â€” On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will consider the case of a California man whose smartphone got him in serious trouble. What they decide will affect everyone with a cellphone.

In 2009, David Leon Riley's smartphone was searched by police. It was loaded with pictures and some of them looked suspicious. Riley got arrested.

Police searched Riley's phone without a warrant. In other words, they looked through the phone without getting permission from a judge.

Riley's case will address an important question: Should warrant-less searches of cellphones be allowed?

The Supreme Court must decide if smartphones are covered by the Fourth Amendment. Amendments are changes to the U.S. Constitution. The Fourth Amendment provides protection against unreasonable searches.

## Updating 200-Year-Old Rules

The Court's decisions will update rules made long ago. Those rules were written years before smartphones existed.

A modern smartphone, lawyer Jeffrey L. Fisher noted, contains a lot of information about us. It can let other people know about the owner's private life. Police, he said, should not be allowed to poke through cellphones.

Fisher is representing Riley in court. Riley's case will be heard along with a separate phone-search case. That case involves a man named Brima Wurie.

The outcome of the two cases could be very important. Both police and phone users might be affected significantly.

Some are worried about what it would mean if the Court rules against Riley and Wurie. This kind of decision, they say, would make it far too easy to find private information. In the United States, almost all adults use cellphones. More than half of adults own a smartphone. These new phones store much more information than older phones did.

Law enforcement officials are worried as well. Without cellphone searches, they believe, it'll be harder to catch criminals.

## "Treasure Trove" Of Information

California officials say cellphones shouldn't be given special protection. Police can search someone they have arrested for things that are in paper form. For example, photos, videos and letters can all be taken away and looked at. So why should these types of things be off-limits when they are on a cellphone?

The Riley and Wurie cases will be argued on Tuesday morning.

"I think the Riley case, in particular, is incredibly important," lawyer Elizabeth B. Wydra said. "It should be important for everyone who has a smartphone."

Riley was pulled over by a San Diego police officer on Aug. 22, 2009. Police seized his car because he was driving with a suspended license. In a search that followed, officers found two guns.

A police officer then scrolled through Riley's phone. It was filled with video clips and pictures. There were clips of gang fights and pictures of gang signs. Worst of all for Riley, there were clips of a certain red car. That car had allegedly been used in an earlier gang shooting.

Riley was convicted on charges that included attempted murder. The 23-year-old was sentenced to prison for 15 years to life.

The Wurie case also involves a warrant-less search of a cellphone. Wurie was busted by Boston police on drug and gun charges. After his arrest, cops checked his phone's call log. That allowed them to see who Wurie had been talking to.

Wurie was found guilty in 2009. He is now serving a 262-month prison term.

The Riley case may prove to be the more important of the two. It deals directly with the way modern smartphones store so much private information.

"You're talking about a treasure trove" of information, Wydra said. And it's "the kind of information that we think of as deeply private."
