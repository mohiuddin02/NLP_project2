LONDON â€” American and British intelligence agencies have taken their spying from reality into fantasy.

The world's most powerful spy groups have been sending undercover agents into the worlds of online games. They are watching activity in games such as "World of Warcraft," news organizations reported.

The New York Times, the Guardian and ProPublica all reported on the spying on Monday. They said U.S. and U.K. spies have spent years looking in online games for terrorists or people who give them information.

The stories were based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, who used to do work for the National Security Agency (NSA). The leaked information shows just how far America's spying campaign has gone. Even fantasy worlds aren't beyond the attention of the NSA and the British spy agency GCHQ.

## Millions Of Gamers Watched

Virtual universes like "World of Warcraft"  draw in millions of players. Those players spend months' worth of real-world time competing with other players for online glory, virtual treasure and magical loot. At its height, "World of Warcraft" had 12 million paying subscribers. That is more than the population of Greece.

Millions more people are in other online worlds. These include Linden Labs' "Second Life" while the various games on Microsoft's Xbox host millions more. Xbox is home to "Halo," the popular science fiction-themed shoot-em-up.

Spy agencies have long worried that such games serve as a good cover for enemies. Those people could use in-game messaging systems to swap information. In one of the documents mentioned Monday, the NSA warned that the games could give terrorists a place to "hide in plain sight."

Linden Labs and Microsoft Inc. did not immediately return messages seeking comment. In a statement, Blizzard Entertainment said that it did not know of any spying taking place. "If it was, it would have been done without our knowledge or permission," the company said.

Microsoft issued a similar statement. It said it did not know about any monitoring. "If it has occurred as reported, it certainly wasn't done with our consent," Microsoft said.

## Profiling The Players?

The 82-page-document was published on The New York Times website. It noted that opponents could use video games to recruit other users. They could also hold weapons training, the document said. The Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers had used flight simulation software to hone their skills, the document said.

Important details were not clear, the Times and ProPublica said. How did the agencies get access to gamers' information? How many players were watched? Were Americans swept up in the spying? Still, the reports point to a determined effort to get inside a world many people associate with adolescents and shut-ins.

At the request of GCHQ, the NSA began pulling "World of Warcraft" information from its global spying operation. It tried to tie specific accounts and characters to Islamic extremism and weapons trading, the Guardian reported.

Intelligence on the fantasy world could eventually translate to real-world success, one of the documents suggested. "World of Warcraft" players included "telecom engineers, embassy drivers, scientists, the military and other intelligence agencies," it said.

"World of Warcraft" wasn't the only target. Another memo noted that GCHQ had "successfully been able to get the discussions between different game players on Xbox Live." Meanwhile, so many U.S. spies were roaming around "Second Life" that a special unit was set up to prevent them from stepping on each other's toes.
