WASHINGTON â€” South Florida's coral reefs are a natural wonder. They are beautiful underwater ecosystems.

Thousands of kinds of fish live in the reefs. So do other kinds of animals and plants.

The reefs are not just pretty. They are very important to South Florida. Divers, boaters and fishermen come from all over to see them. They spend a lot of money on their visits. Their spending helps give jobs to a lot of people.

But South Florida's reefs have been doing very badly for years. Pollution is to blame. Higher water temperatures hurt too. Many people worry that the reefs might die out completely.

## Some Reefs Growing Larger

Now, at last, things seem to be getting better.

There have been no big storms for a while. And no big ships have hit the reefs. This has stopped reefs from dying out more. They have even grown larger in some places.

And now there is more good news. Scientists thought that coral reefs would be hurt if the sea got any warmer. Now it seems they can take some warming. This is important because sea temperatures are rising.

But reefs can only take a little warming. So we have to keep water temperatures from getting too high.

There is one good way to do this: burning less fuels.

## Healthy Reefs Mean Jobs

Driving a car burns fuel. Heating a house burns fuel. Running a factory burns fuel. All these things put carbon dioxide in the air. This is making temperatures rise slowly. People call it [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).

Chris Bergh is a conservationist. Conservationists try to protect animals and plants. They also protect water. He says people are thinking differently now. They realize we have to take better care of coral reefs. Figuring out how to burn less fuel will help.

But saving reefs isn't only about conservation. It's also about jobs and money.

"Without reefs, you don't have fish," said businessman Jeff Torode. "Without fish, you don't have divers." And "you don't have snorkelers."

And what would no divers and snorkelers mean? A lot less money for South Florida.
