Hugo Chavez was president of Venezuela. He died March 5. His fiery personality made him both loved and hated. He fought against poverty and U.S. power. He was 58 and had battled cancer for several years.

Chavez rose from a poor childhood to become a revolutionary. He wanted to challenge U.S. power in Latin America. He was president for 14 years. That makes him the longest-serving elected president in the Americas.

## Humble Origins

Chavez was born July 28, 1954. He was one of seven children. His family lived in a dirt-floor home. He had a mixed background: Spanish, African, and Native American. His parents, though both teachers, had little money. They sent him to live with his grandmother. He dreamed of becoming a baseball player. However, at age 17 he entered Venezuela's military academy.

After graduating from the academy, he joined an anti-rebel unit. He hated hunting the rebels. He thought they were treated badly. Chavez's hero was Simon Bolivar, the 19th-century Venezuelan leader. Bolivar wanted a united Latin America. He overthrew the Spanish rulers. Like his hero, Chavez wanted a revolution. He thought the government leaders were selfish. He felt they did not help the poor.

## Rise To Power

In February 1992, Chavez tried to take over the government. He failed and spent two years in jail. When he was released, he became a politician. He ran for president in 1998 and won with more than half of the vote.

During his presidency, Chavez opened grocery stores that sold food at very cheap prices. He gave health care and education to the poor.

But he also took over farms and businesses from private owners and gave them to the state. That angered many rich and middle-class Venezuelans. Street protests erupted. Chavez was forced out of power in 2002. Two days later the military restored him to power. But soon he took over the national oil company. Another protest almost pushed him out of office again. He was reelected in 2006 and 2012, but by 2012 he was ill with cancer.

## Star On The World Stage

Venezuela has a large oil supply. It sells the oil to other countries for lots of money. Chavez used the oil wealth to gain influence. He gave billions of dollars in cheap oil to Cuba each year. Beginning in 2005, Chavez gave cheap heating oil to poor people in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York. Chavez made several speeches at the United Nations. During one speech in 2006, he called U.S. President George W. Bush "the devil." Chavez criticized the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He made friends with enemies of the United States, such as Iran.

Chavez had a weekly TV program that sometimes lasted seven hours. He was both the host and guest. The show was called "Hello President." It featured Chavez speaking, singing and dancing. He sometimes used it to criticize the United States. In February 2005, he said the U.S. was planning to kill him. "If I am assassinated there is only one person responsible, the president of the United States," Chavez said. In later years, he used Twitter. He gained four million followers; he gave his three millionth follower a free home.

## Abuse Of Power

Even though he was elected, critics said Chavez acted like a dictator. He was accused of dominating the courts, Congress and the media. He changed Venezuela's Constitution to let him run permanently for president.

However, even his critics admit that he gave the poor a voice. But many Venezuelans remain poor, even though they got some help from Chavez. Many feel less wealthy because the economy weakened and prices on basic goods rose. Crime increased during Chavez's presidency. Venezuela's capital, Caracas, became one of the most dangerous capitals in the world.

Despite the criticisms, Chavez is a hero to many Venezuelans. Huge crowds gathered to see his coffin carried through the capital. They wanted to say goodbye to their leader.
