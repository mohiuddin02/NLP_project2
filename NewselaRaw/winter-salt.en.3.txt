SEDALIA, Mo. â€” Cities and towns across the country are running low of an important substance this winter: road salt.

The salt is used to melt ice and keep roads safe. But this winter has been particularly harsh. The weather doesn't look like it is getting any better, either. States and counties say rock salt supplies are at an all-time low.

Pettis County, Missouri, is an example. Dirty rocks of salt are packed in a storage shed in the county. The county just received 8 inches of snow in a nasty storm that closed schools for two days.

There are about 200 tons of salt left piled here. That may not be enough. The county started out the winter with 600 tons. Last winter it used only 50.

"If we don't have more ice storms we'll be fine," County Commissioner Brent Hampy said. The wind whipped his cheeks in the 11-degree chill. "But if we have two more ice storms, we're going to be out."

## "We're Totally Out"

The cold has spread over so much of the country, there's more demand than usual. Salt mines are making the maximum amount they can each day. Nevertheless, they are still forced to ration supplies, and give only a portion of what their customers order. Some cities are so low on salt that they are choosing to salt only main roads. They use sand for the rest.

"I think pretty much every salt mine in the country is out now, or very nearly," said Harold Mayo, general manager of the Hutchinson Salt Mine in Kansas. Much of the Midwest's salt is mined at Hutchinson. "It's just a very unusual winter as far as demand."

The mine is producing its maximum daily amount of 3,300 tons of salt. But people who call trying to buy salt are still being turned away. Places that have a contract are first in line.

Households that use salt to make their walkways and stairs less slippery are also being hit. Hardware stores in Missouri and Kansas said they were out of salt.

"We have seen a large demand for ice melt," said Tara Gudger, a Lowe's spokeswoman. The company keeps working with suppliers to get more salt, she said.

Many private snowplow companies are out of salt too. Jileen Wingerter works at Marcum's Landscaping near Kansas City, Mo. She said her firm was told it couldn't order any more. States and cities had too much demand. "We're totally out," she said.

Wichita, Kan., placed an order for 1,000 tons of salt in December. It received only 800. It's mostly using sand for its roads, said Joe Pajor, deputy director at the Department of Public Works.

## Using Syrup, Juice And Brine

Some places are trying to mix salt with other things to keep the roads safe. They are using beet syrup, potato juice and even cheese brine. Tomatoes and a corn-based product are also used to improve how well the salt sticks. That cuts down on the amount of salt they use. The products started appearing in the late 1990s. But they have been used a lot more because people are worried that salt is making groundwater supplies dirty.

"We can cut your salt usage by a third, saving people some money in the long run," said Mike Demaray. He is the sales manager for Beet 55, one of the mixing options. The sticky stuff turns the snow a brownish color.

Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation is trying out Beet Heet. The product is made from processed sugar beet molasses. Other states are using the same or similar products.

Officials are also trying deal with the shortage by moving salt around the country. They want to get it from places it isn't needed to places that have nearly run out. Two ships carrying about 50,000 tons of salt arrived Wednesday in Wisconsin to help supply communities in need.

"We have enough in the state, but just not in the right places," said Michael Sproul. He is an engineer for the state. Storm after storm this winter has eaten up 60 percent more salt than the average used during the last five winters, he said.

In New York, the state is changing rules to get salt where it is needed. It is not enforcing federal limits on driving hours for salt truck drivers. The drivers can work as long as they have to now until the emergency is over. Transportation officials also waived weight restrictions on bridges to allow larger loads of salt to move through.

Some counties may not be ordering up more salt any time soon, even if they can get it. That's because the demand is so high that the price has doubled, Pettis County's Hampy said.
