BALTIMORE â€” Ray Rice was cut from his football team on Monday after a video came out that showed him hitting his girlfriend.

The video showed Rice, who played  for the Baltimore Ravens, hitting Janay Palmer. She is Rice's wife. But at the time, they were engaged to be married.

Rice hit Palmer in February. There was an older video that showed Rice dragging a knocked-out Palmer out of a casino elevator. It did not show Rice hitting Palmer.

When the first video was shown, the NFL said Rice wouldn't be allowed to play for two games. Many people thought the punishment was too light for such a serious crime.

## New Video Changes Things

Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, was in charge of punishing Rice.

After hearing from people who were angry at the punishment, Goodell apologized. He wrote a letter to the owners of all of the NFL teams. He said that he was sorry for not making the punishment harsher.

Changes were also made for the NFL. Now if a player hits a family member or girlfriend, he will not be allowed to play for six games.

The 27-year-old Rice was sent to court after the February incident. But in May he was accepted into a program that allowed him to avoid jail time.

The new video changed things. It showed Rice and Palmer in an elevator at a casino in New Jersey. They both hit each other. Then, Rice knocked Palmer off her feet. As she fell, her head hit a handrail in the elevator. The fall knocked her out.

The Ravens said earlier Monday that they had never seen the new video. Hours later, they said that Rice would not be playing for their team anymore.

## "I Let So Many People Down"

The NFL also acted. Goodell, who leads the NFL, announced that Rice would not be allowed to play in the NFL until further notice.

For his earlier penalty of a two-game suspension, Rice was not allowed to play in Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals. But he was supposed to play again after Thursday's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

After the newest video came out, the NFL decided to not let Rice play at all.

Rice hasn't spent a lot of time talking to the media since his arrest. On July 31, he called his actions "inexcusable" and said this was "something I have to live with the rest of my life."

He said, "I know that's not who I am as a man. That's not who my mom raised me to be. I let her down, I let my wife down, I let my daughter down. I let so many people down because of 30 seconds of my life that I know I can't take back."
