WASHINGTON — Last month, the Library of Congress had a special royal visit from Britain's Princess Anne. As she moved through the library's Thomas Jefferson Building, the princess was greeted by trumpeters and choirs.

The princess was there to lend the library one of just four surviving original copies of the Magna Carta. Written in 1215, the historic document is the basis for Western legal rights. It gave people in England their rights as citizens and influenced U.S. laws, including the U.S. Constitution.

Princess Anne was the reason for the big event. However, the distinguished white-haired man who sat next to her was the one who made it happen, and who makes everything happen at the Library of Congress: James H. Billington.

## "It's The Greatest Revolution"

For more than 25 years, Billington has been the librarian of Congress. He is in charge of overseeing the library's vast holdings. Only a dozen others have held the post since the library began in 1800.

In the age of the Internet, the title "librarian of Congress" might sound old-fashioned. Yet the 85-year-old scholar is very much up to date. He has been one of the country's strongest promoters of the goals of putting the library's collections online and of expanding its educational outreach through new technology.

The World Digital Library (WDL) is just one of the projects Billington has championed. Begun in 2009, the WDL links libraries around the world.

"It's the greatest revolution since the invention of movable type and the printing press," he said of the Internet.

Billington is a keeper of American culture, not just the keeper of books. He is charged with preserving the past while also expanding the library's reach by keeping in tune with the present. His mission extends beyond books to music, film and various other art forms.

## Lifelong Learning At The Library

The Library of Congress holds more than 23 million books, along with many millions of other kinds of publications, from newspapers to sheet music. There are also more than 100 million items in the special collections.

The collection represents the "intellectual and cultural creativity of the people of the United States," Billington said.

Last month, he presented the Library of Congress' Gershwin Prize for Popular Song to musician Billy Joel. This week he announced 25 additions to the National Film Registry. The Registry lists movies that are essential to American film history, and those that make the cut are preserved at the library. New entries on the list include noted movies such as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."

"We're really in the education business," Billington said. "Lifelong learning is our brand new theme."

The books and other materials Billington oversees are stored in four buildings. Three are located on Capitol Hill, across the street from the United States Capitol Building, while a fourth is in Virginia.

## The Job Keeps Him Busy

Billington also has been a force behind library-sponsored events like the National Book Festival.

He oversees the cultural center where the Magna Carta — on loan from England — is on display. The exhibition also will display pieces from the library's own collection, including George Washington's draft of the U.S. Constitution, complete with handwritten notes.

"Jim has done a spectacular job in reinventing the job of librarian of Congress," said David Rubenstein, the library's head fundraiser. He raises money to help pay for the library's work.

Billington has opened up the library, by making it easier for ordinary people to use and by putting so much material online, Rubenstein said. "He's as good a librarian as we've ever had."

## All About History

A lifelong scholar, Billington is an expert on Russia and the former Soviet Union. He has written five books, mostly about Russia. He also wrote and narrated a PBS-TV documentary on Russia and in 1988 accompanied President Ronald Reagan to a nuclear summit in Moscow.

Billington served in the U.S. Army and then taught history at Harvard University and Princeton. In 1987, President Reagan appointed him librarian of Congress, which is a lifetime position.

While Billington enjoyed the Magna Carta event with Princess Anne — "this was quite special," he said — he did not grow up around the wealthy and powerful. He points to his humble beginnings in the Philadelphia area. During the Great Depression, a time of widespread poverty, his father would bring home cheap used books that cost just 5 cents to reward his children.

Billington said he is in good health and has no plans to retire anytime soon. His mission, he said, is to continue to make the vast collection assigned to his care more easily available to the public.

Billington feels as if he has been entrusted with a huge responsibility. It is his duty, he said, to protect, preserve and promote his country's culture and history.
