PARIS â€” In France, rich students do better than poorer students. There is an especially big difference in math.

To fix this, France is trying a new plan. It wants to make all schools better.

The changes will start in 2016.

Many students learn to speak Latin and ancient Greek. These languages have not been spoken in thousands of years. Instead, students will spend more time on languages people speak today.

Students will start learning another language in about first grade. Most students will learn English. They will begin their second language around age 12. Schools will also decide how students spend more of their time. Right now the government decides what students can do.

## All Is Not Well In French Education

The plan is not popular with everyone. Some groups do not want the schools to change. On Tuesday, teachers across France went on strike. They did not show up to work. Instead, they marched in the streets.

Many French teachers complain the plan does not deal with the real problem. They are unhappy the government did not ask them about what was best. Other groups do not want France's schools to change either. They think the plan will make the schools worse.

Peter Gumbel lives in Paris. He wrote a book about French schools. He said the plan is not different enough. The school problem in France is important.

Still, he said the government cannot make big changes. As it is, the plan makes many people feel uncomfortable.

## "Too Many Middle Schoolers Are Falling Behind"

In 2012, experts studied differences between how well rich and poor children did in school. There was a big difference. Rich children did much better at math. Thirty-nine countries took part in the study. France was the second worst at having equal education for all children.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls is a lawmaker for the French government. He said too many middle schoolers are falling behind. Also, they do not know other languages.

This is a big problem for France and its children, he said.

## One Says Many Students Don't Learn At All

Gumbel said the plan makes school more interesting and fun. It teaches kids what they need to know about the real world.

Some people against the plan think students already get rewarded for hard work. They think students learn great things in French schools. Gumbel says they are wrong.

Many kids do not learn anything at all, Gumbel said.
