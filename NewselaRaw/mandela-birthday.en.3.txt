PRETORIA, South Africa â€” Huge crowds gathered outside a hospital to sing on Thursday. They were there to wish Nelson Mandela a happy birthday. Mandela used to be president of South Africa and every July 18 is known as Mandela Day to celebrate his life. It was his 95th birthday.

He is being treated for a lung infection. South Africans arrived outside to let Mandela know how much they care. They danced, played music, sang and laughed. They paid tribute to the man who brought them freedom.

In South Africa, you can't go far without hearing a vuvuzela. These popular and very loud plastic horns were also blown outside the hospital.

Mandela led the fight to end laws that separated people by the color of their skin. White people ruled South Africa. Black people were not allowed to vote or own land.

## South Africa's First Black President

Mandela believed that all people should have equal rights. He was locked up in prison for 27 years because he didn't agree with the government. Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994.

On June 8 he was taken to the hospital with a lung infection. He has been very ill since then. People have brought gifts to the hospital. A wall outside is full of flowers, art and letters for him.

But Mandela is getting better. On Wednesday, his daughter Zindzi said that his health had improved greatly. She also said that he might be able to return home soon.

Mandela's family gathered to celebrate his birthday inside the hospital. South African President Jacob Zuma visited the national hero on Thursday morning.

Mandela is affectionately known as Madiba, the name given to him by his African clan. Zuma said that"Madiba remains in hospital" but that his health is steadily improving.

The president wished Mandela a joyous 95th birthday. Zuma thanked the people for supporting Mandela through his illness and giving him the biggest birthday celebration ever this year.

## A Huge 95

The country's newspapers celebrated Mandela's birthday. The Sowetan paper showed a huge 95 with photographs of the leader. The Citizen's front page just said "Happy Birthday!"

South Africans around the county contributed 67 minutes of community service. This matches Mandela's 67 years of public work. Members of Mandela's family visited schools and hospitals. Other South Africans gave food to the homeless, picked up garbage, or cleaned hospitals.

Grace Shongoane, 23, a receptionist, visited the hospital. She then planned to go to the Lesedi orphanage in Mamelodi township, east of Pretoria.

She said she wanted to tell the children what Mandela had done for South Africa. "As a man, he's got a very good heart because he thought of us when he was fighting for freedom. He thought of us."

Timothy Sepeng took a group of children to the hospital. "I came today to wish our President Tata a speedy recovery," he said. "He's very much important to me because he has made me what I am today. I'm free because of him. I'm free. And I've got the freedom to do anything I like."

Tata is another name for Mandela. It means father. He is often seen as the "Father of the Nation."
