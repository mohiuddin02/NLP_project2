EDINBURGH, Scotland â€” Scottish voters rejected independence on Thursday, deciding to remain part of the United Kingdom. The historic referendum, or vote, shook the country to its core.

The decision prevented a breakup of a 307-year union with England, bringing a huge sigh of relief to Britain's long-standing political leaders. Scots voted 55 percent to 45 percent against independence, with a greater percentage of people casting votes than ever before.

Independence was a long-cherished goal for Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond who led an impassioned campaign to launch a new state. But a majority of voters chose instead the security offered by remaining in the United Kingdom.

Salmond accepted the results, saying "we know it is a majority for the No campaign" and called on Scots to accept the results of the vote.

Despite his defeat, he said the vote "has been a triumph for the democratic process."

## A "Heads Versus Hearts" Campaign

Salmond had argued that Scotland could go it alone because it is rich in oil and the Scots have high levels of ingenuity and education. He said Scotland would flourish on its own, free of interference from any London-based government.

Nonetheless, Salmond came close to winning independence and still won a promise of new powers for Scotland from London politicians who were rattled by the campaign.

Many saw it as a "heads versus hearts" campaign. On the one side were cautious older Scots concluding that the financial risk of independence was too great. On the other side were younger ones Scots who fell in love with the idea of building their own country.

The result saves British Prime Minister David Cameron from a historic defeat.

## "No Narrow Nationalism"

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a Scot, returned to the spotlight, crisscrossing Scotland in support of the union in the final days before the referendum vote. Brown rejected the notion that independence was the patriotic choice. He argued passionately that Scots could be devoted to Scotland but still proud of their place in the United Kingdom.

"There is not a cemetery in Europe that does not have Scots, English, Welsh and Irish lined side by side," Brown said in his final speech before the vote. "We not only won these wars together, we built the peace together. What we have built together by sacrificing and sharing, let no narrow nationalism split asunder."

Cameron is aware that his Conservative Party is widely loathed in Scotland. The prime minister begged voters not to use a vote for independence as a way to bash his party.

The vote against independence keeps the U.K. from losing a major part of its territory and oil reserves and prevents it from having to find a new base for its nuclear weapons, now housed in Scotland. It had also faced a possible loss of influence within the European Union and the United Nations.

The decision also means Britain can avoid a prolonged period of economic problems that had been predicted by some if Scotland broke away.

In return for staying in the union, Scotland's voters have been promised major new powers by the British government, which had feared losing Scotland forever. Those powers are still somewhat unspecified.
