OSLO, Norway â€” A group of Tunisian citizens won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.

The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was honored for pushing their country toward democracy and away from civil war.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee said it made a "decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy."

The committee said the quartet played a key role as a peacemaker and a force for democracy. It created peaceful discussion among citizens, political parties and officials from political and religious groups. It also prevented the spread of violence.

"It established an alternative, peaceful political process at a time when the country was on the brink of civil war," the committee said.

## A Strong Sign Of Support For Young Democracy

The prize is a huge victory for small Tunisia in Northern Africa. Its young and still shaky democracy suffered two extremist attacks this year that killed 60 people and had a big effect on its tourism industry. Most of the dead were tourists at a museum or one of Tunisia's famous beaches.

Mohammed Fadhel Mafoudh is head of the Tunisian Order of Lawyers, one of the four organizations that make up the quartet. He said the prize sent a message to all groups around the world involved in conflicts.

"... (It's) to tell them that everything can be settled with dialogue and all can be settled in a climate of peace. And that the language of weapons leads us nowhere," he said. Dialogue is when two or more people or groups have a discussion.

Tunisian television and radio stations interrupted their programs to excitedly announce the news, and people celebrated through social media. Small but joyful crowds gathered in front of buildings in Tunis, the capital. The Parliament president announced plans for a big national rally soon.

## Arab Spring Sprung Up In Tunisia

Tunisian protesters sparked what are called the Arab Spring uprisings across the Arab world in 2011. The protests removed dictators and changed the old way of doing things. Tunisia was the only country to carefully build a democracy, and different Tunisian political groups and organizations came together to create a constitution and a Parliament.

Kaci Kullmann Five is the chairwoman of the Nobel committee. She said the prize was meant to encourage the Tunisian people and to be an example for the other countries in the region, which did not become democracies.

She said she hopes the prize will help protect democracy in Tunisia. She said it will also encourage people who are trying to create peace in the Middle East and North Africa.

The National Dialogue Quartet is made up of four important organizations: the Tunisian General Labour Union; the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts; the Tunisian Human Rights League; and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers.

Kullmann Five said the 8 million Swedish kronor prize, equal to $960,000, was for the quartet as a whole.

## Assassination Sparked Group's Founding

The quartet was formed after the 2013 murder of a politician created a crisis. The group led a national dialogue that helped create a new government and organize elections.

Houcine Abassi, the leader of the Tunisian General Labour Union, said he was "overwhelmed" as he found out about the award.

He said the prize "crowns" more than two years of the quartet's efforts at a time when the country was in danger.

Abassi said he hopes the award will help "unite Tunisians to face the challenges presenting themselves now." He said the main one was terrorism.

## Many Expected Peace Prize To Go To Others

The Peace Prize decision came as a surprise. Many people guessed it would focus on Europe's migrant crisis or a Iran-U.S. deal to prevent Iran from making an atomic bomb.

"It is a very good prize that tries to get into the heart of the conflict in the Muslim world," said Oeyvind Stenersen, a Nobel historian. "But it was a bit bewildering. It was very unexpected."

Francois Hollande is the president of France. He said he was "happy for all the Tunisians" and added the prize marks the success of the former French colony to become a democracy. France used to control Tunisia.

"That is an encouragement to support Tunisia even more through all the hard times it faces, as we've seen with terrorist acts in the last weeks and months," Hollande said.

The prize comes the day after a lawmaker was shot at in the Tunisian city of Sousse, which depends heavily on tourism.

## Unrest Not As Violent As Neighboring Countries

Tunisia has been much less violent than nearby Libya or Syria. Still, it has faced attacks, especially from Islamic extremists.

An attack in June on a beach resort in Sousse left 38 dead, mostly British tourists. Another in March killed 22 people, again mostly tourists, at the country's most important museum, the Bardo in Tunis.

Tunisia's 2011 revolution electrified the Arab world, and pro-democracy demonstrations broke out across the region. It ultimately brought down the rulers of Egypt and Libya and plunged Syria into civil war.
