BERKELEY, Calif. â€” People around the country are raising their voices in protest. They are chanting sayings like "Hands Up! Don't Shoot!" And for the first time in years, protesters are also singing songs that express their anger and pain.

In the last few weeks, protests have broken out across the country. Grand juries in New York and Missouri decided not to indict, or charge, white police officers in the deaths of two black men. A grand jury is made up of a group of citizens. They decide if a person should be formerly accused of a crime.

If the grand jury had decided to charge the officers, they would have had to defend themselves in court. Instead, the grand juries decided to not charge the officers.

Protest songs have not been heard in the U.S. since the 1960s. Then, "We Shall Overcome" became an important song of the 1960s civil rights movement. The civil rights movement fought for equal treatment of black people in the United States.

## Expressing Angry Feelings

Now, old songs are being sung by a new generation of protesters. Musicians are also writing new songs. Some of them are big name rock stars.

"Facts aren't fueling this fire. Feeling is what is fueling this fire" of angry protests, said Daniels Watts.  He is a Broadway performer who starred in a protest flash mob in New York. "Until we express those feelings and those feelings are understood, we aren't going to get too far."

One way to express these angry feelings is through song.

One of the new protest songs was written six weeks ago by Luke Nephew. He is a 32-year-old New York poet and song writer. His song starts, "I still hear my brother crying, 'I can't breathe.' Now I'm in the struggle singing. I can't leave."

## Singing At A Protest

Hundreds of people sang those words last week during protests in New York. Earlier that day, a grand jury decided not to charge an officer in death of Eric Garner. The week before, a different grand jury decided not to charge another officer. That officer killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Both men died while being arrested.

Nephew first introduced his song at a meeting of protesters in early November. The protesters taught it to people in their groups. They wanted as many people as possible to sing along during protests. A recording of the song was posted on YouTube.

One of the protesters, Jose Lopez, said they told people, "Make sure you are taking this back to your organizations. Make sure you are learning this."

Singer Darlene McCoy started a protest group. It is called Mothers of Black Sons. Last week, she heard protesters sing Nephew's song on television.

McCoy immediately recorded the song. She posted it on the Internet and challenged other singers to do the same. One of the singers has been viewed almost 750,000 times.

## Today's Songs

Nephew wonders why music has not been part of American protests for so many years. He has some ideas, though. He thinks people are no longer used to singing together. Also, many younger Americans are not interested in the old songs.

In the 1960s, songs meant a lot to people in the civil rights movement, and to people who protested the war in Vietnam. No one knows if today's protest songs will mean the same thing.

This may not happen immediately, said Ian Peddie. He studies protest songs at Georgia Gwinnett College in Georgia. It takes time for ideas to spread, he said. It also takes time for people to write good songs.
