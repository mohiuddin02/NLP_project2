BOSTON â€” Hope Phelan is a talented artist and a runner. Now she has found a way to put those two things together. She is using them to bring back the joy of the Boston Marathon.

On April 15, 2013, Phelan finished her first Boston Marathon in just over three hours. She was a few blocks away celebrating when she heard loud noises and saw people running and screaming. Two bombs had exploded near the finish line.

Phelan had a hard time getting over that terrible day. She made a painting called "Boston Marathon 2013" to help her deal with her feelings. The painting was very dark and serious. She put all her feelings on the paper.

## New Paintings Are More Cheerful

A year later, Phelan decided to raise money for the people hurt by the bombs. She made new marathon paintings that were very different from the first one. They were bright, colorful scenes of the runners and fans. She left out everything that had to do with the bombs. She only wanted to show the things that make the Boston marathon special.

One painting shows college students cheering for runners. Another one shows runners at the top of Heartbreak Hill. It is the hardest part of the race. Another is of runners passing Boston's famous Citgo sign on their way to the finish line.

Some of Phelan's work is very playful. The 26-year-old art teacher made a collage out of the number signs she has worn in her races. Then she painted right on top of it. For another piece, she painted on shiny foil. She wanted people to think of the foil sheets that runners use like blankets after the race.

## Bringing The Fun Back To The Race

Phelan has been a fan of the marathon for a long time. She grew up near Boston. She visited every April to watch the race. Phelan wanted people to see all of those good memories in her paintings. "I wanted to bring the fun back," she said.

Phelan sells her paintings online. Her work is also shown at Marathon Sports, a running shop along the race route. The paintings will be shown there until the race on April 20.

Many people in Boston have become fans of Phelan's work. A runner named Caitlin Marquis is one of them. Marquis says Phelan's paintings make it easy to see how much she loves running. She says Phelan's work shows the joy of the marathon.

## Who Are The Fastest Runners?

Two years have passed since the attack took place. Now people are eager to see the race the way it looks in Phelan's paintings. They want America's favorite marathon to be the way it used to be. The race was created to see who was the fastest runner. It was for all of the people of Boston.

"The Boston Marathon is like a parade," Phelan said. "People are screaming and it's loud and there's water being thrown at you."

Phelan wants to help bring the race "back to normal." She hopes her art will encourage others to help make the marathon fun again. She wants them to enjoy the spirit of the race and all of the people around them.
