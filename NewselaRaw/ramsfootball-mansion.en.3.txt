LOS ANGELES, Calif. — The St. Louis Rams' move to Los Angeles has real estate agents excited. They want to help the Rams players find places to live. Real estate agents help people buy and sell homes. 

Ed Kaminsky is one of those people. He has been calling anyone he knows who might know a Rams player.

Many real estate agents hope to connect with Rams players and staff. All those people will be looking for places to live in Los Angeles.

Kaminsky works with professional athletes. He helps them find new places to live as they move from team to team. Other agents do the same thing. They all are competing to get part of the big business that comes with moving an entire NFL team.

## Over 100 People Are Moving

There are 53 players on a team. Then there are coaches and assistant coaches. There will be more than 100 people looking for homes, said real estate agent Kofi Nartey.

Nartey's company will add workers just to work on moving the Rams. They will help players hire moving companies. They will help them ship cars across the country and find out about schools for their kids, he said.

Ikem Chukumerije runs a real estate company. He said the people with connections to a player will get the business. 

That business probably will not be worth much to start. Real estate agents make the most money when people buy or sell. Agents think Rams players are more likely to rent than buy.

## Players Might Not Stay Long

Many players have contracts that only last a short time. Most players do not last in the NFL for long. The average player plays for a little over three years, says the players union. With such short careers, players may not want to buy.

Los Angeles is also an expensive place to buy a home.

The middle home price in Los Angeles is $506,800\. The middle home price in St. Louis is $160,000, says a national real estate group. The Los Angeles price is more than three times the St. Louis price.

Even the lowest-paid NFL players make a league-minimum salary of $435,000, though. They can afford Los Angeles prices. Still, the agents probably will help most players rent. They will not arrange many sales.

## Efforts Will Pay Off, Agents Say

An agent might get paid a small amount for arranging a rental. Take a home that costs $10,000 a month. The agent would get just $2,400 a year. An agent would make much more selling a home. He or she could get hundreds of thousands for the sale of a multimillion-dollar home.

Still, agents say it is worth the effort. They hope to get to know the player by helping them rent. Then maybe the player would use the agent when they want to buy a home later on. 

Players also need to figure out where they will live.

Agents say a few areas may interest Rams players. The areas are popular with pro athletes. Manhattan Beach has beautiful property on the beach. It is close to Los Angeles International Airport. It is also near Inglewood, where the team will play. Calabasas is another popular area. It has huge homes in communities with gates to keep people safe.

There is one more important thing. Agents said where the team practices will make a huge difference.

Players will want to be close to where they practice. If they are late, they might have to pay a fine of hundreds of dollars. Los Angeles has bad traffic. The traffic could make players worry about being late.
