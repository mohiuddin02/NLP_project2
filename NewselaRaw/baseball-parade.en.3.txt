BOSTON â€” From their stadium to the river, the Red Sox carried the World Series trophy through the streets of Boston.

The team won the World Series with a 6-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6 on Wednesday night. It was the first time the Red Sox won the Series at home in 95 years.

For the third time in 10 years, the Red Sox paraded the prize through their city in a "rolling rally." The team rode in amphibian-like vessels called "duck boats." Thousands of fans lined the streets and the waterway to watch them go by.

The most emotional moment happened early in Saturday's trip. The vehicles stopped at the Boston Marathon finish line. The spot was near where two explosions killed three people watching the race on April 15.

## An Emotional Moment At The Finish Line

Outfielder Jonny Gomes placed the trophy on the finish line. Then he and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia held Red Sox jerseys with the words "BOSTON STRONG" and the number 617. That's the city's area code. A jersey with that message hung in the Red Sox dugout during the season, to remind players of the bombings.

"That was an emotional moment," Gomes said. "To bring the World Series trophy to the finish line, I don't think that the story was written that way, but I was glad to be a part of it."

The Red Sox had left Boston to go on a road trip the day of the Marathon. On the way to the airport, they saw emergency vehicles responding to the explosions. Team Manager John Farrell recalled that moment.

"That's going to bring back a lot, and a lot of uncertainty at that moment," Farrell said, "because no one knew where to turn next."

Second baseman Dustin Pedroia said: "We played for the whole city, what the city went through."

## From Worst To First

Boston's climb from last place in the AL East in 2012 to the top of the baseball world was stunning.

But not to Pedroia, a leader of the Red Sox.

"The way we started spring training, it seemed like everybody counted us out," he said. "We always said, 'One day closer to a parade.' It's here."

A rally took place in Red Sox stadium before the ceremony.

Then the team got on board 25 duck boats normally used for tourist trips. They come in pink, yellow, lime green, white and other colors.

Some boats even had brown carpeting cut into the shape of beards attached on the front.

Players still had their beards, which some had grown all season long. The beards became something the team rallied around. They did not want to get rid of them while they were winning.

"Hopefully, we can all get together and shave them for a good cause," third baseman Will Middlebrooks said.

## A Sweeter Victory Than Before

Some fans also were at rallies after the 2004 and 2007 championships.

"This may be the best parade yet," said Charles Butler, 48, of Boston, who attended his third. "It is the best thing that could have happened to Boston right now."

Many fans in the crowd wore Red Sox gear. Some had foam beards and held signs "Papi for Mayor." That's in honor of World Series MVP David Ortiz, who is called "Big Papi." The word "papi" means daddy in Spanish.

Farrell gave credit to Ortiz for hitting a tying grand slam in the AL championship series against the Detroit Tigers. If that hadn't happened "we might not be standing here today," he said.

Steve Horgan became famous as the police officer who raised his arms in a "V'' after Ortiz's homer. He got to ride in the lead vehicle with the team owners.

"A thrill of a lifetime," Horgan said.

When the vehicles slid into the river, fans cheered.

The team was delayed when it left the stadium, however. A truck carrying a band that had played at the ceremony became stuck in the ground.

A duck boat drove up in front of it. After a rope was attached between the vehicles, the boat pulled the truck free.

Less than three hours later, the rally was over.

"We were ready to go another lap," Gomes said. "We didn't want it to end. It was pretty fun."
