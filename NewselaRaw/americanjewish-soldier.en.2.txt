JERUSALEM — The Nazi soldiers made their orders very clear: Jewish American prisoners of war (POWs) were to identify themselves and then be sent away.

But Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds would not agree to that. In the German POW camp during World War II, he ordered more than 1,000 American captives to step forward with him. Then he announced, "We are all Jews here."

He would not waver, even with a pistol to his head, and the Germans eventually backed down.

## Far From Ordinary

Seventy years later, Edmonds is being recognized with Israel's highest honor for non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II. Edmonds, who is from Knoxville, Tennessee, is the first American serviceman to earn the honor. He died in 1985.

"Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier, but he had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings," said Avner Shalev. He is the chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and memorial in Jerusalem, Israel, which is honoring Edmonds. "The choices and actions of Master Sergeant Edmonds set an example for his fellow American soldiers."

The story remained untold for decades and was only discovered by his son long after his father's death.

## Unraveling What Really Happened

Edmonds was captured with thousands of others in the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944, and then spent 100 days in a POW camp. His son, the Reverend Chris Edmonds, vaguely knew about his father's past from a pair of diaries Edmonds kept in in the POW camp.

But it was only while surfing the Internet a few years ago that he began to unravel what really happened. Oddly enough, he learned about his father's heroism when he read a newspaper article about former President's Richard Nixon's search for a home in New York. Nixon bought his home from a lawyer who said Edmonds saved him and dozens of other Jews during the war.

Edmonds' son found the man and another Jewish former POW. They told him what they witnessed on Jan. 27, 1945, at the German Stalag IXA POW camp.

## He Knew What Was At Stake

The German army kept the Jewish POWs separate from non-Jews. Captured Jewish soldiers in the Russian army had been sent to death camps.

At the time of Edmonds' capture, Jewish American POWs were sent to slave labor camps where most prisoners died. U.S. soldiers had been warned that Jewish soldiers would be in danger if captured. They were told to destroy any evidence identifying them as Jewish.

So when the German camp commander, speaking in English, ordered the Jews to identify themselves, Edmonds knew what was at stake.

Turning to the rest of the POWs, he said, "We are not doing that, we are all falling out," recalled Chris Edmonds. He is currently in Israel participating in a seminar for Christian leaders at Yad Vashem.

The German commander then turned to Edmonds and said, "They cannot all be Jews." Edmonds replied, "We are all Jews here."

## Perhaps More Than 200 Lives Were Saved

Then the Nazi officer pressed his pistol to Edmonds head and offered him one last chance. Edmonds merely gave him his name, rank and serial number.

And then Edmonds said, "If you are going to shoot, you are going to have to shoot all of us because we know who you are and you'll be tried for war crimes when we win this war," recalled Chris Edmonds.

The German officer then withdrew. Chris Edmonds thinks his father saved the lives of more than 200 Jewish-American soldiers.

## Only The Fifth American, And First Soldier, To Be So Honored

About 6 million European Jews were killed by German Nazis and their helpers during World War II.

More than 26,000 people have been named "Righteous Among the Nations." The Jerusalem memorial is a row of trees planted in honor of those who risked their lives to save Jews. One of the most famous of them was Oskar Schindler, whose efforts to save more than 1,000 Jews was told in Steven Spielberg's 1993 film "Schindler's List." Another was Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved at least 20,000 Jews before mysteriously disappearing.

Before Edmonds, only four of the Righteous were Americans. He's the first serviceman to receive the award and the first whose actions saved the lives of fellow Americans. A ceremony for Edmonds will be held next year in Israel. Thanks to his son's efforts, Edmonds is now also being considered for a Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest military honor given in the U.S.

## A Quick, Clear, Moral Decision

Irena Steinfeldt, who works at Yad Vashem, said Edmonds was a military man who made a quick, clear, moral decision.

"When he tells the German, 'No,' that is something that can kill him," she explained. "It is very heroic."

Chris Edmonds said he believed his father's actions were inspired by his deep belief in Christianity.

"All he had to fight with was his will power and his wits," he said. "I'm just glad he did the right thing."
