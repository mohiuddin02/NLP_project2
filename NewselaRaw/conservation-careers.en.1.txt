SEATTLE, Wash. — Growing up in Chicago, Jesse Okwu's closest connection to nature was watching nature documentaries on public television. When he came to Washington for a program on conservation, the state's national parks and deserts were his first real encounters with the wilderness.

By the end of the eight-week program, the sophomore at Knox College in Illinois was loving the outdoor field trips. Now, he's thinking about how conservation work could become part of his career path in economics.

Okwu, who is African-American, is among 26 students from a variety of backgrounds who took part in a program at the University of Washington this summer. The  program aims to increase the diversity of students who choose careers in conservation and ecology. Conservationists dedicate their careers to preserving and protecting natural resources such as forests, lakes and wildlife.

## Ranger Rick Reaches For The Rainbow

The concern: More than 80 percent of people in conservation jobs — like the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and private groups such as the Nature Conservancy — are white, and come from similar economic backgrounds, usually the middle class.

Students who go into conservation jobs often have a passion for nature and a mind for science, said Sean Watts, director of the Conservation Scholars summer program. But they may lack people skills or the flexibility to consider an issue from different points of view.

They may approach a problem with a limited understanding of how different communities are affected by the potential solutions to ecological problems.

The program drew nearly 400 applicants, and Watts said the students were carefully chosen from a range of ethnic and racial backgrounds — white, black, Asian-American, Native American, Latino. Five were white and nine were multiracial. Some had parents who never graduated from high school, and others came from families where both parents went to graduate school.

## "Fantastic, Thoughtful Folks"

Most of students were planning to major in environmental sciences. The group also included students majoring in film studies, mechanical engineering, mathematics, business and economics.

"They are fantastic, thoughtful folks, and mature beyond their years," Watts said. "Wherever they go, they're going to transform the way we think about conservation issues," he added.

During the program, the students crisscrossed Washington state, from the slopes of Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens to the dry grasslands of the Moses Coulee in Eastern Washington. They visited the Elwha dam-removal project, saw the Duwamish River and the Pacific coastline. They also talked with members of the Duwamish, Quinault and Yakama Native American tribes about the cultural foundation of their views of the environment.

Watts hopes to getting more students from all backgrounds interested in conservation at the start of their college studies. Doing so could affect how they choose their careers, Watts said.

The students seem to agree.

## Taking Care Of Business

"Business has been one of the biggest polluters of the environment; I really want to change that," said Eric Katz, a business major at the University of Michigan. Katz is white.

Steven Harris, a Syracuse University student majoring in earth sciences and anthropology, knows there aren't many black men like him in the conservation movement. He is not discouraged by this. "It inspires me," he said.

The students noted that climate change is expected to have some of its most devastating effects on the poorest regions of the planet. Climate change is the warming of the planet. It is caused by humans burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal.

"Climate change is going to be global, and it's important to take diverse viewpoints into account," said Jordan Morgan. He is a white student from Bemidji State University in Minnesota. "The conservation field has not been very diversified — most of the people working in it look like me."

The Conservation Scholars program is being funded by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. Northern Arizona University and the University of Florida also received Duke Foundation money to run programs this summer.

The program was run by the UW's College of the Environment. College Dean Lisa Graumlich said the program has another benefit: It allows freshmen and sophomores to get a hands-on feel for the exciting part of conservation work early in their college careers, a time when they're usually working on the difficult science classes their majors require.

## Challenging Assumptions

It isn't just a feel-good summer program, Watts said. He is is quick to point out that Conservation Scholars was designed to challenge the students' assumptions and stereotypes about the people who work in the field.

For example, the students visited an organic apple farm and met an older white farmer who employed migrant workers to pick his fruit. The farmer was reluctant to talk about his relationship with his workers. Initially the students interpreted his reluctance to mean he had something to hide.

But Watts knew that the farmer had a history of treating his workers kindly. "He treats his farmworkers really well, contributes to their education programs, gives them gas money," Watts said. When they learned this, the students "were having this moment when they had to completely flip their assessment of him," Watts said.

Watts said challenging the way students think about the world can be difficult. "It was tense at times — you don't get to those conversations without a little tension," he said.

This same group of students will return to the UW for two more summers, in 2015 and 2016. A new group of students will join the program next year.
