ST. LOUIS — The Reverend Al Sharpton called on mourners at the funeral for Michael Brown, a black teen killed by a white police officer, to launch a nationwide movement for change.

Brown's funeral soared into a national soul searching over race and justice and the number of young African-American men who have died in cities like Ferguson. The 18-year-old was killed Aug. 9 by a white police officer.

More than 2,500 people packed the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church to remember Brown. His mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood as if in shock, staring at her son's casket. She shook her head back and forth as a tear rolled down her cheek. Brown's cousin, Bernard Ewing, choked back tears as he spoke.

"I love you Mike. That's all I've got to say," Ewing said, standing on a stage behind Brown's casket piled with red roses and a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap.

## A Historic Moment

The memorial drew people from across the country, many of whom never met Brown. There were Hollywood celebrities like director Spike Lee, actor Wesley Snipes and rapper MC Hammer. Also, there were the relatives of other young black men who were killed by people who saw them as a threat.

These included the relatives of Trayvon Martin. He was an unarmed teen who was killed by an armed resident in Florida in 2012. Relatives of Emmett Till also attended the funeral. The 14-year-old was murdered in Mississippi in 1955 after whistling at a white woman.

Most of the mourners were black but a few of them white. Many of them hoped to be part of a day that many believed would become part of the history of blacks and whites in America.

"A lot of people feel they could be next," said Chris Gray, 29, who came from Minneapolis, Minnesota. "There's a historic possibility here for young people to take ownership of a new civil rights movement."

Sharpton told the crowd that Brown's death must mark the beginning of change. And that change must take place not just in the justice system, but also in the African-American community.

"Nobody is going to help us if we don't help ourselves," said Sharpton, a civil rights activist. Sharpton challenged listeners to stop feeling sorry for themselves and take action.

## "Demonstration Into Legislation"

"We can't have a fit. We've got to have a movement," Sharpton bellowed, blasting protesters who stole from stores during nearly two weeks of protests after Brown's death. "A fit — you get mad and run out for a couple of nights. A movement means we've got to be here for the long haul and turn our chance into change, our demonstration into legislation."

Other speakers talked especially about the need to vote to get more blacks in power, the issue at the heart of the racial anger in Ferguson. About 14,000 of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are black, but the City Council and Police Department are overwhelmingly white. In the last municipal election, just 12.3 percent of Ferguson residents voted.

DeeNa Adair, 41, who took part in the protests, came to the funeral with her husband and 10-month-old grandson.

"If we don't stand up now, what is his future?" said Adair of her grandson. She said her 20-year-old son had been shot and killed in downtown St. Louis.

"Hopefully ... this is what sparks the nation to change, to deal with the racial divide," Adair said.

In the church, the funeral was emotional and at times uplifting. A choir belted out gospel songs and women pounded tambourines and shook maracas. Men, women and children, dressed in suits and elaborate dresses, swayed in unison, danced and held their hands toward the sky.

## Opinions About Police

There were only a handful of white faces in the crowd. A survey conducted after Brown's killing found that whites are far more likely than blacks to feel that police will treat people of both races equally.

It found that 46 percent of blacks have "very little" confidence that police will treat blacks and whites equally. In contrast, 12 percent of whites feel that way.

"They think because they wear a badge, they hold life in their hands," said Demond Wright, a 23-year-old dishwasher from Ferguson.

Nate Parker is a 34-year-old actor and producer from Pasadena, California. He said he flew to Missouri after realizing he had no answer for his 17-year-old nephew, who asked him what he should do if stopped by police.

"The real question is how many days will pass before another unarmed black man is killed?" Parker said.

No charges have been filed in Brown's death. Officials say the officer, Darren Wilson, fired in self-defense after Brown attacked him. Some witnesses say Wilson shot Brown after ordering him to stop walking down the middle of the street.

Eighteen-year-old Eric Harris, who lives in St. Louis, identified with the dead teen. "But you don't have to be acting up to be targeted" by police, Harris said. "You can just be walking home from the store and bang, you're a target."
