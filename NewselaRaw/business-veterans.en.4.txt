Three years ago, Frank Miranda came home from Afghanistan. He was in the army. It took Miranda about three years to find a job. Since August, he has been working at Home Depot in New Jersey. He works with two fellow veterans. People who used to be in the military are called veterans.

Home Depot is one of many companies that have started hiring U.S. veterans. Many have struggled to find work and to adjust to life back home.

Home Depot has 35,000 workers who are veterans. That is about one out of every 10 workers. It has committed to hire about 55,000 veterans over the next five years.

Other companies are trying to hire more veterans. They want to find new ways to connect with them.

## A Promise To Hire

This year, Wal-Mart made a promise. It will hire every veteran who wants a job.

The White House started its own program. It wants to place 5,000 vets in jobs in wireless telephone businesses by 2015.

Alex Leniw is 33 years old. Leniw served 10 years in the Coast Guard. He knows  how hard it can be for a veteran to get a job. When he got out of the service, he attended Caldwell College for two years and graduated. For a year since then, he has been hunting for work.

"It's just so frustrating," Leniw said. "The economy's not helping. I had my resume on Monster.com for a while, and that went nowhere. Every job I'm applying for, there's over 100 other" people applying.

Veterans leaving the army have new battles to fight. They face a tough job market. And they often have a hard time explaining how their military skills can help an employer.

"Most of the employers are very eager to hire veterans," said New Jersey Labor Commissioner Harold Wirths. "You're getting a highly skilled employee. You don't have to worry about telling them how to dress. They come to work on time. They're used to harsh conditions."

## Loyalty, Respect And Service

Wirths also said younger ex-service members often go to college under the GI Bill. That means they are counted as unemployed. That can make veteran unemployment figures seem higher, he said. At job fairs, the commissioner said he is seeing many Vietnam War-era vets looking for work. They are in the 50- to 60-year-age range.

Miranda is that old. He spent 27 years in the U.S. Army, serving in places such as Afghanistan and Kuwait. He retired in October 2010. The change was hard on him, Miranda said.

Miranda worked briefly for a supermarket, and eventually applied online for a job at Home Depot. Now he works about 25 to 30 hours a week, "doing the racetrack." He runs from department to department to help customers.

At Home Depot, Miranda said he has a chance to advance. He also likes working for a company that shares the same values of the Army. It values loyalty, duty, respect and service.

"We really have been proactive trying to recruit military," said Pam Frazier. She is a manager for the Home Depot district where Miranda works.

Home Depot holds its own job fairs for veterans. It has a "military skills translator" on its website. It helps veterans find the words to explain how their army skills can be used at Home Depot.
