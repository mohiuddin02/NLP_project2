Visitors to a new exhibition at The Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, won't just be looking at art. They'll feel like they are inside a painting by Salvador Dali. Virtual reality, a three-dimensional world created by computers, will make this experience possible.

The new exhibition is called "Disney and Dali: Architects of the Imagination." It tells the story of the relationship between Salvador Dali, the surrealist artist, and Walt Disney, the great American animator and theme-park pioneer. 

First, visitors will see the Disney-Dali show's paintings, story sketches, their letters to one another, photos and other artifacts. Then comes the museum exhibition's highlight: putting on a headset to try the virtual reality (VR) experience called "Dreams of Dali."

The VR experience takes viewers inside Dali's 1935 painting "Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's 'Angelus.'" The painting shows two giant stone figures towering in a desert. The bare landscape is set under a moody sky. Users can move around inside the painting. Headsets allow them to navigate a trippy three-dimensional world. It includes themes from other Dali works. Those distinctive features include elephants, birds, ants and his "Lobster Telephone" sculpture.

## "It's A Vulnerable Feeling"

The experience is accompanied by a haunting piano soundtrack pierced with bird cries. The VR visuals also include a quarter moon, a stone tunnel and even the image of rock musician Alice Cooper. Dali featured Cooper in a 1973 hologram.

"You actually have a three-dimensional feeling that you're inside a painting," said Jeff Goodby, whose company Goodby Silverstein & Partners created the VR experience. "It's not just like you're inside a sphere with things being projected. It's actually like there are objects closer and further away and you're walking amidst them. It's a vulnerable feeling you give yourself up to. It's not like anything you've ever felt before." 

Disney and Dali met in the 1940s in Hollywood, according to museum director Hank Hine. "Their sensibilities were very connected," Hine said. "They wanted to take art off the palette, out of the canvas and into the world." The exhibition looks at the castle theme that became a symbol of Disney parks. It also looks at Dali's "Dream of Venus" pavilion from the 1939 World's Fair. Some people believe Dali's work led the way for contemporary installation art, or three-dimensional works that dramatically change a large space. 

## Disney-Dali Film Will Be Shown

Disney and Dali also collaborated on a short animated movie, "Destino," that was eventually completed by Disney Studios. The six-minute movie can be found on YouTube. It features a dancing girl with long dark hair, a sundial theme and a song with the line, "You came along out of a dream. ... You are my destino." Clips will be played within the gallery for the Disney-Dali exhibition and the full short film will be shown at the museum's theater.

"Archeological Reminiscence of Millet's 'Angelus'" was Dali's take on a 19th-century painting by Jean-Francois Millet. It shows two peasants in a field, heads bowed in prayer. Dali said that his work was a "fantasy," and that he imagined sculptures of two figures carved out of the highest rocks.

Kathy Greif is the museum marketing director. She said record numbers of visitors attended its last two major shows. Those exhibits explored Dali's relationships with pop artist Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso. Given the Disney brand's immense popularity and the newness of VR, attendance for this show is expected to be high as well.

Dali "wanted art that took you over," said Goodby. "He wanted to take you away and do something different with your head and that's what this does."
