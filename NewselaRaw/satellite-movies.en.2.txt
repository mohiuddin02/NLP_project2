"Dr. Who" is a British TV show that has passionate fans all over the world. Tim Warner, the head of a movie theater company, had never heard of it.

So Warner wasn't sure when executives from BBC America told him they wanted to broadcast a special 50th anniversary episode of the show in his theaters across the U.S. and Latin America.

In the end, he agreed. The episode, "Dr. Who: The Day of the Doctor," came to theaters in late November. So did the fans.

Hundreds of "Whovians" -- fans of the show about a time traveler and his adventures -- came to theaters dressed as their favorite characters. More than 700 theaters, from Los Angeles to New York to Brazil, showed the episode.

"Dr. Who" is an example of a "cult classic" -- a movie or TV show that isn't widely popular, but is adored by a group of fans.

## Beaming Down To Theaters

"To be honest, many of us had never heard of 'Dr. Who,'" said Warner, who runs the nation's third-largest theater chain, Cinemark Holdings Inc. "They told us it was going to sell out. We said, 'Yeah, right.' Not only did it sell out, but people showed up in costumes."

Tickets sold so quickly that theaters showing the episode had to add more screens to make space for everyone. The event was a big success.

It convinced Warner that what happened with "Dr. Who" was only the beginning. There are many TV shows, sports programs and other "alternative entertainment" that could draw people to movie theaters to watch something other than movies.

Although the show is British, it has fans all over the world, including in Latin America. Fred Medina, executive vice president of Latin America for BBC Worldwide, said the "Dr. Who" screenings demonstrated a new way to connect with international fans of the show.

"It's about building a broader relationship with our audiences," Medina said.

After the success of "Dr. Who," Warner is interested in showing TV shows, concerts and sporting events at his theaters. A new satellite network has made it possible to send live entertainment to most theaters in America.

Theater businessmen such as Warner are sure that movies will remain their main focus. But they believe they can make money by showing something other than movies at their movie theaters.

Today, "alternative content" like TV shows or sports make up less than 1 percent of income for major movie theater companies. But in three to five years, that could increase to 10 percent or more, Warner predicts.

We now have the technology to make this a reality, Warner said. This industry is transforming right before our eyes, he added.

## From Spools To Satellites

Theaters have been experimenting for several years with alternative programming, helping to fill up normally empty theaters during slow periods in the middle of the week.

They've enjoyed success with sold-out screenings of the Metropolitan Opera from New York City, World Cup soccer games in 3-D, boxing matches and mixed martial arts fights.

The digital delivery of movies has long been the goal of studios and theaters. Most theaters have already installed digital projectors.

For decades, most movies were delivered on heavy, bulky spools of actual film, which could weigh up to 25 pounds.

Recently, most movies were put on digital hard drives and shipped or mailed to theaters across the country. That's a slow and expensive process.

The new satellite system makes it much cheaper to show movies in theaters.

Ten to 15 years ago, it cost about $2,500 to deliver a film print to a theater. By comparison, it costs about $200 to $250 to distribute digital hard drives to movie theaters.

Delivering movies and TV shows by satellite is even cheaper than that.

About 75 percent of the screens from major theater companies can show movies and other entertainment using the satellite network.

## Live Broadcasts And Video Games

The new network opens up many possibilities. For example, movie theaters could host video game tournaments where players play against each other across the country in a live event.

Warner hopes his company can use the expanding satellite network to show many different types of entertainment at movie theaters. He imagines live "American Idol" or NCAA championship basketball.

Fox, Sony, Disney and other studios are discussing the possibility of showing their sports and TV shows in theaters.

People often pay extra to watch HBO or a big boxing match, said Steve Bunnell, who works with Warner. With the satellite system, people will be paying to watch TV programs on a huge screen with great sound.

"You literally have the largest premium pay-per view network in the world," Bunnell said.

Bunnell recently attended a BBC conference in England, where he discussed other BBC shows that could be shown in his company's theaters.

Putting live sports on movie screens could be a challenge, however.

Traditionally, it has been difficult and expensive for theaters to get permission from sports leagues to show big games in theaters. Television sports networks  spend millions of dollars on the rights to broadcast games. They may also have problems with the idea.

But Warner argues that theaters would work with networks, not work against them. Theaters could provide another place to promote their shows and events.

"To me, it doesn't compete with TV or sports bars," Warner said.
