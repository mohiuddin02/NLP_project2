Saudi Arabia is a country. It is in the Middle East. It has many rules just for women and girls. They cannot do what the men and boys do.

One rule says women should not exercise. The rule is for young girls, too. They cannot play sports. They do not go to gym class.

Some Saudi women and girls want to change the rules. They are playing basketball. The players say basketball is not just a sport. It is a way to fight for more rights.

## Starting A Basketball Team

Lina Almaeena lives in a city called Jiddah. Lina tried something new. She started a basketball team 11 years ago.

Some people tried to stop Lina. Her teammates helped her keep going. They wanted to play in a real sports club.

Lina talked to a sports club called Jiddah United. The club listened to Lina. The club let her team play there. It was the first club in the country that let women join.

## Making New Friends

Playing basketball in Saudi Arabia is expensive. It costs around $130 a month. Women spend even more. They need to pay a driver to get there. Women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia.

Lina says basketball is becoming more popular. The girls like making friends. They get to be part of a team. They can exercise without breaking other rules.

Basketball players wear loose clothes. They can even wear an abaya. An abaya is the long dress all Saudi women must wear. It is very loose.

Basketball can be played indoors. Women play in a room with other women. They make sure men cannot watch them. That would be against the rules.

## Basketball Helps Women

Lina and her club have helped many women and girls. Hadeer Sadagah is one of them. She learned to play basketball at Jiddah United. Now she plays for a university in another country.

"I wouldn't be the person I am today without the sport and the team," Hadeer said. "It made me more social. It made me confident."
