Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. Scientists believe it was important in the making of our planet many millions of years ago.

A new study says Jupiter crashed around the solar system when it was forming. It cleared out other planets to make way for Earth.

Scientists believe planets form around stars. They are shaped by gravity, the same force that makes things fall to the ground. It pulls in dust and gases from young stars to form planets.

## Dinosaurs Were No Match For Asteroids

Jupiter, because it is so huge, was a big helper in creating our solar system. It pushed out the pieces left over when the sun and other planets formed.

Some pieces around Jupiter turned into asteroids. Those fell on other planets, like Earth. They brought water that the planet needed for plants and animals. Asteroids also wiped out the dinosaurs that were on Earth. Then human life could develop.

The study says Jupiter smashed larger planets near the sun. The pieces of those planets formed Earth and its neighbors.

## Calling On "Super-Earths"

Our solar system is an oddball, said Greg Laughlin. He is one of the scientists who wrote the study. Most solar systems in the universe have many large planets, he said.

It was Jupiter that made the difference in ours, said Konstantin Batygin. He is the other author of the study.

Scientists think that our solar system developed like others in the universe.They also believe it used to have more large planets.

Other solar systems have been found that are packed with planets larger than Earth. The scientists call these "super-earths." But those planets do not have an atmosphere like ours. Their air is full of hydrogen that we cannot breathe.

## Planets Did Not Sit Still

Scientists have mostly believed that planets stayed in the same place and in the same orbit around the sun after they formed. But that could be wrong.

Twenty years ago, scientists found planets around other stars. They noticed not all the planets went around in circles.

Since the other planets were discovered, their movements have been studied. Scientists want to understand how our solar system was formed.

Some planets would swing very close to their suns and then far away. Some would get pulled away by other planets.

The scientists studied the movements of Jupiter. Their theory says that when the solar system formed, Jupiter moved to where Mars is today. Planets crashed into each other like a demolition derby.

## Larger Jupiter Muscled In

Smaller planets were pushed into the sun. The pieces of the broken planets came together. They formed Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.

This explains why those planets formed later and why they have different atmospheres. It would also explain why Mars is smaller than Earth. It was formed from pieces of a larger planet.

That is why there are few planets like Earth, Laughlin said. Other planets did not have a Jupiter to clear the way. Scientists are watching for signs of life on other planets. Most of those planets probably cannot support humans. We would be cooked, smothered or crushed in their atmospheres.

But it might really be Saturn that we should thank for being here. Its gravity pulled Jupiter back into place and away from Earth.

Next time you look up at the sky, think of Jupiter and Saturn. Earth might be a very different planet without them.
