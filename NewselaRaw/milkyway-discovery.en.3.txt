MILWAUKEE — A team of Wisconsin scientists has stitched together an exciting 360-degree view of the Milky Way. This remarkable new view shows our spiral-shaped galaxy from every direction.

Galaxies are groups of stars held together by gravity. In addition to the millions of stars in a galaxy, there are the planets, gasses and space dust in between them. Earth is located in the Milky Way Galaxy, one of many galaxies that makes up our universe.

The new picture of our galaxy, which was unveiled on Thursday, is known as GLIMPSE360. It is made up of about 2.5 million images collected by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. This orbiting telescope has been mapping the galaxy for more than 10 years.

## Meet Spitzer

Spitzer is an infrared telescope. That is, it records things as they appear in infrared light. This allows scientists who study space — called astronomers — to see much that isn't visible in ordinary light. Infrared telescopes can cut through clouds of interstellar dust that block visibility with ordinary telescopes.

Thanks to Spitzer, astronomers have been able to study much that was previously hidden in the Milky Way. More than 200 million new stars have been identified.

And now thanks to GLIMPSE360, scientists can easily examine the structure of the Milky Way. It has parts that extend out like arms in a spiral shape. Scientists can now see how many spiraling arms it has, where they are and how far out they extend.

But GLIMPSE360 isn't only about the big picture. Viewers can also zero in on particular objects by using a zoom feature.

## A Band Of Millions Of Stars

GLIMPSE360's infrared images prove something scientists had suspected: A structure shaped like a bar runs like a straight line through the center of the Milky Way. This structure consists of millions of stars and extends out to about 12,000 to 13,000 light years from the galaxy's center. One light year alone equals around 6 trillion miles.

And GLIMPSE360 can help scientists in a lot of other ways as well.

"We can see stars being born," astronomer Edward Churchwell said. "And if we can identify stars in the process of forming, we can start to learn" more about "how stars are formed. We don't really understand the details of how stars are born."

Scientists also now may be able to figure out where stars are formed.

Scientist Robert Benjamin says they can now see every region that forms stars in the galaxy.

And the new view gives scientists some idea how quickly the Milky Way grows, said scientist Barb Whitney. "It tells us how many stars are forming each year."

## Astronomers Have Plenty To Study

The general location of stars in the galaxy is now visible. And astronomers expect to gain a deeper understanding of the dust that lies between the stars.

But GLIMPSE360 also uncovers new puzzles to be solved. The infrared images show that the space between stars and planets, called interstellar space, is filled with patches of gas.

"They are brightest around regions of star formation" but can be seen throughout the Milky Way, Churchwell said. "They're floating out in the middle of interstellar space where they have no business being. It raises the question of how they were formed."

Sent into space in 2003, the Spitzer Space Telescope has far outlasted its planned two-and-a-half-year lifespan. The telescope remains in orbit, sending back infrared images. It can't last forever, however: It will eventually stop working once the liquid helium that cools its cameras runs out.

More than 600 scientific papers already have been published using the information from Spitzer.

Indeed, Spitzer has provided enough new information to keep astronomers busy for many years. "It's done what we wanted it to do," Churchwell said.
