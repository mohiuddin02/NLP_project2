The numbers were released Monday.

The states that added the most people were Texas, California and Florida. This pushed the South and West past the Northeast and Midwest in population growth.

Population is important because it helps determine how much power states get in the government.

The census is a count that the U.S. government takes of the population every 10 years. The population of a state or a country is how many residents it has, or people who live in it.

The complete census count happens every 10 years. But every year the Census Bureau does an estimate. It tries to figure out where populations are changing. It includes how many people have died and been born. It also includes how many people have come into the country, or into the states. And, it looks at how many have left.

## Gaining Seats In Congress

State officials closely watch population numbers. The population determines how much money states get from the federal government. It also determines the number of seats each state receives in one half of Congress, called the House of Representatives. The other half is called the Senate.

The number of seats in the House of Representatives gets changed every 10 years when the complete census is done.

If states keep growing just as fast until the next census, Texas could gain three more seats in Congress. Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado would get one seat each. Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan would lose a seat each.

The new numbers highlight changes that have been happening for a while. Southern states are still growing faster than the Northeast and Midwest. Texas was behind only North Dakota and the District of Columbia in population growth since the last big census in 2010. It gained four seats the last time seats in Congress were divided up.

California has 38.33 million people who live in it, and Texas has 26.45 million. They are still the states with the highest populations.

New York kept its third-place spot. It has 19.65 million people, compared with Florida's 19.55 million. But Florida will soon be bigger than New York. Its population is growing about three times faster.

## Booming Business Helps North Dakota

Over the last year, California's growth was higher than the national average. It added 332,643 new residents. But in total, Texas grew the most, adding 387,397 people.

More and better-paying Californian jobs might mean faster growth in California. But Texas still has an advantage. Its jobs come from oil, and its population has more young people.

Texas is going to have an advantage in getting seats in Congress, until the oil business gets worse again, said Dowell Myers. He is a professor at the University of Southern California.

"But California's adding jobs more rapidly now than Texas," he said. "So probably next year I would bet that California's share of the growth is up a little bit more."

North Dakota is the nation's fastest-growing state. Its booming oil and gas business has has brought in more jobs and people to the state. North Dakota's population stood at 723,393 on July 1. Since the 2010 census, North Dakota's population has grown by one-twelfth. This is a much faster rate than the nation as a whole.

Kevin Iverson runs the North Dakota Census Office. He says the biggest population growth has been among 19- to 34-year-olds. These are mostly people moving there for work.

Over the last year, North Dakota grew fastest, followed by the District of Columbia. Utah came next, followed by Colorado and Texas — which grew at the same speed. And then came Nevada.

West Virginia and Maine saw slight population drops in the last year. Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Vermont and Illinois had the slowest population growth. They didn't grow much at all.

The national population was 316.13 million on July 1, an increase of 2.3 million. But the population is growing slower nationally than it did in the mid-2000s. After that period of high growth, U.S. companies began to cut jobs and people had less money.
