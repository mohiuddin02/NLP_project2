WASHINGTON — For Ahmed Abdulateef, his musical gift has not brought him fame or fortune. Instead, he has had his life threatened and he was kicked out of his house. In his hometown of Baghdad, Iraq, musicians and artists face threats from people who follow a strict version of Islam.

For a while, Abdulateef played music in secret. Then he learned of a month-long U.S. cultural exchange program. It would allow him to perform in California, New Mexico and other places he had only heard about. He applied and finally got word that he was the only Iraqi selected.

In the United States, Abdullateef was free to walk down the street with his oud slung over his shoulder. An oud is a guitar-like Middle Eastern instrument.

"Here, for the first time, I'm Ahmed," he said.

## Newfound Freedom

Abdulateef found this new freedom so precious that he wanted to stay in the United States permanently. He applied for asylum Nov. 24, 2014.

If someone is facing danger in their own country for political, religious or artistic reasons, they can apply for asylum in another country. If the country accepts them, they can live there in safety.

He joined a surge of other Iraqis who hope to live in the United States because Iraq is not safe for them.

These Iraqis who have applied for asylum in the United States are finding that it is a slow process. They have had to wait months, even years, for a decision.

Today, the pipeline that processes requests for U.S. asylum has become clogged, immigration lawyers say. There are more serious conflicts in the Middle East and more asylum seekers. The rise of extremist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has the U.S. government worried that violent extremists may use the asylum system to sneak into the United States.

Islamic State is a radical group in Iraq and Syria that wants to set up its own country under strict Islamic law. It is also known as ISIS or ISIL.

## "This Is A New Life"

"I don't have a plan B," Abdulateef said. "This is a new life, a whole new life, and it's worth fighting to stay here."

The goal of the asylum program is to provide sanctuary — a safe place — for foreigners who face serious threats in their home countries. According to those guidelines, Abdulateef's case may seem like it should be an easy "yes."

He already underwent comprehensive security checks before being allowed to visit the United States in the first place. Also, he is fluent in English.

Washington immigration lawyer David Garfield took Abdulateef's case pro bono, which means working for free. He said Abdulateef's engaging story and the serious threats to him are not enough for a quick decision.

Garfield is representing other Iraqis who also have strong cases: female doctors fleeing kidnapping threats, a man who is being threatened for converting to Christianity, and a man who helped U.S. forces sort through evidence against members of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's government.

Their cases have dragged on for nearly a year. The lives of these Iraqis remain unsettled as they await the news that will determine their futures.

"It looks like they're just sitting on the Iraqi cases," Garfield said. "All these letters, they just don't get responded to. There's been no decisions: no denials, no approvals."

## More People Seek Asylum

Applications for U.S. asylum are handled by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS). The number of asylum requests from Iraqis rose to 1,133 in 2014, up from 788 the year before, according to CIS. The rise is likely due to the emergence of Islamic State in that period, the agency said.

The approval rate dropped slightly, from 84 to 82 percent. Still, the number of open cases at the end of the year doubled. Today, there are more than 1,300 Iraqi asylum cases still open, according to the most recent figures.

Abdulateef, 23, almost certainly faces life-threatening dangers if he returns to Iraq. Radical fighters there have a clear history of violently silencing musicians and other artists.

His trip to the United States may have made things worse. He bonded with American musicians — playing Metallica on his oud, and being introduced to instruments like the mandolin.

The cultural exchange that brought him to the United States was mostly paid for by the U.S. government. In the eyes of Iraqi extremists, he is now linked to the U.S. government.

## Understanding And Tolerance

Abdulateef said he did not come to the United States with the idea of applying for asylum. He learned of the asylum process from American friends, who steered him to Garfield, the immigration lawyer.

To apply for asylum, Abdulateef had to submit an affidavit, an official document telling his story. His experiences are unique, but they also echo the faded hopes of many Iraqis who want to live in a country where basic freedoms are protected.

He said he hopes the U.S. officials who eventually consider his case agree that he can do more to promote Iraqi arts outside Iraq, at least for now.

"All I want is to be safe from fear and be able to continue my musical career," which is all about understanding different cultures and tolerating different views, Abdulateef's affidavit says. "Unfortunately, these principles are not welcome in my country at the moment."
