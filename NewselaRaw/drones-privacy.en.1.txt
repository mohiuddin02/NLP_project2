LOS ANGELES â€” A couple of weeks ago, some Los Angeles Kings fans were celebrating the team's Stanley Cup victory when a drone buzzed overhead.

Unhappy about this, the fans knocked the unmanned aircraft down with a T-shirt, then smashed it into bits with a skateboard.

What remains of the drone is sitting in a Los Angeles Police Department property room, waiting for its owner to claim it. If the owner steps forward, police will simply give it back. Flying a drone in public is not illegal, police concluded.

"It was kind of an eye-opener for us that this is something we really need to pay attention to," said LAPD Commander Andrew Smith about the drone outside the Kings game. "It's certainly something that's growing enormously."

## Flying For Fun

[Drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) piloted either by onboard computers or remotely by a person on the ground. They are being used by more people, especially as a way for people to create videos. Many drones are outfitted with cameras and can take pictures without people noticing. YouTube, for instance, is filled with drone videos taking in the views of Yosemite. This prompted rangers last month to ban the flying machines. At the Grand Canyon recently, a drone crashed, stunning visitors who were there to watch the sunset.

On Friday, the National Parks Service announced that it intended to ban low-flying drones on the 84 million acres of land it manages. It mentioned concerns about visitor safety and the effect on wildlife.

Other drone-filmed videos are popping up on the Internet. They show sporting events, local beaches and even checkpoints where police check for drunk drivers.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of the country's skies, has a host of regulations about how private businesses and law enforcement can use drones. But there are few rules covering people who fly them for fun.

A decision by a federal committee in March further complicated the making of rules. Recently, a pilot was issued a $10,000 ticket for flying a drone over the University of Virginia as part of a photography project. Judges with the National Transportation Safety Board, though, decided that he didn't do anything wrong and he shouldn't have to pay the fine. The FAA is appealing the ruling.

## More Drones Coming

The FAA estimated that there could be 7,500 people flying drones within five years. Federal officials said they hope to create clearer drone rules by 2015, but some experts said that timeline is not realistic.

The rise in civilian drone use comes as prices for the aircraft decline. Prices now range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.

In California, Torrance resident Daniel Saulmon, 42, has been flying his drone around the South Bay region of Los Angeles County for about a month. He created a website on which he regularly posts videos shot at police drunk driving checkpoints. He said he records officers to monitor their treatment of motorists.

"My attorney told me there isn't really much regulation on them," said Saulmon, whose recordings are well-known to police officers. Saulmon said the drone isn't a substitute for a hand-held camera, but it's definitely a good addition.

Saulmon also has flown his drone over oil refineries and along the Hermosa Beach pier.

He doesn't see that he's violating anyone's privacy.

## "They're So In-Your-Face"

But the presence of drones is causing a backlash, because many people don't like something taking pictures of them without their knowledge.

"Once drones become widely used in our society, there's going to be a lot of concern," said Jennifer Lynch. She is a senior attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital legal advocacy group in San Francisco. "It's because they're so in-your-face. It's easy to see the drone, it's easy to recognize the privacy implications."

At Hermosa Beach in California last year, an angry mother confronted a lifeguard about a drone. It was hovering near her and her daughter, snapping photos while they were tanning.

In Connecticut, a man flying a drone over a beach was attacked by a woman who accused him of trying to take pictures of her.

And at Mount Rushmore, a ranger confiscated a drone after it flew around the national monument and over the heads of visitors.

In April, volunteers at Zion National Park in Utah watched a drone buzz over a herd of bighorn sheep. The drone separated the adults from the young.

"Those are the kinds of things that have been going on," said National Park Service spokesman Jeffrey Olson, who said drones bother people and animals.

## Raising Red Flags

The FAA said that flying drones is generally permitted as long as the pilots don't fly recklessly. Guidelines created in 1981 for model airplanes suggest that pilots should fly at safe altitudes and distances near airports and avoid crowds.

Police said there are some activities they consider illegal. One would be drones interfering with aviation activities. Using the planes to spy on neighbors would also raise red flags.

"I have to weigh it on a case by case basis," said Lieutenant Phil Smith, assistant commanding officer for the LAPD's air support division.

But most of the cases police deal with don't concern privacy. They often involve drones capturing beautiful scenery or historic moments like the Kings' Stanley Cup victory celebration a few weeks ago.

"It's going to take one of those dropping out of the sky and hitting someone, or a movie star making a big issue out of it," said Terry Yamamoto, Los Angeles County Fire Department's South Bay lifeguard division chief.
