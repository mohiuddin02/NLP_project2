KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” Farmers can't change the weather, of course. But perhaps now they will be able to outwit Mother Nature.

A company called Climate Corp. may be able to help. It is offering farmers a new way to handle severe weather patterns.

These days more and more farmers are seeing crops fail. Overheating, drought and increasingly wild weather swings are taking their toll.

"We're moving into a period of very unstable weather, and that's what producers need to be prepared for," said Jerry Hatfield, a scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

## Nitty Gritty On Farmers Fields

Scientists believe they know the cause of the crazy weather: climate change, or [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming), caused by humans when they burn fuels like gas.

There are still many people who don't believe climate change is real.

Still, scientists are planning ahead. They are trying to figure out ways for farmers to get a good harvest even if rain is less dependable and temperatures shift.

Enter Climate Corp. Started six years ago, the company uses huge amounts of information to develop super-local weather forecasts.

To make its forecasts, Climate Corp. looks at weather readings taken at 10 million spots. These readings are matched with 40 years worth of information about how much farm fields produce, or yield.

The company can provide detailed information about 29 million U.S. fields. Farmers receive forecasts for rain, soil conditions and wind speed.

The service can also give farmers a range of details about their land. For example, farmers can get an estimate of how much their fields are likely to produce. They can also receive reports on things like how wet their soil is. Or a rundown on how well their crops are growing.

"Farmers still face a tough battle out there every year. Hopefully this helps them," said Climate Corp. vice president Jim Ethington.

## Warming Weather Warnings

Ted Guetterman farms about 10,000 acres. His dad and three brothers work with him.

Guetterman said he's willing to look this new high-tech farming. But he thinks he's his own best judge of what needs to be done.

"Nobody knows my land better than I do," Guetterman said. "I've been farming it all my life."

Guetterman said he would take some advice from a company. But, he added, "I'm not going to do my whole farm that way."

Scientists say global climate change is worsening. Rising temperatures and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are hurting farming. And they are changing the way crops are grown.

A USDA report this year warned of increasing change in weather patterns and the effect on crops.

Kansas will likely see big changes due to warming temperatures. So will other Great Plains states, including Oklahoma, Nebraska and South Dakota.

The USDA estimates that by 2050 wheat production will drop 6 percent and corn yields will fall 4 percent across the Great Plains.

## "Climate Is Going To Change"

A Kansas State University study also points to serious problems ahead. It estimated that for every 1 degree Celsius increase in average temperature, the wheat yield in Kansas would drop by one-fifth. This works out to a loss of 10.6 bushels per acre.

It's a startling estimate considering how much temperatures in the area are expected to rise: about 2 to 3 degrees C in the next 40 years.

Few in Kansas believe climate change is going to push wheat or corn out of the state. But it could make growing them more risky.

"The variability from year to year is going be greater," said soil expert Charles Rice. Farmers will have to have "money in the bank to pay for those poor years."

Rice and others say agriculture will have to adapt. There will have to be better weather forecasting. And there will have to be better control of the soil and new ways of growing plants.

Scientists are now working on developing a new type of wheat. They hope to produce one that will hold up better as temperatures rise.

Hatfield, the USDA expert, said farmers will need to adjust to climate change.

"Climate has changed, climate is changing," he said. "And climate is going to change in the future."
