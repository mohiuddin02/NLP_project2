Inside the Maryland Table Tennis Center, balls ping, pong, pop and zing. Sneakers squeak on the floor. Young people laugh and shout.

The noise does not seem to bother Crystal Wang. She is used to it. The 13-year-old finishes her homework in a corner, then heads over to the blue table.

Crystal picks up a paddle, bends her knees and leans forward. She looks at the boy across from her. Then she hits the ball and sends a great shot over the net.

Derek Nie is ready. In a flash, the 14-year-old sends the ball back to Crystal.

Crystal and Derek are not just having fun. They are two of the best young table tennis players in the country.

## Players Think Fast!

Table tennis is also known as Ping-Pong. It is played indoors on a table that looks just like a small tennis court. The table even has a net that goes across the middle.

Playing table tennis takes lots of small, quick moves. Players' hands and feet move at the same time and they have to think fast. "It feels like a rush," Derek says.

Crystal and Derek both live about 10 miles from the center. It is located in Gaithersburg, Maryland. They train there almost every day.

## The Teens Are "Amazing"

Derek started playing table tennis when he was 7 years old. His older brother was learning how to play, so Derek joined him. Crystal's grandparents taught her how to play. She started when she was just 5 years old.

Now Crystal and Derek work with coach Larry Hodges. Coach Hodges says they are "amazing" because they work hard day after day. They push themselves to get better and they never complain.

Hodges says Crystal and Derek also do very well in school. "Somehow they balance it all," he said.

Derek does more than just homework and table tennis. He is on the math team and plays the violin.

Crystal makes excellent grades even though tennis keeps her very busy. She has competed in places like Japan, Canada, India and Austria. Every summer, she travels to China for extra training.

## Olympic Dreams

Crystal has won matches against women almost twice her age. In 2014, she became the youngest woman ever to make the USA National Team.

Derek plays in big matches all over the United States. He even won his age group at last year's U.S. Open.

These days, both players are training hard to make it into the 2016 Olympic Games.

"My dream is to make the Olympic team," Crystal says. She also hopes her table tennis skills will help her earn a college scholarship. She wants to become a doctor.

## Win, Lose, Learn

Derek and Crystal are both very talented, but they do not win all the time.

Earlier this year, Crystal lost a big match. She was nervous and had trouble concentrating. "I did really bad, but I just tried to learn from the experience," Crystal says.

Table tennis helps Derek and Crystal to grow in other parts of their lives. Derek used to get nervous when he had to get up in front of his whole class. Now he says it is no big deal compared with playing in a big match.

Crystal and Derek take their sport very seriously, but they also have fun along the way. Crystal says she loves making new friends at her matches. "And she really likes to win," Derek adds with a laugh.
