LOS ANGELES â€” A couple of weeks ago, some Los Angeles Kings fans noticed an unmanned aircraft buzzing overhead. The hockey team had just won the Stanley Cup and the fans were celebrating.

Angry at being interrupted, they knocked it down with a T-shirt. Then, they used a skateboard to smash it into bits.

What remains of the drone is sitting in a Los Angeles Police Department property room. If the owner wants to claim it, police will simply give it back. Flying a drone in public is not illegal, police concluded.

"It was kind of an eye-opener for us that this is something we really need to pay attention to," said LAPD Commander Andrew Smith about the drone. "It's certainly something that's growing enormously."

## Drones Banned At National Parks

[Drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) piloted either by onboard computers or remotely by a person on the ground. As the unmanned aircraft become more popular, their use is raising questions about people's privacy. Drones can be equipped with cameras and take pictures from overhead without people noticing.

Recently, people have been using them to make videos. YouTube, for instance, is filled with drone videos of Yosemite National Park. This led rangers last month to issue a public notice saying the planes are banned. At the Grand Canyon recently, a drone crashed, stunning visitors who were there to watch the sunset.

On Friday, the National Parks Service announced that it will ban low-flying drones in all of its parks. The decision came out of concern for the safety of visitors and the effects of the drones on wildlife.

Other drone-filmed videos are popping up on the Internet. Many of them show sports events and local beaches.

The Federal Aviation Administration has made rules about how businesses and police can use drones. Farmers can use drones to monitor their fields, for instance. Real estate agents photograph homes for sale with drones. Amazon even plans to deliver packages via drones. But there are few rules covering people who fly the remote-controlled planes for fun.

## A New Hobby Takes Off

The FAA estimated that there could be 7,500 people flying drones within five years. Federal officials said they hope to create clearer rules by 2015. But some experts believe it will take longer.

The rise in everyday drone use comes as prices for the aircraft have fallen. Prices now range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.

In California, Torrance resident Daniel Saulmon has been flying his drone for about a month. He created a website on which he regularly posts videos shot at police checkpoints. He said he records officers to monitor their treatment of motorists.

Saulmon also has flown his drone over oil production plants and a pier.

He doesn't see that he's interfering with anyone's privacy.

## Drone Upsets Beach Sunbathers

But strong feelings against drones are on the rise. Many people don't like something taking pictures of them without their knowledge.

"Once drones become widely used in our society, there's going to be a lot of concern," said Jennifer Lynch. She is a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a technology legal group in San Francisco. "It's because they're so in-your-face. It's easy to see the drone, it's easy to recognize the privacy" issues.

At a beach last year, a mother became upset when a drone snapped photos of her and her daughter while they were tanning.

At Mount Rushmore, a drone flew around the national monument and over the heads of visitors. A ranger seized it.

In April, volunteers at Zion National Park in Utah watched a drone buzz over a herd of bighorn sheep. The drone separated the adults from the young.

"Those are the kinds of things that have been going on," said National Park Service spokesman Jeffrey Olson. He said that drones bother both people and animals.

## Don't Spy On Your Neighbor

The FAA said that flying a drone is generally allowed as long as the pilots fly safely. Guidelines suggest that pilots should be careful near airports and avoid crowds.

Police said that some drone uses are against the law. They can't interfere with aircraft. People also can't use the planes to spy on their neighbors.

"I have to weigh it on a case-by-case basis," said Lieutenant Phil Smith. He is with the Los Angeles Police Department.

But most cases don't involve drones taking pictures of sunbathers. Usually, they are photographing beautiful scenery or historic moments like the Kings' Stanley Cup victory celebration a few weeks ago.

"It's going to take one of those dropping out of the sky and hitting someone, or a movie star making a big issue out of it," said Terry Yamamoto. He is a division chief with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
