The forest murmurs with the whir of their flapping wings.

Every year, hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies fly the length of North America to spend the winter in Mexico. It may be the world's longest insect migration.

Yet the great monarch butterfly migration is in danger, because of the unlimited use of weed-killing chemicals, extreme weather, and the destruction of forests.

The colonies of butterflies in central Mexico are dense. There are as many as several million butterflies in one acre. But monarch butterfly populations are falling. This year, the colonies were far smaller than ever before.

## On The Brink?

Scientists say Mexico's monarch butterfly colonies are on the brink of disappearing.

"We see these things as so delicate. But if they migrate from Canada all the way down to Mexico, they are pretty tough," said Craig Wilson, a scientist at Texas A&amp;M University.

The orange-and-black monarch butterfly is a beloved insect that most school kids can easily identify. It is the state insect of Alabama, Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont and West Virginia.

Scientists say there are many possible reasons for the monarch's decline, but they're focusing now on one major one: Monarch butterflies can't survive without the milkweed. The milkweed is a broadleaf plant that's widely treated as a weed to be wiped out entirely. It is sprayed with chemicals called herbicides in farmlands and along highway shoulders.

Female monarchs lay eggs on milkweed. When they hatch, the larvae grow into caterpillars that feed on the milkweed's leaves. Those leaves contain a poison that protects the monarchs from their predators. The caterpillars then form chrysalises, and soon emerge as butterflies.

## Milkweed Getting Destroyed

Milkweed is most common in the high-grass prairies in Canada and the U.S. Midwest. But its 70 types also grow along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, in the Caribbean, and elsewhere.

Over the past 10 years, the number of U.S. fields containing milkweed has fallen sharply. Orley Taylor, a monarch expert at the University of Kansas, calls the loss "massive."

The use of new corn and soybean types that can withstand the herbicides has added to the loss. Now farmers use a stronger weed killer. That has had a huge effect on milkweed, which before could grow among crops or at the edges of fields.

"The crops survive but any weeds, including milkweed, don't," said Wilson, the scientist at Texas A&amp;M.

At the same time, the number of monarch butterflies spending winter in Mexico has dropped.

## "Stop Killing The Milkweed"

Most monarchs live only a little more than a month. But one generation each year lives seven or eight months. That's long enough to migrate to central Mexico before winter sets in. There, they often cluster around the same fir trees as their forebears, perhaps drawn by chemical cues. In the spring, the monarchs return to the north, where they lay eggs on milkweed and then die, giving way to a new generation.

The declining monarch colonies worry scientists, who fear they may be a warning of other environmental crises. They worry what the decline of the monarch butterflies means for insects and birds that rely on the same environment.

The decline in the butterflies also threatens people's jobs and ability to support themselves in central Mexico. Tourists travel to Mexico on vacation to see the butterflies. That creates jobs for Mexicans who work in hotels and restaurants, or as tour guides. Those jobs help them provide for their families.

Fernando Guzman Cruz is a member of a group that protects a local butterfly reserve. He says only 55,000 vacationers came this season, a drop of 50 percent from a year earlier. Cruz blames the decline on U.S. agricultural practices.

"We want you to stop killing the milkweed," he told a U.S. visitor.

## How To Help Monarch Butterflies In Your Area

One of the main reasons for the recent decline of monarch butterflies, scientists think, is the eradication of milkweed plants. Monarchs lay their eggs on these plants and their larvae eat them. Here are suggestions how people can help:

— Plant native milkweed in your yard and encourage local government to plant it in parks. There are several sources for free milkweed seeds. Consult livemonarch.com for sources of seeds. Monarchwatch.org provides a list of providers of milkweed plants and seeds. Be sure to determine which variety is appropriate to the area where you live.

— Join programs to monitor monarch butterfly movements and presence in your area. A national count conducted by the North American Butterfly Association is July 1 in Canada and July 4 in the United States. The association's website is naba.org.

— Write to lawmakers to encourage them to plant milkweed along highway roadsides. Roadsides along monarch migratory routes are especially important.
