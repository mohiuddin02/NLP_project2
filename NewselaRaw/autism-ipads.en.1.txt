AUSTIN, Texas — Jaime Morin, 9, has autism, a condition that has made him nonverbal — unable to talk — his entire life. But things have gotten better ever since his mother, Lupe Santander, found out about Zach's Voice, an organization that provides iPads to autistic children who have trouble communicating.

"He can say exactly what he wants with the iPad," says Santander. "When he first figured it out, the look on his face was priceless. We could finally understand him, we didn't have to say 'Yes' or 'No' when he pointed to things."

Because children with autism who are nonverbal cannot talk, the thoughts occupying their heads are unable to come out — that's where the iPad comes in. Through the app of their choice, the children can form sentences by putting together words, which come in the form of buttons and a picture to match the word. Then, they play the sentences back for others to hear. The iPad becomes their voice.

"It facilitates their understanding of the world around them," says teacher Danielle Skala, who specializes in teaching kids basic communication skills. She has a few students who use iPads in her classroom.

## Inspiration For Zach's Voice

Zach's Voice became an official organization last May, a month after giving out their first iPad. Their mission is to provide iPads to autistic children who have communication disabilities.

Zach's Voice was founded by Abby Whitworth, who named the organization after her 7-year-old son. Whitworth was inspired by Zach's experience with the iPad. Before the Apple product, he used DynaVox, a heavy device that was hard to program, Whitworth said. Besides being clunky, it drew attention to him — while with an iPad, he blends in.

A particular incident at the grocery store gave Whitworth the idea of spreading the positive effects of the iPad to other families with nonverbal kids. While shopping, she saw an autistic child walking around with note cards, which he used to communicate. The number of words available through this approach, however, is limited.

"The iPad lets kids use all the words they want," says Whitworth. "It's an unlimited amount of options, as opposed to what you get with handwritten note cards."

"With picture books and note cards," says Skala, "I got to decide what the kids said — now, the child decides."

## Just The Right App

The app recommended by Zach's Voice is ProLoQuo2Go, which costs $219.99 at the iTunes store. The organization provides a gift card that covers the cost of whatever app families decide to download. Jaime chose Lamp Words for Life, the program he had been using with his therapist.

ProLoQuo2Go lets kids add words to the program, such as family members' names and the names of their favorite cartoon characters.

"The kids start off using the app to communicate about the things they love," says Whitworth. "It's rewarding and motivates them to use the program."

Zach's Voice works with teachers and schools to find families who would benefit from the program.

Parents must promise to use the iPad strictly for the benefit of the autistic child, and no other apps are allowed to be downloaded. The idea is that the iPad is to be used as a means to help the kid communicate and for no other purpose. It becomes part of the child's everyday activity, just as essential as wearing shoes when they leave the house.

## A Whole New World

The iPad can do more than just help children with autism communicate — it sometimes also can make it easier for them to talk.

"Zach talks now," Whitworth says. "It started six months ago, about a year and a half after he first got his iPad."

According to a study done by researcher Ann Kaiser, children with autism can "learn to speak later than previously thought." iPads, she wrote, are "playing an increasing role in making that happen." The devices can encourage children ages 5 to 8 to develop speaking skills, Kaiser says.

Jaime's speech has also expanded since he began using the iPad. He has started to repeat sentences and words after hearing them through the app, and when he hears a certain pronunciation, he tries to imitate it.

"It opens up their world, their voice can be heard," Santander says. "He's not stuck in his little body anymore. It has given him confidence."

The iPad as a communication device also can relieve anxiety.

"Being heard and understood can be a great source of relief for our kids," Whitworth says.
