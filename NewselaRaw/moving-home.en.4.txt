More young adults are living with their parents after college. And that's a good thing, a new study says.

The new study found about one in three adults from 18 to 31 live with their parents. This is the most in at least 40 years. Some people say they're lazy and don't want to work.

But a closer look at the numbers shows this isn't true. All signs point to a group of young people doing things their own way. And it may be the right way.

"This generation is making wiser, more careful choices," says Robin Marantz Henig. She is co-author of "Twentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck?"

## Home, But Not For Long

First, a look at the numbers. The study found that one out of every three adults ages 18 to 31 live at home.

The study found important reasons for this. More young people than ever are going to college. Also, almost half of the 18- to 31-year-olds didn't have jobs.

It's partly because there aren't as many jobs out there. But experts say it is also because young adults are waiting to find jobs that are meaningful. Varda Konstam is one of those experts. She is a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.

Also, most young adults don't stay with their parents for long. They find jobs and move out. They usually move out within six months to a year.

## "In Their Own Way"

"They almost all move home for (money) reasons. And they almost always move out as soon as possible," says Arnett.

Both the parents and children really want the same thing, Konstam said. "They do want to be successful at work ... They do want to own a house, " she said. "But they tend to do it in their own way."

Living with parents can really help out. The adult children would be much poorer if they didn't live at home. It gives them time to figure out what they want to do. It also helps them make better decisions.

In 2013, Clark University questioned parents of 18- to 29-year-olds. The parents all had kids living at home. The parents were asked how it was going. Most of them said it was going great, Arnett said.
