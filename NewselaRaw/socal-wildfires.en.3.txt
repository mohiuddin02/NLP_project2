SAN DIEGO â€” On Wednesday, brush fires broke out in more than six places in northern San Diego County. During the day, the fires spread at a dangerous pace. Their progress was spurred on by hot, dry winds and record-high temperatures.

Crews also battled flames in other parts of Southern California.

The San Diego fires forced many evacuations. People hurriedly left schools, businesses, homes, a mobile-home park and even a college in San Marcos.

The most destructive of the blazes was the Poinsettia fire in Carlsbad. Eight homes, an apartment building and two businesses were destroyed or damaged.

## "It's OK, I'm Alive"

Homeowners had only minutes to get out. They gathered treasured belongings and pets and ran.

"There was just no time," said Greg Staska, 63, whose home was destroyed. "But it's OK, I'm alive."

By day's end, the fire was no longer spreading. However, officials said, it was still not contained and hot spots remained troublesome. According to Carlsbad Fire Chief Michael Davis, firefighters have "days of work to be done."

Meanwhile, the Tomahawk fire at Camp Pendleton, a Marine Corps. base, burned more than 6,000 acres. It forced evacuations of two housing areas and two schools.

Erik Bye, 28, a programmer at 24 Hour Fitness, experienced two fires. At work in Carlsbad, he saw smoke from the Poinsettia fire approaching. "The smoke just kept growing, growing, growing," he said. "It wouldn't stop. We weren't sure what to do."

He raced home to San Marcos where he felt it would be safe. Instead a fire erupted there and covered his neighborhood in smoke. Without waiting for an evacuation order, Bye left.

"It's been a bad day," he said. That comment was heard frequently from others in northern San Diego County.

## "A Scene From Armageddon"

Various evacuation centers were set up for those trying to escape Wednesday's fires. Among them were schools, a shopping center, a senior center and a golf course. Several people with large trailers volunteered to move neighbors' horses to safety.

And in the canyons next to Rancho Santa Fe and Fairbanks Ranch, firefighters continued to battle the Bernardo fire. This erupted on Tuesday. By early Wednesday, it had burned 1,500 acres.

"It's like a scene from Armageddon," one homeowner said as thick, black smoke blotted out the sun.

Hundreds of homes and businesses were evacuated as the Bernardo blaze raged out of control. Several elementary schools and libraries were emptied out as well.

Legoland in Carlsbad was closed, leaving disappointed vacationers. Heath and Gina Seifert of Glendale were en route to the theme park with their two daughters. Suddenly, the traffic on Interstate 5 locked up. News of the fire began to spread.

"They were like, 'Where's Legoland from here,' and we were like, 'It might be on fire,'" Heath said of his daughters.

Legoland did not burn, but the rides were shut down and the park was evacuated.

County firefighters raced from fire to fire.

As bad as Wednesday's fires were, San Diego County has seen worse. Many remember raging fires in 2003 and 2007. People in the area, state official Dave Jones said, "are all too familiar with the destructive force of wildfires."
