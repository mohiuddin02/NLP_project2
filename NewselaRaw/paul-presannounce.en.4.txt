LOUISVILLE, Ky. â€” Senator Rand Paul just announced that he wants to become the 2016 Republican candidate for president of the United States.

Whoever wins the most Republican votes will run in the general election against Democrats and other political parties. The winner of that race becomes the new president.

## Ready For The Bigger Job

Paul was just voted into Congress in 2010. He has already become known as a rebel. People have grown angry with political leaders. He took advantage of that anger. He jumped from being a Kentucky eye doctor to a job as senator.

"We have come to take our country back!" Paul told a crowd at his campaign launch in Louisville. He said that companies and other groups have influenced Washington too much. They have pushed the government to get money for causes they support. He said they use the government as "their personal piggy bank."

Paul stood on a stage surrounded by American flags. He spoke of the need for diversity. He said all Americans need to be included in the American dream. His speech aimed to attract people who do not vote for Republicans.

"The message of liberty, opportunity and justice is for all Americans, whether you wear a suit, a uniform or overalls, whether you're white or black, rich or poor," Paul said. Many Americans, though, are being left behind. He said, "the poor seem to get poorer and the rich get richer."

## He Has A Lot To Say

Paul is the second major Republican candidate to jump into the 2016 race for president. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas announced his plans to run in March.

People have noticed Paul since he first entered Congress. He has clashed with leaders in the Republican Party. He has proposed his own plan to fix government spending. In 2013, he spoke on the floor of Congress for almost 13 hours straight to stop a vote. He was against President Obama's use of unmanned planes called drones. He was worried that they could drop bombs on Americans.

The speech made him a star among younger Republicans. Many had been looking for a new voice.

## Who Should Get The Money?

Paul frequently criticized the Republican Party when he made his announcement. He said his own party was part of the problem. At the same time, he called for the government to spend less money. Paul would like people to keep more of their own money. When the government taxes people less, they have more money to keep. He believes that when people have more money to spend, it creates jobs.

He also spoke out against government debt. When the government spends more money than it has, it borrows money to pay for programs. The borrowed money is a debt. In the future, it must get paid back.

"Both parties and the entire political system are to blame," he said. "Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration. And it's now tripling under Barack Obama."

## "A New President"

Paul still works as an eye doctor. Even now, he performs free eye surgeries. Paul had never been in government until running for the Senate in 2010. Yet he's been involved in politics his entire life. He is the son of one of America's most famous politicians.

Paul is expected to keep pushing for the Republican Party to reach new voters.

"White, black, brown, rich, poor, with tattoos and without tattoos, with earrings and without earrings," Paul said at a meeting in February. "We need to take our message where it's not been before."

In Washington, D.C., Paul has been known for working with Democrats. He worked with another Democratic senator to change laws that will fix the criminal justice system. Paul has also been trying to appeal to black voters. He pushed to get money to help Detroit, a city where many black voters live.

"It's time for a new way, a new set of ideas, a new leader," Paul said in February. "Above all, it's time for a new president."
