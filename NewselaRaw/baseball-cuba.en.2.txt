HAVANA, Cuba â€” Cuba has produced some of the world's great baseball players. Many Cuban-born players do not play in their own country, however. Instead, they choose to play abroad where they can earn more money. Officials in Cuba have put new policies into effect aimed at keeping their players from leaving.

The island's national league began its 54th season on Sunday. For years, talented players have been leaving Cuba to play overseas, chasing dreams of riches in countries like the United States. With so many gifted players leaving, the overall talent level of the league has gone down.

"There's no way that economically Cuba is going to keep enough top players in the country to have the quality of league they had five or 10 years ago," said Peter C. Bjarkman. He is the author of "A History of Cuban Baseball, 1864-2006."

Up until recently, the rules prohibited players from signing contracts in other countries. In 1959, a revolution in Cuba succeeded in overthrowing the government. The new state was set up according to communist ideas. Under that system, players were paid by the government rather than by privately owned teams. The government forbid them from playing professionally outside of Cuba.

## Cuba Changes Its Rules

The result was that players who wanted international careers left the island illegally. Doing so meant not only abandoning Cuba's national league but also abandoning Cuba itself.

In September 2013, however, Cuba established a new policy. It was a compromise, giving players more freedom in the hope that fewer of them would decide to leave Cuba for good.

The new rules allow ballplayers to sign offseason contracts in countries like Japan and Mexico. Large chunks of these players' salaries will go to the state, however, and players must return to play in Cuba throughout the year. In addition, the Cuban league has also given raises to on-island athletes.

Cuban officials hoped that these reforms would help keep talented players from leaving. Overall, however, the changes do not seem to be having much effect.

Despite the new policies, Cuban players still have to choose between playing in the United States and remaining Cuban citizens - they cannot do both. When Cuba became a communist country, the United States passed several laws against doing business with Cuba.

A 52-year-old U.S. law bars major league players from paying Cuban taxes. Even if the Cuban government allowed players to play in both countries, the American government would not. In other words, Cuban players still cannot compete in the United States without permanently leaving the island.

## Hitting The Big Time

The appeal of the majors is strong for Cuban players. For one thing, the salaries offered in the United States are hard to pass up.

This summer, outfielder Rusney Castillo left Cuba and signed a $72.5 million, seven-year deal with the Boston Red Sox. This topped outfielder Jose Abreu's $68 million, six-year contract with the Chicago White Sox last October. The contracts for six of the top-earning Cuban-born major leaguers total close to $280 million.

Such large paychecks are very attractive to Cuban players. As a result, Cuba's best players may continue to leave. This year alone, 13 Cuban players signed new major or minor league contracts, up from 10 last year.

Money is not the only attraction. Industriales pitcher Odrisamer Despaigne, 27, left Cuba this past February. Three months later, he agreed to a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres.

"I needed new challenges," he explained. "That's why I left my country, to achieve my dream of playing with the best in the major leagues."

## Illegally Leaving Cuba

The reforms are not enough to keep players like Despaigne from leaving. The appeal of the majors is so strong that players continue to seek contracts with major league teams.

Doing so is not easy. Typically, players who wish to leave quietly stop playing in Cuba. They then establish residency in another country. From there, they look to get hired by American and Canadian teams.

Illegally leaving Cuba can be dangerous and expensive. The Cuban government does not allow citizens to come and go as they please. Players often have to leave in secret. Many ballplayers are smuggled out of Cuba by human-trafficking groups in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Such dangerous journeys have not stopped young Cubans from dreaming of playing in the major leagues, however.

Take 15-year-old Ernesto Medina, for example. He dreams of being a great baseball player one day. "To start, I'm dreaming of playing for Industriales, the greatest Cuban baseball team in my opinion," he said. He does not want to stay in Cuba forever, though. "Afterward of course I'd like to play in the major leagues."

As long as players like Medina keep dreaming of making it in the United States, Cuba's national league may continue to lose its best players.
