New Jersey Governor Chris Christie appeared on "The Late Show with David Letterman." He chomped down on a jelly doughnut and mocked his own hefty weight. Ten days later, he underwent a secret medical procedure to help him shed pounds.

And then it was back to work, as if nothing had happened. No mention of the procedure at any of the meetings Christie held that week.

"If I had the choice, I wouldn't have ever talked about it," Christie said on Tuesday. He said that a news report about his surgery nearly three months ago was indeed true. Christie has joked about his weight throughout his career. However, the governor said it was his plan all along never to admit publicly that he had undergone surgery. The procedure is commonly known as lap band surgery.

"It's nobody else's business," Christie said. He added that it became public only because a reporter from the New York Post asked him a direct question about the procedure. "I would never have lied about it."

## Does Surgery Signal Presidential Hopes?

It is, Christie said, a deeply private matter for a man who has struggled for decades with his weight. And he insisted it has absolutely nothing to do with politics. Christie is up for re-election soon. Political experts point to him as a possible 2016 Republican candidate for president.

Christie told reporters in a televised news conference on Tuesday that he decided to have the surgery because of his family. He has a wife, Mary Pat, and four children. He made the decision in September when he turned 50.

"My long-term goal is to get myself into a position where I'm healthier and I can live a longer life and be an active parent and hopefully someday grandparent," Christie said. He mentioned that his youngest two children are in elementary school.

"I want to try to put myself, as I get older, in the best position I can be to spend as much time with them as I possibly can," he said.

## Keeping Quiet

Christie declined to say how much weight he has lost. Nor would he say how much he weighs now or how much he plans to lose. He said such questions are nobody's business and called the media attention "ridiculous" and "silly."

The only people in the administration who knew of the surgery were his chief of staff and chief counsel, Christie said. Other that that, he discussed the procedure with no one outside his family. New York Jets coach Rex Ryan offered his personal experiences with the same surgery in a phone call. But Christie said he never told the coach that he was considering the surgery at the time.

## No Plans To Be A Role Model

Unlike former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, Christie said he has no plans to become an example for weight loss. "I do not see myself nor do I care to be a role model in this regard for anyone," he said. "This is an intensely personal issue for me." Less than two weeks before his surgery, Christie appeared on "The Late Show," where he pulled a doughnut out of his pocket and took a bite as Letterman asked Christie if his jokes about the governor's weight bothered him.

Christie replied that his size was "fair game" but also said, "I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life."

The next day, former White House physician Connie Mariano told CNN that she worries about his "dying in office."

The remark, which Christie said his children heard, drew fire from the governor. He called Mariano a "hack who wants five minutes on TV."

The governor has been open about his struggle with his weight. During a news conference after the Letterman appearance, he said "there's always a plan" to shed pounds. He said he's been working with a personal trainer four days since running for office. He said he began using the personal trainer three times a week in 2008. His workouts involve lifting weights and cardio exercises.

## Does Weight Matter To Voters?

Former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, a Democrat, tried to make an issue of Christie's weight in the 2009 gubernatorial election. Christie responded at the time saying, "I don't know what that has to do with being governor." Christie beat Corzine. Pollster Patrick Murray said some voters described Christie as overweight in polls, but that didn't stop them from supporting him.

"Now that he's governor, it doesn't matter because as long as he hasn't had a health scare, and the only thing that we know about is a trip to the emergency room for an asthma attack, the only thing people judge him on is his performance," Murray said.

But Murray said running for president would be different. It would put Christie on a stage with other Republican candidates, making his weight a factor. He pointed to an October 2011 poll; 20 percent of those surveyed said it was appropriate to talk about weight in a presidential race. And Murray said that doesn't account for the people who were thinking that, but didn't want to admit it.

He said it's likely that Christie wanted to lose the weight for his family, but political ambitions also matter. "You have to think that the looming presidential election in three years, which we all know he wants to run in, gave him that extra push to try something he wouldn't have otherwise," Murray said.

Christie insisted that politics played no part in his decision. And he's also said that he doesn't think his weight should be a factor if he decides to seek higher office.
