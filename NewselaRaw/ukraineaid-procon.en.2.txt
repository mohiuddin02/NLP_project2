### PRO: U.S. military aid to Ukraine would give Putin pause

WASHINGTON — Congress has an opportunity to push the United States in a more effective direction with regard to Ukraine. Republican and Democratic lawmakers should approve legislation put forward in the Senate that would give Ukraine $350 million in military aid. It needs the aid to help it fight Russia from taking more of its land.

Russia took Crimea from Ukraine in March. Many people in Crimea are ethnically Russian and speak Russian. Some wanted to separate from Ukraine, and began to fight Ukraine's government. Russia backed these separatists as they began their attacks. Then Russian troops invaded Ukraine and seized control of Crimea.

Russian President Vladimir Putin dreams of bringing back the Soviet empire. He wants to go back to the era when Russia ruled over Eastern Europe, including Ukraine. He scoffs at U.S. and European actions to stop him.

Putin won't be stopped from seizing more of Ukraine and plotting his next moves by the weak actions of the U.S. and Western Europe. So far, they've only put in place weak sanctions to prevent countries and businesses from trading with Russia. Threatening somewhat tougher sanctions won't do anything.

## Stopping Putin

That's important because Putin is not just carving up Ukraine. No, increasingly, he's threatening the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. All of those countries are now members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance led by the U.S. and Western Europe.

More broadly, Putin is threatening world peace.

Only U.S. military aid to Ukraine's weakened government could possibly stop Putin. So far we've given just non-military aid. As Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko told Congress recently with regard to U.S. non-military aid, "Blankets and night-vision goggles are important. But one cannot win a war with blankets."

Far from disturbing Putin, the West's actions so far have only encouraged him to push ahead.

## Sanctions Aren't Working

After Russia took Crimea, in an unfairly run election Crimeans voted 95.5 percent to join Russia. U.S. and European leaders called the election illegal. Then they imposed limited sanctions blocking some Russian trade, and conducted military exercises in the area. None of those actions stopped Putin.

Then, Russia aided pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, sent troops and arms across the border and cut off natural gas supplies on which Ukraine relies heavily. Russia then forced Ukraine to give the separatists self-rule over their area of Ukraine as part of a cease fire deal that was to stop the fighting. Not surprisingly, Russian separatists have already violated it.

President Barack Obama vowed to Russia that "there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine." The United States and Europe ramped up sanctions and Obama visited Estonia to show U.S. support for the Baltics. Again, Putin barely noticed.

Regarding the Baltics, a top Russian official recently complained of discrimination against ethnic Russians and the Russian language. He's clearly laying the groundwork for a Ukraine-like intervention in those countries.

In addition, Russia seized an Estonian official along their shared border and charged him with spying. It also captured a Lithuanian fishing ship, claiming that it had sailed into Russian waters. Even worse, Russia asked Lithuania to send 1,500 former Soviet citizens there to Russia. Supposedly, they hadn't fulfilled their military service during the Soviet Union.

## West Can't Be Weak

Weak Western action is just encouraging Putin. In mid-September, Russian nuclear bombers flew within 63 miles of Alaska's coast and 46 miles of Canada's. The action forced U.S. and Canadian jets to fly out and meet them.

Such Russian brashness comes at the same time the country is upgrading its nuclear arsenal with new missiles, submarines and a new bomber; test-firing new missiles; and strengthening its forces and bases in the Arctic.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the $350 million in aid for Ukraine on Sept. 18. Congress should quickly vote on it. Then President Obama should sign it.

Otherwise, we'll surely see more bold Russian attacks in Ukraine and beyond. They'll only let Putin further chip away at global peace.

### CON: U.S. guns to Kiev would just make matters worse

COLUMBUS, Ohio — President Barack Obama is right to reject the request of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for military aid that includes weapons. Poroshenko wants weaponry to fight Russian-backed separatist groups in his country.

Obama gave Poroshenko a feel-good moment during his visit to Washington by letting him speak to Congress and ask directly for weapons. He earned the applause of lawmakers. But in a meeting just after, Obama turned Poroshenko down. Obama will come up with military aid for Ukraine that doesn't include weapons.

A cease-fire is in place — more or less — in Ukraine between its government and the separatists, who control the major eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. If the cease-fire holds, the warfare that has wrecked some areas in eastern Ukraine will not continue. Giving Ukraine weapons would risk making the situation there worse at a time when matters seem to be getting resolved.

## A Way Out Of The Conflict

Poroshenko has just made an important compromise, passing a law to give the separatists some autonomy, or independence, to rule the areas they control. That law, along with the cease-fire, has set a path to a way out of the deadly conflict.

Obama's rejection of sending weapons to Ukraine does not satisfy everyone in Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has called for weapons for Ukraine's government. But what the United States should now do is to help the cease-fire hold and make sure the new autonomy law goes into effect.

That law is a good first step. It gives the population in eastern Ukraine more control over local affairs. It will allow for keeping the closer ties that that area has historically had with Russia.

In the public discussion over a proper U.S. approach toward the situation, the focus has been on differences between the US and Russia. It's easy to see anything that looks like a gain for Russia as a loss on our side.

The focus needs to be on what is best for Ukraine.

## Working Out A Relationship

Finding the right balance will not be easy. The new law on autonomy leaves unclear exactly which parts of eastern Ukraine are involved, and just what autonomy will mean.

One uncertain factor is the desire of the population in eastern Ukraine. One group of the easterners want nothing to do with Ukraine's government in the capital of Kiev. It is that opinion that fuels the separatists. But a second group in that part of Ukraine is comfortable with being ruled from Kiev. And perhaps a third group just wants calm.

One key element in the new autonomy law is an assurance that the Russian language can be used publicly in eastern Ukraine, such as in schools, courts and local government. That is a good step.

Just what kind of relationship eastern Ukraine will have with Russia remains to be worked out. A takeover by Russia — as happened earlier in the year in Crimea — won't happen in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government and the separatists have to work out a solution that accommodates everyone.

The United States should promote that process. There is every reason to believe that an acceptable arrangement can be achieved that will end the bloodshed in Ukraine.
