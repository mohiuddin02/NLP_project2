### PRO: A trio of culprits at heart of Obama administration's ineffective response

ARLINGTON, Va. — As the Ebola epidemic deepens in West Africa and has put U.S. citizens on alert, critics are increasingly questioning the Obama administration's response to the crisis. So far it has been ineffective.

U.S. health officials have blamed the unfolding tragedy on not receiving enough money from lawmakers in Washington to fight the disease. That was bad enough.

The appointment of someone with flimsy medical qualifications as Ebola czar confirmed that the White House response is more political than responsible. It's just looking for a quick political fix, to seem like it has things under control.

In an hour of need, our various national and international public health administrators dropped the ball with deadly consequences. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) have all failed at their roles.

That's due to the way government health agencies generally spread around public resources. Several different health agencies receive money from the federal government and each are tasked with fighting the epidemic on the front line. But they've done a poor job coordinating their efforts.

## CDC Focuses On Political Concerns

Take the CDC. Its mission is to "develop and apply disease prevention and control." Yet that takes a backseat to more political concerns like fighting obesity and gun violence.

From 2004 to 2014, CDC spending grew by almost 30 percent, from $8.3 billion to $10.7 billion a year.

Yet the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, whose job it is to prevent diseases like Ebola, received only roughly $400 million a year, a tiny sliver of total CDC funding.

Funding for the CDC's climate change and chronic disease programs, which aim to prevent smoking, alcohol consumption and poor diets, receive roughly $1.6 billion each year.

While these are real problems, they take resources and focus away from the CDC's original mission and away from responding to disease outbreaks.

## NIH Spends Money On Wrong Projects

The same is true at the NIH. Its director made inaccurate public statements blaming budget cuts for the its lack of preparedness, yet it has plenty of money.

Recent NIH funding levels are actually higher than historically. In 2000, its total budget was $24.1 billion. By 2014, that grew by roughly 25 percent to $29.7 billion.

Much of NIH's budget goes to projects that have nothing to do with researching vaccines for emerging diseases like Ebola. Instead, its money goes to projects like studying the behavioral attributes of feces-flinging chimpanzees or designing condoms.

But funding for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH department that actually researches infectious diseases, has not gone up. It has remained at roughly $4.5 billion a year since 2003.

These are only symptoms of a deeper problem. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office reported that NIH's broad range of activities, large staff and consecutive funding increases make "inefficiencies and duplicative or wasteful efforts" likely.

## WHO Didn't See "Writing On The Wall"

Then there's the WHO. In July, its director ignored a plea for more support from Doctors Without Borders, the group doing much of the work fighting Ebola in West Africa.

The Associated Press recently obtained a leaked private WHO document admitting that "nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall."

The problem? WHO acknowledges its African office directors were appointed for political reasons, not because of their job qualifications.

The co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, Dr. Peter Piot, agreed, noting that "the regional office in Africa didn't do anything." That office, he said, "is really not competent."

Poor government planning and unaccountability are wasteful and inefficient in the best of times, but the worsening Ebola crisis shows that they can be downright deadly in the worst of times. It's time our public health officials learned from these mistakes.

### CON: The CDC is doing a good job, but can't go it alone

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Ebola is a recent phenomenon for most people. Their thinking might also be that the Ebola horse has left the barn and our government, specifically the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is not riding it.

For others who have watched Ebola emerge, however, we see the involvement of the CDC, even without support from our lawmakers who haven't committed enough money to fight the disease.

The story of Ebola is truly one of a worldwide lack of public health infrastructure — health care workers, hospitals and equipment. There is also a lack of trust in working with African nations just emerging from war, and an exhausted health care workforce. There is also widespread wariness and avoidance of our duty as a global community to fight disease wherever it might be.

When CDC Director Tom Frieden said our effort to beat Ebola lies in our ability to stop the epidemic in West Africa, he was not suggesting that we let others handle it.

## Public Health Is Everyone's Concern

Is the CDC doing a good job responding to Ebola? Yes, and they'll need our help. A short explanation about public health is in order.

First, public health is our responsibility to assure the health of populations. CDC is our primary public health agency and, as such, it is our best weapon against international epidemics. However, it is not the U.S. agency in charge of our interaction with other countries.

Fact: Most of the public health presence around the world is nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), like Doctors Without Borders, which survive on donations from foundations and nations.

CDC is an easy target for our frustrations or fears about Ebola because it is likely the only U.S. public health agency we know about. We are generally clueless to the many positive public health outcomes of its work such as clean water, air, safe workplaces, a trained health workforce and response to outbreaks.

We fail to notice that school-based measles and whooping cough outbreaks are quickly handled, thanks to local public health departments; or the progress made in reducing infections patients catch in hospitals.

## The CDC's Quick Response In U.S.

We become aware of public health when something "goes wrong," and then blame the government even when we shirked our duty as a public health community.

Our ignorance was made clear by the mounting fear witnessed since Thomas Eric Duncan became known to us as the first Ebola patient in the U.S.

The CDC responded quickly, providing such resources as epidemic intelligence officers and public health advisers to find everyone who he came in direct contact with. It also provided hospital infection control procedures, detailed Ebola screening checklists, laboratory precautions, quarantine rules and is now managing the airport screening processes.

As Ebola was emerging in West Africa, CDC epidemiologists, doctors specialized in epidemics, were soon on the ground there investigating. CDC could increase important human resources for West Africa: hundreds of epidemiologists, health educators and public health advisers could be sent.

If we recognize anything about CDC's Ebola work, it is likely only that of crisis response. We do not see the longer term investment in sustainable public health infrastructure because we have not made this a national or international priority and committed the money to it.

## Our Complaints, Demands And Disinterest

Has the CDC done a good job responding to the Ebola outbreak? Absolutely, and they are not done yet.

Have we? No. Our complaints, demands to close our borders, paired with our almost complete disinterest to the challenge our friends in West Africa face, will likely be the barrier to success with Ebola or other emerging world health issues.

To be fully successful in our fight against Ebola, Americans must call upon their government to invest in sustained public health infrastructure here and in West Africa.

They must expect our U.S. hospitals to systematically train, prepare and supply the front-line health workers to recognize Ebola, protect themselves and control the spread. And they must support the nongovernmental organizations that are doing the work on the ground.

This is more than an emergency response, but a move toward public health infrastructure here and abroad. CDC is doing a good job, but they are not alone in this, and all Americans must engage fully as members of our global community.
