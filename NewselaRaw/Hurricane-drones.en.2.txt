ORLANDO, Fla. — A bunch of Coyotes will be let loose in hurricanes this year. Their mission will be to improve hurricane forecasts.

The small pilotless aircraft, or [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), were developed after Hurricane Sandy. They will be tested for the first time this hurricane season, which runs from June to November in the Atlantic Ocean.

Coyotes will be launched into the eye of tropical storm systems, where they will be used to detect changes in air pressure.

What they find should help the National Hurricane Center get a better handle on future hurricanes. Most importantly, Coyotes will provide information about how strong a storm could become.

"It's an innovative way to measure the atmosphere," said Jason Dunion, a hurricane researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

## Information Gatherers Like No Other

The Coyotes weigh about 7 pounds and have a 5-foot wingspan. They'll be dropped out of chutes in NOAA's WP-3 hurricane hunter aircraft while 10,000 to 12,000 feet above the ocean.

The drone's spring-loaded wings will lock into place and its small electric motor will spin up, allowing it to fly at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Then the little plane will do what no other aircraft can: spend up to two hours spiraling around the core of a hurricane. It will send forecasters detailed information about a hurricane's inner workings.

"You're getting a longer snapshot of how pressure changes within the eye" of a storm, Dunion said.

Coyotes also will be flown into a hurricane's most destructive part, the eye wall. A ring of clouds surrounding the eye, the eye wall is the area of the hurricane with the heaviest rain and strongest winds. The goal is to find the strongest winds there. That, too, should help the hurricane center improve its predictions about just how powerful a hurricane will become.

Additionally, forecasters hope the Coyote will help them better predict when a hurricane might rapidly strengthen. That kind of rapid increase can be devastating if the hurricane is near land.

## Sending Them Off To Dangerous Duty

Manufactured by Sensintel of Tucson, Arizona, the Coyotes cost about $70,000 apiece. Yet two or three of them might be sent into a single storm with little hope of seeing them again.

Dunion said the benefits will be worth it. He said the small plane can fly right above the ocean surface in a storm's eye, which is far too dangerous for any aircraft with people aboard.

In the process, the Coyote will help scientists better understand how a tropical system feeds on the heat of the ocean's surface.

The temperature "of the ocean near a storm's eye is not something we sample very often," Dunion said. "It's hard to sample."

To get an early look at storms that could hit the U.S. coastline, NOAA this summer plans to station Coyote-carrying WP-3s in St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

## It Takes A Team Of Aircraft

Along with several other planes, the Coyotes will become part of a coordinated attack on a hurricane.

Among the other planes:

—Air Force Reserve hurricane hunters will feed storm information directly to the hurricane center. At the same time, WP-3s will provide atmospheric information and conduct research missions. A Gulfstream IV high-altitude jet will investigate the upper fringes of storms.

—Two Global Hawks will monitor hurricane systems from their earliest beginnings until they make landfall. These large jet-powered drones can remain aloft more than 30 hours. In addition, a WB-57 will be used to study the upper reaches of a storm.

—NOAA also plans to send drones to capture ocean temperatures. Such information will help determine how much heat is available to feed storms.

Combined, the vehicles should provide a top-to-bottom view of a hurricane, said Erica Rule, a NOAA spokeswoman. They will make possible "a complete picture of what's happening."

Before the Coyote, a small drone called an aerosonde was flown into Hurricane Ophelia while it threatened North Carolina in 2005. That aircraft, however, had to launch from land, then fly out to the storm.

By contrast, Coyotes will be launched from a hurricane hunter plane already in a storm. This will enable them to remain aloft longer and collect more information.

"This is just over-the-top technology," Rule said.
