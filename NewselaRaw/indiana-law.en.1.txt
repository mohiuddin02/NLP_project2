INDIANAPOLIS â€” Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Tuesday that he wants a law on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that a new state law does not allow discrimination against gays and lesbians.

Pence defended the religious-freedom law as a vehicle to protect religious liberty. Still, he said, he has been meeting with lawmakers "around the clock" to address concerns that it would allow businesses to deny services to gay customers.

The Republican governor said he does not believe "for a minute" that lawmakers intended "to create a license to discriminate."

"It certainly wasn't my intent," said Pence, who signed the law last week.

But, he said, he "can appreciate that that's become the perception, not just here in Indiana but all across the country. We need to confront that."

## Who Does The Law Protect?

The law prohibits the state from making new laws that "substantially burden" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. The definition of "person" includes religious institutions, businesses and associations.

Although the legal language does not specifically mention gays and lesbians, critics say the law is designed to protect businesses and individuals who do not want to serve gays and lesbians. For example, there are people such as florists or caterers who might be hired for a same-sex wedding. Some of them might be opposed to gay marriage.

Businesses and organizations including Apple and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) have voiced concern over the effect of the law. Some states also have barred government-funded travel to Indiana.

Also Tuesday, the Indianapolis Star urged Indiana lawmakers to respond to widespread criticism of the law by protecting the rights of gays and lesbians.

The Star printed an opinion article by the newspaper's staff. It was headlined "FIX THIS NOW." The words covered the newspaper's entire front page. It called for lawmakers to enact a law that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of whether or not a person is attracted to someone of the same gender.

The newspaper says the uproar sparked by the law has "done enormous harm" to the state. It could also potentially hurt the state's economic future. If more companies refuse to do business with Indiana, the state will see less money.

## Arkansas Mulls Similar Law

Meanwhile, Arkansas was poised to follow Indiana in enacting a similar law despite increasing criticism from businesses and gay-rights advocates.

The Arkansas House could vote as early as Tuesday on a proposal that would prohibit state and local governments from infringing on a person's religious beliefs without a "compelling" reason. Arkansas lawmakers also said they won't change their own law.

"There's not really any place to make any changes now," Republican Representative Bob Ballinger of Hindsville, Arkansas, said about his proposal. "If there are questions in two years, we can fix it."

Hundreds of protesters filled the Arkansas Capitol to oppose the measure, holding signs that read "Discrimination is not a Christian Value" and "Discrimination is a Disease." They chanted "Shame on you" at Ballinger after the measure was supported by a House committee.

"I believe that many people will want to flee the state, and many people will want to avoid our state," said Rita Jernigan. She is a protester and one of the main people challenging Arkansas' gay marriage ban in a federal lawsuit.

Similar proposals have been introduced in more than a dozen states, patterned after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. Nineteen other states have similar laws on the books.

## Will The Law Hurt Arkansas?

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who had expressed reservations about unintended consequences of an earlier version of the bill, has said he will sign the current measure into law.

"If this bill reaches my desk in similar form as to what has been passed in 20 other states, then I will sign it," Hutchinson said. The Republican governor added that he was "pleased that the Legislature is continuing to look at ways to assure balance and fairness in the legislation." .

Mark Stodola, the mayor of Little Rock, urged Hutchinson to veto the proposal, which he said would hurt the state's economic-development efforts. Stodola said the proposal "sends the message that some members of our community will have fewer protections than others."

The bill's opponents hoped to target Hutchinson's promise to be a "jobs governor" made during his successful bid last year for the state's top office. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group, has run ads in Silicon Valley aimed at the same technology firms Hutchinson has said he wants to lure to Arkansas.

Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in The Washington Post over the weekend opposing the Arkansas and Indiana measures. Meanwhile, retail giant Wal-Mart has said the proposal sends the wrong message about its home state. Little Rock-based data services company Acxiom also urged Hutchinson to veto the bill, saying the measure would enable discrimination and open the state up to ridicule.

"This bill is at direct odds with your position that 'Arkansas is open for business,'" CEO Scott Howe and Executive Vice President Jerry C. Jones said.

In Indiana, the reaction has included a public-employee union canceling a planned women's conference in Indianapolis this year and the band Wilco canceling a May performance.
