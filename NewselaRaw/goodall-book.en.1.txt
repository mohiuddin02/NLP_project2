Much of what we know about how chimpanzees behave is because of one person: Jane Goodall.

Goodall spent more than 40 years in the East African country of Tanzania studying chimpanzees. A new children's book, "Untamed: The Wild Life of Jane Goodall," is filled with amazing photos and stories of Jane's life and her important scientific discoveries.

Several other children's books have been published about Goodall because of her work in primatology, which is the study of animals like apes and monkeys. Yet "Untamed" is a little bit different. Anita Silvey, who is the author of "Untamed," wanted to write the book because she thought it was important to cover the 81-year-old scientist's career up through the present, not just her work on primatology. "Her entire life fascinated me," Silvey says.

## Goodall's Early Passions

"Untamed" begins with Goodall's childhood in London, England. Silvey writes that Jane was an eager observer of her many pets and of other local animals. She loved being in nature and reading books like "The Story of Doctor Dolittle," which is a fictional story about a veterinarian who travels to parts of Africa and learns to speak to animals.

Like Doctor Dolittle, Goodall would later become famous for her connections with animals in Africa.

Aside from being an author, Silvey is also an expert in children's books, and says: "A lot of reading for children is about thinking." She goes on to say that children often ask questions like, "Can this story be a map for my life? Is there something I can learn here that is actually a way for my life to go?" Perhaps these are the same questions Goodall had when reading her childhood stories.

## Entering Africa

When she was in her early 20s, Goodall received an invitation from a school friend to visit Africa. She became obsessed with the idea and worked hard to earn enough money to get there.

Once she was in Africa, Goodall quickly got herself a job with Louis Leakey. He was a famous scientist whose work was important for tracking the development of early humans in Africa. Leakey helped Goodall study chimpanzees in the wild.

The Gombe Stream Game Reserve is now a national park in Tanzania. There, Goodall changed the field of scientific research on animals forever. Silvey writes that Goodall "focused on chimpanzees as individuals, with distinct personalities." At the time, the larger scientific community recorded animals with numbers. Goodall, however, insisted that every individual chimpanzee mattered and each one was special. She removed the numbers and named the chimps, giving them names like Fifi and David Greybeard.

Silvey's book contains many wonderful images, including four pages of a chimpanzee "family scrapbook." The scrapbook lets the reader see the distinct personalities of these chimpanzees that Goodall described and illustrates the trusting relationships that she formed with many of the chimps she studied.

## The Road to Change

Silvey makes it clear that Goodall also faced many difficulties, "It wasn't easy for her, but she is somebody who always overcomes the next obstacle. Whatever the problem, she finds a solution."

"It's not that everyone can have Jane Goodall's story," Silvey says. "But her story lets kids know that if you love something, if you really want something, you can change the world." Goodall took her childhood love for animals and made it into a career. Silvey wants children to understand that if they follow their dreams, they also may be able to change the world for the better.

Goodall is now traveling the world and working to improve the treatment of chimpanzees and other great apes. Throughout "Untamed," Silvey offers ideas for helping endangered animals and addressing animal treatment problems. Her book gives easy ways for kids to get involved, as well as a few larger, more significant ways.

As Goodall writes in the introduction to Silvey's book, "You make a difference every single day. And you get to choose what sort of difference you want to make."
