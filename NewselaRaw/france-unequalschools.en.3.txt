PARIS — France's school system is unequal. Rich students do far better than poor students, a study found.

To fix this, France announced a new plan to give all children a better education.

The lack of fairness threatens the country's future, the French government says.

The changes will start in 2016. The are not big ones. In France, students take Latin and ancient Greek. These languages have not been spoken in thousands of years. The government will lessen the amount of time students learn them and spend more time on languages spoken in the modern world.

## Language Instruction Will Start Sooner

The plan also calls for cutting a program in which students are taught in two languages. Only the best students can be in the program. In exchange, more children will begin learning another language at a younger age.

Students will start learning another language — usually English — in about first grade. They will begin their second foreign language around age 12. The government also wants to add classes that cover several subjects at once.

Schools will also get to decide how students spend one-fifth of their school day. Right now the government decides.

## Some Things Will Stay Much The Same

The plan is not popular with everyone. Some groups do not want the schools to change. On Tuesday, teachers across France went on strike. They did not go to work and marched in the streets to protest the changes. In the United States, there are similar debates about why students from poorer families do not do as well as students from richer families.

French teachers unions complain the plan does not deal with the real problem. Unions are groups that help support the teachers. The unions say that the people who made the plan did not ask teachers about it. Other groups do not want France's traditional system of education to change. They think the schools will grow worse.

Some things will stay the same. French students will still only spend around 26 hours in school per week.

## Critic Says Plan Is Weak

Peter Gumbel is a British reporter who lives in Paris. He is about to publish a second book about French schools. He said the plan is a weak way to deal with an urgent problem.

He said the government cannot make extreme changes. It knows that if the changes are too extreme, the entire country will be angry. As it is, the French government is pushing the limits of what people feel comfortable with, he said.

France's government is trying to fix the education system quickly. A study done in 2012 showed large differences between rich and poor children, especially in math. Thirty-nine countries were included in the study, but only Taipei in Asia showed a bigger difference in math between rich and poor students. Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, is not as well-developed as France. There are mostly rich and poor people but not a lot of middle-income people.

"How can we accept that our educational system can't promote all talents, that so many middle schoolers do not master basics, do not master foreign languages?" Prime Minister Manuel Valls wrote in a French newspaper.

In the modern world, this is a big problem for France and its children, he said.

## Changes Won't Help Problems In French Schools

France's last big education change added a half-day to the school week in elementary schools. Normally, students in France only had four days of school. When they made it four and a half days, French people protested for a year.

Najat Vallaud-Belkacem is in charge of education in France. He said the critics are full of lies and nonsense.

Gumbel said the changes will do little to deal with the basic problems in French education.

The plan makes school more interesting, more about the real world and more fun, he said. The people against the plan "want you to be cramming things that are useless for your life."

People think that French students are rewarded for working hard and great things are learned, Gumbel said. The reality is that one out of five kids are not learning anything at all, he said.
