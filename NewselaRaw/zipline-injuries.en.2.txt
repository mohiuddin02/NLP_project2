CHICAGO, Ill. â€” As zip-lining has become more popular, injuries from the activity have soared.

A new study looked at zip line-related injuries in U.S. emergency rooms. It found that over 16 years, nearly 17,000 people were treated for injuries including broken bones, cuts and sprains.

Most of these injuries occurred in the last four years of the study, which took place between 1997 and 2012 and was the first time researchers looked at zip line injuries. Researchers concluded that the activity needs to be better regulated. They also said there should be safety standards that everyone follows.

The study was conducted at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. It was published Monday in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine. Deaths were not included in the study. However, there have been at least six deaths nationwide this year, most from falls.

## Study Used National Figures On Injuries To Reach Findings

To come up with their findings, researchers studied national figures on injuries. The figures were provided by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an agency that studies product safety. The study covers the early years of commercial zip lines. There are now more than 200 of these nationwide. There are thousands more "amateur" zip lines, located in backyards, summer camps and schools.

Most injuries occurred at commercial courses, camps and other public places. About one-third were from zip lines in backyards or farms. These are sometimes do-it-yourself kits bought online, may be improperly installed and should be avoided, the researchers said.

The yearly injury rate for all zip lines climbed between 2009 and 2012. In 2009, it was about 8 per 1 million people. In 2012, it was about 12 per 1 million people. Causes included falls, zip-liners colliding with things and slamming into objects at the end of the course. Injuries were most common in children and teens.

## Hospitalizations More Frequent Than Other Sports, Researcher Says

Nearly 1 out of 8 injuries resulted in hospital stays. Researcher Tracy Mehan said that is a worrisome rate much higher than more traditional sports.

Groups that promote zip-lining have adopted voluntary safety standards. These typically involve equipment, making sure everything is safe and up-to-date and training workers. But these standards differ from group to group and are not always followed.

Insurance companies generally require operators to follow some of these standards, and several states have adopted safety regulations. But Mehan said the same set of safety standards is needed for everyone. She also said the zip line industry needs better supervision.

## Zip Line Groups Say Sport Is Safer Than Driving

People who work in the zip line industry say the study causes too much alarm. They say zip lines are safer than driving a car.

Mike Barker is vice president of the Professional Ropes Course Association. He said his group has strict safety standards that recommend courses be regularly inspected. He said reasons for injuries and deaths include mistakes by zipliners or operators, or when equipment does not work.

James Borishade leads the Association for Challenge Course Technology. He said no activity is risk-free and that zip line operators "are working to minimize that risk."

## Follow Safety Tips To Keep It Fun, Lower Risk

There are some safety tips that can minimize the risk.

Participants should check out the Better Business Bureau, a group that helps people find businesses they can trust. Zip-liners should look at online reviews to find an operator with a good reputation. Additionally, they should ask operators if they follow any industry safety standards and avoid those that do not. Participants should see inspection or maintenance reports, and inquire about staff training.

Zip line riders should always wear safety equipment provided including body harnesses, helmets and gloves. Don't readjust the harnesses after guides have secured them. Participants should listen closely and follow guides' instructions.
