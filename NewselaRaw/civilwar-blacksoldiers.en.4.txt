The Confederacy was a group of Southern states. They wanted to keep slaves and leave the Union. Their symbol was the Confederate flag. At the end of the war, the Confederacy lost.

## Black Union Soldiers In Georgia

The North was called the Union, and they wanted to end slavery. Their symbol was the American flag. At the end of the war, the Union won.

After the war ended, black Union soldiers were sent to Atlanta, Georgia. They were supposed to keep peace. These soldiers used to be slaves in the south. Now, they were soldiers in the United States Army.

"Ten Cent" Bill Yopp was born a slave. During the war he was a Confederate drummer. He shined boots and took care of his master, Captain Thomas McCall Yopp.

## One Black Confederate

After the war, "Ten Cent" stayed in the south and took care of his old master. When he died in 1933, "Ten Cent" was buried in a Confederate cemetery. He is the only African-American buried there.

Stone Mountain is a famous mountain in Georgia. A museum about blacks in the Civil War is being built in its park. People want to make sure it tells history the right way.

Some people say blacks fought for the Confederates. Some people think "Ten Cent" did too. Historians say they did not. Nobody has found reports about any blacks who fought for the South. Many black soldiers did fight for the North. 

## Slaves Or Soldiers?

Michael Thurmond is a historian. He said that slaves worked as cooks and made clothes for the Confederacy.

"But that didn't make them Confederate soldiers. It made them slaves serving their masters," said Thurmond. 

When the war started, nobody let black people fight. There were no black Union soldiers or black Confederate soldiers.

## Blacks Fought For The Union

General Robert E. Lee led the Confederate army. He wanted to let slaves fight in the South. The Confederate government voted against it.

In 1863, blacks were allowed to fight for the North. About 200,000 blacks decided to fight for the Union. In 1865, the Confederate government finally voted to let blacks fight. It was too late. The Confederates soon lost the war.

Thurmond said that war ended before black Confederate soldiers could fight. No records show black soldiers in the Confederacy.
