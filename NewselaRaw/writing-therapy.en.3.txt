As a child, Allison Adelle Hedge Coke had to deal with a mother who had a serious mental illness. Her mother could not think or behave normally. She could not care for her daughter, so Coke grew up in different foster homes. Coke also fought cancer and overcame a drug problem.

"I really didn't believe I would make it through childhood, but the act of writing brought me through," she says.

Coke is now 56 years old and an award-winning poet. She teaches writing as a way to make people feel better. Her students are cancer patients, young people, doctors, families and just about everyone else.

## Think Deeply And Heal

Writing can be a way of thinking deeply, Coke says. It is a way to understand both the good and bad things that happen to us.

Reading also helps us to heal, she says.

We learn through the experiences of the characters we read about in books, Coke says. We feel what they are feeling, and that's how we understand other people's lives. Stories also help us become less upset by our own troubles.

Frank McCourt wrote a book called "Angela's Ashes." He wrote about growing up poor in Ireland in the 1930s and 1940s. Reading books like that makes us feel a little less alone, a little less worried, she says.

Humans have told stories to feel better through the ages. For example, fairy tales teach lessons about right and wrong. Holy books tell stories that battle with valleys of sadness and mountains of hope. Now doctors and scientists who study the mind are looking into the health effects of reading and writing.

## Put Yourself In The Character's Place

Raymond Mar is a professor at York University in Toronto. He studied children and adults who have read stories their whole lives. He found that they were better at sharing and understanding other people's feelings.

Why? Because when people read stories, they imagine what it is like to be in these stories, Mar says.

We try to understand these characters by using our brain in the same way that helps us understand people in the real world. We start "walking in their shoes." We imagine ourselves as them. Then we are better able to treat others well, he says.

For adults, it doesn't matter what they read, Mar says. It only matters that they are reading. With children, however, it's important to discuss what they are reading. Discussing stories helps kids understand the story and share the characters feelings.

Reading stories can give children and adults a chance to talk about difficult things in our lives, Mar says. Some doctors see telling stories as a way to improve the health of our minds.

## "Writing Is Also Healing"

Writing and reading stories can help doctors and patients talk to each other. Together they can discover meaning in the diseases they fight.

Dr. John Harper is a heart doctor at a hospital in Dallas, Texas. He thinks telling stories and medicine go together. He runs a program that brings an author to speak and teach writing classes to hospital workers each year.

Harper says doctors who read stories understand and care about their patients more. They become more willing to listen to their patients' stories.

Harper reads poems to his patients to show them and their families that he cares about them. Some of his patients could die from their illness. The poems show them that he understands their experience.

Writing is also healing, Harper says. He teaches other doctors to write about their experiences. He teaches them that writing is a way to let go of their feelings.

If you have an experience and you sit down and write about it, you can pour that feeling out, Harper says. Then you can move on with your life, he says.

That is the same message Coke teaches her writing students.

Writing it down lets us understand our life better. We also learn to enjoy the fun parts more, she says.
