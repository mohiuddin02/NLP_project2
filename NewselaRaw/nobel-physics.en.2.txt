They were awarded for their theory on how the most basic building blocks of the universe acquired the mass they needed to eventually form the world we know today.

They came up with their theory in the 1960s. But it was not confirmed until last year when the so-called Higgs particle was discovered at CERN in Geneva, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. The particle is also known as the Higgs boson. Some call it the "God particle."

"I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research," the 84-year-old Higgs said in a statement released by the University of Edinburgh, where he was a professor before retiring. Blue-sky research is theoretical, without any immediate real-world uses.

The 80-year-old Englert said he could not have imagined getting a Nobel Prize when he stated the research 50 years ago.

## Two Sought To Solve A Riddle

"You don't work thinking to get the Nobel Prize, that's not how you work," Englert said. "(Still) we had the impression that we were doing something that was important, that would later on be used by other researchers."

Awarding just the men behind the theoretical discovery of the particle solved a tricky problem for the committee. It did not have to single out one of the thousands of scientists at CERN laboratory to share the award. The Nobel award can only be split by three people at most.

Academy member Ulf Danielsson noted that the prize document also honored the work done at CERN. He called the discovery "a milestone in the history of physics."

He said, "This is a giant discovery, it means the final building block in the so-called standard model for particle physics has been put in place." The standard model is the basic picture of how physics operates on Earth.

Englert and Higgs theorized about the existence of the particle in the 1960s to provide an answer to a riddle: Why matter has mass. They believed the tiny particle acts like molasses on snow — causing other basic building blocks of nature to stick together, slow down and form atoms.

Without it, particles would keep flying through the universe, never coming together.

## Slamming Trillions Of Protons Together

Scientists wanted to know how matter formed shortly after the Big Bang. They came up with an explanation that centers on the idea that there is an invisible field throughout the universe. Particles travel through the field. They are slowed down like a ball rolling through molasses. If this is the case, then it should be possible to detect a type of particle, dubbed the Higgs boson.

But decades would pass before scientists at CERN were able to confirm its existence in July 2012. To find it, they had to build a $10 billion collider in a 17-mile tunnel beneath the Swiss-French border.

Scientists used the collider to slam trillions of protons into each other. The protons collided and produced energies like those right after the Big Bang. Scientists examined information from the collisions to find proof that the Higgs boson existed.

Only about one collision per trillion will produce one of the Higgs bosons in the collider. Once something that seemed like the Higgs boson was found, it took CERN some time to decide that it actually was a Higgs boson.

Michael Turner, president an organization of physicists, said the Higgs particle captured the imagination of the public.

"If you're a physicist, you can't get in a taxi anywhere in the world without having the driver ask you about the Higgs particle," said Turner. He is also a scientist at the University of Chicago.

## Tackling Other Mysteries Of The Universe

Turner said the finding of the Higgs completed the standard model. But beyond that, he said, it represents the first in a class of particles that scientists think played a role in shaping the universe. That means it points the way to tackling other mysteries.

The announcement was widely expected. But it was delayed an hour, which is highly unusual. The academy decides the winners in a majority vote on the day of the announcement.

The academy's Staffan Normark said the academy had tried to reach Higgs on Tuesday but "all the numbers we tried he did not answer." He wouldn't say if that's why the announcement was delayed.

The physics prize was the second of this year's Nobel awards to be announced. On Monday, the Nobel Prize in medicine was given to three American scientists for discoveries about how important substances are moved around within cells.

The prizes were established by a rich Swedish businessman named Alfred Nobel. They will be handed out on Dec. 10 — the anniversary of his death in 1896. Each prize is worth $1.2 million.
