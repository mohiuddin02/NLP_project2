ST. LOUIS, Mo. â€” Fourth-grader Richie Tienter won his school's spelling bee.

Richie spelled the winning word "magician." He heard the applause when he won. He felt joy.

He couldn't see his mother in the crowd. He did not see that she and his teachers looked very happy.

Richie is blind.

Richie's mom is Ann Tienter. She said she sometimes forgets that her son is blind. The reason is he gets so much information from his other senses, she said.

## Love Of Learning

Richie's parents learned he was blind when he was 6 months old. His optic nerves are smaller than those of sighted people. The optic nerves are at the back of the eye. They send information from the eye to the brain.

Richie loves learning, and reading. His favorites are books about European royalty and World War II.

Ritchie's mom began reading to Richie when he was a baby. She continued to read to him after they found out that he was blind. Except then the books changed. She started using books with raised bumps for the letters. They were written in Braille. Blind people read Braille with their fingers.

Now Richie is 9. He goes to Westridge Elementary School near St. Louis. Teachers there say Richie reads like a high school student. He knows more words than his classmates, too.

Richie doesn't think a lot about the challenges of being blind. At the spelling bee, he thought of his disability in a different way. It helped keep him from being nervous about seeing so many people in the audience, he said.

## "A Regular Kid"

Just before the holiday break, Westridge students took home sheets with spelling words to study. Richie's list was in Braille. He studied during the days off from school. However, Richie would only study during the week. He also would not study on holidays.

Richie has been in other contests. Last summer, he won third place at the National Braille Challenge. Students from first grade through high school were there. They took part in contests in reading, spelling and other areas.

Richie's parents expect no less of him than they would of a sighted child, his mom said. "We wanted him to have a regular kid experience," she said.

Richie uses Braille to read materials at school.

Recently, Richie and his class were matching nouns with verbs. The other kids used papers and pencils. Richie read a Braille sheet with the words prepared ahead of time. He then typed out the answers using the six keys on a Braille notetaker.

To use the machine, Richie learned different codes for the letters of the alphabet. He also had to learn 180 contractions. Those are words that combine two other words, like "don't" from "do not."

## Next, A Bigger Contest

Richie will now move on to a bigger contest. He will be in the written semi-finals of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Spelling Bee. He will go up against other school winners from across the St. Louis area.

Then there is a spoken final contest. The winner there will represent the St. Louis area in the 2015 Scripps National Spelling Bee. A spokesman for Scripps said other kids who are blind have been in the national bee before. One was a girl from Oklahoma a few years ago. She made it to the third round.

Officials from the St. Louis regional spelling bee say children with disabilities can get some help. They are still figuring out what can be done for Richie on the written test. Someone might write his answers for him. He also might use his Braille machine to type them out.
