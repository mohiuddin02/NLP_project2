SANTA ANA, Calif. â€” Wayne Irving's daughter was 15 when she asked to get her driver's permit.

"I was already frustrated at how addicted to texting my daughter was," said the San Clemente, Calif., father of four. At the time, he had just learned a grim fact: More than 7,000 Americans had died from texting and driving the year before.

Irving decided he had to do something. In 2009 he began work on a smartphone app to help stop texting while behind the wheel. That app is called Text Kills. It has since grown into a nonprofit company.

The problem Text Kills is dedicated to fighting has only gotten worse since 2009. Texting while driving has become the No. 1 killer of U.S. teens. It now kills more teens than drinking and driving.
## Hitting The Road

Since 2010 Text Kills has traveled the Unites States in a yellow bus. It plans to visit more than 30 high schools before the end of the year. The goal is to reach teens who send or receive at least one text message while driving.

Text Kills also hopes to gather several thousand signatures from drivers who promise not to text while driving. NASCAR racers Kyle Busch and Joey Logano already have signed their names to the side of the Text Kills bus. So have more than 100,000 others.

When he and four others began working on the app, they were just a bunch of engineers and people who owned their own businesses, Irving said. Soon they were invited to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate the Text Kills app. Because they couldn't afford to fly, Irving and the others drove to Washington.

Along the way, they visited various colleges. At these schools they spoke to students about the dangers of texting behind the wheel. "We educated ourselves and hit the road," said Irving. The first stop was the University of Denver in Colorado; 1,200 students showed up.

"Many of them had their own stories about texting and driving," Irving said. "One freshman's parents bought her a brand-new Ford Mustang two weeks before college. She totaled it a week later. Another gal told us her cousin died three weeks earlier. He was texting, ran off the road and hit a tree."
## Distracted By Cellphones

In the three years since, he said, "We've heard thousands of stories from kids and parents who have lost loved ones."

According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 11 percent of teenage drivers killed in car crashes were distracted when the crash happened. Twenty-one percent were distracted by cellphones.

Earlier this month, Text Kills became even more serious about its mission. It began to raise money for a documentary film. Text Kills hopes to be able to offer the documentary to schools across the country.

"Our goal is to produce this thing and distribute it [widely]," Irving said of the film. The plan is to offer it to teachers around the country. The film is titled "Smartphones of Mass Destruction."

It's all part of the Text Kills plan to make students hear its message. The bus has already visited 3,000 schools. At the events, Text Kills uses simulators. These help students see what it's like to drive while distracted. 
## Running Off The Track

One simulator uses a 50-inch TV attached to the side of the Text Kills bus. Students can drive a car on the screen, just like in a video game.

"We make them drive in a race car situation around the track," said Text Kills member Ryan Foland. Then they're told to pick up a card that looks like a phone and read it out loud. "They read it, and their eyes aren't on the road. Everybody else is watching them ... [run] off the track and hit a wall, and their car is spinning around. It's a nice eye-opener."

Another simulator uses a remote-controlled toy car. Drivers try to keep it on a track while they are blindfolded for five seconds. This is about how long it takes to send a text. Every time, the car goes off the road and hits somebody's ankle, Foland said.

And when people see how easy it is crash because of distracted driving, they think, "Oh, I won't do that again," he added.
