WASHINGTON, D.C. — Before too long there may be a very odd thing on your dinner plate. It will look just like salmon, and it is. Yet this salmon is genetically modified. It is the first modified animal cleared by the U.S. government for people to eat.

Scientists changed the genes of this salmon. Genes are passed down by parents, and decide what someone looks like and how their body works. They make a person have wavy or straight hair, or blue or brown eyes. Plants, animals and people all have genes. With new genes, now the salmon can grow faster. 

Some people do not want the genetically modified fish to be sold in stores. They call it a "Frankenfish," after the Frankenstein monster. Yet on Thursday, the government decided that the new salmon is safe to eat. It could be in grocery stores in just a couple of years. The part of the government that made the decision is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.

The new fish is called AquAdvantage Salmon. It is just as healthy as other farm-raised Atlantic salmon, the FDA said.

## Many People Don't Trust Modified Food

The FDA waited five years to approve the salmon. It knew people were concerned about genetically modified food. The fish grows two times as fast as regular salmon. It reaches the size it needs to be when sold more quickly than regular salmon. 

A company named AquaBounty makes AquAdvantage. Ron Stotish is the head of AquaBounty. He said the new fish brings healthy food to people in a responsible way that does not damage the ocean.

It takes the new salmon about two years to grow. It should be in grocery stores in that time, AquaBounty said.

People who buy the new salmon in stores may not know they are eating it. The law does not force stores to tell people that the fish is engineered. AquaBounty says that genetically modified salmon looks and tastes the same as regular salmon.

AquaBounty does not have to write on the package that the fish has been modified.

## Some Stores Refuse To Sell The Salmon

Some stores have said they will not sell the modified fish at all. They include Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Target and Kroger.

People who do not like the new salmon have asked stores not to sell it. They worry the salmon could cause allergies. They also fear that if the salmon escapes into the wild, it could mix with natural salmon and wipe them out. 

"There's no place on our dinner plates for genetically engineered fish," Lisa Archer said. She works for a group called Friends of the Earth, which supports nature. She said that "most people don't want to eat this poorly studied, unlabeled, genetically engineered fish."

Lisa Murkowski is a lawmaker from Alaska. She has said the engineered salmon could harm fishermen who catch wild salmon in her state. She and other lawmakers from Alaska and the Pacific Northwest said they will push for a new law to add a label to the modified fish.

## Fish Can Keep Growing All Year

Scientists have added growth hormone to the salmon from the Pacific Chinook salmon, so it can grow all year long. Scientists found a way to keep the hormone working all year by using a gene from another fish. The gene acts like an "on" switch. Regular Atlantic salmon make the growth hormone for only part of the year.

The FDA said it examined the information that AquaBounty sent in. Then it decided the company's claims were true and the fish is safe. 

AquaBounty said it is hopeful that people who are against the fish will accept it in time as they learn more about it.

"We think time and education and information may allow many of these folks to change their mind," Stotish said.
