A head injury can happen in an instant. A student could trip and fall or hit their head while playing sports.

Getting hit in the head might simply hurt. Sometimes, it can cause brain damage. Scientists just did research on what happens when students get brain damage. They found that if students hurt their brains, they might have problems in school, even weeks after the accident.

## Teens Have The Most Trouble

The scientists studied students of different ages. The students with the most difficulty were teens. Out of all of the teens, almost 9 out of 10 of them had problems going back to school after a brain injury. They were tired and had headaches. It made learning very difficult.

Even after they get brain damage, students usually heal after three weeks. Sometimes, though, it can take longer to heal. Students who do not get better quickly often have trouble paying attention. They can struggle to do their homework. The longer their injuries last, the harder it is to go back to school.

## Schools Should Do More To Help

The scientists studied hundreds of students. All of the students' brain injuries happened within the past four weeks. More than half of the students still had headaches. Some were dizzy and in a bad mood. They also had trouble concentrating. Their heads hurt around bright lights.

Students taking difficult math classes seemed to have the most trouble. Students whose moods changed because of their accidents also had a very hard time.

Scientists want schools to do more to help students with brain injuries. They say that most schools do not understand what kind of help students with brain injuries need.

## Students Should Not Do As Much Schoolwork

The study recommends that doctors write out special plans for students with brain injuries. Students' families should give those plans to their schools. Each plan should tell the school exactly how they can help the injured student.

While they are getting better, students might only go to school for part of the day. They will probably need to take more breaks and do less homework. It might be a good idea for teachers to wait to give them tests until they heal.

Noise can also be a problem for students with brain injuries. Students might need to leave class before the bell rings. They might also want to eat lunch in a quiet place.
