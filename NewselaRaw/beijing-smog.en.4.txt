BEIJING, China — Pollution in Beijing was terrible this week. Some people wanted to get away. They did not want to be near the dirty air. The government issued a red alert. Schools closed, factories shut down and half of all cars were kept off the streets.    

A red alert means the pollution is bad. It also means the pollution is expected to last for three days. It was the first red alert in Beijing, the capital city of China.

The Chinese government has promised to clean up the pollution. Most of it comes from power plants that use coal. Factories and cars cause pollution too.  

## Nearby Cities Are Also Polluted

Many people in Beijing said they planned to escape the pollution. They needed to travel pretty far. Other cities nearby were even worse than Beijing.  

One mother who lives in Beijing decided to leave town. She and her 8-year-old daughter flew to Kunming. It is a city in southwestern China. It is cleaner than Beijing. The mother said her daughter gets nosebleeds from the pollution. She said she was very glad to be in Kunming.  

Not everyone wanted to get away. One man from Beijing said he liked the empty streets. He walked around taking pictures.

## China Says Solution Will Take Years

"I like this kind of haziness," he said. "It gives a blurry feeling and makes you feel like you're in a dream." 

The polluted air in China makes many people sick. Some people die sooner than they have to.  

Leaders in Beijing are trying to help get rid of the pollution. They are shutting down some factories. They are telling people to stop driving their cars every day.  

The government of China is also trying to fix the problem. It is trying to make factories work better. It also wants to find new kinds of power.

China says it will be many years before things get better.
