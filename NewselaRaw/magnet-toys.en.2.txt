<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/LIFE_MAGNET-INGESTION_2_TB.jpg" /> ORLANDO, Fla. — Last month, 14-year-old Christin Rivas was playing with a couple of small round magnets at her school.

She needed both hands to grab something, so she decided to hold the mini-magnets in her mouth. Someone made her laugh, and … gulp. Christin swallowed them.

Five days later, Christin was in the hospital having the magnets removed. Along with the magnets, surgeons took out a small section of her colon and her appendix. The colon is the last part of the digestive tract.

Christin used to be fascinated with magnets, the kind you can sculpt into shapes and use to perform magic tricks. Put a pen on a desk, hold a magnet underneath, and watch the pen move across the desktop. But Christen found out the hard way what doctors and product safety experts already know: the magnets can be dangerous if swallowed.

## Warning Labels Ignored

Labels warning "harmful if swallowed" are on many toys. But that has not stopped an increasing number of kids from putting the magnets in their mouths or noses. The magnets can get stuck in their bodies, where they may cause serious harm.

It's not just children age 5 and younger that get into trouble with magnets. Also at risk are tweens and teens, some of whom use magnets to mimic tongue, lip, cheek or nose piercings.

"Kids swallow a lot of objects," said Dr. Tejas Mehta, a doctor at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children who treated Rivas. "Magnets cause more damage than anything else."

Magnets will work so hard to find each other that their force can cause intestines to twist and become blocked. Eventually the magnets can make a hole in the intestines and can cause infection, Mehta said.

Four out of five kids who swallow more than one magnet will need surgery to remove them, said Mehta. He has heard of kids needing massive bowel resections. A bowel resection is a type of major surgery in which all or part of the large intestine is removed.

From 2002 to 2011, magnet-related emergency-room visits among Americans younger than 21 increased by five times. This is according to a study in the Annals of Emergency Medicine.

During those 10 years, 22,500 magnet injuries were reported. Usually the kids swallowed the magnets. But about one-fourth put the magnets up their nose, said Julie Brown. She is an emergency room doctor at the University of Washington in Seattle, and lead author of the study.

## Millions Of Magnets Out There

The problem shows no sign of slowing down, Brown said.

"There is something very tempting about" the magnets, she said. "You want to put it in your mouth. You want to try to separate the magnets with your teeth."

To toddlers, they look just like the little silver-ball sprinkles that decorate cupcakes, she said.

Buckyballs is a set of 216 magnets that people can put together to form sculptures and chain jewelry. Last year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission asked retailers and makers of Buckyballs and Zen Magnets, a similar toy, to stop selling them.

But you can still find them online, Brown said. She said that more than 3 million sets of the magnet sets have been sold. At 216 magnets per set, that's 600 million magnets out there just waiting to get swallowed or stuck in someone's nose.

Other products containing magnets are also a problem, she said. These products include metallic bulletin boards with little magnet pins. There also are refrigerator magnets that look like actual candies or coffee beans, and fishing games that have a magnet on a rod.

## "I Messed Up My Intestines"

Some emergency room doctors don't know how serious the magnet problem can be. When Barbara Rivas took her daughter to the emergency room, a doctor ordered an X-ray, then sent Christin and her mother home. The doctor told them the magnets would pass out of her digestive system naturally.

That advice didn't sound right to Rivas. So, she did some online research.

"That's when I hit the panic button," she said.

Christin was taken to Arnold Palmer Hospital, where doctors admitted her and tracked the magnets' path by X-ray.

Normally, food or foreign objects take six to eight hours to go from entry to exit, Mehta said. But the magnets Christin swallowed became stuck in her digestive tract for 24 hours. At that point, doctors decided to operate.

Anyone who has surgery on the small intestine runs a 10 percent chance of developing a bowel obstruction later in life, Brown said. A bowel obstruction occurs when either the small or large intestine becomes blocked. It can be life threatening.

"Don't even think about touching them or buying" magnets, Christin advised. "I messed up my intestines. I worry about that down the road."
