YOKOHAMA, Japan — Seven decades after the end of World War II, nine former prisoners of war returned to Japan this week. The American servicemen visited some of the places where they were held and recounted their memories.

The men, all in their 90s, opened their tour with a memorial service Monday for fallen soldiers at the Commonwealth War Graves in Yokohama.

As they marked the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, the emphasis was on forgiveness.

George Rogers, of Lynchburg, Virginia, said he did not hold a grudge against Japan. Now 96, he was taken captive by the Japanese and survived the infamous Bataan Death March in April 1942. The Japanese also forced him to work at the Yawata steel plant in southern Japan, or today's Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corp.

## At 96, "No Hard Feelings"

During his nearly 3 1/2 years of captivity, Rogers was given meager food rations and sometimes beaten up.

He said that he was lucky to survive, but that he harbored "no hard feelings" toward his captors.

"Just like we do what we're told to do as far as the Army is concerned, your (Japanese) men do the same thing. They tell them to do it, they do it," he said. "Other than that, I think we lived."

A month after Japan's Aug. 15, 1945, surrender, Rogers returned to the United States in skin-and-bones condition, weighing only 85 pounds (about 38 kilograms), despite being 6-foot-3. His doctor told him — he was 26 then — that he would most likely not live past 45 or 50, keep his teeth or have children.

Rogers, who still has his teeth, has five children, and one of them accompanied him on his trip to Japan.

## He Survived Bataan Death March

"They didn't give me any food, and I didn't get much water when I needed it, but other than that, it was a long trip, very far," he said.

Rogers had hoped to revisit the steel plant where he worked, though the trip did not materialize. However, the Yawata plant was chosen as a World Heritage site and preserved due to its historical significance.

During the Bataan march, thousands of prisoners were forced to walk more than 60 miles (97 kilometers), under severe, abusive conditions, and many died.

About 132,000 members of the Allied forces, which fought Japan, were held as prisoners across Asia during World War II, including more than 30,000 in Japan, historians say. Of the total, about 35,800, or nearly one-third, died in captivity. The prisoners died at a rate several times higher than prisoners held by Germany and Italy, which also fought against the Allies.

## Visits Aim For Forgiveness

At Monday's memorial service, the nine veterans, assisted by their family members and U.S. service members, laid flowers for their countrymen who died after being taken prisoner.

The veterans are visiting Japan at the invitation of the country's Foreign Ministry under a program for reconciliation and forgiveness that started five years ago. They are scheduled to visit some former prisoner-of-war (POW) camp sites in the cities of Osaka, Yokohama and Kamioka, central Japan.

Japan has similar programs with Australia and Britain. Many former POWs still have hard feelings because of harsh treatment by the Japanese.

## He Just Hopes For Peace

It took 94-year old Arthur Gruenberg, from Camano Island, Washington state, 70 years to come back. The former Marine surrendered at Corregidor, Philippines, in May 1942, and was eventually sent to work in a mine in Fukuoka, in southern Japan. By then he was blind in one eye due to vitamin A deficiency.

Gruenberg said he was simply impressed by Japan's postwar development and hoped it remains a peace-loving nation.

"Everything is just amazing, it's unbelievable," he said. "I can't say it (my feelings) has changed much; I just hope we don't have any more wars."
