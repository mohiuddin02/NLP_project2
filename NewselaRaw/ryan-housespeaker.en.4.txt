WASHINGTON, D.C. - The House of Representatives and the Senate make up Congress. They make laws for the United States.

Paul D. Ryan is a lawmaker in Washington, D.C. He won the top job in the House on Thursday.

Other lawmakers voted for him to be Speaker of the House. The speaker is the leader of the House of representatives.

## The House Is Broken, Ryan Says

Ryan said the House is not working right. He said it is broken and needs to be fixed.

Ryan belongs to the Republican Party. It is one political group in the United States. Ryan said there are big problems in the Republican Party. Different members of the group have different ideas about how the government should be run.

John A. Boehner used to be the speaker of the House. In September, he decided to quit Congress. He had too many arguments with conservative Republicans. Conservatives are more old-fashioned and traditional.

## Arguments Divide Instead Of Unite

Ryan said these arguments divide the Republicans. The arguments do not solve problems, he said. Instead, they make the problems much worse. Ryan wants to make changes in the Republican Party. He wants all Republicans to come together.

Ryan might help unite the Republicans.

Almost all the Republican representatives voted for Ryan. He got 236 votes Thursday. Only nine Republicans did not vote for him. They voted instead for Daniel Webster, a Republican lawmaker from Florida. He is much more conservative than Ryan.

## Republicans Lead The House Of Representatives

Right now the Republicans lead the House because they have the most representatives. They have more representatives because more Americans voted for them.

The Democrats are the other main party in the United States. They usually do not agree with Republicans. President Barack Obama is a Democrat. Democrats have their own leader in the House. Their leader just has less power.

Nearly all the Democrats voted for Nancy Pelosi of California. She is the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives.

## New Speaker Calls For Unity

After the vote, Ryan called for unity. He talked about unity among Republicans, and between Republicans and Democrats. Everyone needs to understand each other, he said.

Ryan said it is OK to disagree. He told the lawmakers he wants to hear everyone's ideas.

Ryan is 45 years old. He is the youngest speaker elected since 1869. Ryan's family was at the House to support him on Thursday. He has a wife and three children.

Kevin McCarthy is a Republican lawmaker from California. He said the future looks brighter with Ryan. He said the Republicans are more united. When they are united, he said, they can do big things.
