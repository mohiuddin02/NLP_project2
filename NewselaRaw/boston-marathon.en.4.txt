BOSTON â€” On Monday, nearly 36,000 runners hit the streets of Boston. The city's first marathon since last year's bombing sent a strong message: Boston is back.

The day provided a second chance for many. Runners who couldn't finish last year's race were back for a second try.

"I showed up, I'm back," said Mary Cunningham, 50. "I am going to finish what I didn't finish last year." Cunningham had been stopped a mile short of the finish line by the explosions.

Last year's bombing took place on April 15. The two homemade bombs went off near the end of the 26.2-mile course. They killed three people and wounded more than 260.

## Last Year's Tragedy

This year, police were spread out in large numbers along the route. Helicopters circled above. Bomb-sniffing dogs checked garbage cans.

A total of 35,755 runners signed up to run this year's marathon. Many came to show support for the city. The words "Boston Strong" were everywhere.

"I think I'm going to start crying at the starting line," said Katie O'Donnell, a doctor. "I'm not sure I'll stop until I cross the finish line."

There was a moment of silence at the finish line at 2:49 p.m., the time the bombs went off. It was followed by some of the loudest cheers of the day. People whooped, clapped and rang cowbells.

Joe Ebert was cheering on his son-in-law near the spot where the bombs went off. He was there last year, too.

"Just wanted to let them know that they can't beat us down. I think it makes us all stronger when something like that happens," he said.

Jeff Bauman was also among the onlookers near the finish line. Last year, Bauman lost his legs in the bombing. It was the first time he had returned to the area since the attack.

"It feels great" to be back, he said. "I feel very safe."

## More Police And Cameras

Sabrina Dello Russo, 38, was running her first marathon for a good friend. That friend, Roseann Sdoia, lost her right leg in the bombing.

"Every run I do, she is in the back of my head," Dello Russo said. "She will be keeping me going today."

To make sure nothing happened this year, police carefully checked all backpacks. More than 100 cameras were installed along the course.

Runner Scott Weisberg, 44, said he had trouble sleeping the night before.

"With everything that happened last year, I can't stop worrying," Weisberg said.

In the end, though, everything turned out just fine.

## And The Winners Are ...

Rita Jeptoo of Kenya won the women's race. She completed the course in a record 2 hours, 18 minutes, 57 seconds.

Jeptoo won last year as well. However, she was unable to enjoy that victory.

"It was very difficult to be happy. People were injured and children died," she said before this year's race. "If I'm going to win again, I hope I can be happier and to show people, like I was supposed to last year."

American Meb Keflizighi won the men's title. He finished the course in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 37 seconds.

Cheers rose up as word of Keflizighi's victory spread: An American man had won for the first time since 1983.

Keflizighi had the names of last year's victims written on his race bib. For many, his victory was the perfect ending.

President Barack Obama praised Keflizighi on Twitter. He also singled out Shalane Flanagan, the top American finisher among the women. He congratulated the two "for making America proud!"

"All of today's runners showed the world the meaning of #BostonStrong," Obama wrote.
