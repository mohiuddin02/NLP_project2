The unmanned spacecraft New Horizons has just completed its most difficult job. It had to pass over Pluto as close as it could without being damaged. Its job was to take pictures to send back to Earth. The spacecraft was controlled by scientists in Maryland. They work with NASA, the U.S. space agency.

Pluto is the most distant object ever visited in space. Scientists used to say it was the ninth planet from the sun. But now they call it a dwarf planet because it is smaller than the other planets.

## Mysterious Pluto

The spacecraft almost did not go to Pluto at all. Sending a spacecraft into space is very expensive. At first NASA could not find enough money to make it happen. However, many people asked NASA to launch the Pluto trip. Eventually, NASA found the money.

Scientists have always been interested in Pluto. For a long time, they did not know very much about it. Then in the 1990s scientists learned some new information. The Hubble Space Telescope showed light and dark areas on the planet. Still, that is all they knew. New Horizons tells a much more detailed story about Pluto.

Scientists have been studying the last picture the spacecraft sent back to Earth. It is more detailed than anything they have seen before. It shows one side of Pluto that faces away from its main moon, Charon. On the surface of Pluto there appears to be a heart-shaped area. The scientists believe it may be icy. The two sides of the heart are different colors. It could mean Pluto is made up of different kinds of chemicals.

## More Pictures On The Way

New Horizons is not finished sending back pictures. It will send more detailed pictures in the coming weeks. It will even send pictures of some of Pluto's moons.

Scientists have made other discoveries too. Pictures from New Horizons show that the planet is bigger than they thought.

The spacecraft also proved there are five moons around Pluto. These moons are called Charon, Hydra, Nix, Styx and Kerberos.

## Pictures Surprise Scientists

Pictures sent back to Earth show the differences between the surface of Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. "Now we see how dramatically different they really are," said scientist Alan Stern. He says the pictures show "a much younger surface on Pluto and an older, more battered surface on Charon." Pluto appears to have craters that have been filled in. Now they are smooth areas.

It is now clear that Pluto is quite different from Neptune's moon Triton. For a long time scientists thought they might look alike. "It's unbelievable how alien this place is," Stern said of Pluto. For example, it is much redder than Triton. Pluto's surface looks more like the planet Mars.

## Flying Away From The Sun

This is only the beginning of New Horizon's trip to space. It will also study the other, darker side of Pluto. Then it will search for planetary rings lit from behind by the sun. In September the spacecraft will send all its information on Pluto back to radio telescopes on Earth.

New Horizons has enough power to keep taking pictures of space for about another 20 years. By then it will be about twice as far from the sun as it is now.
