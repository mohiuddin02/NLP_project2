Dairy farmer Ron Koetsier's 1,200 cows drop 90 tons of manure every day. That's more than 65 million pounds of poop per year. For the past three decades, he has tried to turn the stinky dung into power. He wants to run his 450-acre farm in California on that power. But so far, he's failed.

He put in a power system in 1985. It cost $1 million. That system used the methane from manure to make electricity for his farm. Methane is the gas that is released from the dung. In 2002, he replaced that system with newer technology.

But he hit a snag. The government made new rules to cut down on air pollution. Koetsier would have to make costly fixes to his system in order to follow the rules. He decided to shut down the system in 2009.

However, in a few weeks Koetsier will give the dung plan another try.  A new company will replace his current system. His new system should meet strict air rules in the highly polluted area he lives in.

## Change Is In The Wind

A decade or so ago, dozens of California dairy farmers built methane digesters. The digesters turn manure into power. But the systems caused pollution. The government said they were breaking some laws. Most farmers gave up on the digester systems. Only a handful are still in use.

All that could be changing. Energy companies have figured out new ways of running digesters to make more money. They're using better technology. Now the digesters run cleaner and follow the tough clean air laws.

Koetsier will be the first dairy farmer to install a digester under a new state program. He hopes that this time it will finally work. After hearing of the new changes, he decided to "give it another whirl," Koetsier said.

Greenhouse gases like methane are harmful to the planet. Cow dung isn't the only thing that releases greenhouses gases. So does burning coal for electricity. California wants to cut down on greenhouse gases. And that is causing power companies to look for new power sources.

Unlike coal, there's a never-ending supply of manure. Experts say digesters could work for California. It's the top dairy-producing state with 1.8 million cows. As long as they keep eating, those cows will produce manure all day long.

## Plenty Of Poop To Work With

"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure," said John Blue. He's with the California Environmental Protection Agency. Digesters help the environment in other ways.

California has a goal to get its power from sources that don't hurt the environment. "We'd like to see dairy digesters as part of the mix," Blue said.

One California environmental power company is CH4 Power Inc. It plans to build more than 40 digesters over the next year. It will start building its first digester on Koetsier's dairy farm in a few weeks. Other companies will likely follow.

It may be hard to get dairy farmers to give digesters another try though. Especially after some tough years in the dairy business.

Dairy farmers have plenty of manure lying around to change into energy. A typical cow can produce as much as 150 pounds of dung daily. The farmers have to get rid of all that waste. They also must control the methane.

## Running Afoul Of Smog Rules

Digesters seemed like the perfect solution only a few years ago. Manure is fed into a digester. The digester removes methane from decomposing material. It burns it to produce energy.

But many farmers got in trouble with environmental rules. Their generators put out a gas that caused smog, a kind of air pollution.

The newest digesters have better technology. The new technology makes them better for the environment, experts said.

With those advances, officials are trying to start new projects quickly.

## Making Milk, Not Power

Ray Brewer is president of CH4 Power. He asked Koetsier to try digesters again. He promised a less risky way of doing business. Koetsier won't have to run the digester. Instead, CH4 will rent the land where the system will be built. CH4 will buy Koetsier's manure. That seemed like less of a gamble, Koetsier said.

CH4 workers will be able to keep an eye on the digester from far away. And they will be available if it breaks down, Brewer said.

CH4 signed its first contract with Koetsier.

It's a plan dairy farmers will be more comfortable with, experts said. That way, a dairy farmers can focus on what they do best: making milk, not running a power plant.
