CHICAGO, Ill. - This summer, 8-year-old Claire Dormanen added computer coding to her camp activities. Computer programing is when someone writes a set of instructions that allows a computer to work. The codes are used in almost every type of technology, from cellphone apps to dishwashers.

At a summer camp in Illinois, children learn how to write computer codes every day. They build creatures out of Legos and then write programs that make them move.

"This is where the world is going," said Claire's mother, Audrey Dormanen. She thinks that the camp is teaching her daughter technology and important life skills.

Coding was usually just for students who wanted to work in tech jobs. Some huge technology companies are Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Now it is possible for anyone to learn coding. A few summer camps in Chicago now teach computer programming. The lessons appear next to usual camp activities like arts and crafts, soccer and rock climbing.

## Coding Versus Playing Outdoors

Camp directors believe that these lessons are necessary. They think children should learn how to code at an early age. The new programs also make a lot of parents happy. Parents want their children to experience new things at summer camp. They want their children to learn about careers in science, technology, engineering and math.

However, some parents and experts wonder if children need to learn how to code. They think that these lessons might be unnecessary for children. Children already use technology every day. They think children should enjoy summer days outside instead of in the classroom.

Jim Taylor is a professor at the University of San Francisco. He said that teaching coding to children as young as 5 to 10 years old is ridiculous. Taylor thinks that it is more important for children to play. When children play, they learn important social skills, he says.

Many other people still think children should learn how to code. Ed Lazowska is a professor of computer science at the University of Washington. He thinks that in the future, knowing how to code will be important for all types of jobs.

Lazowska said kids should not learn how to code just because they want to work at Google and Facebook. Students who choose not to go into tech jobs still learn valuable skills. They learn how to recognize a problem and "debug" or solve it.

## First You Code, Then Play Ball

For half the day, students at a camp called Code Play Learn learn how to code. After lunch, campers stop coding. They spend the rest of the day playing games like soccer and dodgeball.

At the Steve and Kate's camps, people worked for months to create coding rooms for campers. They made these coding rooms at 40 camps across America. At any time of the day, campers can play video games that teach them how to code. They can even make their own smartphone apps and send them to their parents' cellphones.

Ben Chun made the computer programs used in the coding rooms at the Steve and Kate's camps. He likes the idea of teaching children how to code. He said that it is difficult for schools to add computer programming classes to their normal lesson plans. It is easier for students to learn over the summer, at camps like Steve and Kate's camp.

Betty Hintch has a son named Mateo. She was happy when she found out that Mateo could learn coding at Steve and Kate's Mount Prospect camp.

Hintch said she could understand why some parents are upset. She is not upset, though. She thinks that a few lessons in programming along with sports would be a good thing for her son.

Hintch said sneaking in coding along with fun activities is "really a good thing."
