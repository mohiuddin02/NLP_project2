A monkey took some selfies four years ago, and now the pictures are famous. An animal-rights group says the monkey should be able to legally own the pictures. However, the photographer who set up the camera says he should be the owner.

The animal-rights group is People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA. It has filed a lawsuit in court. The lawsuit seeks to make sure any money made from the pictures is used to help the monkey and others like it.

The macaque monkey, 6-year-old Naruto, lives on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. The island is in Asia and has a population of about 17 million.

The photos were taken during a 2011 trip to Sulawesi by British nature photographer David Slater. He put the selfies in a book called "Wildlife Personalities."

## Animal Selfies Published Around The World

However, the photos have shown up on websites and other places. The websites claim that no one actually owns the pictures because they were taken by an animal, not a person.

Slater is thinking about suing the websites that have published the pictures. He said he was "very saddened" by PETA's lawsuit. He said he supports animal rights.

Last year, the U.S. government said only human beings can legally own pictures. It said animals cannot legally own these types of things.

Jeffrey Kerr is a lawyer with PETA. He disagrees.

"Copyright law is clear," he said, talking about the law which says who can legally own things. "It's not the person who owns the camera, it's the being who took the photograph."

## Nature Photographer Unhappy About Clash Over Photos

Slater has been upset by the fight over the photos.

"I set the whole thing up," he said in an email. "A monkey only pressed a button of a camera set up on a tripod â€” a tripod I positioned and held throughout the shoot."

Last year, Slater offered copies of the monkey selfie photo to people. He told them they only had to pay for shipping. He promised to give some of the money to a group that protects monkeys.

However, Slater also has defended his right to make money from the photos. He has a 5-year-old daughter and would like to use the money to send her to college one day. "I have very little else to offer her," Slater wrote in his e-mail.

PETA has filed lawsuits in the past that experts did not think would be successful. In 2011, it accused SeaWorld of keeping five killer whales in poor conditions. It compared the conditions to slavery. However, a judge said the law about slavery applied only to humans.

Kerr, the lawyer for PETA, said PETA "has a very strong case" this time. He said Naruto should be declared the photo's owner.

## Experts Say They Have Doubts About Lawsuit's Success

David Favre is a law professor at Michigan State University. He often writes about animal rights. Favre said PETA has a fair argument. Yet, he added,"I would have to say it is an uphill battle."

Laurence Tribe is a Harvard Law School professor who supports animal rights. He expressed doubt about the lawsuit.

Tribe said people who care about animals should pay attention to more important problems. As examples, he pointed to animals being needlessly killed or taken advantage of.
