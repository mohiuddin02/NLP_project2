It started as a classroom project at Stanford University. The idea: An app for cellphones that would allow users to send photos that would disappear seconds later.

Vanishing photos? Classmates shrugged, uninterested.

But now, four years later, the idea that once seemed impossible has turned into a company known around the world: Snapchat. And on Wednesday, Snapchat Inc. reportedly secured a $200 million investment from Chinese technology superpower Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. That sum raises the market value of Snapchat to $15 billion, the highest of its peer companies based in Southern California.

## Mix Of Media Features

The investment from Alibaba is a stamp of approval for Snapchat's unique mix of social media features that turned its 200 workers into an inescapable force in media, advertising and smartphone economics. It also underlines how quickly a company can rise from small beginnings to global stature in today's fast-paced culture of apps.

This success has not been without its challenges and, according to one expert, the company has "had some growing pains in their short journey." But even with these speed bumps, "they're already there among the most important digital content distribution platforms," said Brandon Quartararo of the investment bank Digital Capital Advisors.

Those troubles have ranged from a legal dispute with a fired co-founder to inappropriate emails from another founder's account spilling online to sensitive business data being released to the public when computers at Sony Pictures were hacked.

The company also was criticized after it turned down an offer to be bought out by Facebook in 2013 for $3 billion, a sum that seemed absurd at the time.

But through it all, Snapchat maintained its popularity, regularly sitting among the top 10 most downloaded apps in dozens of countries.

## The Disappearing Element

Alibaba's investment could prove valuable both financially and strategically. The company, which already has a major presence in China, aims to become a bigger player in the U.S. in both online shopping and creating content.

"As an e-commerce site, you want to have access to places where people live their online lives," Quartararo said. "You want to become a place where you go not just to buy a roll of tissue papers and groceries."

Snapchat first hit Apple's App Store in July 2011 and at the time was called Picaboo. Later that summer, after dropping one of three co-founders, the remaining leaders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, changed the name to Snapchat. At the time, they had been working out of Spiegel's father's house. But Spiegel returned to his studies at Stanford University and Murphy to a job in San Francisco.

Snapchat became a quick hit among college students that semester. The disappearing element — along with a warning if someone took a screen-shot to save the picture — made it a perfect app for sending content that users wanted to vanish fast, though now its use has broadened.

In class, Spiegel would monitor Snapchat's logs to see how many people were using the app. During one class, he saw one photo sent every five minutes, but by the end of the same class, it was one per second. Due to the quick success, he dropped out of college and waves of investors began pouring in.

## CNN On Snapchat

By late 2012, Snapchat saw more than 200 snaps sent per second. Following this success, they began a fundraising effort that would raise more than $10 million in funding. By summer 2013, an additional $80 million flowed into the company's bank account as some 4,000 snaps moved every second. Snapchat has raised at least $500 million more since then.

New Snapchat features have kept users coming back, including being able to organize posts into "stories" that disappear after 24 hours. Users may also share content publicly now. Snapchat employees organize this public content based on major events, like the Grammys, or around locations, like a college campus.

The new features have given Snapchat a feeling that combines the experience of other popular pastimes: the simplicity of Instagram, the draw of watching YouTube videos and the feel of a town square with observations on daily life.

CNN has several employees who create and post news content to Snapchat and are adding more of these roles, according to Samantha Barry, the network's senior director of strategy.

"People are actively clicking on CNN on Snapchat to see the content we have curated for them," she said. "And they are staying from top to bottom and spend longer and longer."

Some media organizations, including CNN, have put ads in between their Snapchat content. The ads bring in huge sums of money from advertisers.

## For, Or Beyond, Millennials?

Creative individual video makers who produce funny or cute videos have also become stars of the app. They draw millions of views and get paid tens of thousands of dollars from advertisers for integrating products into the clips.

But analysts say Snapchat must broaden its reach beyond teenagers and young adults if it wants to be the next Facebook or YouTube.

"If I start using Snapchat, my wife is going to wonder what's going on with my marriage," Mark Kapczynski, who runs the consulting firm Kontrol Media, said half-jokingly. "Snapchat has to evolve into a trusted platform for a broader set of advertisers who appeal to an older demographic."

Another alternative is for Snapchat to stick to its roots and add more services directed at millennials.

"If they started to look and get more creative that way, they could really claim a piece of the big e-commerce pipeline," Kapczynski said.
