SEOUL, South Korea — The ground shook around North Korea's nuclear testing facility Wednesday. Soon afterward, North Korea announced that it had exploded its first hydrogen bomb, calling it the "H-bomb of justice."

Around the world, experts distrusted that North Korea actually had exploded the extremely powerful bomb. But whatever it tested, another round of tough international punishments is likely for the isolated, poor country.

North Korea wants to create a nuclear warhead to place on a missile that can reach the United States mainland. Wednesday's test likely pushed it closer to this goal. But South Korea's spy agency thought the explosion was too small for an H-bomb.

In Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, people were excited and proud. A large crowd celebrated in front of Pyongyang's main train station as the announcement was read on a big video screen. People took videos or photos of the screen on their mobile phones, applauding and cheering.

## Government Claims A "Perfect Success"

A North Korean television reporter read a government statement that said a test of a miniature hydrogen bomb had been a "perfect success." The statement said the explosion raised the country's "nuclear might to the next level."

North Korea's official media said the test was self-defense against a potential U.S. attack.

Throughout Southeast Asia and elsewhere, there was much worry about the test. South Korean President Park Geun-hye ordered her military to strengthen its defenses against North Korea. During the Korean War, which ended in 1953, Korea was split into two countries, North and South Korea, which are now enemies. Park called the test a "grave provocation" and "an act that threatens our lives and future." Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, "We absolutely cannot allow this."

Washington and nuclear experts have doubted previous North Korean claims about H-bombs. They are much more powerful and difficult to make than atomic bombs. If North Korea has the H-bomb, it would make bigger problems between North Korea and other countries.

## United Nations Discusses Punishment

Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, Matthew Rycroft, said an emergency meeting at the U.N. took place Wednesday. The United Nations is the organization of countries around the world. The meeting was to agree on a statement condemning the nuclear test and to increase sanctions against North Korea. Sanctions are punishments against a country. Countries are already forbidden to sell arms, technology and other goods to North Korea.

A successful H-bomb test would be a big advance in North Korea's nuclear weapons program. In an atomic bomb, the element plutonium is split into smaller atoms by a process called fission. The process releases enormous amounts of energy. Fusion is the main principle behind the hydrogen bomb. In fusion, smaller atoms are fused together and the explosion is hundreds of times more powerful.

## Earthquake Believed Too Small

A South Korean lawmaker said the country's spy agency told him that North Korea may not have conducted an H-bomb test. The bomb was exploded underground and caused an earthquake. The lawmaker, Lee Cheol Woo, said that Wednesday's quake was just not large enough to have been from an H-bomb, even a failed one. Lee said he got his information from South Korea's intelligence agency. A successful H-bomb test would have been hundreds of times stronger, he said. Even a failed H-bomb test would have been larger.

A miniature H-bomb could cause a weak quake. However, only the United States and Russia have these kinds of H-bombs, Lee said.

In Pyongyang, people felt pride, and some confusion.

Kim Sok Chol, 32, said he does not know much about H-bombs. He added that "Since we have it, the U.S. will not attack us."

Ri Sol Yong, 22, is a university student. He said, "If we didn't have powerful nuclear weapons, we would already have been turned into the slaves of the U.S."

## Exact Threat Not Known

It could take weeks before it is clear whether an H-bomb was actually tested.

Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress is a physicist at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation in California. The center studies the spread of nuclear weapons. He said the world may never know if a hydrogen bomb was actually tested Wednesday.

Also, it is not known whether North Korea's nuclear program is a big threat to the world. North Korea is thought to have a handful of basic nuclear bombs.

Some experts say the North probably does not have the technology to make an H-bomb, but no one knows for sure.

North Korea needs fresh nuclear tests for military and political reasons. To build a nuclear program, the North must explode new and more advanced weapons. Its scientists need to continually improve their designs and technology. Nuclear missiles could then be used as deterrents against its enemies — and especially against the United States. Its enemies would be less likely to attack if they think North Korea has nuclear missiles.

U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea and other countries in the area. North Korea has long pushed the United States to withdraw these soldiers and sign a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War.
