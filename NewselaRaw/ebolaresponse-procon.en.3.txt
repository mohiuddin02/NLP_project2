### PRO: Obama administration and health agencies have dropped the ball

ARLINGTON, Va. — The Ebola crisis is worsening in West Africa and U.S. citizens are on alert after cases in this country. People are increasingly questioning the White House's response to the crisis. So far it has been ineffective.

U.S. health officials blamed their own poor handling of the situation on needing more money. They said lawmakers in Washington didn't give them enough money to fight Ebola. That was bad enough.

Then the White House put someone with weak knowledge of health in charge of handling the response to Ebola. This proved the White House is just looking for a quick fix. It just wants to seem like it is doing something.

In an hour of need, our various national and international health agencies dropped the ball. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) have all failed at their jobs.

## Agencies Not Working Together

That's due to the way our government spreads around money and uses health workers. Several government agencies have the job of fighting the epidemic. They have done a poor job of working together.

Take the CDC. Its mission is to "develop and apply disease prevention and control." Yet it spends much of its money fighting long-term problems like obesity and gun violence.

From 2004 to 2014, CDC spending grew from $8.3 billion to $10.7 billion a year. Yet its department which aims to prevent diseases like Ebola only gets a tiny amount of that. It receives only $400 million a year.

The CDC has a program to limit climate change. It has another to deal with ongoing health problems — preventing smoking, alcohol abuse and poor diets. Together those programs receive about $1.6 billion a year.

While these are real problems, they take away from the CDC's job of responding to disease outbreaks.

## Where The Money Is Really Needed

The same is true at the NIH. Its director made inaccurate public statements. He blamed the agency's lack of preparedness on cuts in the money the NIH received. Yet the agency has plenty of money.

NIH gets more money from the government now than it did a few years ago. In 2000, it had $24.1 billion to spend. By 2014, that grew to $29.7 billion.

But the money the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH department gets has not gone up. It is the part of the NIH that actually researches the diseases people can catch. Its spending has remained at roughly $4.5 billion a year since 2003.

Much of NIH's money goes to projects that have nothing to do with discovering vaccines for diseases like Ebola.

These only hint at a deeper problem. In 2011, the Congressional Budget Office reported that NIH's large number of programs, large number of workers and large amount of money it has to spend makes "wasteful efforts" likely.

## "Didn't Do Anything"

Then there's the WHO. In July, Doctors Without Borders asked it for more help. The group is one of the leading ones fighting Ebola in West Africa. The WHO ignored the request.

A recent WHO document admitted that "nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall."

The problem? The leaders of its African office got their jobs because they knew the right people, not because of their skills. The WHO admitted this.

The co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, Dr. Peter Piot, agreed. He said that the office in Africa "didn't do anything."

Poor government planning is wasteful in the best of times. As the Ebola crisis worsens, it shows that it can be downright deadly in the worst of times. It's time our public health officials learned from these mistakes.

### CON: Government health agencies are doing good work against Ebola

BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Ebola is a recent and scary event for most people. Their thinking might also be that our government, specifically the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has poorly handled its job of stopping the disease.

Others, however, have seen the good work the CDC is doing.

The story of Ebola is truly one of a worldwide lack of public health infrastructure — health care workers, hospitals and equipment. Health care workers fighting the outbreak are exhausted. We have hid from our duty as a global community to fight disease outbreaks wherever they might be.

CDC Director Tom Frieden said beating Ebola lies in our ability to stop it in West Africa.

## CDC's Many Health Successes

Is the CDC doing a good job responding to Ebola? Yes, and they'll need our help. A short explanation about public health is needed.

First, securing the health of the nation is a responsibility we all share. That's why it's called "public" health. CDC is our primary national health agency and as such is in charge of investigating diseases that spread. However, it is not in charge of fighting disease in the rest of the world.

Fact: Most of the health care done around the world is by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), like Doctors Without Borders, which do their work by getting money from charities and nations.

CDC is an easy target for our fears around Ebola because it is likely the only U.S. public health agency we know about. We are generally clueless to the many health successes it's involved in. It aids with clean water, air, safe workplaces, training health workers and responding to outbreaks.

## Blaming The Government

We fail to notice that measles outbreaks in schools are quickly handled, thanks to local public health departments; or the progress made in reducing infections patients catch at hospitals.

We become aware of public health when something "goes wrong." Then we blame the government.

Fear mounted as soon as Thomas Eric Duncan became known as the first Ebola patient in the United States.

The CDC responded quickly, sending health officers to find everyone who he came in direct contact with. It also provided steps to control infection in hospitals and created detailed Ebola screening checklists. It set up quarantine rules that decide whether people should be isolated from others. It now is screening people at airports.

As Ebola was emerging in West Africa, CDC doctors were soon on the ground there investigating. CDC could still send hundreds of doctors, health educators and health workers to West Africa.

## Fighting Ebola Here And In West Africa

Has CDC done a good job responding to the Ebola outbreak? Absolutely, and they are not done yet.

Have we? No. We've just complained and made demands to close our borders. Those actions will likely make it harder to stop Ebola.

To be successful in fighting Ebola, Americans must call upon their government to spend money on public health here and in West Africa.

They must expect our U.S. hospitals to train, prepare and supply the health workers to recognize Ebola, protect themselves and control the spread of disease. And they must support the groups and charities that are doing the work on the ground.

This is more than an emergency response. It is a move toward better public health facilities here and in other countries. The CDC is doing a good job, but they are not alone in this, and all Americans must engage fully as members of our global community.
