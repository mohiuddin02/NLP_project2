SEATTLE — This week a group of Nez Perce Indians said enough is enough. They gathered at U.S. Highway 12 in central Idaho. The road cuts through pine forests and runs along a winding river.

Hundreds showed up along the narrow highway on Monday and Tuesday. Together they formed a barricade — a human wall that blocked the road.

They were attempting to stop a huge load of machine parts going to Alberta, Canada. The parts are used to get oil out of the ground. The load weighed about 644,000 pounds and stretched over 200 feet.

The protesters included tribal elders and mothers with young children. There were also people who had come from other places to support the Indians. Together they slowed down the large group of trucks carrying the machine parts. They were not able to stop the trucks for long, though.
## Protecting The Countryside

Trucks that travel in groups are known as a convoy. This one was carrying a giant water evaporator. After being blocked, it continued on its way when police arrested 20 of the protesters.

The crowd plans to keep on protesting. They said they would return Wednesday and Thursday nights.

Both [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) and people trying to protect the land want to stop the convoys. They say they crowd roadways and disturb tourists. They also threaten the beautiful countryside around the highway.

That countryside is part of the Nez-Perce National Forests. It is home to white-tail deer, cougars, black bears and mountain goats. Its rivers are full of salmon and trout.

"Everything is in there," said Nez Perce tribal leader Silas Whitman. He was one of the first protestors to be arrested.
## The Spirit Of The Land

Omega Morgan is the company carrying the water evaporator. It said the Idaho Department of Transportation gave it permission.

The company also said it followed state rules. According to these regulations, convoys have to travel at night. They can't delay traffic for longer than 15 minutes. And they are not allowed to damage nearby trees and other vegetation.

But the U.S. Forest Service says it is the agency that has to give permission. The loads are traveling through protected lands, it pointed out.

The Forest Service does not want convoys passing through the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests. The agency wants to first find out whether the convoys might harm the countryside.

The land has a spiritual meaning to the Nez Perce as well, the Forest Service said. It wants to find out just what that spiritual value is to the tribe. Like many Native Americans, the Nez Perce think of the land in a religious way.
## Trying To Delay Convoys

Tribal leaders said they had spoken out against convoys. But they were ignored. They soon decided that the only way people would pay attention was if businesses started losing money.

They hoped their protests would delay the convoys. Delays would cause companies to lose money. And that might make them decide not to send any more convoys down Highway 12.

Tribal leaders knew that police officers might have to arrest them.

On Monday, Whitman was the first to be handcuffed. He was with his 10-year-old granddaughter. As he was being carried off to jail, he told her to get back behind the barricade. "You have to stay here. You can't go with me."
