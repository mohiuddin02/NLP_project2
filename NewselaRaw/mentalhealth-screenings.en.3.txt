MIAMI â€” After a 15-year-old Illinois boy found out his father had cancer, he spun out of control. He skipped school, yelled at teachers and punched holes in walls. Stunned by an overwhelming sadness, he sometimes hid in his room.

The teen was suffering from major depression, a mental illness that causes great sadness. Eventually he agreed to go to group therapy sessions at his school.

School violence appears to be on the increase. Yet, experts say many teens are struggling with mental illness that is not being treated -- or even identified.

However, schools are not required to look for early symptoms of mental illness in students. This is in spite of the fact that U.S. health officials recommended mental health screenings nearly a decade ago.

## Varies From State To State

An Associated Press review shows there's a big variation in how schools handle the issue. There's no agreement on what to look for, at what age to check, or even if schools should screen kids for mental illness at all.

This "doesn't make any sense," said Mike Dennis. He teaches health care professionals around the country how to identify and treat mental illness and drug abuse. Schools check kids for all kinds of rare diseases. But many don't screen for behavioral and emotional problems. When these problems are caught early, it's easier to treat them. Waiting can be costly to the child, the family and society.

The Illinois teen's depression was not discovered at school. But at his school therapy sessions, he's learning to identify what sets him off. He also is learning how to calm down before he acts out.

"I think it is a good idea because a lot of people think they don't need help but they actually do," said the teen.

It's unknown how many schools offer mental health screenings.

## Screenings Aren't Perfect

Baltimore and Chicago have strong screening and treatment programs. Teachers in one South Florida school district screen children as young as kindergarten. In Minnesota, students answer surveys about drug use and depression. In Olympia, Wash., around 21,000 students were screened for drug abuse and mental health problems in 2010.

Mental health problems typically start during the teenage years. If left untreated, they can lead to drug and alcohol abuse and kids dropping out of school. Yet many people do not see a doctor for their mental disorders until later in life. The U.S. Surgeon General reports that 10 percent of children and teenagers suffer from serious emotional and mental illnesses.

However, running mental health screening in schools can be complicated.

Linda Juszczak, the president of the School-Based Health Alliance, said people need to be very cautious when they talk about screening all school children. The screening tests are not perfect. Some students will be falsely identified with mental illnesses. With others, the screening tests will miss very real problems. "The consequences to that are big," she said.

Other people say screening everyone could uncover mental health problems that schools can't treat. They may not have the money or staff to do so.

## Opportunity Grasped, And Missed

Behavioral Health System Baltimore developed a system that targets the most at-risk kids. Teams identify children who may need help. They look at whether a child has a parent in prison or who is addicted to drugs. Teams also identify kids struggling academically and behaviorally.

In South Florida, a fourth-grader was put in the hospital last August after threatening to attack a teacher's face with a pencil. The child was found to have two different mental disorders.

Dr. Seth Bernstein is a psychologist who is involved in the case. He called it a missed opportunity. The child was never screened for emotional or behavioral issues. A year earlier, a program that offered school support and family counseling had been cut at his school.

In contrast, Matthew Palma, now 10, attended play therapy sessions as a kindergartener as part of Primary Project. The project screens 3,000 kindergarten kids and first-graders each year for warning signs like having trouble making friends.

Matthew's mother says he is much more confident now. He isn't afraid to talk to adults or raise his hand in class.
