The Mauna Kea mountain in Hawaii is a treasure to many people. Nature lovers prize its beautiful forests. Astronomers gaze at stars from its peak. Native Hawaiians believe that their gods live at its summit.

Lately, the mountain has been a place of culture clashes as well.

On one side are scientists who want to build a $1.4 billion telescope at its top. On the other side are Hawaiian activists who want to protect the sacred mountain from construction.

The telescope is called the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). It is named for the width of its enormous, light-gathering mirror, which is 100 feet. The telescope will see as much as 100 times farther and more clearly into space than we have ever seen before. It will allow astronomers to gaze deep into the universe's past and out toward its farthest stars. It will be 18 stories tall and far larger than anything on the mountain.

## Not On My Mountain!

Protesters recently delayed construction on the telescope for the second time. They crowded the road to the mountain top, waving flags and singing songs. Some left boulders and stone altars, or ahu, in the middle of the road. Others camped at the construction site overnight. A dozen protesters were arrested.

Mauna Kea is about 1 million years old. This is not the first time that Mauna Kea has been fought over. Ever since 1968, when the first plans for a telescope were announced, activists have opposed building on the mountain. Now there are 13 telescopes. Many Native Hawaiians believe that each one is an insult to the mountain.

Mauna Kea is a volcano. It rises nearly 14,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean and more than 6 miles above the sea floor. From base to peak, it is the world's tallest mountain. In Hawaiian tradition, the mountain is where the sky and earth separated. Native Hawaiians believe it is also where the mother and father of Hawaiians first met. The mountain is on the big island of Hawaii. It is home to more than 250 religious places and burial sites. In the past, its summit was so holy that only high chiefs and priests were allowed to climb up to it.

## Mountain's Beauty Should Be Undisturbed

Mauna Kea represents the Native Hawaiian people's ancient ties to the beginning of the world, said Kealoha Pisciotta. She is a Native Hawaiian activist. She is also one of six people trying to stop the telescope in Hawaiian courts.

For more than 10 years, Pisciotta worked as a technician on one of the mountain's telescopes. Meanwhile, she maintained a family shrine near the summit and led a Hawaiian cultural group.

"I have always supported astronomy," Pisciotta wrote. Astronomy is the study of space. "However, I do not believe it is of so much importance that it should be allowed to overtake and destroy everything else."

Activists like Pisciotta believe that the proposed telescope will ruin the mountain's beauty and religious power. They also say it will threaten its rare natural habitat. An environmental study, however, found this would not happen.

## Seeing Beyond The Telescope

In April, an email was sent to scientists about the project. It had an attachment from another scientist. He wrote against the local traditions and protests. Many people thought the message was insulting toward Native Hawaiians. It only made them more angry and more opposed to the project.

Bryan Kamaoli Kuwada is a Native Hawaiian. He wrote that any time native people try to protect their holy places, they are called old-fashioned and against science.

The TMT is not the first scientific project that has upset native groups. Often the projects are in places that are remote and beautiful. These qualities were what made native people worship them in the first place.

In Mauna Kea's case, some astronomers are questioning whether the telescope is really worth it.

Emily Rice is a scientist who worked on one of the telescopes on the mountain. She posted on Twitter that she did not like how the project was being done.

"Astronomy is awesome, but it's not life or death," she tweeted. "We can take the time to do things right and set an example."
