NEW YORK â€” Romance can be rocky, and no one knows that better than the Statue of Liberty. Over and over, Lady Liberty has been separated from those who love her. The most recent breakup was caused by an uninvited guest. Her name was Sandy and she stormed through, leaving heartbreak and ruin behind her.

Since Oct. 29, 2012, the statue had stood alone in New York Harbor. But the painful separation is over at last. On Thursday, visitors returned to the Statue of Liberty for the first time since the superstorm shut her down. It was the third closure since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

"I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little bit tired of reopening and closing the Statue of Liberty," said David Luchsinger, the statue's superintendent. "I think this time we'll just leave it alone," he said with a laugh.

As he spoke, hundreds of visitors swarmed Lady Liberty. Her home, Liberty Island, is a short ferry ride from Manhattan. The island's only resident is the 127-year-old woman who symbolizes freedom, from her shimmering torch to the broken chain at her feet.

## Visitors Quietly Stare At Her

As the first tourist boat of the day circled the island, visitors fell quiet. They got a close-up view of Lady Liberty's strong jaw and steady-gazing eyes. Many lowered their cell phones, stopped taking pictures, and just stared.

"She's beautiful," said Rebecca Hines, of Byron, Ill. "This isn't something you can capture on an iPad."

"Pictures don't do it justice at all," said her 16-year-old son, Alex.

Officials said it took a round-the-clock effort to get the statue reopened in time for Independence Day. A Fourth of July reopening had been their goal. The storm sent a record 14-foot storm surge over much of lower New York City.

Lady Liberty survived unharmed, but her home was trashed. The ferry docks were broken and the electrical and sewage systems were destroyed. The walkways and railings surrounding her pedestal were a total loss.

## Scramble To Reopen Pays Off

The National Park Service expected to spend about $56 million to fix Liberty Island and nearby Ellis Island. But the cost jumped to $77 million. Officials decided to use stronger materials. They hope they can prevent the next monstrous storm from causing so much damage.

The repairs included putting down 53,000 new paving stones and 2,000 feet of granite. "It was no small feat," said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis.

The scramble paid off. Tickets to visit the statue's crown sold out months ago. Visitors must climb 354 stairs up a narrow, winding staircase. "It's worth it," said Bev Viger, a visitor from Canada, who was visiting with her granddaughter, Makaela. They had managed to get crown tickets along with a friend, Danielle Williams. The three tourists were not held back by the hot, swampy day.

"It's spectacular, and it's the New York icon," said Williams. "And what better day to visit?" As they began their climb, VIPs and special guests gathered behind Lady Liberty for a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

The guests came from all walks of life, just like the masses that the statue embraces. They included three schoolteachers from Kendallville, Ind. Their pupils sold lollipops to raise more than $400 to contribute to the statue's repairs. Actor Dominic Chianese sang "God Bless America" to the crowd.

## Tribute To Fallen First-Responders

Sally Jewell also attended the reopening. Jewell is the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, which oversees all National Park Service monuments. As part of the ceremony, she paid tribute to the 19 firefighters killed Sunday in Arizona. Jewell broke down in tears as she called the fallen men "a great reminder of the importance of first-responders."

She urged Americans to remember them on Independence Day. Jewell wore a purple ribbon on her shirt to honor the firefighters.

Since the statue was dedicated in 1886, it has been closed several times. The past dozen years have been especially hard for Liberty and for those who yearn to get close to her. Worries about security after the 2001 attacks kept Liberty Island shut down for three years. The island reopened in 2004, but the statue was kept closed for another two years. In 2006, visitors were once again allowed inside, but not up to the crown. It finally was reopened on July 4, 2009.

On Oct. 29, 2011 the statue was closed for one year as the inside was renovated. It reopened a year later, only to close after one day because of Sandy.

"This is a work of art that became a symbol of resilience," said Adrian Benepe of the Trust for Public Land. "It's a highly important symbol, not just for New York but for the world." Gil Thibault, visiting from Laguna Beach, Calif., with his wife, Judy, and daughter, Sandee, agreed.

"It's not one of the seven or eight wonders of the world," Thibault said, "but it should be."
