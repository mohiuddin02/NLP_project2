Dave March was about to try an experiment. He wanted to see if the car he built really could drive on water.

He took a sip of his coffee, and looked through the windshield of his waiting car. It wasn't on a road by other cars but on the water in Newport Harbor, Calif., next to his 65-foot boat.

"This has been a dream for 10, 15 years," he said. His gaze was fixed toward Catalina Island, where he was going to try to drive his car. "Every time I see that island," he said, "I think, 'Oh, it's not that far.'" But he has never tested the car on open water, and 30 miles is a long way to swim.

March has spent more than 10 years developing a fast car that operates on water, or is amphibious. He set the Guinness World Record for fastest amphibious car. Now he is about to start selling his newest car. Each one will cost $135,000. He has already taken orders from the Prince of Dubai, tycoons in Silicon Valley, and other rich people.

## Car Cuts Across Water

The car that March is test-driving to Catalina is called the Panther. It looks like a jeep. It took him 12 years of testing and hundreds of thousands of dollars to build it.

The United Arab Emirates has ordered one. Sheik Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, the crown Prince of Dubai, has ordered six. Two of the most powerful men in Silicon Valley each have sent deposits, but their names are being kept secret. NASCAR drivers are knocking at his door.

Back in Newport Harbor, March points his Panther toward the horizon. Surrounded by three powerboats carrying friends and family, he steps on the gas. The Panther slowly rises up out of the water. The morning sun is still low as the Panther cuts across the water.

March moves into deeper water. The shore disappears from view. Dolphins leap up around him and a whale comes up for air. You can see March's big grin from the deck of another boat.

"We're at 13.5 miles," March's partner, Fred Selby, radios from his boat before the halfway mark. "This is the point of no return."

Strong and gnarled from years of working with fiberglass and steel, March's hands are like those of a carpenter. His blond hair falls on either side of his gray-blue eyes. He has the confident smile of a man who can afford expensive toys.

Like so many other ideas, March's first water car was born in his basement, which he flooded to see whether his test model would float. But the real challenge wasn't waterproofing, as you'd think. It was getting the car up and out of the water when he pressed the gas.

## Panther's First Run A Success

March's first model in 2003 looked like a small Camaro sports car. When it was switched to a boat, the tires pulled up into the car and metal plates covered the wheel wells. March posted a video of it online, and the clip went viral.

March's first customer is an electronics manufacturer from Pennsylvania named Peter McIlroy. He is scheduled to receive his Panther sometime in February. March said it's taking longer than usual to produce. McIlroy wants his Panther to be gunmetal gray with a red interior, to match his Bentley.

An hour and 10 minutes after he left, he'd made it to the harbor of Catalina Island. "I never thought we'd make it the first time out," March said as he celebrated with his friends and family.

After the thrill wore off, March wanted to drive the Panther into town. But the tide had made a land approach difficult. The Panther is designed for cement loading docks and relatively smooth shores like a sandy beach.

March drove onto the rock-strewn banks of Catalina at low tide, but it was too steep. He had to run the jets backwards. It sent a barrage of small rocks up into the car's underbelly, damaging a wheel fastener.

March was visibly upset that he was not able to finish the Panther's maiden voyage into Catalina, but was glad to find a weak link to improve upon. "Each time you break something, you learn something," March said. "That's what it's all about."
