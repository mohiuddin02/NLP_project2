SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. â€” Some parents are being accused of stealing because they sent their children to better schools.

This is what happened to Hamlet Garcia and his wife, Olesia. They were accused of "stealing an education" for their 8-year-old daughter, Fiorella. Hamlet Garcia's crime meant that he could have gone to jail for seven years.

## Neighborhoods, Lies And Jail

Parents are only allowed to send their children to schools in the neighborhood in which they live. If they live in a neighborhood with bad schools, they are not allowed to send them to a school in another neighborhood.

Some parents have had to pay big fines for lying about where they live. Others have been criminally charged. A few have been jailed.

Experts say these tough punishments may be on the rise.

"I'm hearing about it more and more every year," said Gloria Romero, the leader of a parents' group and former state senator of California.

## Punishing Poor Families Of Color

The examples are many. Some local leaders are worried. They say tough enforcement measures unfairly hurt poor families of color. Poor families cannot easily pay their way out of trouble. They can't afford to pay back the price of their children's education.

Jonah Edelman is the leader of an education group. He says the real problem is the difference between rich and poor areas. Rich areas have much better schools.

Hamlet Garcia says that he and his wife Olesia decided to live separately during the 2011-2012 school year. During that time, Olesia and their daughter lived with Olesia's father in Lower Moreland, Pennsylvania. Lower Moreland is a small, peaceful town with good schools. His daughter attended school there. She read picture books, learned the alphabet and made friends.

The prosecutor, Risa Vetri Ferman, said the Garcias were never truly separated. She said the family always lived in northwestern Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where many schools are struggling. They lied to get their daughter into the Lower Moreland school, she said.

The Garcias agreed to pay nearly $11,000 to the school. They also had to pay $70,000 for lawyers and court costs. They now want to send their daughter to a private school.

Parents who lie about where they live can be sent to jail. In Michigan, parents can be jailed for up to 20 days. In Oklahoma, the sentence can be up to a year.

## More Parents Fight Back

Gwen Samuel runs a group that helps parents. She said school boards are "treating families like they've robbed a bank."

Romero is a former state senator who wrote laws for California. In 2010, she wrote a law that lets students attending bad schools move to better schools anywhere in the state.

Romero says many parents don't know about the law.

"A lot of parents think they are trapped," she said.

Parent groups say they are seeing more and more cases of parents who have been targeted by schools. The parents are fighting back. They are talking about the problems on television and in newspapers. They are also arguing against jail time.

"The real issue is how do we provide quality schools for all children," said Ryan Smith, who leads an education group.
