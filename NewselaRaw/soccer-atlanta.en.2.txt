ATLANTA — Major League Soccer announced its newest team on Wednesday, which will be based in Atlanta and begin play in 2017.

The team's owner, Arthur Blank, dressed as a soccer fan to mark the occasion.

"I love this one," Blank said. He looked down at the red, black and gold scarf draped over his dark suit. "I haven't taken it off since it was given to me. I may not sleep in it tonight, but I may. I haven't decided yet."

Blank also controls the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.

Blank said he first started talking with MLS about bringing a team to Atlanta about 10 years ago.

The discussions started again recently, after Blank said he would build a new $1 billion downtown stadium. He is putting up most of the money and the city will contribute $200 million. Those funds will come from money Atlanta collects from hotels whose guests pay a tax for every night they stay.

## Red And Black

"I think Atlanta is a natural fit for Major League Soccer," said Blank, as a group of fans sang to him. The fan group calls itself "Terminus Legion," referring to Atlanta's former name.

The team's name has not been decided. Blank said he will ask the fans before choosing it. He already knows the team's colors, though. They will be red and black — matching the Falcons — with some gold as well.

"What the name will be, we really don't know," he said. "We will spend a lot of time listening to our fans and trying to understand why some names are more important than others."

One name that won't be considered is Atlanta Chiefs. That's the name of two previous teams that played in the old North American Soccer League. While the Chiefs won the first NASL championship in 1968, both teams struggled financially and eventually folded.

MLS Commissioner Don Garber said there was no hesitation about putting a team in Atlanta.

Atlanta is the ninth-largest city in the U.S.  It is also the biggest U.S. city without a top-level soccer team. The city has a large Hispanic population and last month more than 68,000 fans watched a friendly match between Mexico and Nigeria at the Georgia Dome.

## MLS Expanding Rapidly

The league went all out to promote its newest team. Hundreds of fans turned out for a street festival. Blank and Garber arrived by helicopter for the introductory news conference. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed also attended.

While the new stadium is mainly designed for the Falcons, Blank stressed that it will be soccer-friendly. Because the soccer pitch will be larger, the stands along the sideline can be moved back.

MLS games attract a smaller crowd than football games. Curtains will fall from the roof and close off the upper sections, to make the venue appear smaller.

The new stadium is designed to seat about 71,000 for NFL games. That can be reduced to about 29,000 for soccer.

"There will never be an MLS game in Atlanta where NFL lines are shown on the field," Blank said, drawing a big cheer.

MLS, which has 19 teams this season, is expanding rapidly. Its goal is to have 24 teams by 2020.

Orlando and New York City are scheduled to begin play next season. There will also be a team in Miami, if a group led by David Beckham can build a soccer-specific stadium there.

## Different Fan Bases

The league has added five teams in the past five years, including the hugely successful Seattle Sounders. Garber said there is no worry about growing too fast given the large amount of soccer talent around the world.

"When we expand, we can pick from players around the world," Garber said.

Blank said he will try to encourage some crossover between Falcons' season-ticket holders and those interested in attending MLS games. But he said the teams are likely to have very different fan bases. The new soccer team will not merely be a side business for the Falcons, he said.

His first task is to hire a team president for the MLS venture. He will also be exploring possible locations for a state-of-the-art training ground.

"We want to make sure the people running soccer get up in the morning thinking about soccer and go to bed thinking about soccer," said Blank.
