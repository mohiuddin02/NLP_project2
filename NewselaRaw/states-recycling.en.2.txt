WASHINGTON, D.C. — An old television. One of the first iPhones. The printer that came with a new computer.

These items are among the millions of tons of technology pitched into the trash or taken to recycling centers each year. States have been trying to get manufacturers to help pay for electronics recycling since the early 2000s. Yet half of states do not have recycling programs across their entire state. Those that do are considering how to make their programs work as the size, volume and value of recycled electronics change.

Many electronic devices should not be thrown away with regular trash. They contain dangerous materials, such as mercury and lead, that can pollute soil and groundwater. Meanwhile, much of the metal, plastic and glass in devices can be recycled.

## E-cycling Law Began In California

California became the first state to pass a law requiring "e-cycling," or electronic recycling. The law passed in 2003. In California, consumers pay a fee that supports e-cycling when they buy a product. Another 24 states and Washington, D.C., put the cost of e-cycling programs on manufacturers. Many require that the companies that make the products pay for the collection and processing of a certain amount of e-waste based on how much they sell within the state.

Five states have programs that require electronics makers to help pay for local drop-off centers where people can bring their old electronics. The states are Connecticut, Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.

It is difficult for manufacturers to meet all the different laws and variety of other rules, said Walter Alcorn. He is a vice president at the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA).

Initially, the CEA, which represents retailers and manufacturers, asked for laws requiring consumers to pay recycling costs, as they do in California. Now the group is working with states to make existing laws similar across states. It is also trying to get laws made that electronics makers agree with.

"We want to see recycling incorporated into these corporate business models," Alcorn said. "That's where they can thrive and companies can get creative in getting their customers to bring back their used products."

## Who Picks Up The Recycling Tab?

Some state laws require manufacturers to pay for a set weight of e-cycling each year. Yet these laws can backfire if the weight goals are met before the end of the year, because then manufacturers are allowed to stop paying, said Resa Dimino. She works for the Product Stewardship Institute (PSI). The group focuses on the environmental and health effects of consumer products.

When companies stop paying, local governments or other groups have to pay for recycling efforts themselves. If not, the recycling stops, she said.

PSI works with states to run their e-cycling programs. Dimino said that programs could be changed so companies that make the products have to keep paying for recycling collection.

Manufacturers in Washington and Oregon pay for cities and towns to have collection sites, Dimino said. Having recycling centers close by makes it easy for residents to recycle. Since these states do not make companies meet a weight goal, the states do not have to worry that companies will suddenly get to stop paying. E-cycling in those states is more reliable as a result.

## Devices Are Smaller And Smaller

Electronic devices are also becoming smaller and people keep them longer. This can create a different problem. It may be difficult for electronics companies to collect enough recycled materials to meet the state weight goals, said Allison Schumacher at the CEA.

She points to recent a change in an e-cycling law in South Carolina. The change lets electronics makers work together on recycling.

Schumacher said the change will give manufacturers the flexibility to meet state recycling rules. She hopes other states will be able to use it as a model.

Manufacturers' might also have trouble meeting weight goals because there are fewer cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to be recycled. CRTs, part of big older televisions and computer monitors, usually contain leaded glass. They have largely gone out of production since 2010. Most TVs are lightweight flat screens now.

Heavy CRT devices helped manufacturers meet their recycling weight goals, but at this point fewer of them are available. Once they are gone, meeting weight goals will be harder, Schumacher said.

When electronics are recycled they can be fixed up for resale or broken down, with manufacturers or recycling companies selling pieces such as plastic and metal.

## Make Existing Laws Better

States without formal e-cycling programs are not without recycling opportunities. Programs in those states are supported by companies that host electronics buyback programs. Private organizations and local governments also have recycling efforts, said Jason Linnell, director of the National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER).

Instead of pushing for more state laws, NCER helps states make existing laws work more efficiently. Linnell said he does not expect more statewide laws to pass in coming years.
