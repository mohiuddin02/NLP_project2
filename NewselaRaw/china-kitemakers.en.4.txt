WEIFANG, China â€” Dragon kites, eagle kites and butterfly kites cover Zhang Xiaodong's workshop. There are even mechanical kites.

Zhang is one of China's most loved kite makers. The 65-year-old showed off some of his life's work. He talked about why kite flying is good for you.

"Flying a kite provides good exercise," he said. It also builds friendships. He says it puts people in a better mood.

Chinese kite makers have many worries. As China becomes more modern, young people are playing video games instead of flying kites. The kite makers are getting old. Almost all of them are men.

## A Kite Maker Remembers

China is very proud of its kites. They are an invention that helped mathematicians and scientists later invent airplanes and other things. Still, the future of this old craft is far from certain.

Weifang is a city that calls itself China's kite capital. Han Fuling is a kite maker from Weifang. He is 82 years old. He has been making traditional kites for almost his whole life. He can remember the special feeling when he built his first kite. He saw it float into the air. He was only 7 years old.

Times have changed. Han does not think that any of his four children will make kites.

## Hard Times For Kites

Kite making is only part of a bigger story in China. People do not appreciate art as much. Historic buildings, crafts and music are being erased. China is growing but it does not have time for art. The country is not able to keep its older way of life.

China's kite masters have been through hard times before. The country used to be run by an emperor, or king. After World War II, Chairman Mao Zedong took over. In the 1960s and 1970s, China had a "Cultural Revolution."

Chairman Mao was a strict leader. He wanted to make people listen to him. He decided to make sure artists listened to him. Sometimes art can make people find problems with the government. Mao tried to control art. Kite makers had to change, too.

Han Fuling followed Mao Zedong's strict rules. He started making kites that showed workers. Mao thought this would cause people to only think of work. Before, kites used to have drawings of ancient gods or heroes.

Fuling has bad memories from that time. A kite artist named Fei Baoling lived in another city. He went through the same thing. Fei had to ruin his beautiful kites. He had to follow Mao's rules.

With a new ruler, kite art changed back. Artists could paint the ancient gods and heroes again.

## Keeping Kite Making Alive

China is home to many schools of kite making. There are artists in many different cities. In Beijing, Fei is widely known as an expert. He is good at painting designs on kites.

Fei's eyes do not work as well as they used to. It can be hard to paint when he cannot see well. Still, he tries to teach people to paint on kites. Sun He is one of his students.

He is a 36-year-old car mechanic who began studying with Fei in 2003. He wanted to make kites as beautiful as Fei.

Sun said his fascination with kites started with his grandfather, who taught him the old accents and ways of Beijing, including Beijing opera.

When Sun meets a young person interested in Chinese culture, he is eager to talk to them. But he said it does not happen often.

People do not usually fly traditional kites, Sun says. They buy cheap, triangle kites from toy stores "and fly them at the bridges."
