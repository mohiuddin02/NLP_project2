HOPE MILLS, N.C. â€” Alberta Currie is the great-granddaughter of slaves. She was born in a farmhouse surrounded by tobacco and cotton fields. Her mother, Willie Pearl, gave birth 78 years ago with the assistance of a midwife.

There was no official birth certificate issued. A birth announcement was handwritten into the Currie family Bible.

This is causing problems today. It may force Currie to sit out an election for the first time since 1956. A restrictive new North Carolina law requires a state-issued photo ID for voting as of the 2016 election.

Voters can obtain a state-issued ID at no cost. But they have to go to get to a state driver's license office. Then they have to wait in line. And they have to show documents that many voters do not have, including an original or certified birth certificate and original Social Security card.

## Groups Say ID Law Targets Minorities

Republicans backed the law. They say the new measure combats voter fraud. Civil rights groups argue that the obstacles are an obvious attempt to make it difficult for Democratic-leaning voters to obtain IDs needed to vote. They say the law particularly targets African-Americans, students and the elderly.

Currie has spent three years trying to persuade officials to issue her a birth certificate. Now, because of the new law, she must locate several other documents. This is difficult for someone her age.

"They're trying to make it as hard as possible for people like me to vote," Currie said at her brick home in farm country in southern-central North Carolina. "It takes two IDs to get the ID I need, but how can I get it if I don't have those two IDs?"

Republicans have enacted similar voter ID laws in at least 11 states since 2011. One is Texas. The Justice Department has filed suit against the Texas law. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has threatened lawsuits against other states, including North Carolina.

In North Carolina, three civil rights groups have filed suit in federal and state court alleging that the law discriminates against African-Americans. Currie is the lead plaintiff in one of the lawsuits. The North Carolina chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has said the new law "revisits the tactics of Jim Crow" and represents a new form of poll taxes once levied against black voters in the South.

Jim Crow was the name used for segregation laws and practices in the South.

## Law Rejects Student ID Cards At Polls

"Jim Crow was very ugly about what he did," Jeremy Collins, a lawyer with the Southern Coalition, told Currie. Her twin daughters, Brenda and Linda, 57, nodded in agreement.

"Today James Crow wears a suit and tie and is much more sophisticated," Collins told the family.

As in Texas, the law rejects student ID cards as a form of identification. This forces North Carolina's 300,000 college students to scramble for documents. Rob Christensen is a reporter for the News &amp; Observer of Raleigh who has covered state politics for four decades. He accused Republicans of using the law to block the youth vote, which Barack Obama won by two-thirds in 2012.

Cassandra Perkins, 20, a junior political science student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said she voted in 2012 by simply providing her on-campus address. But now she's struggling to obtain documents required by the new law.

"It's a slap in the face," Perkins said of the law.

The law also cuts early voting by a week and eliminates same-day registration. It also gets rid of other measures that are mostly used by African-Americans or students.

## No Evidence Of Voter Fraud

North Carolina rose from 47th in voter participation in 1991 to 11th in 2012, according to Christensen. Two reasons were early voting and same-day registration, he said.

Republicans have produced no evidence of voter fraud. Nor have they explained how cutting early voting and registration combats fraud.

Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican who signed the voter ID bill into law Aug. 12, said it requires the same number of early voting hours as in 2012. They are just compressed into a shorter period. McCrory's office says 34 states require or will soon require some form of voter ID.

"The need for photo ID has been questioned by those who say voter fraud is not a problem in North Carolina," McCrory said in a statement. "However, without the higher level of identification a photograph provides, is it possible to know?"

In an Aug. 22 speech in Raleigh, former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell criticized McCrory and state Republicans. He said the law tells minority voters that "we really are sort of punishing you."

## Making It Hard For Some To Vote

More than 600,000 registered voters do not have a state driver's license or state-issued ID, according to a state board of elections survey. Many are young, poor, African-American or elderly.

Rosanell Eaton, 92, an African-American, has voted in every election for seven decades. She rode a mule-drawn wagon to register to vote in 1939. White election workers in North Carolina required her to recite the preamble to the U.S. Constitution. Eaton, the top student of her high school, recited it perfectly. The workers allowed her to register. They were not happy.

"It's the same old thing," she said of the ID law. "They know if they make it hard enough for African-American folks to vote, we won't have enough people voting."

Currie said the new law reminds her of being forced to the back of the line, behind white voters, when she first cast a ballot in 1956. "You just knew you better get back when white folks showed up," she recalled.

Nonetheless, Currie said, she is determined to continue voting. "I'm not giving up," she said. "We fought too hard for the right to vote to give up now."
