MUMBAI, India — The voice from the Internet ad is confident: No one will suspect anything, he says. The gadget has never failed.

He is a college student, but he assures the caller that he speaks from experience. His price: about $40. Minutes later he texts, offering a 6 percent discount.

That's the price to cheat on one of India's all-important tests, a pressure-packed exam that opens the doors to the country's best colleges, universities and postgraduate programs.

Anil, a medical student in southern India, was selling a tiny wireless earpiece, scarcely bigger than the head of a pin. The earpiece receives a signal from a cellphone via a transmitter. During exams, Anil conceals the transmitter under a loose-fitting shirt, texts pictures of the test questions to a friend at home and receives answers over the phone.

"There's no way anyone can even make out you using the device," says Anil, who imports the earpieces from the United States and sells three or four a week on eBay to high school and college students. "I've never had any problems. You just need to have some confidence and a good friend who can help you out during the exams."

## High-Stakes Exams

India's schools are renowned for producing hordes of talented math and science graduates. Tens of thousands of them go on to excel at universities in the United States and worldwide, but the huge importance of the exams has created a tradition of cheating.

The stakes are high, because achieving good scores in the nationwide tests for 10th- and 12th-graders — known as board exams — determines who gets into the best schools. The board exams are also key to getting into the most sought-after fields of study, such as engineering and medicine. And pressure from parents to do well can be overwhelming, students say.

Even for those not attending college, test results are important for entering job training programs, which can offer a ladder up to the middle class.

Education officials say they are tackling the problem. But for every comical-sounding contraption like the one Anil was selling, more extreme examples of cheating come to light once exam season begins each February.

At a school in Allahabad, in northern India, members of an inspection team were attacked with bombs after catching two students cheating.

At a test center in northern India's Bareilly district, inspectors found school staff members writing answers to an exam on the blackboard. When the inspectors arrived, the staff members tried to throw the evidence out the window.

Sometimes the stories are horrifying. A 10th-grader in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, accused his principal last month of allowing students to cheat if they each paid about $100. The student's poverty-stricken family could barely manage half the bribe. Upset, he doused himself with kerosene, a type of fuel, and set himself on fire in the family kitchen, dying the next day.

## Trying To Stop Cheating

Some schools have installed closed-circuit cameras to monitor testing rooms. Others posted armed police officers at entrances or employed jamming devices to block the use of cellphones to trade answers.

Still, India's national elections, which began this month, "are likely to be freer and fairer than the exams," journalist Mridula Chari wrote.

Teachers and school officials say rogue students make up a small fraction of the millions of those who take the board exams each year. But some say the problem became worse after a 2010 policy that guaranteed schooling for all children up to age 14. No student can be held back until the eighth grade or forced to take a board exam until the 10th grade. Teachers say the policy pampers underperforming students and doesn't train them to take tests.

"They are used to passing. They don't become accustomed to studying," said Madhukar Yadhav, the head of a school.

For rule-breakers, low-tech methods remain popular. Hiding cheat sheets in socks, copying neighbors' answers and scribbling notes on walls are common tactics, while tests routinely are sold by school employees, as well.

One student said that during his 10th-grade exams just one supervisor was assigned to watch dozens of students.

"For the major part of the exam, he was not present in the class," the student recalled. "There was open passing of information, noise and even discussions. I remember verifying most of my answers with my friends."

## "A Headache For Us"

The anti-cheating measures begun this year had mixed success. In Mumbai, India's largest city, officials said that installing closed-circuit cameras reduced cheating by 20 percent, but students in at least one school disabled the cameras by throwing rocks at them.

In the eastern state of Bengal, police stood guard outside test centers. But that didn't stop people from tossing cheat sheets wrapped around small stones through windows into the exam rooms.

"One hundred percent, we can stop this problem," said Lakshmikant Pande, chairman of the board of education in the western state of Maharashtra. "If we continue these types of efforts over two or three years, surely we can stop this."

Veteran teachers remain doubtful, saying that school principals often are reluctant to report cheating for fear of damaging their reputations. They also said there is little incentive for a teacher to testify to a cheating case, which can trigger a time-consuming formal investigation.

About a decade ago, the son of a senior Indian Railways official hired a train conductor to take an exam for him. The scam was busted and the student reported to the authorities.

Yet long after his graduation, the case remains before the police and the teacher who nabbed the cheat is forced to appear at least once a year at a court proceeding.

"We learned a lesson from that," said an English teacher, Akhil Bhosle. "If we register a case, it will be a headache for us."
