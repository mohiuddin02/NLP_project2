KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” Army Sgt. 1st Class Terrence Hoard must reach potential recruits early to set them straight.

They think anybody can enlist. Many see the military as a last resort in a tough job market, but young people always assume it is an option. The Class of 2014 now leaving high school will face more difficulty qualifying for the armed services than ever in the 40-year history of the all-volunteer force.

So Hoard tells them long before graduation day: Don't ever get caught with drugs. Work out, shed weight. And be extra careful about getting tattooed.

"We're turning down twice as many as before," said Hoard, who supervises the Army recruiting station in Grandview, Mo. Several years ago, his office needed to sign up 16 to 20 soldiers per month to meet recruiting targets. Now, 10 or 12 will do.

## Jumping Jacks For Wannabe Warriors

Earlier this month, a dozen fresh recruits and wannabe warriors showed up for push-ups and jumping jacks. Among them was Kyle Bayard, of Drexel, Mo., whose lifelong dream of serving was held up for a year because he had been prescribed attention-deficit medicine in high school.

Mauricio Lonza maintained a B average in high school and through a couple of years at Kansas State University. But three times he failed a written armed services skills test, the ASVAB, before he got a passing score. Math was never his favorite subject, said Lonza, 21.

Hoard had to reject four local candidates for having tattoos that crept too low on their forearms. All four were turned down the week after the Army's tattoo restrictions took effect April 29.

With the United States decreasing its troop numbers from wars in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) and [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq), about four of every five adults who seek to join don't qualify. The chances for active-duty service for a generation that grew up in the age of terror aren't likely to improve.

With the cutbacks, the Department of Defense (DOD) is looking for the same successful, highly motivated high school graduates that everyone else is chasing, said retired Army Lt. Col. Mike Byrd. He would know: Byrd is an instructor for Van Horn High School's Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program in Independence, Mo.

"It's very expensive to recruit," he added. "We don't have the flexibility we once had to get it wrong with one kid and hope the next one works out."

In February, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel unveiled plans to reduce the Army's active-duty troops from 520,000 to 490,000 by autumn 2015.

In December, Congress enacted defense funding limits as part of a general agreement to reduce government spending. Under the plan, the Army could shrink toward an active-duty force of about 440,000 over the next two years, its smallest since before World War II.

## Join The Navy?

Further shrinkage would be necessary if budget fights resume in coming years, Hagel and other military leaders said.

According to military officials, the Pentagon's budget plan spares only the Navy from force reductions next year.

The Air Force, Marine Corps and military Reserve and Guard units would shrink over the next several years. Those troop cuts are not expected to be as deep as in the Army, the largest recruiter of all.

What does this mean for young adults, ages 17 to 24, already facing 14 percent unemployment and soaring college costs?

"There'll be fewer opportunities in military service, as there have been in the overall economy," Byrd said. And fewer young veterans means less opportunity to have college costs covered by GI benefits.

The Army nationwide is on pace to hit its 2014 goal of signing up 57,000 recruits for active duty.

That's down from about 80,000 new recruits each year from 2005 through 2008. Only once, in 2005, did Army recruiters fail to hit their mark.

In those years, much of their recruiting success was owed to commanders granting exceptions for conduct and health issues that, in peacetime, would keep candidates out of the military. Only 86 percent of new recruits at the height of the war in Iraq had completed high school. Many with serious criminal convictions were allowed in.

## Tougher Hurdles For Recruits

Today, 99 percent of recruits have graduated from high school. The military branches expect higher scores in the ASVAB test, which quizzes candidates on tools and electrical circuitry as well as on language and math. Even a past minor criminal offense may prevent a potential recruit from joining.

"It's not that we have a zero-defect mentality, because we don't," said Nathan Christensen, a Navy officer in public affairs for the Defense Department. "But it is true that the quality of military recruits right now is the highest it's been in 40 years."

Many potential recruits don't know that. They're out of luck when they show up at Hoard's recruiting office with drug charges in their background, without a high school diploma or GED, or without being as physically fit as the Army requires.

"Five years ago, if a kid had gotten caught with a (marijuana) joint in his car, that person would be pretty much a shoo-in" to enlist under an exception, Hoard said. Now, recruiters are not authorized to let them in.

Societal trends aren't helping. A 2009 study by educators and retired military leaders estimated that 75 percent of Americans ages 17 to 24 were ineligible to enlist. This finding comes as the slumping economy makes more young people look to military service for work.

[Weight alone disqualified 27 percent](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity); many others were ruled out by problems ranging from juvenile crime to unfinished schooling to massive credit card debt, the report said.

A leaner, pickier military affects the broader economy. Young adults who don't land meaningful work by age 22 or are unable to tap military benefits for college tuition are likely to earn less money for at least a decade into their future, studies have found.

"They call it 'scarring,'" said economist Sarah Ayres of the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Center for American Progress. "It's not just a right-now problem. It's a problem that lingers years down the road."
