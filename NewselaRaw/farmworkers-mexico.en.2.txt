SAN QUINTIN, Mexico â€” Veronica Zaragoza has seen everything in this fertile agricultural region change, except her wages.

She has watched as new greenhouses were built and irrigation lines spread to water the fields. She saw produce packing plants expanded, and fruits and vegetables piled onto larger and larger trucks.

 Zaragoza, who grew up picking berries and tomatoes, said she still earns only 110 pesos per day, about $8. Her pay is just a little more than when she started picking as a 13-year-old.

Zaragoza, now 26, joined thousands of pickers this week to protest low wages. It was the first strike by farmworkers here in years.

## Blocking The Highway

Pickers left the fields and stood shoulder to shoulder blocking the main highway. They halted traffic for hours and almost stopped the harvest at the height of the growing season.

Hundreds of police and army soldiers cleared away the crowds with rubber bullets and tear gas, a chemical that is used to stop protests. More than 200 people have been arrested.

Zaragoza, a mother of three, was held in a field surrounded by police for 17 hours before being released. By Thursday morning, she was back protesting.

"We haven't done anything wrong," she said. "We just want better lives."

The strike, which began Tuesday, has shut down schools and stores across the region. It has focused attention on low wages and other problems at agribusinesses, large farms that export millions of tons of produce to the United States every year. Among the companies targeted is BerryMex. It grows strawberries and raspberries sold in the United States under the Driscoll brand name.

## Better Pay And Health Care

Farmworkers are seeking higher salaries and health care. They also want extra pay when they work overtime.

Farmworker leaders and government and company officials met Thursday but made little progress in reaching a solution.

The land around San Quintin grows much of the produce that Mexico exports. Tens of thousands of people pick fruit there. Most of them are indigenous people, or native Mexicans. They were originally from southern Mexico, but have been around San Quintin for decades now.

Some of the region's biggest growers have connections to local government leaders and have served in the state government. Their defenders say that the wages they offer are higher than in other Mexican farming regions.

In a statement, BerryMex said it has been committed to "fairness, honesty and respect for all employees."

"Our primary focus continues to be toward the well-being of our employees," it said. "We are working with local authorities to ensure the safety of our workers and the local community."

## No Running Water

But produce picker Bernardo Velasco, 47, said his family lives in harsh conditions. His neighborhood has only dirt streets, and no running water. He said he buys five jugs of water every week so his family can drink and bathe. Velasco said he can't feed and house his family on the $50 he earns per week.

"We've been here for years working and working for the same wage. We've had enough," Velasco said.

The protests started peacefully, but turned ugly as some people began taking over government buildings and a police station. At least one store was looted.

Protesters threw rocks and police fired back with tear gas and rubber bullets. Zaragoza said she saw protesters thrown to the ground and hit by police.

Like others, she said police were arresting everyone on the streets, even peaceful protesters such as her. On Thursday afternoon, dozens of police officers kept watch on hundreds of people gathered outside a state government building. They were waiting for news of their arrested relatives and how the talks were going.

## "We Need Our Own Union"

Alberto Munoz, a lawyer representing the growers, said it would be difficult to change working conditions for the farmworkers. Contracts already exist between the growers and the unions that represent the farmworkers.

In Mexico, many farmworkers are part of large unions. But the unions represent may different workers in many different businesses, not just the produce pickers. The union leaders are also often seen as more on the side of business owners than on the side of the farmworkers.

Fidel Sanchez is a spokesman for the groups representing indigenous farmworkers. He hoped that an agreement would let them go around union bosses and let the pickers deal directly with their employers.

"We need our own union," Sanchez said.
