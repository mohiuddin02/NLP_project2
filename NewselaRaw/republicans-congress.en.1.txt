WASHINGTON — Republicans took control of the Senate on Tuesday, riding on the discontentment of voters who are disappointed with Democratic President Barack Obama. The party now holds majority power in both the Senate and the House for the final two years of his presidency.

Republicans won Democratic-held Senate seats in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia, giving them majority control of the Senate for the first time since January 2007.

They also held onto their majority control of the House of Representatives and looked to add as many as a dozen seats. The increase in Republicans in the House would give the party the most control they have had since 1949.

## Voter Dissatisfaction

The results vividly demonstrated how frustrated voters are with the current government, particularly Obama. They also illustrated the huge amount of voters who believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction.

Democratic efforts to upset the Republican takeover with wins of their own failed.

In Kentucky, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell easily beat Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. The Democrats had hopes for a Republican seat in Georgia, but Michelle Nunn failed to defeat Republican businessman David Perdue. In Kansas, Democrats appeared to be counting on Greg Orman, who ran neither as a Democrat nor a Republican, against Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican. Vice President Joe Biden earlier Tuesday called Orman "an independent who will be with us in the state of Kansas." It wasn't enough to unseat Roberts.

Democrats did keep their control of New Hampshire, where Senator Jeanne Shaheen turned back a strong challenge from former Senator Scott Brown. For now, the Republicans have also not won in Louisiana. Because no one got a majority, Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu will face Republican Representative Bill Cassidy in a runoff next month.

## "We Can Do Better"

Still, the night belonged to the Republican Party, thanks to a favorable electoral map and a president that many Americans are unhappy with. McConnell, speaking to supporters, was both defiant and conciliatory.

"Tonight, Kentuckians said we can do better as a nation," McConnell said in his victory speech in Louisville. "Tonight, they said we can have real change in Washington. Real change, and that's just what I intend to deliver."

Democrats were defending 21 Senate seats to the Republicans' 15. Seven of the Democratic seats were in states that voted for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 against Obama. The states included Arkansas, Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia.

"This is probably the worst possible group of states for Democrats since Dwight Eisenhower," Obama said Tuesday on WNPR in Connecticut.

In the election for the House, two Democratic representatives lost their seats to Republicans: Representative Nick Rahall of West Virginia and Representative Joe Garcia of Florida. Rahall, a Democrat, was first elected to the House in 1976 and has faced challenges as West Virginia has become increasingly Republican.

## A Look At Key Senate Races

— In Georgia, Republican David Perdue was chosen to represent his party because he was seen as an outsider who would shake up Washington. Democrats had at least hoped no one would get a majority and the race would require a runoff. Instead, Perdue won.

— In Kentucky, McConnell easily defeated Grimes. Democrats once had big hopes of gaining a seat in the state, but McConnell slammed Grimes as a supporter of Obama policies, which are not popular in the state.

— In West Virginia, Republican Representative Shelley Moore Capito won the election as the state's first woman senator, defeating Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant in a race that was never considered close.

— In North Carolina, Democratic Senator Kay Hagan lost to Republican Thom Tillis. The race was nasty and expensive with the campaigns running more than 100,000 ads, according to The Charlotte Observer.

— In New Hampshire, Republican Scott Brown lost to the Democratic candidate. After losing his Senate seat in Massachusetts back in 2012, he moved to New Hampshire. Voters called him a "carpetbagger," to mock him for moving.

— In Arkansas, Democrat Mark Pryor lost after being hammered for supporting Obama on nine of 10 key votes last year.

— In Kansas, the streak continues. No Republican has lost a Kansas Senate campaign since 1932, and though Roberts was seen as out of touch with the state, he was able to overcome that.

— In Iowa, Republican Joni Ernst, a state senator, came into the spotlight earlier this year with her down-to-earth pitch as a mother, soldier and independent. She defeated Bruce Braley to take the seat being left by retiring Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat.

— In Montana, Republican Representative Steve Daines won the Senate seat easily.

— In Alaska, Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, is behind in polls but has a ground game that's a proven success. His race with Republican Dan Sullivan is likely to be close and perhaps not decided for days.
