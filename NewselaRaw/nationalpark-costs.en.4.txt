WASHINGTON â€” Some of our national parks need repairs. Fixing them up will cost a lot of money.

Yosemite National Park is one of America's most famous and beautiful parks. It is located in California. Millions of people visit the park each year. There are many things at Yosemite that need to be repaired.

Because Yosemite is a national park, money to fix it up comes from the government. Right now, lawmakers are talking about what to spend money on, and how much to spend.

## Billions Of Dollars!

Other parks need repairs, too. One is Sequoia National Park. It is to the south of Yosemite. It is home to some of the tallest trees on Earth. Another is Lassen Volcanic National Park, to the north of Yosemite.

All together, it would cost $11.5 billion to repair America's national parks. Written out, that's $11,500,000,000.

Jonathan B. Jarvis is in charge of the National Parks Service. He spoke to a group of lawmakers. He told them about the need to fix up America's national parks.

Jarvis argued that it was up to the government to repair national parks. He admitted that it would be expensive.

## Are New Parks So Important?

The National Parks Service does not just want to fix up national parks. It also wants to make new parks. That would also cost money. It would need to buy more land.

President Barack Obama suggested that some money go to repairs and some money go to new parks. Not everyone agrees, though. Some lawmakers do not think it is worth it to have new parks.

Jarvis was asked a difficult question. Which was more important: fixing parks, or buying land for new ones? He said that if he could only do one, he would choose to fix the parks that need repairs. However, he said making new parks is important as well.

Tom McClintock is a lawmaker from California. He represents the part of California where Yosemite is. He does not think the government should pay for new parks. He does not think adding new parks makes sense when the old parks can be fixed.

McClintock had a different idea. Instead of making more parks, he suggested adding new activities to old parks. For example, the government could spend money to have bicycling, horseback riding and ice skating at national parks.
