TUCSON, Ariz. â€” Lizbeth Mateo took a big risk when she left California and flew to Mexico. She and eight other immigrants went to the U.S. border and asked to be allowed back in legally. Immigration officials held them for two weeks in a jail-like center. On Wednesday they were freed.

Mateo was brought to the U.S. as a young child and has spent most of her 29 years in Los Angeles. She is set to begin law school on Monday. She wasn't sure she would make it after she crossed into Mexico. Now she's even more determined to succeed. "I am absolutely ready to go to law school," Mateo said.

Immigration officials had released her from Eloy Detention Center in Arizona moments earlier. They also released the others, who are known as the "Dream 9." The protesters get to return to their American communities until they can argue their case in court.

They take their name from the Dream Act, which would provide a path for immigrants like them who were brought to the United States illegally as children to live in the country legally.

## Wearing Caps And Gowns

The nine were transported by bus about 60 miles south to Tucson. Immigrant rights supporters and news crews were waiting for them.

"You're here!" someone shouted. Some of the Dream 9 and their supporters cried. The five women came off the bus first. They wore graduation caps and gowns. They were also wearing them when they were arrested last month while trying to cross from Mexico back into the United States. Next came the four men. They wore street clothes.

It could take several years before any of them get their day in court, said the group's lawyer, Margo Cowan. They hope there will be changes in immigration law before then, she added. Immigration law deals with people who were not born in the United States who are trying to live here.

The Dream 9 staged a daring protest to draw attention to the more than 1 million people deported under the Obama administration. When they tried to re-enter the United States on July 22, they were arrested. They had been in held by the government ever since.

## "These Are Their Homes"

Mateo said she spoke to several people like her in the detention center, which is like a jail.

"I want the government to recognize that there is a group of people, Dreamers, who grew up in this country and belong here because these are their homes," Mateo said. "They shouldn't have to go through what we went through. They should come home."

Officials decided this week that all nine had a reasonable fear of persecution or torture in their birth country, Mexico. The decision meant they could not be immediately deported.

Now their cases go to an immigration judge. The odds may be against them. Experts say 98 percent of Mexican asylum cases are denied. People seek asylum when they are afraid of being hurt in the country where they were born.

Mateo and two others voluntarily crossed into Mexico before trying to re-enter the United States as an act of protest. The other six were attempting to return after leaving for Mexico more than a year ago for various reasons.

## Relieved To Be Free

Maria Peniche, 22, left a year ago to live in Mexico City. She came to the U.S. legally when she was 10, she said, and overstayed her visa. In Boston, Peniche said, she worked three jobs to pay for college and grew frustrated that there was no immigration relief in sight.

She left three days before the Obama administration announced a program that allows people who were brought into the country illegally as children to stay in the United States, at least for two years.

Life in Mexico was difficult, Peniche said; she was targeted because she'd lived so long in the U.S. She was relieved to be free, and grateful to be back in the U.S. "It's amazing. I feel like I have so much freedom here. I can be myself and not be afraid," she said.
