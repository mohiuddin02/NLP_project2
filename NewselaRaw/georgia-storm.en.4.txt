ATLANTA â€” A snowstorm this week in Atlanta brought the city to a complete stop. People were stuck overnight at school, in their cars on jammed roads, and at work.

State and school officials were blamed for the disaster. But the officials said it was not their fault. They said they were following lessons learned from the last big snow.

The problem was that storm wasn't this storm.

After the snowstorm of 2011, officials wrote an 11-page disaster plan. They built up new salt piles and bought new equipment. With Tuesday's snowstorm, the problem was not too few snowplows and salt trucks.

Instead, the problem was too many people.

## No Warnings To Stay Home

There was a big difference between that storm and this one. The 2011 snowstorm hit on a Sunday night. People woke up the next morning to discover they were snowed in.

This one hit in the middle of the day on Tuesday. It left thousands of people stuck at work and at school. It caused enormous traffic jams when people tried to drive home. There was only one way to prevent the mess. That would have been to warm people ahead of time to just stay home.

But no one did that. The 2011 plan never told officials when to warn the public.

Steven Picou is a professor at the University of South Alabama. He studies how people respond to disasters. The problems in this one was caused by bad decisions, he said.

After the storm, officials from Governor Nathan Deal on down said they learned new lessons. They also promised to act differently next time around. But no one admitted to making any mistakes.

Instead, they blamed the National Weather Service (NWS). They claimed it did not give them clear information.

The NWS rejected that claim. It pointed out that it had issued a winter storm warning for Atlanta at 3:38 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) Tuesday.

Keith Stellman is in charge of the NWS office for Atlanta. As the weather service got new information, it changed some of its predictions, he said. But it was right about when and where the snow would fall. "That's a fact. That's an absolute fact," Stellman said.

Mike Smith is another meteorologist. He also denied that meteorologists were responsible for the chaos. The problems could have been seen ahead of time, Smith said.

## Better Luck Next Time?

Charley English directs the Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA). He said the state followed the 2011 plan and did everything it was supposed to do.

Earlier and stronger warnings would not have made a difference, English said. He said he would make the same decisions again.

GEMA's website never told drivers what to do when the snow got worse. A link about "winter weather" led to information about keeping houses warm.

"Yes, I would have acted sooner," Deal said. But, he did not want to tell people to stay home unless it was really necessary. "Because if we'd been wrong, you all would have been in here saying, 'Do you know how many millions of dollars you've cost ... the city of Atlanta?'"

Some local officials also struggled with the storm response.

Gwinnett County Chairwoman Charlotte Nash defended the state's response. She said it did as well as it could under difficult conditions. Nash said it took her three hours to get home in the snow from downtown Atlanta on Tuesday.

But others saw big room for improvement. They said people should have been warned sooner.

"For all of us, that's a lesson learned," Fulton County Transportation Director David Ricks said.

 "This was man-made," said Kay Love, an administrator for Roswell, which is near Atlanta. Love thought there should be a way to communicate information better when a storm is coming.

About 3,500 students spent the night at their schools because buses could not get them safely home.
