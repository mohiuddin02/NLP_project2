THEODORE ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK, N.D. — Valerie Naylor stands and admires her national park: She looks out over rocky hills, rustling trees, and the twisty, serpentine Little Missouri River shimmering below.

Most people feel totally calm here at Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota. But Naylor, the park superintendent, is worried.

"So much of what you're looking at is outside the park, and it's so vulnerable," she said.

The park was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, who hunted buffalo in the area as a young man from New York, and later lived there as a rancher.

Nayor asks herself how can she protect the park from oil drilling that's going on all around it. She is on a mission to preserve the park's natural sounds, fresh air and breathtaking views. She's fighting against a huge industry — large oil and gas companies.

## Oil Wells, Roads And Pipelines

Today, North Dakota has more than 11,000 active oil wells. The state estimates 60,000 more could be built, with drilling continuing for at least 20 years.

There's a lot of oil in the ground, and it has created an oil boom — many companies in the state are making a lot of money drilling oil and a lot of people are getting rich. Oil companies in North Dakota are now pumping a million barrels of oil a day.

Almost every week, it seems there is a new project planned near the 70,000-acre park, Naylor said. One week it's a cell tower. Another it's a saltwater disposal well. "If you don't keep your eye on everything, you could easily miss something that could have a massive impact on the park," she said.

She estimates that she and her staff have tried to get changes on more than 20 development plans since the boom began, often through polite but firm letters, words from park supporters and follow-up phone calls.

"There's so many things going on so quickly. It might be a pipeline, power line, oil well, or new road … any number of things," Naylor said.

## Months Of Negotiating

Driving her SUV up a scenic road, Naylor points to a fence that marks the boundary of the park. She explains that a few years ago, a company wanted to build an oil pump, storage tanks and other infrastructure right along the fence.

Naylor wrote a letter to the company, asking it to change the project. Eventually, after months of paperwork and negotiating, the company agreed to move the project 2 miles away.

Oil companies are more flexible now thanks to new drilling techniques such as horizontal drilling. Using horizontal drilling, companies can move oil pumps, but still access the underground oil.

The oil industry always tries to keep an open dialogue with neighbors, a spokesman said.

One oil company announced it was canceling plans for a new oil well near the park's border, saying it wanted to preserve the natural beauty of North Dakota public lands.

## The Scent Of Sagebrush

The park is a special place for Naylor, who has spent much of her life here. She values the wildlife, the scenery, the history.

Naylor first fell in love with the park more than 40 years ago, when she visited with her parents as a teenager from Oregon. She came back to the park, spending years volunteering, doing research, and working as a park ranger.

She became the park's superintendent 11 years ago.

Naylor and others want to protect not only scenic natural views, but also the park's solitude. They want the sound of blowing wind and singing birds, not the hum of traffic. The scent of sagebrush, not the stink of chemicals. The darkness of the night sky, not the glow of gas flares.

## "To Always Protect It"

Deb Hornfeldt and Debbie Virnig stopped at the park during a road trip across the Western United States. They visit the national parks to find serenity — peace and quiet. Hornfeldt, a retired teacher, said spending time in nature helps her relax and feel less stressed.

More oil drilling and traffic would ruin the beauty, she said.

"Natural spaces are getting smaller and smaller," Virnig added, speaking in sign language.

The oil boom has brought traffic, dust, noise and construction to North Dakota. Oil company workers now visit the national park to get away from it all.

Preserving a wild area is more important than ever, Naylor said.

"I love this park," Naylor said. "I will continue to always protect it."
