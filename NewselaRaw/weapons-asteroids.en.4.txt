WASHINGTON â€” In May 1995, physicist H. Jay Melosh attended an unusual meeting. U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons designers were there. To his surprise, the former enemies were eager to work together. They spoke of a possible danger: asteroids that might someday be headed straight for Earth.

Edward Teller, the inventor of the hydrogen bomb, was the first to talk. He asked the others to think about building huge, new nuclear weapons. These would be used to protect the planet from asteroids. They would blow them up before they reached Earth. Several of the top Russian experts then spoke up. They thought this was a good idea.

Melosh found it all very strange. Here were scientists agreeing to build "the biggest bombs ever." Bombs, of course, can be very dangerous.

Since then he has been speaking out against the idea. He says there are other, safer ways to prevent asteroids from hitting earth.

## Weapons Experts Target Asteroids

But NASA still thinks nuclear weapons can be used against asteroids. Every year it spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to study the idea.

Weapons experts also are looking at asteroids. They say the danger from asteroids is a reason to build new nuclear bombs.

To some, the idea seems like a bad movie. It's like something out of the 1998 Bruce Willis action film "Armageddon." In that movie, a team lands on an asteroid headed for earth. It plants a nuclear warhead on it and blows the rock into halves. Those huge pieces just narrowly miss Earth.

Some experts worry about radioactive debris. Such bits and pieces would be sent flying after an asteroid exploded. They could cause terrible damage on Earth, experts say.

## Bombing Asteroids "The Only Way To Go"

But the bomb idea has strong supporters. Bong Wie heads the Asteroid Deflection Research Center. He said he is designing a "hypervelocity nuclear interceptor system." Basically, that's a nuclear missile with a battering ram attached.

He said the battering ram would separate from the bomb before the bomb hit. It would gouge a crater into the asteroid. Then, the bomb would crash into the crater. It would blast the asteroid to bits.

The biggest U.S. supporter of the bomb idea is probably David S.P. Dearborn. He is both a physicist and a weapons designer.

Nuclear weapons could be used in two ways, he said. If an asteroid was still far away, a nuclear blast could knock it off course. If time was shorter, defenders would try to blow up the asteroid.

You would break it up "with enough force so that the pieces spread out," he said. That way, they mostly miss the Earth. Small bits of rock would burn up in the atmosphere.

There would be no need to build new weapons, he said. But you probably would need a weapon with a blast equal to 1 million tons of TNT. That is roughly the power of the largest bomb the U.S. has.

Physicist Mark Boslough thinks bombs are the only way to go if time is short.

## Other Options To Stop Asteroids

Melosh disagrees. Ninety percent of big asteroids are very far away, he says. So there is time to come up with non-nuclear plans. These include hitting asteroids with battering rams or zapping them with lasers.

Melosh has tested one of his ideas. In 2005 he served on a NASA mission known as Deep Impact. The mission launched an 820-pound battering ram into space. The ram gouged a crater out of the comet Tempel 1.

To work at all, he said, bombs would need to be more powerful than any ever built. A lot more people, he warned, have been killed by nuclear weapons than by asteroids.
