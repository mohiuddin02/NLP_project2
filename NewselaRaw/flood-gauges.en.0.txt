WASHINGTON â€“Spring is off to a soggy and sometimes deadly start in the Midwest, where floodwaters have driven thousands of people from their homes and killed at least four.

But forecasters say the death toll could have been even higher, if they could not quickly track the rise of the rain-swollen Mississippi, Illinois and other rivers that  spilled over their banks.

A network of gauges provides that information to officials in states that are prone to flooding. The gauges record the rise and fall of waters across the United States. But that 8,000-gauge network, called the National Streamflow Information Program, may shrink due to paralysis in Congress.

As many as 375 gauges could shut down in the coming months, according to the U.S. Geological Research Survey (USGS), the agency that oversees the program. That is unless Congress passes a budget to undo major spending cuts known as sequestration.

Shutting off the gauges would add stress to a system that is already shrinking due to cutbacks at state and local governments, which partner with federal agencies to fund it.

As [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) increases the likelihood of extreme droughts and floods, experts say shutting off the stations, which can each cost about $15,500 annually to maintain, could have devastating consequences.

## Delayed Flood Warnings

The USGS says 145 stations have recently been discontinued, with much of Florida hit the hardest. Meanwhile, 508 stations are considered "endangered," which means their funding has not been renewed. Many of those are concentrated in the Northeast. Another 29 are "threatened," meaning the agency does not expect to find future funding. Those numbers do not count gauges affected by sequestration.

The cutbacks threaten to delay flood warnings and hurt the work of those who use the data for a host of other activities: mapping flood plains, studying water quality, allocating water and constructing dams or bridges.

"All of these gauges -- in one way or another  -- are used for the (protection) of life and property," said Michael Norris, the network's coordinator. "They're used for so many things, and the public doesn't even know what they are."

## Water Fight

The need for data was brought up Tuesday at the U.S. Supreme Court, where Texas and Oklahoma are sparring over water in the Red River Basin. Attorney Lisa Blatt, representing Oklahoma, said the lack of stream-flow gauges in the basin makes it nearly impossible to tell how much water each state is drawing, and whether they are sticking to a four-state agreement.

When it comes to flooding, emergency officials say the data can be a life-or-death matter. Floods prompt about 75 percent of all presidential disaster declarations, and in recent years, they have damaged billions of dollars' worth of property. The human toll can be especially great in the case of flash floods, quick overflows caused by sudden heavy rains. It was that type of flood that killed at least 26 people in May 2010 in Tennessee and Kentucky.

## "Absolutely Critical"

Warnings can help save lives and money, studies by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Service (NOAA) have found. Just one hour of advanced notice can reduce damage by 10 percent, and longer-term flood preparation, such as building levees and putting down sandbags, can save an estimated $163 million nationally each year.

"Data was absolutely critical" earlier this month when the Grand River's surge forced 1,700 people to flee their homes in Kent County, Michigan, said Mark Walton, manager of the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Grand Rapids. "Without it, we would have basically been flying blind," he said, using a phrase several forecasters and water experts have repeated.

Though homes and businesses faced serious damage, no one has been reported hurt or injured. Streamflow gauges played a large role in that success story, Walton said, particularly in Grand Rapids, where the river crested at a record height.

"If we would have had gauges go down there," he said, " ... that would have been catastrophic." Last year, Michigan was at risk of losing several gauges, including those near cities with sizable populations. But the USGS was able to scrape together enough local support to keep them running -- for now, at least.

## Last-Minute Reprieve

New York recently faced the threat of dozens of shutdowns, including many gauges in the Susquehanna River Basin, one area in the country most vulnerable to floods. But after a strong push from Democratic Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, NOAA last month set aside $215,000 in disaster relief to keep some of them running.

Susan Obleski, of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, said she was glad the funding came through, but it will only last four months. "For something that's as critical as stream gauges, that's not sustainable."

Norris, the network's coordinator, agrees. He said it needs program-wide funding, not a regional patchwork of last-minute efforts, because much of the nation's water system is interconnected. "The flows in New York are affected by what happens in Pennsylvania and Vermont," he said.

President Barack Obama has proposed to increase the program's budget about 25 percent. Though the proposed budget has a slim -- if any -- chance to wriggle through Congress, Norris takes it as a sign that politicians, even those trying to pinch pennies, see the value of the gauges.

"It's a no-brainer," he said. "Like motherhood and apple pie."
