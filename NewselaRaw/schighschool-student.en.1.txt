A student sends a text during class, plays a video game on an iPad or mouths off — and gets a warning from the teacher.

Then what?

At Spring Valley High School in Columbia, South Carolina, a similar scenario ended differently Monday when a white sheriff's deputy was summoned after an African-American student refused to leave the class. The deputy yanked the student from her desk and threw her across the floor, events which were captured on students' cellphone videos.

The officer, Richland County Senior Deputy Ben Fields, was fired from his job on Wednesday.

The FBI launched a civil rights investigation and is looking into whether Fields broke any laws during the scuffle.

But the encounter also has many questioning why a police officer was needed.

## No Room For Flexibility

Since the 1990s, educators and parents have demanded "zero tolerance" policies in response to school shootings, drugs and gang violence. Under zero tolerance, breaking the rules always results in punishment.

Creating safe schools has become a mantra for elected school boards. One result has been the deployment of an estimated 14,000 officers on campuses across the country.

In many districts, common discipline problems that were once the responsibility of teachers and school administrators are being handed off to armed law enforcement officers. And problems that once ended in detention may now leave students with criminal records — a phenomenon that critics say disproportionately affects African-American students.

The girl in the incident faces a criminal charge under South Carolina's "disturbing school" law.

## Officers Now Policing Dress Codes, Disruptions

"What we find is school safety becomes conflated with school discipline," said Janel George. She is an education policy lawyer with the Legal Defense and Educational Fund of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Officers now are dealing with classroom disruptions, dress code violations and minor discipline problems that in the past would have been handled by teachers, she said.

In recent years, advocates have criticized the "school-to-prison" pipeline created by the rise of no-tolerance policies at schools.

In the 2011-2012 school year, black students represented about 16 percent of the student population. But they made up 27 percent of all students referred to law enforcement, and 31 percent of school-related arrests, according to a federal report from the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.

## Direct Link Between School Tickets, Likelihood Of Jail

The statistics were so alarming that last year Los Angeles Unified School District police stopped giving tickets for fighting, petty theft and other minor offenses. Research shows that when police handle such matters, struggling students are more apt to drop out and get in more serious trouble with the law.

There are no national standards for training school police, according to Mo Canady. He is the executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, the name typically given to school police. When resource officers are well trained and work closely with school officials, arrests in schools go down rather than up, he said.

The Richland County Sheriff's Department says school resource officers have three roles: serve as deputies, provide a positive role model and counsel students with problems.

Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott has 86 deputies stationed at schools. But even Lott expressed discomfort with the idea of deputies getting involved in classroom discipline problems.

## Meaning Of Law Open To Interpretation

Lott said South Carolina's disturbing school law makes it a crime "to interfere with or to disturb in any way or in any place the students or teachers of any school or college in this state." It could apply to a broad range of behavior.

"I think sometimes our officers are put in uncomfortable positions when a teacher can't control a student," Lott said. "We don't need to arrest these students. We need to keep them in school."

Lott said his office will also look at when it is proper to call in a resource officer. But "that is something for the district to answer," he said. "Is it proper to call in a resource officer to discipline a student, or is that the job of the school?"

## Student Was Looking At Phone

At least three students who were in the classroom at Spring Valley High said the teacher tried to discipline the student for looking at her phone.

When the student refused to leave class, the teacher called in a vice principal. When the student refused the vice principal's request to leave, officials called in Fields, who also helps coach the school's football team.

In one video, the deputy can be seen telling the student sitting at her desk, "You either come with me, or I'm going to make you."

In a second video posted on Instagram, the student can be seen lifting her arm defensively as the deputy physically tries to remove her from her desk.

The deputy then wraps his arm around her neck from behind and tries to lift her by one of her legs. As the deputy struggles with the student, the desk flips backward onto the ground with the student still sitting in it, the video shows.

The deputy drags the student and throws her across the classroom, the two videos show.

Lott said there was a third video that showed the student hitting the deputy.

The girl was not injured, Lott said, and was released to her parents.

## Misbehavior Has Become A Police Matter

"This is a perfect example of how the school-to-prison pipeline plays out in everyday life," said Michael Harris. He is an attorney for the National Center for Youth Law, a nonprofit youth advocacy group. "A student does something that's minor, not that threatening, not putting anyone else in danger.

"Many schools over the last, I would say, two decades have shifted how they deal with student misbehavior," Harris said. "And that shift really involves having law enforcement be the major component in enforcing school rules."
