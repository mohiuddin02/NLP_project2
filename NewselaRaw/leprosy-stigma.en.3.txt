TAHIRPUR, India â€” Thirty years ago, Ashok Yadav was ignoring the pink skin that showed up in patches on his arm. Then pale sores started showing up on his body and he lost feeling in his fingertips. A doctor told him the terrible news: Yadav had leprosy.

Leprosy is a bacterial infection. It often lies quietly for years before attacking the body's nerves and slowly causing numbness. The disease doesn't kill anyone and it can spread from person to person, but it doesn't spread easily. Still, many people are afraid of the disease.

For Yadav, the fear caused him to leave his home. Now he lives in Kasturba Gram, a leper colony outside New Delhi. "I lost my job," he said. "My parents felt I would spoil my sisters' chances of getting married. My family felt it would be better if I left home."

Leprosy is a shameful disease in India. Because of this, people try to hide their leprosy from family members and loved ones. They are afraid they will be asked to leave like Yadav.

## Disease's Deformities Fuel Fear

Bosses regularly fire people who have the disease, even if they have been treated and cured. Even the leprosy-free children of lepers are shunned.

India has made great advances in treating leprosy and the number of people affected has gone down every year. But this year, the number of new cases has risen slightly. Doctors say the huge fear of leprosy is hurting efforts to finally stop the disease for good.

We face a thousand humiliations every day, said Neelawati Devi. She has lived in Kasturba Gram for a long time. About 10,000 people live there, including the children of leprosy patients.

But the deformed arms and legs that are the sign of leprosy add to the fear surrounding the disease. Hands and feet eventually become like claws. Serious wounds often go unnoticed because no pain is felt. People sometimes lose their fingers and toes.

The number of new leprosy cases in the world was around 10 million in 1991. But last year it was around 230,000. Countries increased their efforts to fight the disease. In India, hospitals began treating patients with a mix of medicines that essentially kills the germ that causes leprosy.

In 2005, India declared victory. But pockets of the country continue to have problems with leprosy.

## Stepping Up The Fight

In 2012, India detected 134,752 new cases of leprosy. That was slightly more than the 127,295 cases reported a year earlier. India accounts for more than half of newly diagnosed leprosy cases in the world.

C.M. Agarwal is a health ministry official. He is in charge of the country's leprosy program. Agarwal says the rise in cases is the result of a bigger push against leprosy. He says health workers are reporting cases that otherwise wouldn't have been noticed.

But some activists don't agree. They also say the problem might be worse than anyone realizes.

Leprosy can take "five years to 15 before the first signs become detectable. And by then, many others could become infected," said P.K. Gopal. He works with a group that helps leprosy patients.

The government is stepping up its fight against the disease. It is sending health workers to 209 districts seen as high areas of leprosy. But that won't end the pain and shame that leprosy brings to patients and their families.

## In Leprosy's Shadow

"Our children shouldn't have the shadow of leprosy hanging over their lives," said G. Venugopal as he sat outside his home. He is one of the older men at Kasturba Gram.

Venugopal wants the government to pay people with leprosy more. "They pay us a monthly allowance of 1,800 rupees ($29)," which is nothing, he said.

The money does not even pay for bandages. Leprosy patients use them every day on their sores, said Uttam Kumar.

Kumar lives in Kasturba Gram. Like many of the people there, Kumar was thrown out of his home. Neighbors didn't want to have a leprosy patient around. Kumar's bandaged feet are the only sign of his leprosy. He searched for months before finding a place to live in the one-room shabby apartments of Kasturba Gram.

At Kasturba Gram, we don't know each other, but we know we all suffer, Kumar said. "Everyone has their own sorrows, but our pain is the same."
