TOKYO, Japan — Chikara Yamanobe is about as far from a sumo wrestler as it's possible for a little Japanese kid to be. He's so skinny that his ribs stick out, and his eyes tear up when he gets pushed around roughly in the ring. He's also just 5 years old.

Still, Chikara, whose name means "power," wants to be a professional sumo wrestler when he grows up.

"I want to be like Endo," he said after training for almost three hours at a dojo in Tokyo, referring to the Japanese sumo star.

Chances are Chikara won't make it.

## A Particularly Tough Life

Japan's national sport, with its traditions and rituals from the Shinto religion and requirement for physical bulk, is in decline. Boys in this baseball-mad country have lost interest in a sport that is seldom shown on prime-time TV and offers little in the way of cool products to buy, like sumo toys or T-shirts or costumes.

In recent years, sumo has become dominated by foreigners. When the summer grand sumo tournament wrapped up this month, the winners were all from somewhere else. Terunofuji Haruo — a Mongolian born with the name of Gantulga Ganerdene — emerged victorious from a competition that featured two of his countrymen and a Bulgarian in the top rankings. Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, along with an Egyptian and a couple of Georgians, also have done well this year.

This is partly the result of a general trend away from rigid traditions in Japan, and also because the life of a professional sumo wrestler is particularly tough. Aspiring sumo wrestlers must leave school at 15. They live in training quarters, known as a "stable," where everything from their hairstyle to their diet is decided for them.

It also stems in part from a lack of access. The main sumo matches happen in the afternoon. They are shown on television while most kids are in school, and sumo arenas are filled largely with senior citizens and tourists.

Mike Wesemann, an American who runs the blog Sumo Talk, said that sumo is losing its fans. Plus, it's having a hard time competing with other sports. Sumo wrestlers wear a loincloth, a piece of cloth wrapped around their hips. There are no jerseys and hats kids can wear like in baseball and soccer, and they can't exactly practice with their dads.

"There's just nothing cool about it," Wesermann said.

## "To Expand The Player Base"

Sumo officials are all too aware of this.

"Sumo is not a familiar sport compared to others like soccer and baseball," said Kento Nakazawa of the Japan Sumo Association.

"There aren't many opportunities for kids to get to play sumo, so our aim is to provide an occasion," Nakazawa said. "We'll be happy if anyone, even one child, gets interested and starts to play."

Noboru Yoshimura, administrative chief of the Japanese Sumo Federation, said he was worried about sumo's declining popularity. Even though martial arts is now offered in junior high school, kids are not choosing sumo.

Yoshimura said the sumo federation now provides a three-day sumo training course for teachers to boost interest. "Sumo doesn't require much, there's no equipment necessary, and it's easier to start, so we are promoting sumo that way in order to expand the player base," he said.

Participation in the Wanpaku sumo tournament for children has dropped from 70,000 kids in 1994 to 33,000 in 2014.

## Having To Bulk Up

Still, at the dojo in Tokyo, boys exercised, wrestled with coaches and fetched Band-Aids for scratches and scrapes.

Boys — and they are almost always boys, as girls and women have not traditionally been allowed in the ring — generally practice sumo as a sport until high school. Then, if they want to continue, things become a lot more serious.

Toshiyo Abe sat on the tatami mats watching his 6-year-old son Shotaro wrestle older boys. Shotaro asked to start sumo a year ago, so now they travel an hour by train to the dojo every Saturday and Sunday.

"I'm a little envious that he is having so much fun," Abe said.

Some parents, however, balk at a key part of getting ahead in sumo: being heavy.

"Some high school clubs make you eat until you throw up, but some clubs just leave it to you to bulk up," said Akiteru Kiyomiya as he watched his two sons train. "If this is the path they want to take, then yes, I'll support them."

Yet the boys' mother, Yumi Kiyomiya, was not so sure. "I actually don't want them to get big," she said.

## The Next Yokozuna?

After the four-hour training session, coach Shinju Taira said he worried about the decline of sumo both as a sport and as a part of Japanese culture.

"It's not that everybody will get into the professional levels, but we're trying to raise future leaders, people who can be leaders in our society," he said.

Hisao Yoshiyoka, who had two sons on the mat at the dojo, said she was happy about her boys' experience.

She said they are learning how to survive in Japanese society, where everyone knows their position, and at the same time they're learning about Japanese traditions.

Her youngest son, Ryudai, 7, has already chosen his professional sumo wrestler name. Watch out in 2030 for a yokozuna, or grand champion, called Dairyu.
