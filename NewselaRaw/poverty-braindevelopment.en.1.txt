The gap between rich and poor is widening in the United States and more and more children are growing up in low-income households. A new study published this week in the scientific journal JAMA Pediatrics shows that poverty can harm children's brain development, making it extra hard for poor children to succeed in school.

## Harmful To Brain Development

It has long been known that growing up poor is linked to poorer performance in school. Recent research has also linked poverty to smaller brain surface area. The current study examines the relationship of school performance, brain development, and family income. It reveals that differences in brain development account for up to 20 percent of the difference in school performance between low- and high-income students.

In other words, scientists now have a partial answer to the question of why poverty makes it harder to succeed in school: it harms children's brain development.

Psychologist Seth Pollak at the University of Wisconsin–Madison carried out the study with a sample of 389 healthy children and adolescents from age 4 to 22. Some of the study subjects came from low-income households, while others came from middle- and high-income homes. The researchers wanted to understand the specific effects of low income on brain development, so they excluded children who had other factors known to negatively affect brain development.

## Less Gray Matter

The researchers examined the size of select areas of the children and adolescents' brains. To do so, they placed subjects in a machine called an MRI scanner, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of the body. Researchers were particularly interested in the parts of the brain that are essential to academic success, and whose development is affected by a person's environment as a child. Some of the individuals came back for reassessment after 24 months and returned for follow-ups over a period of up to six years.

Pollack and the other researchers then compared the brains of children who grew up poor with the brains of children who grew up in higher-income households. To define "poor," they used the federal poverty line, according to which a family of four making less than $24,250 is considered to be poor.

The researchers found that a low income affected the brain development of otherwise healthy kids. The brains of children who grew up in poor households had 8 to 10 percent less gray matter than the brains of other children. Gray matter is a kind of brain tissue.

## Humans Are "Hardy" — To A Point

The researchers did not find differences between children from middle class and wealthy families. Yet children living only 50 percent above the poverty line (an income of $36,375 for a family of four) showed gray matter volumes 3 percent to 4 percent below the norm. In other words, more money does not necessary mean better brain development, but not having enough money for basic needs has a negative impact.

Pollak explained how growing up poor can hurt brain development even though growing up rich doesn't necessarily improve development. "Humans are very hardy," he says. "I think the human child can learn to accommodate quite a wide variety of circumstances — what's happening in extreme poverty is that we're moving out of the range where the human brain can cope."

Pollak was hoping to see the gap closing as children grew older and spent more time in school and outside their homes, but the gap in brain development was still present at age 22.

## "An Important Study"

The researchers also looked at subjects performance in school. They found that poverty had a similar affect on academic success as it did on brain development. This finding suggests that one of the ways that poverty limits students' performance is by harming their brain development.

"This was an important study," says Joan Luby, a doctor at the Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Louis, Missouri, who was not part of this study. It went one step further than previous studies, she notes, and created a link between poverty and academic achievement. "It gives us a clear road map for future public health action."

## Poverty Is "A Toxin"

A recent report revealed that in 2013, 51 percent of students in U.S. public schools were from low-income families. Growing up poor exposes these children to a number of challenges, including unsafe neighborhoods, stressed parents, and less access to healthy food. It is difficult to pinpoint which of these factors harm brain development and school performance.

In future studies, Pollak and his group hope to identify how different social programs, such as free lunch programs, can help children who grow up poor. "I used to think about poverty as a question of social policy. Now I think of it as a biomedical problem," Pollak says. He now views poverty as a toxin that is making children less healthy.
