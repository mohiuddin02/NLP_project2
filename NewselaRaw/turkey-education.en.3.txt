ANKARA, Turkey â€” Ahmet Guvener wanted to get his daughter out of the religious classes required in her school. But all the choices the school offered her were also classes about the Islamic religion. She had to choose one, or fail the year.

Guvener and his family are Christian. He is a pastor who leads the Protestant Church in the city of Diyarbakir. He accused the school of forcing religion on the students.

The school denies it is trying to force the students. Guvener said the school told him there was no demand for any other electives except religious classes. He could not believe that not one of the 900 students had asked for math or English. After he spoke out, the school offered his daughter an astronomy class.

Many parents, teachers and students in Turkey are upset about teaching religion in the schools. Thousands of people in Turkey have protested in the streets recently. They demanded that the government stop trying to impose Muslim religious ideas in the schools.

Turkey is a country between Europe and the Middle East. A majority of the country is Muslim and follows the Islamic religion. But the government has followed secular ideals, that is, non-religious laws.

The country's first president tried to make the country more secular. Schools banned Islamic headscarves. Traditional Islamic women wear the scarves to cover their heads.

## Turkey's New Government

The new government now allows headscarves in schools. The government said it wanted to give students freedom. But at the same time, it banned tattoos and dyed hair in schools.

The current President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is taking a new path. Opponents of the president say he is building an Islamic school system. They point out he has said he wants to raise "pious generations." That is, he wants the Turkish people to be more religious.

Protests against President's Erodogan's new rules have broken out in cities around Turkey. Thousands marched to support secular education. Hundreds of students and teachers stayed home from school to protest.

Protesters asked the government to stop trying to force the Sunni religion on the students. Sunni is a sect, or a group, in the Islamic religion. The majority of Turks follow Sunni teachings.

Protesters also demanded respect for Alevi Shiite students. The Alevi Shiite is another sect in the Islamic religion that doesn't have as many followers as Sunni.

Police broke up a protest in Izmir, the third-largest city in Turkey. Reports said at least 10 people were arrested for organizing the school absences.

## More Religious Education

Turkey's national education advisory council has recommended more religious classes, and that classes start at younger ages. This could be a hint at what the future will hold.

President Erdogan supports adding Ottoman language classes at high schools. Ottoman is an older version of Turkish. It was abandoned when the country tried to become more Western.

Some people are bothered by their children leaning Ottoman, President Erdogan declared. "Whether they want it or not, Ottoman will be learned and be taught," he said.

Educators who support the government say Turkey is going back to its traditions. Education in Turkey was going against the people's own culture and civilization, said Ali Yalcin. He is the deputy head of a teachers group which proposed many of the changes.

Yalcin denies schools are trying to force religion on the students. What they are trying to do is offer religious education. It's what the people want, he said.

## The Problems In Schools

Critics say the government is focused on religion, but it ignores the problems in the schools. A report said Turkish students did poorly in reading, mathematics and science. Turkey ranked 44th out of 65 countries in those subjects.

The real problems in schools are being brushed aside, said Sakine Esen Yilmaz. He is a leader of the Education and Science Laborer's Union, a group that does not like religion in schools.

Yilmaz said teachers have classes with 50 to 60 students. Schools have no labs, libraries or sports facilities, he said.

Other people believe religious classes will not make a difference. Abbas Guclu is an education expert. He does not believe religious classes will make students more religious. Young people spend more time watching TV or using the computer, he said.

"It's not possible to control the youth of today," he said.
