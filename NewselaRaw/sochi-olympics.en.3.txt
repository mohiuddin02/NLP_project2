LONDON — The Winter Olympics start in just three weeks. But there are hundreds of thousands of tickets left unsold.

It's surprising given the popularity of the Olympics. And, it's raising the prospect of empty seats and a lack of atmosphere at Russia's first Winter Olympics in Sochi, which runs from Feb. 7-23.

Many foreign fans are staying away. They are turned off by a number of reasons: fears about terrorism, expensive flights and hotels, and long travel distances. There's also not much else to do in Sochi, and it's a hassle to obtain visas and special passes needed to go to the games.

"Some people are scared it costs too much," International Olympic Committee member Gerhard Heiberg of Norway said. Others, he said, are worried about their safety. "From my country, I know that several people and companies are not going for these two reasons. Of course, there will be Norwegians there but not as many as we are used to."

## "Strong Last-Minute Ticket Sales"

Sochi organizers said that seven of every 10 tickets available have been sold.

Russian organizing committee chief Dmitry Chernyshenko said about 213,000 fans are expected to attend. About three-fourths of them are likely to be Russians.

"Tickets are being snapped up fast," the organizing committee said in statement. The most popular events are hockey, biathlon, figure skating, freestyle skiing and snowboarding. "We are expecting strong last-minute ticket sales," the committee said. They do not expect to have empty seats.

Sochi officials have refused to say how many tickets were put up for sale, but the figure will be released after the games.

However, according to IOC records, Sochi had a total of 1.1 million tickets on offer. That would mean about 300,000 tickets are left.

In the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, 1.54 million tickets were put up for sale. Almost all of them (1.49 million) were sold. The same was true for the 2012 Summer Games in London. Organizers sold 8.2 million of their 8.5 million tickets.

IOC member Heiberg also helped organize the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics in Norway. He said the Russians have cut down by half the number of viewers for the mountain events, for reasons of safety.

That means there will be fewer people and probably less excitement than in Lillehammer, he said. The Lillehammer games stood out for the colorful atmosphere, much of which was generated by the excitement of the Norwegian fans.

## Worries Over Security

Sochi's ticket sales began in February 2013, a year before the games. Tickets have been sold first-come, first-served on Sochi's official website. Ticket offices are now open in Moscow and Sochi.

The cheapest tickets go for 500 rubles ($15), and the most expensive are 40,000 rubles ($1,200). More than half of all tickets cost less than 5,000 rubles ($150). Tickets are expensive, since the average monthly salary in Russia is 30,000 rubles ($890).

Three dozen people lined up at the only ticket office in Sochi one afternoon. Many, however, complained that all the cheap tickets were already gone.

"Prices leave much to be desired, but what can you can do?" said Yana Ivolovskaya, who lives in Sochi. She bought two tickets for the bobsled event for 2,000 rubles ($60). "We're not going to get another Olympics in Sochi so I thought I should go."

Attracting foreign visitors has been a challenge, in particular because of worries over terrorism. Back-to-back bombings killed 34 people last month in Volgograd, which is only about 400 miles from Sochi. An Islamic group in Russia claimed responsibility, and threatened to strike the Sochi Games.

And flights to Sochi are expensive. Most travelers from around the world have to go through Moscow, with direct flights to Sochi only offered from Germany and Turkey. For Western travelers, getting permission to enter the country is time-consuming. They also have to obtain a special pass to watch the games, in addition to their tickets.

Jan Serenander helps run ticket seller Jet Set Sports in Norway. He mentioned another reason. "When Sochi was announced, no one had even heard of the place," Serenander said. People had to look on a map, he said.

Die-hard winter fans — like those from the Netherlands — will not be discouraged. You can't miss speedskating fans from the Netherlands at any Winter Games. They are all dressed in orange, their country's national color.

"I expect it to be orange," said Jeroen de Roever, the head of official Duch ticket seller ATPI. "We have been sold out for quite a while."
