WASHINGTON â€” The government shutdown means many people are not working at some important federal agencies. Their absence has made it harder to protect Americans' health and safety. Investigations into the cause of transportation and workplace accidents have been affected. So has the tracking of diseases that come from food.

An outbreak of salmonella in chicken is the latest example. People in 18 states have gotten sick from the bacteria.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) keeps track of diseases in food. It said Tuesday that it was bringing back some of its staff to deal with the salmonella outbreak. More than 270 people have gotten sick from chicken.

Many government agencies have had to shut down because Congress has not approved the money for their operation. The states have had to pick up much of the slack from federal workers who have been kept away from work.

## Salmonella, And Fatal Mine Accidents

Take the case of food safety. State labs are investigating illnesses from food. They are communicating with each other to figure out whether outbreaks have spread.

Dr. Christopher Braden heads the CDC division that investigates illnesses from food. He said bringing the staff back will let the agency keep a better eye on the salmonella outbreak. But the agency is monitoring more than 30 outbreaks. Gaps still exist as the shutdown begins its second week.

The staff will go through other cases, he said. They could find something that was missed earlier. "When that's the case, it's harder to start investigations later than earlier," Braden said.

The CDC isn't the only agency that's strained. The shutdown also affects the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The agency has stopped its regular mine safety inspections. It normally conducts those at each of the nation's underground mines every three months.

Three mine workers died in separate accidents on three consecutive days during the past week. The coal mining industry has not had three straight days of fatal accidents in more than 10 years. The nation's largest mine workers union has raised alarms.

"The government's watchdog isn't watching," union president Cecil Roberts said.

## Food Plants Not Being Inspected

Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board is only investigating some accidents because of its staffing cuts. Officials have to believe lives or property are in danger.

The Food and Drug Administration has stopped normal inspections of food plants. Food imports are still being inspected at borders. But any samples that need to be analyzed could be stalled. There aren't as many scientists to check them now.

The CDC has had to stop monitoring flu. That might not seem like a big deal. But the disease spreads. It kills about 24,000 Americans a year.

It is too early in the flu season for many people to be sick. So there is not a lot to test. But some state health departments have been testing samples that otherwise would have gone to the CDC, said Kelly Wroblewski. She works at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

The CDC also is slashing its staff at airports. When airline pilots become aware of a sick traveler, they summon CDC officers. The officers can keep people who might be a health threat from coming into the country.

Eighty percent of the airport officers have been dismissed. There's essentially only one person working at each station, said Dr. Martin Cetron of the CDC. That could increase the chance that some diseases could slip into the country at a time when measles is raging in Turkey.

## Websites Shut, Hard To Get Information

Many federal workers who protect safety and health are still working. Air traffic controllers, airport screeners and the majority of federal law enforcement are all on duty. People on active military duty are likewise working.

The USDA's agency responsible for investigating the poultry farm in California that is linked to the salmonella outbreak is also mostly staffed.

But the absence of other workers matters, said Caroline Smith DeWaal. She is director of food safety advocacy at the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest.

She pointed out that it was hard for the public to get information on any outbreaks because many websites have been shut down.

"These agencies are always running behind, and the idea that you can just shut them down is just foolish," said Smith DeWaal.
