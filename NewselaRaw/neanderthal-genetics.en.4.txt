Scientists say that people today are part Neanderthal. Neanderthals were a kind of early people. They lived 50,000 years ago. 

Neanderthals lived in what are now the continents of Europe and Asia. Continents are big pieces of land. There are only seven, and many countries share them. 

Scientists say that long ago, people walked out of the continent of Africa and into Asia. Then they walked to Europe. Along the way, they met Neanderthals. People had children with them. 

Today a little bit of DNA in people comes from both Neanderthals and people who lived long ago. Pieces of DNA are the building blocks of life. They tell the body how to grow and work. DNA is passed from parents to children. 

## Keeping Humans Healthy

Scientists say that Neanderthal DNA keeps people from getting sick. They also say that it causes allergies. People with allergies sometimes itch or sneeze. It happens because their bodies react to something. 

Not everyone with Neanderthal DNA has the same kind. There is more of the Neanderthal DNA that protects against getting sick. Lluis Quintana-Murci is a scientist in France. He says, "That's huge. It came as a big surprise to us."

Scientists noticed three special kinds of genes. Genes are blocks of DNA that give the body directions. The special genes keep the body from getting sick. Some people are born with them.

These genes can work before a person even knows that he or she is sick. Quintana-Murci says that this has helped people stay strong. Not everybody is born with the special genes. 

## Two Studies On Neanderthal DNA

Quintana-Murci wants to know what happens when sickness spreads. It has killed many people through history. He thinks the special genes must spread through only the strong. They have been passed on from parents to children for thousands of years.

Quintana-Murci looked at many special genes in people. He also looked at other kinds of genes. Quintana-Murci figured out that there was more Neanderthal DNA in the special genes. 

Janet Kelso is a scientist in Germany. She wants to find out what happened when people and Neanderthals had children long ago. Kelso wants to know how the Neanderthal DNA helped. She also wants to know how Neanderthal DNA works in people today.
