WASHINGTON — Researchers several years ago tested the widely accepted notion that skipping breakfast can make you fat.

Some nutritionists take this on faith. Indeed, it is written in the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, the federal government's advice book, which recommends having breakfast every day because "not eating breakfast has been associated with excess body weight."

As with many nutrition tips, though, the bit about skipping breakfast is based on scientific speculation, not certainty. Indeed, it might be completely unfounded, as the experiment at a New York hospital indicated.

At 8:30 in the morning for four weeks, one group of subjects got oatmeal, another got frosted corn flakes and a third got nothing. And the only group to lose weight was the group that skipped breakfast. Other experiments, too, have similarly contradicted the federal advice, showing that skipping breakfast led to lower weight or no change at all.

"In overweight individuals, skipping breakfast daily for 4 weeks leads to a reduction in body weight," the Columbia University researchers in New York concluded.

## Guesses Turn Into Rules

A closer look at the way government nutritionists adopted the breakfast warning shows how guesses — possibly right, possibly wrong — can become hard-and-fast rules.

This year, as the U.S. Dietary Guidelines are being updated, their trustworthiness has been questioned. An advisory committee called for dropping the longstanding warning about the dangers of cholesterol, which had long plagued the egg industry. Important studies contradicted the government warnings about the dangers of salt. Also, the government's longstanding condemnation of foods rich in saturated fats seems simplistic, according to critics, because scientists have a better understanding of the nutritional value of fatty foods.

The Dietary Guidelines are important because they influence school lunches. Also, amid widespread obesity, so many people look to them for sound eating advice.

The notion that skipping breakfast might cause weight gain entered the Dietary Guidelines in 2010.

In preparation for a new edition, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee collected research on skipping breakfast. Some of it suggested that breakfast skippers might be more likely to gain weight.

## Observational Studies Can Produce False Results

One of the key pieces of evidence, for example, examined the records for 20,000 male health professionals. Researchers showed that the men who ate breakfast were 13 percent less likely to gain a lot of weight.

"Our study suggests that the consumption of breakfast may modestly lower the risk of weight gain in middle-aged and older men," the researchers said.

The advisory committee cited this and similar research, known as "observational studies," in support of the notion that skipping breakfast might cause weight gain. In "observational studies," subjects are merely observed, not assigned randomly to "treatment" and "control" groups as in a traditional experiment.

Observational studies in nutrition are generally cheaper and easier to conduct. But they can suffer from weaknesses that cause false results.

## "Confounders" Can Confuse Researchers

One of the primary troubles in observational studies is what scientists refer to as "confounders." These are basically unaccounted factors that can lead researchers to make mistakes about causes. For example, suppose breakfast skippers have a personality trait that makes them more likely to gain weight than breakfast eaters. If that's the case, it might look as if skipping breakfast causes weight gain even though the cause is the personality trait.

In analyzing the results of observational studies, scientists try to adjust for the potential confounding factors that they can measure — age, alcohol consumption, exercise, employment, and the like. Breakfast skippers in the health professionals study, for example, tended to drink more, smoke more and exercise less. The scientists adjusted their numbers, but they are not exact, and the groups might be different in another way.

Relying on observational studies has drawn fierce criticism.

S. Stanley Young is the former director of bioinformatics at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. He has estimated that more than 90 percent of the claims in the medical field cannot be duplicated later by more precise experiments.

"Wow. Is this really science?" Young said during a talk at the Sigma Xi, the science research society. "Every observational study could be challenged."

## True Experiments Are The "Gold Standard"

Because of the weaknesses in observational studies, many scientists prefer true experiments. These are controlled trials, in which subjects are randomly assigned to one or more treatments, and one category of subjects receives no treatment at all. Scientists say these experiments provide the "gold standard" in evidence.

The 2010 Dietary Guidelines committee did mention one randomized, controlled trial on the question of breakfast. That experiment, conducted on children in Mexico, "found no relationship with breakfast alone" and weight gain, according to the committee.

But the committee looked beyond that trial and gave weight to several observational studies.

"Modest evidence suggests that children who do not eat breakfast are at increased risk of overweight and obesity," the advisory committee said. "The evidence is stronger for adolescents." As for adults, the evidence was not consistent.

It was hardly proof, but it was enough to get the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services to go along with it. The breakfast recommendation and the link to obesity became part of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines, under its advice for losing weight.
