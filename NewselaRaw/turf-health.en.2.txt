HACKENSACK, N.J. — Athletes who have played on turf fields may have one thing in common, no matter what team they're on. They are probably familiar with the tiny specks of black rubber that cover the field.

It's called crumb rubber. The pellets are shredded bits of used car and truck tires. The rubber can get stuck in carpets and car mats after practice on the field. Crumb rubber is used to cover synthetic, or fake, athletic fields. The rubber pieces fill in the space between blades of fake grass.

And now, some people are wondering how safe crumb rubber pieces are.

## Concerns About Safety

Most studies on crumb rubber have found that the pellets do not pose a health risk.  A number of organizations have researched turf fields.

But even with this evidence, some communities and school districts are still concerned about the safety of the fields. As towns consider installing synthetic turf fields, many people debate the pros and cons of crumb rubber.

A growing number of parents and athletes believe the rubber contains dangerous materials. They argue the chemicals inside the pellets can be swallowed, inhaled or absorbed.

Some studies have found toxins, such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride, at turf fields. However, researchers found such a small amount of the chemicals that the fields were deemed safe.

Turf companies say that there is nothing to worry about.

Darren Gill is a spokesman at a turf company called FieldTurf. He said the company is "certainly confident in the safety of the product, and we have absolutely no problem with more study being done." If the public looked at the science, he said, they would realize that the fields are safe.

## Crumb Rubber Is Cheap

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission have published studies in the past declaring the turf fields safe. But recently, the organizations seem to have changed their minds. The EPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission are both federal agencies.

On its website, the EPA refers to its study as "very limited." The agency said it is "not possible to extend the results beyond the four study sites" and that more data may need to be examined.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission put a large, red note on its website above the study. The banner told readers that the researchers only studied a small number of fields and that the results are limited.

The issue around crumb rubber fields has gained national attention. The material covers fields, parks and playgrounds where both kids and professional athletes play. MetLife Stadium, home to the Giants and Jets football teams, has a turf field.  There are approximately 11,000 synthetic turf athletic fields across the country. Of those, 98 percent — over 10,700 — use crumb rubber, according to the Synthetic Turf Council.

Turf fields are popular across the nation. They are weather-resistant, easier to maintain than grass and usable year-round. They last 10 to 15 years.

Crumb rubber is also cheaper than other materials used on athletic fields. It is considered a recycled material. Turf manufacturers advertise recycling as part of the benefits of their fields.

## "No Significant Environmental Threat"

Research on the rubber fields largely supports the turf companies' claims that the rubber is safe.

A major environmental group in New York conducted a study on crumb rubber. It found that crumb rubber fields pose "no significant environmental threat to air or water quality." It also said crumb rubber does not affect a person's health in any significant way. Artificial turf might have another benefit: greater safety than grass fields. Studies conducted by two universities found that high school athletes reported fewer injuries when playing on turf fields than regular grass fields.

Even with this research, not everyone is convinced that crumb rubber fields are safe.

The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and a school district in California no longer install crumb rubber fields.  A state senator from California has proposed a bill that would prevent cities and school districts from installing them for three years.

Keith Verkem's 13-year-old son plays soccer on a turf field. Verkem is concerned about the crumb rubber.

The material "that we make tires out of is not healthy," Verkem said. "Do we want to find out years later that there is a link?"

Most researchers don't think there is a link. But the researchers cannot say for sure. Parents like Verkem don't want to take a chance.
