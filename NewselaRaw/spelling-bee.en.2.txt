NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — As their names were called, 46 of the world's best spellers lined up on the stage with medals around their necks.

Many appeared shocked they'd made it to the semifinals of the 2014 Scripps National Spelling Bee. Parents shouted, cheered and even cried with happiness.

The 87th edition of the iconic American spelling showdown was dramatic. The first round Wednesday went through 41 spellers before the first mistake. Out of the 281 contestants who began the day, 24 were eliminated. They stumbled on words like Keeshond, a Dutch dog breed, and paradigm, referring to patterns.

The young scholars, ages 8 to 15, successfully spelled such tongue-twisters as sassafras, cynosure, ipecac, balalaika and Panglossian.

## Some Spelling Stumpers

Wednesday afternoon's round began with 257 spellers. They stayed in the contest by spelling words for rare animals and foods, medical terms and other curiosities. They correctly spelled objicient (argumentative), Valkyrian (related to battle) and formicivorous (feeding on ants). Other spelling stumpers were pikas (small mammals of the Asian mountains), ocellus (an insect eye used for detecting light) and Wordsworthian (relating to the poet William Wordsworth).

A crowd favorite was Hussain A. Godhrawala of Barnwell, South Carolina. At 8, Hussain was the youngest speller. He seemed almost overwhelmed when he got unguiculate. That means relating to nails or claws. Nine-year-old Kasey Cuenca Torres of San Angelo, Texas, got a rousing reaction to his winning word, phaeton — an open automobile.

In the second round, spellers were knocked out by jeroboam (a wine bottle) and obtundent (lessening pain). Palatalize (use of the tongue in producing sounds) and diphtheria (a childhood illness) sent other spellers home.

Many of the spellers enjoyed joking with pronouncer Jacques Bailly. But others seemed in a hurry to spell their words. Nicole Seman, 13, of Leesburg, Virginia, Madeline Rickert, 13, of Minot, North Dakota, and Zander Reed, 11, of Ankeny, Iowa, didn't ask for their word's language of origin, part of speech or definition. Instead, they went straight to spelling: Faustian, connoisseur and Holstein, in that order.

The spellers often drew the crowd's attention with bubbly greetings for Bailly. Fourteen-year-old Sriram Hathwar, of Painted Post, New York, gave a cheery "Hello, Dr. Bailly and friends."

Some spellers wrote invisible words on the backs of their name-and-number signs, on arms, on hands and in the air. Others would bite their lower lips in concentration or stick their hands deep in their pockets. Neha Seshadri, 13, of Detroit, asked Bailly: "May I take a deep breath, please?" When he said yes, she replied, "Back to business."

## Fantoccini And Foggara

The spellers came from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. overseas territories. They also came from Defense Department schools in Europe and seven foreign countries.

The annual event has become a major phenomenon. More than 1 million students participate in local bees. The winners of the local bees go to regional contests, which lead to the national championships.

Some spellers seemed relieved at getting common words. They had no trouble with lieutenant, poignant, pyre, escargot, rapport, visceral, dichotomy and mistletoe. But they also seemed to welcome head-scratchers like galjoen (a sport fish of Africa), roodebok (a small antelope) and schottische (a polka-like dance).

Ed Horan is 14 and lives in Hoboken, New Jersey. The crowd appeared breathless as he seemed stumped by the word for puppets moved by overhead strings. Then he nailed the word, fantoccini. Similarly, Mary Polking, 14, of Charlotte, North Carolina, repeated the first few letters of the word for a man's felt hat. She started over twice. Then she figured out the correct second vowel, and spelled homburg.

Many of the spelling bee standards are words few kids use in everyday conversation. They include mandir (a Hindu temple), quisling (a traitor) and jeremiad (an angry rant). Foggara (an underground conduit for carrying water), Baedeker (travel guidebooks) and bobbejaan (an Afrikaans word for baboon) are some others.

The spelling words come from languages of origin ranging from the Algonquin Native American language, Javanese and Yiddish to Russian, Dutch, Persian, Latin and Greek.

In the end, the Scripps National Spelling Bee crowned two winners Thursday night. After a five-round duel, neither competitor could miss a word. Sriram Hathwar, of Painted Post, New York, and Ansun Sujoe, of Fort Worth, Texas, shared the prize.

It was just the fourth time in the Spelling Bee's history that winners shared the title. It was also the first time in more than 50 years that there was more than one winner.
