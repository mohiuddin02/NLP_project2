CHICAGO — A gunman fired shots at a basketball game in a Chicago park late Thursday night. He was armed with a type of gun used by soldiers. Thirteen people were injured. One was a 3-year-old boy.

Once again, people are asking why Chicago has so many shootings.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel was traveling when the shooting happened. He cut the trip short to fly back to Chicago.

Reporters asked whether the city had fallen to a new low. Has Chicago become more dangerous than ever? Shootings have been common. But there usually are not so many victims at once. Nor such powerful guns.

## A Miracle That No One Was Killed

The shooting happened at Cornell Square Park. The basketball courts were soaked with blood. Police found bullet shells. The shells showed the shooter used a military-style weapon.

Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said it was a miracle that nobody was killed.

 "Illegal guns, illegal guns, illegal guns drive violence. … A military-grade weapon on the streets of Chicago is simply unacceptable," he said.

The park is in an area with a lot of gangs, McCarthy said.

At least one gunman walked to the basketball court and opened fire 45 minutes before the park's 11 p.m. closing time, police said. The 13 people hit included both players and people watching the game. Nobody was expected to die from their wounds.

Kevin Gordon, 31, said he was talking to his cousin when he was shot in the rear. He fell to the ground.

"It was the longest seconds of my life. It felt like forever," Gordon said. "I was about to run but I couldn't. I could feel 'em whizzing by me. Then it stopped. I looked up and everything was over with. I'm like 'I'm hit.' I looked around; it was like everybody was hit."

## "They Shot My Baby"

Three-year-old Deonta Howard was shot near the ear, police and relatives said. The bullet exited through his cheek.

"They shot my baby with a gun that's bigger than him," said his mother Shamarah Leggett. "It's out of control."

Relatives said the boy's uncle was shot and killed over the Labor Day weekend.

"This gun violence has to stop," Leggett said. "It has to. My baby is only 3. How is he shot in the face with an army gun? Where are they getting army guns from?"

Police believe the shooting was part of an argument between two gangs.

The first paramedics on the scene found more than a dozen people lying across the court. One person lay near a bicycle that was on its side. A pair of white gym shoes were left near an out-of-bounds line.

Ambulances kept coming for nearly a half hour after the shootings. Wounded people were carried out on stretchers. They included a 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl. About 60 police officers swarmed the park. Workers from the crime lab combed the scene.

## Mayor Visits Hospital, Goes To Prayer Gathering

McCarthy repeatedly refused to say whether the shooting hurts the city's reputation.

"Every time somebody is shot in this city, it's a setback," McCarthy said. "But this is not a problem particular to the city of Chicago."

Mayor Emanuel spent 40 minutes at Mount Sinai Hospital. He spoke with Deonta's mother. The boy was being prepared for an operation during the visit. Later, the mayor attended a prayer gathering where he urged people who live in the city to live by a "moral code."

"The parks in the city of Chicago belong to the families of the city of Chicago. The streets of the city of Chicago belong to the families of Chicago. The front stoops of our homes belong to the families of the city of Chicago," he told the crowd. "You go out there and you enjoy our city."

Mario Campbell was shot three times in the belly at the park. The 25-year-old wants to become a cook. He had been worried about gang fighting in the past week, his mother Diane Cade said. He stayed inside most of the week, but went to the park with friends to watch the basketball game.

"Out here it's hard for a boy, no matter what you try to do with your life, no matter how you try to change … it's hard," Cade said.
