NEW YORK â€” A crowd of fast-food workers gathered on Aug. 29 at a McDonald's in New York City. They chanted and held signs. They were there to demand higher pay. More protests were expected to spread across the country.

There were about 500 people outside the McDonald's on Fifth Avenue. Fast-food workers were not alone. Activists, religious leaders and local leaders were there too. The protesters chanted "Si Se Puede" ("Yes, We Can" in Spanish). They shouted "Hey, hey, ho, ho $7.25 has got to go."

Their signs read "On Strike: Can't Survive on $7.25."

Workers in all 50 states [must be paid at least $7.25 an hour by law](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage). The protesters want $15 an hour.

## A Robot Making Pancakes

The protesters planned to spread out to other New York restaurants during the day. Protests were also expected in 1,000 restaurants in 50 cities. Los Angeles, Chicago, and Charlotte, N.C., were just some of the places workers were targeting.

Not everyone supported the protest. A group in Washington put an advertisement in a major newspaper.  The ad shows a robot making pancakes. It explains that restaurants have to pay workers less to keep prices low. If wages get too high, they might need to use robots instead.

The fast-food protests first began in New York on Nov. 29. There have been three in New York since then. Others have taken place in Chicago and other cities.

Thursday's protest was to be the first for fast-food workers in Los Angeles.

## Blue- And White-Collar Demands

"This is our fourth strike in New York, and now we have 50 cities striking with us," said Tyeisha Batts, 27, one of the protesters. "I'm ready for a change," said Batts. She has worked in fast-food restaurants for six years.

More workers are beginning to demand better working conditions. And they are not just blue-collar employees. Some professional workers are asking for changes too.

But the fast-food protests are unusual because they are not targeting one company.  For example, workers in Chicago were expected to strike at Wendy's, Subway and McDonald's. In New York, they were outside Wendy's and Burger King along with McDonald's.

Derrick Langley stood in front of the chanting crowds. The 27-year-old pointed to scars on his arms. He said he got them while cleaning the grill in the KFC where he works. He also has a second-degree burn on his right foot, he said.

## Employers "Don't Respect Us"

"They don't seem to care," he said about his employers. "It's horrible how they manage us, how they talk to us, how they treat us. They don't respect us as human."

The fast-food workforce has changed over the years. Restaurants used to hire mostly younger people just trying to earn pocket money. Now, workers are older. They depend on the work to feed their families. Research shows that the average age of minimum-wage workers is now 35, and that most of them are 20 and older.

"This morning, I'm out here taking a stand for all the fast-food workers around the world," Langley said. "If you're not going to stand up for yourselves, we will."
