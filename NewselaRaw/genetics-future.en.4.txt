MINNEAPOLIS â€” Denis Keegan was suffering from kidney disease, but his doctors were struggling to find out the exact cause of it. He was out of answers. That's when he turned to testing his DNA.

Your DNA contains the information that tells your body how to grow and work. DNA is passed on from parents to children.

Doctors at a hospital in Minnesota took Keegan's DNA from his blood and examined it. They found that a mutant gene was causing his kidney problem. Keegan was suffering from a very rare disease. Now that they knew this, the doctors were able to treat his condition.

All human genes were first mapped in 2003. They showed for the first time exactly how our bodies work and develop. Since then, genetic testing has become a big business. It can let patients learn more about the mysteries of their bodies.

## Spotting A Disease

The testing is also improving quickly. The X-ray machine made it possible to look inside the body. Now genetic testing is changing the way we treat diseases.

Testing can be done by a doctor. There are also home testing kits that are bought online or at a drugstore. They can check for a wide range of illnesses, from kidney disease to cancer.

Genetic testing is very complicated. It could cause needless worries among healthy people. Or it could lead to family problems. One person's test could show troubling information about the health of everyone in that family.

People get many diseases because of their genes. So results from these tests can help stop a disease. They can help doctors learn why someone is unwell or how treat an illness.

They also can show whether a person can pass a disease to his or her children. The DNA is usually collected from a blood sample.

## Tests Aren't For The Healthy

The cost of the testing varies. Home kits are $99 but hospital tests can cost thousands of dollars. The price also changes depending on which disease the doctor is testing for.

Some experts believe that the home tests are not very useful. They say it is important to go to the doctor for the best results.

Doctors say these tests can help to find the best medicines. One woman had a disease that was not getting better with her regular medicine. But with genetic tests the doctors found a medicine that worked.

But for healthy people, there is little point in having these tests. It could cause worries about the chances of developing a disease.

Dr. Alexander Parker said the tests are just about finding risks. "We can never say that we know exactly what will happen to anyone," he said.

He said patients should talk to a doctor before taking any tests. People should also think about how the results will make them feel.

## A Hard Decision To Make

Nada Maalouli of Minnesota has thought about taking the test for years. Her mother, her grandmother and an aunt all died from cancer. A test would tell Maalouli if she has the gene that gives her a higher risk of getting cancer.

She has worried over the decision to get tested. Maalouli is concerned that the test results could bring bad news. Now 51, Maalouli and her three sisters have made a deal. They are all healthy now. But if any of them finds something wrong, they will all go for genetic testing together.

One person's test may also give information about his or her relatives. And they may not want to know. Keegan's tests affected several members of his family. Doctors asked his brother and father to also give DNA to find out if Keegan had got the disease from his father.

Keegan, 30, and his wife were thinking about having a baby. There is a one-in-two chance their child would also get the gene that could cause the disease.

The couple talked about testing the fertilized egg to make sure it  did not have that gene. But they thought this would be "playing God." They've decided just to go ahead, have children and see what happens.

Keegan figures that treatment for the disease will be better in the future.
