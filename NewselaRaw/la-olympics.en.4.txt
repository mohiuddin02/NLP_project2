LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” The Olympic Games are the biggest thing in sports. Almost every country sends its best athletes. The winners of the Olympic games are the best in the world.

The games happen every two years. First they are held in the summer. Then, they are held in the winter.

The games last more than two weeks. Each time they are held in a different place.

## One Step Closer

It is a big honor to put on the Olympics. Many cities want to do it. Each time, there is a contest to pick one lucky city.

Cities have been picked for the next four Olympics. None are in the United States.

No city has yet been picked for the 2024 Summer Olympics. The race to be picked is still on.

Los Angeles is now one step closer to being picked. It has just beaten out the other U.S. cities that were in the running. The U.S. Olympic Committee made that pick.

## International Olympic Committee Will Make Final Choice

Now L.A. will be matched up against cities in other countries. It will be running against Rome, Italy; Paris, France; Hamburg, Germany; and Budapest, Hungary.

The International Olympic Committee will make the last pick. It will announce a winner in September 2017.

L.A.'s leaders are very happy their city has gotten so far.

Los Angeles was made for this, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. "This city is the world's greatest stage," he added.

## L.A. Is Hoping For Its Third Olympics

Los Angeles was home to the Olympics in 1932 and 1984. Garcetti promised the city will do a great job if it gets to put on the 2024 Games.

City leaders think L.A. will end up being picked.

"We are in this to win it," Councilman Paul Krekorian said. "I think we will."

## Many Sites In L.A. Would Host Different Competitions

Competition will take place all over the city if Los Angeles is picked. For example, volleyball would be played on Santa Monica Beach. The sport was invented there.

Mountain biking would happen in Griffith Park. Memorial Coliseum would be the main playing field.

The city says it will build a village for players if L.A. is picked. Players from around the world would stay there during the games.
