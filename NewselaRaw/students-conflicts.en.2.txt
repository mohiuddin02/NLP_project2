CHICAGO â€” The tension between the two Manley High School students started on Facebook, with a post that asked a direct, but loaded, question.

"Do you have a problem with me?" one teenager wrote on the other's page.

By the time Marquita Riley, 16, and Aaliyah Hudson, 17, ended up in their West Side school's "peace room," people in school had been saying that the two girls were going to fight.

Aaliyah retreated to the bright classroom with a comfy couch, chairs and posters, to get a counselor to help the girls talk. She was hoping to avoid a brawl that could lead to a 10-day suspension.

There, the girls sat in a circle of chairs, talked and listened to each other until they worked out their problems.

"I came down here and talked before I reacted," Aaliyah said after their session. "That way, 'cause if anything did happen, it wouldn't be my bad," she said.

## Helping Youth Avoid Violence

The room at Manley is part of the school's restorative justice initiative. Restorative justice is a growing movement that, among other things, focuses on healing and teaching people how to resolve conflicts. The philosophy aims to bring together victims and people who wronged them to work through their problems.

The idea is used in schools, community centers and churches in Chicago as a way to teach young people how to understand their anger and handle problems before they turn violent. It is also being used as an alternative to suspensions and arrests, which can lead to more trouble the community.

The idea is that if something bad happens or someone misbehaves, there needs to be a way to "restore order for the community to move forward," said Ilana Zafran of Umoja Student Development. Umoja puts together restorative justice programs in Chicago schools.

City authorities are dealing with shootings and killings among youths. Activists, ministers and educators are turning to the principles of restorative justice to stop the unrest.

The concept forces all sides in a disagreement to communicate and understand one another instead of resorting to violence. There may still be punishment for wrongdoing, but restorative justice emphasizes identifying hurt and thinking of ways to fix it.

"The assumption is if you are a teenager, you know everything about how to act and behave," Zafran said. "But that's not true. This idea of restoration is not something even adults do well because it can be messy and complicated, and involves vulnerability, and that is just hard."

## Complicated, But Worth A Try

While the idea sounds great, supporters admit that it is complicated. It is also difficult to measure the success of such work.

But restorative justice is a tactic worth trying, experts say.

"The idea that if we punish hard enough they won't do it again hasn't proven effective," said the Rev. David Kelly. His ministry applies the tenets of the philosophy when working with troubled youths. Putting people in prison does not work and is expensive, he said.

At Manley and Fenger high schools in Chicago, administrators have created peace rooms where students and workers can go to work out problems.

In the peace circles, people involved in a conflict sit together and are allowed to express their feelings without interruption.

"This process forces us to look at a conflict and then look at what goes on behind it," said Tosha Jackson, assistant principal at Fenger.

That school began implementing restorative justice after a 2009 brawl left one student dead.

In the peace rooms, students often reveal gang ties and deep troubles they may have at home. Teachers admit they have unresolved hurt and anger, and staff members admit they struggle, too.

"A lot of our kids don't want to be involved in fights. They don't want to be suspended or away from school," Jackson said. "We had to create an environment of peace. High school has to be a pleasurable experience for our kids. If they come here and feel the same anxiety they feel in the streets, how can we expect them to stay?"

## Cooling Down Tensions

Before she started high school, Geneva Harris, 18, said she was the type of kid who called others names, was insulting and oozed sassy attitude. But at Fenger, another student questioned the motivation behind her demeanor.

Harris, a senior, learned from that student the steps for breaking through tension. Then she became a peer conflict resolver herself. Now, she's quick to pull her friends and family members into a circle and talk their problems over.

"Now I'm a people person," she said. "I'm like the older sister among my friends."

Manley started restorative justice because it had a lot of suspensions, said Ted Christians, CEO of Umoja. Eventually the suspension rate dropped by 40 percent and the number of on-site arrests fell. So it became a way of teaching social skills and moral lessons.

On a recent afternoon, the Manley High School peace room pulsated with activity.

Marquita and Aaliyah, the two girls rumored to be gearing up for a major fight, where there.

"People came up to me and said you wanted to fight me," Marquita told Aaliyah.

"If you thought I had a problem with you, you could have come to talk to me," Aaliyah told Marquita.

After another 20 minutes of discussion, they agreed they had simply misunderstood each other. The girls decided they would not fight, and promised they would talk it over if they found themselves facing tension again.
