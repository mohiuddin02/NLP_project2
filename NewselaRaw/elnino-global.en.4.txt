A fog of thick smoke settles over the country of Indonesia. Hundreds of thousands of people become sick. The air is not safe for the people. 

In Peru, they cannot have the Dakar Rally. It is a famous car race. Now, they must prepare for heavy rains.

In Ethiopia, farms cannot grow food. The land is too dry. Soon there may not be enough food.  

All these problems happen because of a weather event called El Nino. 

## Named By South American Fishermen

El Nino was named by fishermen in Peru and Ecuador. They saw that warm waters sometimes came around Christmas. The warm water kept the fish away. El Nino means "the child" in Spanish. The fishermen were thinking of the birth of Jesus Christ.

When the surface of ocean water is hot, it can cause storms. The storms draw energy from the hot water. The hottest ocean water is in the west part of the Pacific. It is close to Indonesia. During an El Nino, these warm waters move to the east. Soon, many storms start. 

## El Nino Changes Rain, Oceans, Wind 

El Nino changes other things. Rains that people expect at that time of year might not come. This can happen in India, Africa and Southeast Asia. Farms cannot grow food. Wildfires start. In parts of North and South America, there are pounding storms.

In Indonesia farmers cut down plants and light fires to clear farmland. El Nino means hot, dry weather and little rain. The weather makes the fires quickly spread. The fires have happened during every El Nino since 1982. Smoke from the fires makes thousands of people sick.

Heavy rains cause floods, or overflows of water. Floodwaters spread dirt and germs that make people sick.

A hurricane has high, fast winds and rain. It can harm people and homes. Scientists think El Nino was one reason that Hurricane Patricia happened. It was one of the strongest hurricanes in history.
