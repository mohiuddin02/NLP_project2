Paris, France, was attacked Friday night. Terrorists shot at people. More than 132 people were killed.

Paris is the biggest city in France. It is a very famous city.

The attack made many Americans feel shocked and sad. They went on Facebook and Twitter to say how they felt.

People posted photos of themselves in front of the Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel Tower is the most famous structure in Paris. Many people said they were praying for Paris.

## Kenya Suffered Too

Then suddenly people began seeing a story about another terrorist attack. This time the attack was in Kenya. It is a country in Africa.

"Man, what's happening with the world right now?" one Facebook user wrote.

The story passed around quickly. Soon, thousands and thousands of people had read it.

Many people did not notice when the story was written. The story was old. It was written more than seven months ago.

The attack in Kenya was just as terrible as what happened in Paris. Terrorists killed 148 people at a school. Yet back in April there was almost nothing about it on Facebook and Twitter.

Something like that also happened last week.

## And An Attack In Lebanon

The city of Beirut, Lebanon, was attacked the day before Paris was. It was hit by the same violent group. It is called Islamic State, or ISIS. Yet, there was not much talk about the attack on Facebook or Twitter.

When Paris was attacked suddenly everyone was talking about it.

Some people think the difference is unfair. They believe it shows that Americans care less about people who are not white or from Western countries.

The problem is complicated. Many people did not even know about the attacks in Kenya and Beirut. Maybe if they had known, they would have cared.

## When We Feel Close To Victims, We Care More

One thing is clear, though. People usually care more when terrible things happen to people to whom they feel close.

Most Americans know something about Paris. It is a very popular place to visit on vacation. When Paris was hit, it was almost as if a friend had died.

Not too many Americans have traveled to Kenya or Beirut. Most Americans do not really know those places.

Still, it is not right for us to care less about them.

Most of us know that. Perhaps that is why so many people shared a story from seven months ago. They wanted to show the world that they care about Kenya too.
