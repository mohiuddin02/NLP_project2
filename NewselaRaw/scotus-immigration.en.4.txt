WASHINGTON, D.C. — People who move to America from other countries are called immigrants. Our country is a land of immigrants.

Some immigrants move to the United States without permission. They live and work here for years anyway. 

People have different ideas about such immigrants. Some say they should be sent back to their home country. Others say if they have been here long enough, they should be allowed to stay.

## Children Born In The U.S. Are Citizens

The problem is particularly difficult when such immigrants have children. If their children are born here, they are U.S. citizens. The children have the right to live here. 

Many people feel it is not right to break up families by deporting parents. Immigrants who are deported are sent back to their home country. 

Many immigrants here without permission hide from the government. It can be very hard for them to find a good job.

## Plan Would Make Life Easier For Many Immigrants

In November 2014, President Barack Obama announced a new government plan. The plan is known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program. It is called DAPA for short. 

DAPA would make life easier for many immigrants living in the United States without permission. It would allow them to work openly. As many as 5 million people would be helped.

In 2014, Obama said DAPA would let people "come out of the shadows." The plan covers immigrants who have been in the U.S. more than five years. Their children have to be living here legally.

## Lower Courts Have Ruled Against Obama's Plan

Twenty-six states challenged DAPA right away. Texas took the lead. It and the other states got lower-level federal courts to block the plan. Courts make decisions based on laws. The courts said it was not fair to Texas. Texas has many immigrants. It would have to pay a large amount of money to help them.

Now things could change. On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court said it will look at DAPA. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land. Its decision has more power than the lower courts. The U.S. government asked the Supreme Court to step in.

The Supreme Court court will rule in June.

Many people praised the Supreme Court for taking up the case. Lawmaker Harry Reid said many immigrants live in "fear of being separated from their children. These families must be allowed to step out of the shadows." Parents should be able to work openly, Reid said.
