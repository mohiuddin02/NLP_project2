KAMPALA, Uganda â€” Madinah Nalukenge remembers when she began selling food at a bus station here in the Ugandan capital in 2004. She had only $10 left after a failed attempt to sell bed sheets.

Ten years later, Nalukenge runs a catering business that makes up to $3,000 profit per month.

Nalukenge, 34, is a single mother who only finished elementary school. Her business is not only a way to make a living, it's also a source of pride.

She spends her days offering mashed banana-like plantains and greasy meats to workers in downtown Kampala.

"There is a lot of money to be made here," she said recently, her apron overflowing with cash. "I need to stay focused."

She has a lot of competition, though: There are more than a dozen other women operating food stalls near hers.

## Breaking Stereotypes

Nalukenge is part of a growing trend in Africa, where more women are running their own businesses. The amount of female [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur), or independent business owners, today would have been unthinkable just 20 or 30 years ago.

Africa now has the highest growth rate of female-run business in the world, according to the World Bank.

About 63 percent of women in Africa who don't work in agriculture have their own small businesses. This is more than twice the worldwide rate, according to World Bank data.

For these women, it is the need to make money that drives them to start their own enterprises, not necessarily available opportunities.

Women often start by running small businesses, selling things or providing a service. But some women who are luckier or more ambitious have started businesses that now employ thousands of people. Some of these projects break stereotypes about what women can do in societies that are still largely conservative.

"Traditionally women would sit at home and wait for the man to return home with a bag of groceries. This has been changing over time as women's dependence gradually reduces," said Thomas Bwire, an economist with Uganda's central bank. In a sign of the times, Ugandan women now even work at road construction sites, he said.

## Feeding Children, Paying Rent

In sub-Saharan Africa, there are more women than men working in the informal sector, according to the International Labor Organization. The "informal sector" refers to businesses that are generally very small and do not pay taxes.

This is different than other regions, such as South and East Asia, where self-employed women usually work in homes, doing domestic work such as cooking and cleaning, according to the U.N. agency.

The food vendors in downtown Kampala have similar reasons for entering into private business: Hungry children, unpaid rent, violent or uncooperative partners. Most of them are single. This is important, they point out, because being independent at home has allowed them to be successful in business. Many of the vendors have also enrolled their children in boarding school to make more time for work.

"They don't help and they never want to help," Nalukenge said of her former partners. "Yet even the little you get they want to take away from you. I was alone when I started this business."

## A Powerful Force

Economists who study developing countries point out that women starting businesses can be a powerful force for global economic growth. Giving these women credit, loans to start business, can jump-start the process.

According to the World Bank, there is a $300 billion credit gap for female-owned businesses. This means that these businesses could use $300 billion in order to grow, but no one is willing to loan it to them.

The International Finance Corp. of the World Bank launched a $600 million fund in March to finance women-owned businesses in the developing world. The fund, called the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility, aims to work with local banks to lend money to 100,000 women entrepreneurs.

Across sub-Saharan Africa, where extreme poverty is still common, stories of successful women entrepreneurs are accumulating.

A Kenyan woman, Mary Okello, is celebrated for starting a school inside a three-bedroom house that has since become a prestigious group of private schools.

## Making Baskets For Macy's

In Rwanda, Janet Nkubana has been recognized abroad for running a handicrafts company that employs more than 3,000 women. Their baskets can be purchased at Macy's.

The Nigerian Adenike Ogunlesi is famous for her "Ruff 'n' Tumble" clothing line for children, a business that she first operated out of a car trunk.

In Uganda, where most of the food is grown locally, many women have been drawn to catering. Their food stalls are very common at transport centers and open markets. Since the women are unable to get loans from banks, they start "cooperative" groups where they pool their savings together and take turns getting loans.

Extreme poverty is pushing women to take over "core family responsibilities" from men, according to Ugandan economist Fred Muhumuza. Women who have started their own small businesses "have surprised themselves by succeeding," he said.

Nalukenge, the food vendor in downtown Kampala, said she has kept her children in school and now owns two small plots of land.

On a recent evening, as she prepared to clean up and pack her saucepans, she considered her unlikely journey from failed seller of bed sheets to successful caterer with a long line of loyal clients.

"We spend a lot of energy here," she said. "There's no resting. But at the end of the day we get our reward."
