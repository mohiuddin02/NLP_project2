The two men were amateur cavers who enjoyed the challenge of burrowing through dark and possibly dangerous caves. This time their route proved particularly difficult. They were exploring one of a group of caves in South Africa known as Rising Star. Their goal was an unexplored chamber deep underground.

Most people believed the cave had already given up most of its treasures years ago. Still, American scientist Lee Berger had asked the men to keep their eyes open for ancient remains.

## Almost Human, But Not Quite

The men had to feel their way along the cave's winding passages, then crawl on their stomachs through an opening less than 10 inches high. Next, they had to ascend a jagged wall, cross a narrow ledge known as the "Dragon's Back," then make a 400-foot descent, sideways, through a vertical crack. Finally they arrived at the prize: a 30-foot-long chamber probably between 2 million and 3 million years old.

What they found that day in September 2013 nearly took their breath away. The chamber they entered contained more than 1,500 bones and teeth buried in ancient clay. The remains looked almost human, but clearly were not.

Berger then arranged for a further month of excavation and two years of careful study. On Thursday he made a dramatic announcement: The fragments the two men found belong to a previously unknown species of human relative, which has been named Homo naledi. "Naledi" means "star" in Sesotho, a local South African language.

## Now "Best-Known" Human Ancestor

"It was soon apparent that what I thought was an individual skeleton was dozens of individuals," Berger said. The fact that different examples of every bone in the body were found gives scientists a very clear idea of what the species looked like. Homo naledi is "already practically the best-known" ancestor of today's humans, he said.

Berger and his fellow scientists say Homo naledi may be one of the most primitive members of the genus Homo, which includes today's humans.

The pieces that were discovered in the chamber belonged to at least 15 individuals of the same species, including men, women, children and infants. Perhaps more remarkable, all of them appeared to have been intentionally placed there after death. The bodies seem to have been ritualistically or ceremonially disposed of, which is not something scientists would expect to see with such a primitive species.

## "None Of Us Expected It"

"It's enormously surprising to see a very primitive member of the genus, not very humanlike overall, to do something unique to humans," Berger said. "To see it in a small-brained hominid is completely surprising â€” none of us expected it."

Homo naledi is an unusual combination of the primitive and the modern, the scientists said. Its brain was no larger than a baseball, its shoulders and chest were primitive and its fingers were long and curved, allowing it to climb and swing from the trees. At the same time, its wrist bones indicate that it used tools. Its long legs and feet were almost exactly the same as those of modern man. They allowed it not only to walk upright but also to travel for many miles at a time.

"We had never seen a creature like this before," said scientist John Hawks.

## Excavation: A Dangerous Job

The remains were recovered over 21 days in November 2013 and seven days in March 2014. The scientists soon decided they had to put together a special team. They needed people slender enough to crawl through narrow sections of the cave, but also experienced enough to handle the dangerous work.

The six who were eventually chosen were all women, including American student Becca Peixotto.

"We had a lot of spectacular moments, and a few stand out," Peixotto said. A fragment of a skull from the center of the chamber "took days to excavate," she said. After it was finally free from the soil, it was packaged in a box just small enough to fit through the narrow cracks of the cave. Next the team faced the difficult task of getting the box to the surface. "It was all hands on deck," Peixotto said. The women passed the skull box up the chute, out the slot, down the Dragon's Back, through the crawl, up another ladder and finally out to the surface. "There was huge cheering as it reached the light of day," she said.

## Looking Back 2.5 Million Years

Berger says he is certain the remains are more than 2.5 million years old. Their age makes Homo naledi among the earliest, if not the earliest, relative of modern human beings, he said.

Hawks said that Homo naledi's unusual combination of features could make scientists take a fresh look at how humans developed as a species. It "gives us a different model for how things could fit in our own origins," he said.

Berger said the team plans on further expeditions and excavations of the chamber.

"This chamber has not given up all its secrets," he added.
