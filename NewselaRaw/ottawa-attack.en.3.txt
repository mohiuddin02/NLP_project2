OTTAWA, Ontario â€” On Wednesday, a gunman killed a soldier in Canada. The soldier was guarding a monument that remembers Canada's soldiers who died in wars. The killer then fired many shots inside the government's Parliament building. He was killed by a guard.

Canada's highest political official, the prime minister, called it the country's second attack in three days.

"We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated," Prime Minister Stephen Harper told his country.

Harper was addressing a meeting of members of the government when the attack began around 10 a.m. Many shots were heard inside the government building. People protected themselves by blocking doors with chairs. Others ran away from the building in fear.

## Dressed All In Black

The gunman was 32-year-old Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. He had been arrested for several other crimes before. Harper described him as an "ISIL-inspired terrorist."

The prime minister was referring to the extremist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. It has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the land stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

ISIL has called for revenge against Canada and other Western countries because they joined the United States in a military air campaign against its fighters in Iraq and Syria.

According to witnesses, Zehaf-Bibeau carried a rifle and was dressed all in black with a scarf covering half his face. Zehaf-Bibeau shot the Canadian soldier guarding the memorial. The soldier's name was Nathan Cirillo.

After the gunman shot Cirillo, witnesses said he raised his arms in triumph, then went to the government building which is located a few hundred yards away. He then fired many more shots.

## Guard Kills Attacker

Some people fled the government building. Others hid inside. Police gathered outside and blocked entry to streets around Parliament.

Government officials said the guard inside Parliament stopped the shooting by killing the attacker. The guard is 58-year-old Kevin Vickers. Even though he carries a gun, his job is mainly symbolic. His uniform includes a decorative staff, green robes, white gloves and a tall hat.

At least three people were treated for minor injuries. The government building is where Canada's laws are made.

The Canadian prime minister promised to keep the country safe and work with Canada's allies to fight militants.

A witness named Tony Zobl said he saw the Canadian soldier being shot. Zobl was looking down from his fourth-floor window directly above the memorial.

"I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth," Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency. "The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle."

## Many Shots Heard

The Canadian television station had video footage of the gunman going to his car after he shot the soldier at the memorial. The car was later spotted down the block.

Government official Tony Clement wrote on Twitter that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament.

"I'm safe locked in a office awaiting security," Kyle Seeback, another member of the government, wrote on Twitter.

"I hear this pop, pop, pop. Possibly 10 shots," said John McKay, a government official.

He said guards then came rushing down the halls and brought people toward the back of the buildings.

## Events Canceled In Toronto

Canada was already on alert because of a deadly attack against two Canadian soldiers two days earlier. A man killed one soldier and injured another with his car before being shot to death by police. Officials believed this man was a militant. Recently, they did not allow him to leave Canada to travel to Turkey.

After the shootings, officials canceled two events in Toronto. They were honoring a teenager from Pakistan who won the Nobel Peace Prize. Her name is Malala Yousafzai.

She had been shot in the head by a militant in 2012 in Pakistan because she supported education for girls there. The government was going to give her honorary Canadian citizenship.
