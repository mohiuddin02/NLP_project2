Police said a painting they had found could be the work of the artist who painted the famous Mona Lisa. But now the story is in doubt.

Carlo Pedretti, an art expert from the University of California in Los Angeles, said that story is wrong. People thought Pedretti said the work belonged to Leonardo da Vinci. Now he says that it could be a da Vinci, but it needs to be studied more.

Paintings by Leonardo da Vinci are very rare and expensive. Most of his paintings, like the Mona Lisa, are in famous museums.

## Da Vinci Discovery?

This painting shows a woman named Isabella D'Este. The Swiss police have the painting as evidence in a case. The Italian government wanted to know if the portrait was taken out of their country illegally. Many countries have laws against taking important works of art or historic items out of the country without the government's permission.

The Swiss police said Pedretti had declared the picture was painted by da Vinci. An Italian magazine had said the same thing in 2013. That article also excited art lovers with the idea of discovering a new masterpiece by da Vinci.

Those stories have raised the price of the painting, said Alessandro Vezzosi. He runs a museum dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci in his hometown of Vinci in Italy.

The Swiss police said the value of the painting has gone up since it was discovered. It was worth about $108 million in 2013, and now it is worth about $137 million. The prices of works of art go up and down depending on how famous they are.

## There Might Be A Hidden Drawing

Pedretti said he had recommended the owners run more tests before announcing it was painted by da Vinci.

He said people who say he claimed the painting was by da Vinci are wrong. He would first have to talk with some other experts before deciding, he said.

Pedretti said he recognized the work was important to study da Vinci's work. Pedretti is convinced the painting is old and is quite likely from da Vinci's lifetime. Some details were painted later, like a palm frond and a wheel.

Vezzosi said the picture does not look like da Vinci's paintings. But he said it is possible that there could be a drawing by da Vinci under the paint.

A drawing of Isabella D'Este by Leonardo da Vinci hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris. It shows the painter knew her.

## Artist Helpers

Many artists in da Vinci's time had other artists working for them. He could have worked on the painting, and one of his students finished it, Pedretti said.

Leonardo da Vinci had a lot of interests. He was busy studying mechanics and physics, Pedretti said. "He didn't have time to stay and work on a painting."
