WINTER GARDEN, Fla. â€” Classes were over for the day at Tildenville Elementary School, and most of the students had gone home. There were about two dozen fourth- and fifth-graders who were still on campus, however. They were not thinking about homework, or sports, or what was for dinner. They were building solar generators.

The students were crowding around Thomas Dillen, a student at Valencia College, who was leading a solar energy workshop. Dillen raised a solar panel above his head, trying to catch the sunlight. The students watched and waited, hoping that the sun would power the portable generator they had been building.

A light bulb attached to the machine lit up. The students erupted in cheers.

## They Built It!

In only a few months, the students had turned a box, some wires and a light socket into a machine that would capture the energy of the sun and turn it into usable electricity. Not only that, the generators they built would soon be donated to an orphanage in Africa.

The workshop was part of a new after-school program at Tildenville. With the help of visiting college students, children at Tildenville have been building solar generators to donate to areas without electrical power. The goal is to develop the students' interest in science and technology and raise their awareness of problems around the world.

The program, which will end next month, was developed by Deb Hall, an electrical engineer and professor at Valencia College. In 2009, she attended a renewable-energy workshop. Renewable energies are sources of power that will never run out, like the sun and wind. New technologies are being designed that can capture these energy sources and use them to power lights and machines. At the meeting, she met a couple who run a company called We Care Solar.

## What They Do Is So Cool

The company designs "solar suitcases," portable generators that can provide power in areas without electricity. The solar suitcases made by We Care Solar are donated to hospitals in poor countries. Without generators, doctors in some areas have to work by candlelight, which makes their jobs extremely difficult.

Hall was inspired by the work that We Care Solar was doing and became interested in building solar suitcases in her classes at Valencia. Teaching her students about the generators could be educational and could improve the world, she thought.

She first had to look for funding. Hall received $5,000 from the Valencia Foundation that allowed her, as well as her students in Introduction to Alternative and Renewable Energy to build five generators. When the generators were complete, four of them were sent to Haiti, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Kenya. Hall kept one to use in demonstrations.

## A New Idea Comes To Light

About three years ago, Hall and a half-dozen of her students began visiting Tildenville Elementary. They gave presentations to science teacher Sharon Burnett's fifth-graders, hoping to teach the kids about careers in science and technology.

"These kids need to have their eyes opened to what might be available to them in the future," Burnett said.

Hall brought along their solar suitcase to show to the kids. Burnett thought solar generators would make a good project for her after-school students. We Care Solar agreed to let the Tildenville kids help build generators under the supervision of Valencia students. The company would inspect the suitcases and then send them to Uganda.

Burnett got funding to build three of the suitcases, which cost $1,500 apiece. The workshops at Tildenville began in August.

## Many Lessons Are Learned

On a recent Friday, the children divided into three groups and got to work while Hall gave instructions.

"Everybody gets a chance to tighten up the screws," Hall said as the kids clustered around the generators.

The workshops teach students not only about electricity and sustainable energy, but also about working together, following directions and testing their work. Moreover, students learn about people in other countries who are less privileged than them.

Most of the students at Tildenville Elementary do not come from wealthy families. Nevertheless, they live in luxury compared with the Ugandan orphans.

Ariana Gonzalez, 9, said she felt sad when she learned about what life was like for people growing up in extreme poverty.

"In Uganda in some orphanages, they don't have any light at all," she said. "They have only one little candle, and it doesn't light up the whole room."
