NEW YORK — Until recently, Bernie Sanders' plan for using technology to win over young voters mostly involved Twitter. His posts were taken straight from his long speeches and videos explaining the inequality between rich and poor.

Then the Democratic presidential candidate joined Snapchat. About 100 million people use the app daily, according to Snapchat. The comany claims to have a large share of America's young voters in its audience. Sanders is popular with young voters, so he is betting that Snapchat can help him make the most of his advantage with them.

## "This Snapshot Thing"

At first glance, Sanders seems like a strange fit for Snapchat. On Snapchat, users can send photos and short videos to their friends that later disappear. "What is this Snapshot thing and why do I only get 10 seconds?" Sanders tweeted on Monday to announce his new account. He is also late to join Snapchat. His Democratic rivals, Martin O'Malley and Hillary Clinton, have been on Snapchat for several weeks. So has every major Republican candidate except Jeb Bush, Donald Trump and Rick Santorum.

But there is some data to show that Snapchat is a natural fit for Sanders. About 37 percent of the app's daily users are 18- to 24-year-olds, according to Snapchat. After the Aug. 6 Republican debate, Snapchat said that age group were more likely to watch the platform's five-minute "live story" of the debate than watch the debate live on television. Two-thirds of 18- to 34-year-old Snapchat users will probably vote. About one-third of them use the app, according to an online poll paid for by Snapchat.

## More Humor Than TV

"Compared to other kinds of social media, Snapchat really gives a true behind-the-scenes look at campaigns and candidates," said Robert Blizzard. He works at Public Opinion Strategies, an opinion research company.

Snapchat's live stories cover the entire night of the debates, unlike TV stations, and offer more background information and humor.

Sanders' stories have often been about serious matters. His first story featured scenes from a rally and statements he made, while his second story promoted an announcement of his immigration plan.

In comparison, Clinton, who joined Snapchat in early August, has been praised for her funny posts. They often feature old photos of the candidate or images mocking her Republican opponents.

## Booming With Millennials

Kenneth Pennington works for the Sanders campaign. He is in charge of using technology to get voters interested in Sanders. He said Sanders is "uniquely positioned" to turn out young voters due to his popularity with them. A national poll released Nov. 13 found 57 percent of voters prefer Clinton, with just 39 percent choosing Sanders. However, Sanders led among 18- to 29-year-olds by 58 percent to 35 percent.

Pennington said they are seeing that more young people are getting excited by Sanders. "And it's not because the senator is some cool hip guy, it's just because his ideas are really appealing" to young voters. Sanders will likely use the account to focus on issues young voters care about. Some of those issues include the high cost of college, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, and racial justice, Pennington said.

## Speaking Their Language

Sierra Smith is a 19-year-old journalism student at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. She is just the sort of young voter the campaign hopes to reach. Smith was one of many fans who tweeted approval of Sanders' new Snapchat account. She called it "the cutest thing ever." In an interview, Smith said she thought the app was a good way to keep people her age informed about Sanders. She plans to vote for him and said she probably would not go to the polls if not for him.

"I think a lot of the things that he says are things that people our age believe in," Smith said. "And he's the only one who's really just saying them."

## He Needs "Large Numbers"

To win the Democratic nomination, Sanders needs to get high numbers of young people to come out and vote for him.

Sanders adviser Tad Devine said that campaigns usually neglect young voters. But Obama did not make that mistake and neither will Sanders, Devine said.

"We believe that these young people who are now supporting him in very large numbers can be persuaded to participate in large numbers as well," Devine said. "And that can make a huge difference."
