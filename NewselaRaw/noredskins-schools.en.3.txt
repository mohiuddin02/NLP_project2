LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” California has a new sports law. It says that public schools cannot use the name Redskins. Now four high schools need new names for their teams.

Governor Jerry Brown signed the law. A governor is a state's leader.

Now state schools in California cannot use the Redskins name as a mascot.

A mascot is usually a person or animal. It represents a group or school and is mostly used to bring good luck. Most sports teams have a mascot.

## Redskins Name Has A Long History

Many Native Americans are upset by the Redskins name. It is a very old word. It is seen as an unkind word for a Native American. The first people who lived in the Americas were the Native Americans.

Four high schools in California use the name. Sarah Koligian is in charge of schools in the town of Tulare. She said people in her town are unhappy about the new law. They will change their team's name anyway.

Ronald V. Seals is in charge of schools in another California town called Chowchilla. They also use the Redskins mascot. Seals will ask the people in town to help come up with a new name. Chowchilla has used a Redskins mascot since 1928.

"You don't pick a mascot that you don't respect," Seals said. He also said that those who want to change the mascot do not live in Chowchilla.

Two other California schools are also known as the Redskins. They will have to come up with a new name for their sports teams as well.

## Native Americans Press For Name Change

The Washington Redskins play football in the National Football League. The team is from Washington, D.C. Native American groups say having a team named Redskins is disrespectful.

This year a judge said that the Washington Redskins will have to give up its name. The team's owner does not want to do that. He is fighting that ruling.

Ray Halbritter is a Native American from the Oneida tribe. He is also a member of a group called Change The Mascot. Halbritter thinks the California school mascot law should be an example for the Washington Redskins.

Halbritter said the ruling shows that the Redskins name is unkind. "The NFL should act immediately to press the team to change the name," Halbritter said.

## Smokeless Tobacco Is Not Allowed

California has another new law about sports. It says that sports teams cannot use smokeless tobacco at big league baseball parks.

Tobacco is a plant that is used for smoking or chewing. The smokeless tobacco law is for players and coaches. They cannot have it on the playing field.

Smokeless tobacco is a form of the plant that people chew.

Major League Baseball uses the parks for its teams. The group has already said that it supports the new law.

Doctors say that fewer young people are smoking cigarettes. Tobacco is also used in cigarettes. Doctors worry that more young people are using smokeless tobacco. They say the plant still causes cancer and other diseases if it is chewed.

San Francisco and Los Angeles are cities in California. They already do not allow smokeless tobacco in ballparks.

## Good News For Cheerleaders

There is one more new sports law in California. The law says that competitive cheerleading will now be called a sport. It will become an official high school sport.

Competitive cheerleading is when teams perform routines with music in a contest. They try to do the best cheering, jumps and tumbling.

Lawmakers hope that now the sport will get more attention. It may also become safer.

California has three new sports laws. The Redskins mascot law will start in 2017. The competitive cheerleading law starts then too. Next baseball season, smokeless tobacco will not be allowed on big league ballpark fields.
