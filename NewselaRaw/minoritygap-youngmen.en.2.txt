WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama on Monday launched a non-government program to help men and boys of color. The program won't be paid for by the government. Instead it will bring together former elected officials, pro athletes, celebrities and business leaders to find solutions.

Obama criticized the "sense of unfairness and of powerlessness" that leads to such violent events as the Baltimore riots. He also promised to fight for the cause of equal rights for the rest of his life.

## Help In School And On The Job

The nonprofit organization is called My Brother's Keeper Alliance. It's built on a program Obama started last year to draw attention to the differences between minority students and their peers. The goal is to improve minority students' performance in school and help them with their careers.

"We are in this for the long haul," Obama told a crowd at New York's Lehman College in the Bronx. "I notice we don't always get a lot of reporting on this issue when there's not a crisis in some neighborhood.

"But we're just going to keep on plugging away," he said. "This will remain a mission for me and for Michelle, not just for the rest of my presidency, but for the rest of my life."

## Finding Solutions After Baltimore

The alliance is an offshoot of the My Brother's Keeper program, which Obama launched a year ago. It shows Obama using his power to bring leaders together so they can work on society's problems. It's something Obama has been doing as his presidency winds down, since he hasn't always been successful at starting new government programs or getting Congress to pay for programs.

Monday's pledge came just days after Obama spoke with clear frustration about the conditions that led to the rioting in Baltimore. He condemned the death of a young black man who was being held by police. He also criticized the larger issues of poverty and lack of opportunity that affect inner cities around the country.

They are problems for whole communities to solve, he said, and it will take a continuous effort to make a difference.

## Racism, Poverty And A Life's Work

Many of the presidents who served before Obama left the White House wanting to make changes they couldn't accomplish in office. President Jimmy Carter created Habitat for Humanity, which builds affordable housing, and focuses on global peace work. President George H.W. Bush runs the world's largest organization devoted to volunteer public service, the Points of Light.

In their footsteps, President Bill Clinton dedicated his Clinton Global Initiative to projects he began in office. They include fighting against climate change and improving health care worldwide.

James A. Thurber is a professor of government at American University. He says there's a strong desire on the part of former presidents to finish the work they couldn't do in office.

"Rather than just establishing a library that shows what they did, they want to continue the work," Thurber said.

Obama, he said, might be more effective on his chosen cause after he leaves office.

"He can address racism and poverty, two things that are very closely linked, in a very effective way," Thurber said. "These are big problems in America, and he is in a special position to get people talking about them."

Thurber added, "He's likely to be more effective in that way than by trying to pass legislation in trying to deal with them."

Obama has been gearing up his effort for years, said Joshua DuBois, who worked with Obama at the White House. When he was in the Senate, Obama worked on healthy families and fatherhood issues. He started a fatherhood program shortly after becoming president.

Obama's concern for men and boys of color "started long before he was in the White House and will last long after he's closed the doors to that building for the last time," DuBois said.

The effort became more urgent after the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer. That's when Obama began to talk publicly about the importance of helping men and boys of color thrive.

## A National Network To Close The Gap

The new organization aims to build a national network to help boys and young men of color. It plans to do this mostly through programs designed to close what Obama called the "opportunity gap." This means helping minorities stay in school and find jobs just like their peers.

On Monday, Obama argued that most Americans share the belief that everyone deserves an equal shot.

"There's a tragic history in this country that has made it tougher for some," he said. "And folks living in those communities, and especially young people living in those communities, could use some help to change those odds."
