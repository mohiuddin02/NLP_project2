They were there to test a new method of studying the biggest killer of beach swimmers — rip currents.

Again and again, the researchers toted 3-foot yellow-and-green contraptions into the surf. The odd devices were fashioned from foam, plastic sewer pipe, gym weights and cheap GPS units.

They then walked along the beach to wherever the devices washed up and retrieved them as puzzled sunbathers looked on.

Rip currents are blamed for killing 62 beachgoers in North Carolina since 1999. They are thought to be responsible for 80 percent of all U.S. surf rescues, and are by far the most common reason that coastal swimmers drown.

## "Frightening For Swimmers"

"It's really frightening for swimmers," said Simon Sanders, the ocean rescue supervisor for Carolina Beach. "It's like an endless treadmill for them."

The vast majority of his lifeguards' rescues, he said, were because of rip currents. The lifeguards themselves know how to deal with the currents, and often use them to zip out more quickly to swimmers in trouble.

The nature of perilous currents seems straightforward: Water piles up between the beach and an offshore sandbar. It then finds a low point in the bar and rushes back out to sea, sometimes carrying swimmers with it.

Scientists, however, have only recently begun figuring out the life-and-death details. The 22 "data-logging drifters" that the team on the beach released Wednesday are thought to be the first ever used on the U.S. East Coast.

The team hopes the research will lead to more accurate ways of predicting rip currents. Perhaps too it will lead to better methods of escaping them.

## Gathering Information

The devices float along more or less as swimmers would and let researchers precisely and repeatedly track where the rip currents take them. They also gather other information on the currents' behavior.

On Wednesday, the surf was calm: The likelihood of dangerous rip currents was at the lowest of three risk levels that the National Weather Service uses for predictions. The group had set up right in front of a rip current that had been seen in the same location for weeks.

The rip current clearly was happening. A dark patch of more or less calm water showed where the current split the surf on its way out to sea. The current was weak, though, and several swimmers and surfers bobbed cheerfully right in the middle of it.

The lack of danger actually underlined one reason why research on rip currents is important: They are unpredictable.

The currents develop constantly. Nonetheless, a given stretch of beach in North Carolina may develop them only rarely. The right combination of conditions to create dangerously strong ones may exist for only five to 10 days a year in any one location. Such conditions include wave size and frequency, tides and sandbar shape.

Spencer Rogers, who led the construction of the drifters, said currents are "almost never dangerous." When they are, though, champion swimmer "Michael Phelps couldn't keep up with one." Phelps has won more Olympic medals than anyone else.

## Should I Swim Or Should I Float?

The research also could lead to different advice about how to behave when caught in a rip current.

One of the volunteers Wednesday was Ron Brander, a highly respected coastal researcher from Australia.

Brander believes the standard advice on how to escape rip currents is wrong. Swimmers have long been told to swim parallel to the beach until they are out of the relatively narrow band of flowing water.

Brander, an expert on surf behavior, said that in many cases the currents form circular movements of water. Known as eddies, these will return you to the beach if you simply float along with the flow.

The chances of that working in the currents studied were perhaps 80 percent to 90 percent.

Experts are now debating whether to continue advising people to swim parallel to shore. Some feel swimmers should instead be told to float and wait.

## Fatal Reaction

Of course, in a handful of cases swimmers would be shot straight out and not returned to the shore. For weak swimmers, that could prove fatal.

Meanwhile, Brander said, the advice for beachgoers is pretty simple: If you know how to spot the tell-tale darker water and flatter surf of a rip current and are a good enough swimmer to get out of one, fine. If not, find a spot on a beach near a lifeguard or don't go in the water past your knees.

It's not so much the rip current itself that kills many of those who drown, Brander said. It's the panic that getting caught in one triggers.

His latest research includes polling people who have been caught in rip currents. The aim is to learn more about the experience and what that might tell researchers about how to improve beach safety.

Brander thinks rip currents aren't treated seriously enough.

"In Australia," he said, "they don't get much attention." Rip currents "only kill one or two people at a time," so no one worries about them too much. Nonetheless, "they kill more people than cyclones, bush fires, floods and sharks combined."
