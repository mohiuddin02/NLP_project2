SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — Close to 1 million people will descend on San Francisco in early February for the Super Bowl. In addition to the football game, they can enjoy a music performance by Alicia Keys, local art, and a fireworks display. What they won't see much of are homeless people.

In recent weeks, San Francisco has sent workers to a part of town called The Embarcadero to help the homeless find shelter. The city is creating a Super Bowl City in the area. The free fan village will feature concerts, interactive games and player appearances. It will be among the main images broadcast of San Francisco. If the city's plan succeeds, the homeless will head to shelters where they can connect with social services.

Jennifer Friedenbach works at the San Francisco-based Coalition on Homelessness. "When a lot of cameras are going to be pointed on the city, they want to have an image of the city that does not include poverty," said Friedenbach. "They want to ... create an illusion that poverty does not exist by removing poor people from the vicinity of the Super Bowl party."

## Panel's Goal: "Safe, Secure, Sanitary"

Homelessness in San Francisco is an ongoing problem. It has worsened as a technology boom drawing thousands of well-paid workers has raised housing costs to some of the highest in the United States. The city now has the eighth-worst homeless rate in the nation.

Starting on Jan. 30, access to the site will be controlled through four security checkpoints. The CBS television network will broadcast from the village, which is near a pier where 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle was shot to death last year. Police have arrested and charged a homeless immigrant in her killing.

David Perry is on the Super Bowl host committee. At a community meeting, he said that they will be working more than usual in the next few weeks. "There will be more street teams going out to assist people who don't have a place to stay," Perry said. "San Francisco is also committed to making sure that the experience for Super Bowl is safe, secure and sanitary."

## Mayor Was Clear, Supervisor Says

Supervisor Jane Kim said the message she got from Mayor Ed Lee's office is that the city is specifically targeting the site for homeless services because of the Super Bowl. She said taxpayers should not be on the hook for a corporate marketing event. The game itself will take place Feb. 7 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, south of San Francisco.

Kim said that the city should provide these services all the time. The city should not provide such services simply because it expects a surge in tourists.

Rachael Kagan works for the city's health department. "It will be very different than usual for the next few weeks, and the team made sure that the people who live there are aware of that," she said.

Christine Falvey is a spokeswoman for Mayor Lee. She said homeless people are being approached at the festival site with offers of shelter and longer-term housing because of the winter weather. Falvey denied the city is specifically targeting the homeless around the site because of plans to build Super Bowl City.

## Weather Cited As City's Motivation

"It's associated with cold, wet winter," Falvey said. "It is dangerous and unhealthy to live on our streets."

Christopher James, 33, is homeless in San Francisco. He said he has not been approached by city officials and even if he were, he doesn't know where he would go.

"Shelters are nasty," James said.

San Francisco, the 13th-biggest U.S. city by population, had an estimated 6,775 homeless in 2015, with 64 percent living outside of shelters, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

San Francisco's Public Works department collects data about the city. According to its data, since 2012, public complaints about feces, urine, and other substances and materials have doubled to 16,530\. Complaints about homeless camps have quadrupled to 3,509.

Jackie Jenks works at Hospitality House, based in San Francisco. Hospitality House runs a shelter that can house 30 men. She said there are 500 to 700 people on the waiting list for shelter at any given time.

"We are definitely in favor of any new place where we can get folks off the street," she said.
