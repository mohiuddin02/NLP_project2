ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Oogruk is a bearded seal. Oogruk have long hairs growing near their mouth like a cat.

The oogruk live in the Arctic. The Arctic is water and land that is far north. Part of the state of Alaska is in the Arctic.  

Oogruk is the Inuit name for the seals. The Inuit are native people. They are sometimes called Eskimos. They live in the Arctic. 

John Goodwin is an Inuit. He lives in a city called Kotzebue, Alaska. John hunts oogruk for food. 

## Melting Ice Shortens Hunting Time

Seals rest and have their babies on the sea ice. The ice breaks up when winter ends. Then John can get his boat into the water. John has a short time to hunt. When the ice is gone the seals swim farther away.

Hunting used to last for many weeks. The ice was thick, so the seals would stay longer. John says it turns to water quickly now. He says there is not enough time to hunt. Inuit like John want to protect their way of life. 

Scientists think that the ice is turning to water faster because it is warmer. They say it is mainly because people burn fuel to make power. Burning the fuel makes gases. The gases get stuck in the air. They heat up the Earth. It is called global warming. 

## Inuits Talk To Alaska's Leaders

Global warming is changing the land. The Inuit may not be able to hunt seals soon. Carolina Behe knows about the Inuit. Her job is to look out for them. Carolina says the land needs to be healthy for people to have good food.

Most food in Alaska comes in on boats and airplanes. The Inuit do not like that. They still want to find their own food. Carolina says that big boats hurt seal hunting. They are too noisy. She said the boats poison the water, too.

Inuits talked to Alaska's leaders about global warming and seal hunting. The leaders thought that bringing in food was fine. The Inuits had different ideas.

Leaders will make new laws for the Arctic. Carolina says the Inuit want the leaders to think of them.
