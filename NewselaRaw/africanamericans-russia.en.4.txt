MOSCOW — Growing up in Russia, Emilia Tynes-Mensah did the same things other children did. She read the books of Russian authors. She listened to Russian classical music.

In her home, though, there was also American music. There were Thanksgiving celebrations too. Soul food sometimes replaced Russian beet soup.

That is because her father, George Tynes, was an African-American from Virginia. He moved to Russia in 1931.

Tynes was not alone. During the 1920s and 1930s, hundreds of blacks traveled to Russia.

"My father didn't know anything about this country. He didn't know what to expect," Tynes-Mensah, age 73, said as she sat in her Moscow apartment.

## Better Pay, Cheap Houses

Most African-Americans who came to Russia were seeking a better life. They were hoping to escape the racism they faced in the United States.

Today, fewer than 50 of their descendants still live in Russia.

Once, Russia was eager to bring in skilled foreigners. Thousands of Americans came to work in Russia during the 1930s. Among them were several hundred African-Americans.

The African-Americans who came to Russia were highly educated. They included engineers, teachers, entertainers, journalists and lawyers.

Russia gave them special treatment. They received big paychecks, cheap homes and free vacations.

## Fitting In With Russian Society

Tynes-Mensah said her father felt that Russia treated him better than America. "He was happy here."

Tynes was an agricultural expert. Nonetheless, back in America he could only find work washing dishes, his daughter said. So he jumped at the chance to go to Russia.

Most of the African-Americans who came to Russia had very good experiences. In turn, they added to Russian society. African-American agricultural experts helped come up with different uses for plants. They also helped to develop new plants that were cheaper to grow.

Tynes was sent to farms to teach people how to raise ducks and other waterfowl. He became well known as an expert.

There were never many African-Americans in Russia. However, they got a lot of attention.

## Times Have Changed In Russia

Eventually, such attention became unwelcome. After the leader Josef Stalin came to power, foreigners were no longer trusted. People who were not citizens were ordered to leave the country.

Things only got worse after 1947. From 1947 to 1991, the United States and Russia were involved in the Cold War. There was no military fighting, but the two countries became enemies and made threats aimed at each other.

African-Americans still living in Russia were not treated well during this time. However, this was not because they were black, but because they were foreigners.

Today, many Africans have moved to Russia. Racism is now a problem there.

Tynes-Mensah is half African-American. Her mother was Russian-Ukrainian. Growing up in Russia, she realized that people saw her as different from most Russians.

"I was afraid to go out in public," said Tynes-Mensah, who has light brown skin and a short Afro. "People used to stare — but it was curiosity. They were not angry."

Tynes-Mensah lives most of the year in the United States now, but still spends summers in Russia.
