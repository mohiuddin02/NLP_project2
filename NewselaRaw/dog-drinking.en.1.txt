Dogs don't have a reputation for drinking gracefully. If you place a bowl of water in front of a thirsty canine, you're likely to see much of it splashed on the floor. However, researchers who study how different animals drink water are learning that dogs might actually have a clever strategy all their own.

The research provides new ideas on the basic — and mysterious — animal behavior of drinking water. These new scientific findings were described at the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in San Francisco.

Different animals have distinct strategies when it comes to getting a mouthful of water, according to research co-author Sunghwan Jung, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech University.

Some animals, like humans, use suction to drink liquids, using our cheeks like a vacuum by creating negative pressure in our mouths. The negative pressure is what allows us to suck liquid from the lip of a cup or through a straw.

## Open Wide

Carnivores, including animals from the canine and feline families such as wolves and lions, do not have complete cheeks. Not having complete cheeks is beneficial for catching prey since it allows carnivores to open their mouths very wide. But it prevents their lips from closing fully to create suction. So instead of sucking up water, carnivores have to use their tongues to lap at liquid and bring it toward their mouths.

Using a tongue to get water into your mouth may not seem like the most efficient way of getting it in, but in 2010, Jung and his research colleagues showed that cats at least have a surprisingly effective way of drinking water.

Cats extend their tongues in a J shape, barely flicking the surface of their water with the tongue. Then they quickly move their tongue upward over and over again, each time pulling a stream of water up into the air. They close their mouths over part of the stream when it becomes tall enough. Scientists believe that mastering this skill is the secret to cats' efficient drinking skills.

## Dogs Dive In

Some researchers used to think that dogs used their tongues to simply scoop up water like a ladle, rather than manipulating it in complex ways like a cat. Now they say that's not the case at all.

The researchers recorded canines drinking water from above and below the water's surface using a video camera. They mimicked and modeled dog behavior to learn more about how the animals were sucking up water. To do so, researchers created glass tubes that copied the shape of a dog's tongue. They dunked the tubes in the water in the same way dogs did.

There were some important distinctions between dog and cat drinking strategies. Dogs extended more of their tongues, which allowed them to whack more of the water's surface, then used their tongues to pull the water up into a column at an extremely fast rate — the acceleration of water upward was five to eight times faster than gravity when changing from downward to upward. That's a much faster rate than cats move their tongues when drinking, according to Jung. While cats barely flick the water, dogs use a wide cross-section of the tongue to plunge into the liquid.

## One Question Remains

However, both dogs and cats time one key drinking movement in the same way — just before the stream of water they have flicked up is about the collapse, they snap their mouths closed around the liquid. This allows them to capture the maximum amount of water.

"Dogs use a very smart (mechanism) to optimize their drinking," Jung said.

Despite the new research, the question still remains: why did cats evolve to be such dainty drinks while dogs are sloppier animals? Presently, there is no way to know for certain, but Jung said it might be because cats dislike water while many dogs love it.
