The man who spilled the beans about the U.S. government's secret spy programs that gather data about people's telephone calls and Internet use is trying to keep his own secret from the government: Just where exactly is Edward Snowden?

Snowden's attempt to avoid facing criminal charges in the United States has become an international game of hide-and-seek, with the U.S. getting little help from Hong Kong and Russia.

U.S. authorities want to arrest Snowden on charges of espionage and theft, and have canceled his passport.

Snowden, 29, has received help fromWikiLeaks, the group that leaked the secrets of governments of many countries over the Internet. WikiLeaks' leader, Julian Assange, has been living under asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for a year, trying to avoid legal problems of his own.

## Snowden Seeks Asylum In Ecuador

Assange faces arrest and extradition to Sweden to face a sexual assault investigation, and possible extradition to the United States for an investigation into WikiLeaks, if he leaves the embassy. He has denied the sexual assault allegations.

With WikiLeaks' help, Snowden has also sought asylum in Ecuador.

"The WikiLeaks legal team and I are interested in preserving Mr. Snowden's rights and protecting him as a person. What is being done to Mr. Snowden and to Mr. Julian Assange -- for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest -- is an assault against the people," WikiLeaks legal director Baltasar Garzon said.

On Friday, the United States said that it was seeking to extradite Snowden -- to legally bring him to the country to the face charges against him. U.S. officials have also canceled Snowden's passport, which would make it more difficult for him to travel between countries.

Snowden was in Hong Kong, where he had lived for a few weeks while disclosing the secret National Security Agency spy programs to the _Guardian _and _The Washington Post_.

His leaks sparked a worldwide debate over how far U.S. security officials could go to gather information to try to prevent terror attacks. And can that include monitoring the phone and Internet use of foreigners and its own citizens?

## Hong Kong Lets Snowden Fly

To the Obama administration's chagrin, Hong Kong let Snowden fly to Russia on Sunday. Hong Kong authorities said they had asked the United States for more information about the request to extradite Snowden. Hong Kong said it could not legally stop him from leaving.

U.S. officials have expressed their displeasure with Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and with China itself. They said that they were answering Hong Kong's questions when Snowden left.

Once he arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, things became even more interesting. There is no direct flight from Moscow to Ecuador. Reports said that Snowden was taking a flight to Cuba on Monday.

The gate where the flight was boarding was mobbed by reporters and television cameras. Some went as far as to book seats on the flight. But Snowden never boarded the aircraft.

The _New York Times_ said that Snowden has not been seen publically, or photographed, since he arrived in Moscow.

Assange told reporters via telephone on Monday that Snowden was "healthy and safe," but would not say where he was.

## Russia Playing Coy

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday said that Russia should turn Snowden over. "I would urge them to live by the standards of the law because that is in the interest of everybody," he said.

But Russian officials were playing coy. "Overall, we have no information about him," Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary told Reuters.

Ecuador confirmed that it has received Snowden's request for asylum. It said it will make a decision in due time, taking into account Ecuadorian and international law.

How can Snowden travel at all without a valid U.S. passport? Assange told the _New York Times_ that WikiLeaks arranged for Ecuador to issue Snowden a "special refugee travel document" a week ago. The organization had expected that United States would file charges against Snowden.

Whether the document will help Snowden obtain passage depends on the rules of the airline he choses, Assange said.

## U.S. Defends Domestic Spying

U.S. officials have defended the gathering of telephone and Internet data. NSA director Keith Alexander said last week that the programs had helped stop more than 50 terror plots worldwide.

But Assange said in a speech published over the weekend that the program shows that government secrecy is growing at the expense of personal privacy.

"The U.S. government is spying on each and every one of us, but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off," he said.
