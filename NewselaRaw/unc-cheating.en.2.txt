RALEIGH, N.C. — The University of North Carolina (UNC) continues to be rocked by the discovery that some students took fake classes and got fake grades. An investigative  report shows there was a worrying lack of supervision by the school's leadership, which allowed the deception to carry on for nearly two decades.

These classes were ended in 2011. UNC is now struggling to deal with the consequences of the scandal.

University leaders, faculty members and staff missed or ignored warning signs that could have stopped the problem years earlier, the investigation found.

More than 3,100 students — about half of them athletes — benefited from the fake classes over the years. The classes were in the African and Afro-American Studies department (AFAM).

## School Waits For More Fallout

The new investigation was led by former U.S. Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein. His report noted that the dummy classes stopped in 2011 and that the university has re-made the department and put new policies in place. Still, the school must wait to see whether the new details will lead to even more troubles.

There are two groups that are watching this cheating scandal at UNC very closely. One is a group that accredits colleges and universities. This group, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' (SACS) Commission on Colleges, examines schools to make sure they are offering a high-quality education. In other words, it accredits them.

The other group, the NCAA, runs college sports. It is examining the scandal in relation to UNC's sports programs to see if athletes received special treatment and whether the school's leaders were really in control.

## A Good Class Grade No Matter What

Carol Folt took over as chancellor of the UNC in 2013. As chancellor, she is the top leader of the university.

"Bad actions of a relatively few number of people were definitely compounded by inaction and the lack of really appropriate checks and balances," Folt said. "And it was together that really allowed this to persist for such a length of time."

The report provided disturbing details: athletic counselors encouraged athletes to sign up for the fake classes. These classes did not require attendance. Students only had to turn in a research paper at the end. These papers would always receive a grade of A or B, regardless of how good they were.

An office secretary looked over the research papers and signed the department chairman's name to grade lists.

The office secretary and department chairman — Deborah Crowder and Julius Nyang'oro — were at the center of the scheme.

Wainstein's report also said that other school officials had suspicions or concerns but failed to act on them. This allowed the fraud to continue and to escalate.

## What To Do Next

Now, the university is facing questions about its accreditation — whether it is an honest organization that is providing high-quality education to its students.

The SACS' Commission on Colleges had UNC on its watch list until this summer. It also required the school to allow students who took a fake class to take another class for free.

In the next few days, the commission will send UNC a letter asking school leaders to show that they are following standards needed for the group's seal of approval, commission President Belle Wheelan said.

"What we would do is ask them: is this bigger than you thought it was, what are you going to do now? It's a mess," Wheelan said.

At its December meeting, the school's 77-member board will address the issue.

"We are interested in more than anything in making sure that the students don't run into problems trying to explain any degrees that they have after the fact as a result of this," Wheelan said.

## Sports Programs Could Take A Hit

To be accredited, a university must have clear control over all parts of its educational program, including athletics.

For the NCAA investigation, the issue of control is important as well. What coaches knew is a key issue that could lead to sports wins and championships being taken away, or vacated.

"If we go back with the NCAA in our joint review, and ... if we've identified that we have played students who were ineligible, then obviously we would have to vacate wins at that time," UNC Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham said. "But as long as the courses and the credits and everything count to the accrediting agency, we're very comfortable with our certification process — that our students were eligible to compete when they competed."

After years of a hands-off approach by school leaders, the university's fate now lies in the hands of these two groups.

## Missed Chances To Stop It

Both the AFAM department and its chairman were never reviewed by any outsiders. Most academic departments are reviewed every five years, but AFAM wasn't because it did not award degrees to graduate students.

AFAM's Nyang'oro was not reviewed by his peers because he was a department chairman.

Folt said the school would have caught the cheating sooner if it had not been for those two exceptions, which have since been removed.

There were other chances to stop the cheating, and Folt is holding everyone accountable.

"It really isn't something that you could look at as only one thing," the chancellor said. "It had the combination, and that's why we have to make sure we can't be complacent about it. We have to accept full responsibility for it."
