DeKALB COUNTY, Mo. — As Alda Owen works with the cattle, Sweet Baby Jo lies down.

The dog is on her belly, with her ears up. She is wide-eyed and ready to jump.

"She don't like 'em getting too close to me," said Owen, age 62. As she speaks, the herd of cattle crowds around her.

Not long ago, Sweet Baby Jo came to the farm Owen owns with her husband, Rick, and changed her life. The dog came from a project called PHARM Dog. It stands for Pets Helping Agriculture in Rural Missouri.

## Program Focuses On Farmers

Many other programs around the country train service dogs. This one may be the only one its kind. Service dogs are trained to help people living with physical problems and other needs. PHARM Dog is specifically for farmers who do not want to give up farm life because of physical problems or sickness.

When Owen was 10, she lost most of her vision from an infection. Sweet Baby Jo helps her still work her farm.

"I can get out and help Rick now," she said. "I can get the cows in the lot while he goes gets a bale of hay."

## "All He Cares About Is Helping Me"

And there is Jim Harig, age 70. He keeps horses, donkeys, sheep, mules and alpacas on his farm. Once he could hardly get around his farm. Now every morning, he holds onto a harness on the back of his yellow Labrador, Dixon, and checks them all. The dog is like a four-legged cane.

"All he cares about is helping me," Harig said.

Dixon can carry buckets, bring tools and open gates.

"If I had to sell my animals, I think I'd lose the ambition to live," Harig said.

## Farmers Just Want To Keep Farming

Jackie Allenbrand started PHARM Dog. She says people ask her why farmers do not just leave their farms when they get sick.

"But here's the thing about farmers — and I'm married to one — they're stubborn," Allenbrand said. "It's what they do. Most were born into it and they don't want to give it up."

Troy Balderston, who also has a PHARM dog, put it this way. "I don't know anything else."

## Money Is The Biggest Challenge

Allenbrand got the idea while working for another program. It helps farmers live with physical problems and keep working.

For Allenbrand, the big challenge was money. She needed dogs and training for free.

That is how she came to meet Bobby Miller one day. He trains border collies, like Sweet Baby Jo.

That night, Miller told his wife that he would help PHARM Dog.

So he called Allenbrand to let her know. Soon she showed up with an old wheelchair.

"She told me the dogs needed to get used to it," Miller said. "So I'd sit in that thing and pups would climb on my lap."

## Dogs Make The Difference

On a recent morning, Owen jumped into her truck and drove over to her cattle. Sweet Baby Jo rode in the back, face in the wind and excited to be going to work. Owen looked at the cattle gathered under trees.

"I couldn't be out here if not for" Sweet Baby Jo, Owen said.

Allenbrand wants PHARM Dog to grow. She would like to train more dogs and send them to more states.

"If I can do anything to help these farmers stay put, that's what I want to do," she said. "Same for everybody involved in this — we're all farmers ourselves."
