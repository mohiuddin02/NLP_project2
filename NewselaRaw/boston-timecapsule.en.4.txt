Workers found a 200-year-old time capsule in Boston on Thursday.

No one knows exactly what is inside the box. Experts have an idea. They think it may contain coins from 1652. There also may be a silver plate, newspapers and cards.

The capsule was found in bricks from the Massachusetts State House. It was put there in 1795. America's famous patriots Samuel Adams and Paul Revere were there. Paul Revere made a famous horseback ride in 1775. He warned people that the British were coming to attack.

"It's exciting," Bill Galvin said. He is a Massachusetts official. "The history of Massachusetts is the history of America," he said.

## Small Box Holds Big History

Workers found the box while they were trying to fix a water leak. It took them a day to dig it out. The box was small. It is 5 inches wide and 7 inches long.  Officials hope to X-ray the box over the weekend. They will probably open it this week.

Less than half a mile away is the Old State House. The building was built in 1713. At the time, England was in charge of Massachusetts. The Declaration of Independence from England was read from the building's balcony in 1776.

Three months ago, workers found another old time capsule there.

This time capsule was hidden in a lion statue. There were more treasures in it. There was a piece of an older lion statue from the 1700s. An envelope was also in the box. On the outside of the envelope was a note. The note said there was a message to the future inside. The envelope, though, was empty.

Heather Leet said she thinks the empty envelope was a joke. She is with a group called the Boston Society. They are helping to fix up the Old State House.

## New Notes To The Future

This fall, Leet's group made a new time capsule. They put an Apple iPhone 5 and Red Sox baseball tickets inside. They also added part of a 1713 brick from the old building.

In November, the group put the time capsule back into the statue. The capsule will wait there for the next person to find it.
