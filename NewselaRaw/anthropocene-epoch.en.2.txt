A great deal can change in 4 1/2 billion years. 

That is about how old the Earth is, and in its long history, continents have shifted, species have flourished and died out, and ice ages have come and gone. 

Geologists are scientists who study the history of the Earth by examining clues in rock and soil. These clues, when taken together, tell the story of how the planet has changed over time.

## Many Chapters In Earth's History Book

They divide this story into different chapters, based on the major phases the planet has gone through. First, geologists have split the planet's history into eons, each of which represents an overarching phase in the planet's development. Each eon is made up of a few eras. Eras are made up of periods, and periods are made up of epochs. While epochs are short compared with eons, they still usually last millions of years.

We are currently in the Holocene epoch, which began about 11,750 years ago when the most recent ice age ended. This brought about a series of massive geologic changes that shaped the Earth as we know it.

Geologists are now debating whether a new epoch is upon us. Some believe that human beings have fundamentally changed the Earth. They argue that we are now living in a new epoch, which they call the Anthropocene.

## Humans Have Been Reshaping Earth

Jan Zalasiewicz is a geologist at Leicester University in England. He and a group of scientists have just published a new report in the magazine Science. They make the case for the Anthropocene.

The scientists presented evidence that major changes have been taking place on Earth because of human activity. "A real geological phenomenon is taking place, it is still going on. In many respects, it's accelerating even as we speak," Zalasiewicz says.

One major change has to do with global warming. Humans burn fuels to power cars and factories, which adds carbon dioxide gas to the atmosphere at ever-increasing rates. The added carbon dioxide is causing global temperatures to rise, which may lead to enormous environmental changes. 

Meanwhile, as the population has grown and technology has advanced, humanity has begun to reshape the environment on a massive scale. For example, humans have now made enough concrete to encase the entire world. People have also created materials that never existed before, like copper alloys and plastics. Some of these materials will last for hundreds of years, and more are produced each year.

## New Epoch Birthdate Proposed

As a result of human activity, Zalasiewicz argues that the Earth now works and looks differently. He thinks that the changes are so dramatic that the planet has entered a new epoch, one that is distinct from the Holocene.

Key questions remain, however. If the Earth has entered into a new epoch, when did it start? This question comes down to when the recent geologic changes really began. Perhaps the epoch began thousands of years ago when our ancient ancestors started farming or burning the land. Or perhaps it began more recently. 

Some, including Zalasiewicz, have proposed a very exact start date for the Anthropocene: July 16, 1945, the date of the first test of an atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico. This marked the beginning of the spread of rare radioactive elements like plutonium around the globe, which altered the planet in a way that will be detectable for at least 100,000 years.

Scientist hope that more research will allow them to better understand the geological effects that humans have caused. For example, geologists would like to examine the land forming off the California coast to look for plutonium and soot. "That is science that will need some organization and some money," Zalasiewicz noted.

## Scientists Remain Divided

Not everyone agrees that we are entering into a new epoch at all, however. "Many find it difficult to accept that an epoch that is so short can be recognized," said Colin Waters of the British Geological Survey, the lead author of the new report.

Some scientists doubt whether humans have really changed the planet enough to trigger a new epoch. Others think that it is too soon to declare a new epoch, as big changes like mass extinctions and the effects of climate change have not yet happened. 

For now, thinking on the Anthropocene remains divided. With the release of his new study, Zalasiewicz is looking to promote further discussion among his fellow scientists. "We are putting together ideas and then hoping to gather responses from people who can give us some sensible feedback," he said.
