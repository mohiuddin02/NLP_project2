ST. PAUL, Minn. — Kadra Mohamed walks into the Grocery and Meat Market on this city's north side. Mohamed is a regular here — she grew up in a public housing project nearby and has been shopping here since she was a girl.

In the store, Mohamed breathes in the smell of spices and the bread she has loved since she was a child. They are the aromas of Somalia, the east African country where her mother was born.

The market's owner, Abdi Mohamed, steps out to greet her.

"Kadra, it's you," he says in the rhythmic Somali language. He asks about her mother, and then pauses. "It's good to see you in uniform."

## Trying To Ease Tensions

Kadra Mohamed, 22, is a new cop on the street. As a community officer, Mohamed often pays visits to local business owners, an important part of community policing. Mohamed is doing traditional police work, but at the same time, she's breaking new ground. She is the first female Somali officer in the St. Paul Police Department.

In the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, there are more than 80,000 Somali Americans. It's the nation's largest Somali community. Relations between the large immigrant community and the city can be tense. Having police officers like Mohamed is one step toward reducing that tension.

When Mohamed puts on her crisp blue-and-white uniform, straps on her thick leather belt and handcuffs, she also puts on her hijab, the traditional headscarf worn in public by many Muslim women.

Not everyone in this Midwestern city of 290,000 has been supportive. One blogger objected to Mohamed wearing a hijab while on duty. The St. Paul Police Department "has placed her life on the line in more ways than one," he wrote.

## Shirts, Pants, No Apologies

Some police officers have complained that by wearing a hijab, Mohamed is breaking the traditional uniform code.

St. Paul Police Assistant Chief Todd Axtell said all rules, even uniform codes, are made to be changed. "In the early 1970s, you had to be at least 5-foot-8 to become a St. Paul police officer," said Axtell, who is 5-foot-7. "If that rule hadn't been changed, I wouldn't be here today."

Some criticism of Mohamed has come from within the Somali-American community. Older Somalis say she's breaking cultural traditions: wearing pants and short-sleeve shirts, and working closely among men in public. After Mohamed passes her police exams, she will apply for a job as a sworn officer, meaning she would carry a gun.

Mohamed doesn't apologize for going into police work. She once wanted to be a lawyer, but changed her goal to police work because she wanted to help her community.

She may be especially needed more now than ever in the Somali community. There has been a rise in Somali street gangs such as the St. Pistol Boys and Somali Outlaws. Other Somali American young people have left Minnesota to fight with extremist groups in Somalia, Syria and Iraq.

## "Mystery To Both Cultures"

The tension between Somalis, many of whom are Muslim, and the city is as high as it's ever been since 2001, some say.

Then comes Mohamed. "[She] has defied logic for whites and Somali alike," said local activist Omar Jamal. "She's a mystery to both cultures."

Mohamed was born in a refugee camp in Kenya in 1991, after her parents fled Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, and its violent chaos. Her Ethiopian father, Hassan, and her Somali mother, Zamzam, were joined by an arranged marriage.

"Love takes time," Mohamed said. "Their relationship started off cordially, then a friendship developed before they grew into loving one another. They got lucky."

The family eventually moved to the Twin Cities, an area with a reputation for welcoming new immigrants. Mohamed's parents had four more children — two boys and two girls.

Her father, an immigration case worker, died when she was 12, and Mohamed grew up fast.

## "They Think She's Crazy"

Mohamed was attending St. Cloud State University outside the Twin Cities when she decided to start wearing a hijab. She quickly learned about racism, as strangers told her to "take the towel off your head," and "go back to your terror state."

As a community police officer, Mohamed is often called on to translate, but most of her duties involve showing a friendly face in public housing projects, where many poor immigrants live. She often rides with her partner, Tom Lee, 24, who works with the Hmong community of southeast Asian immigrants.

Walking through a community barbecue at a housing complex, Mohamed runs into a high school friend, Nada Mohamed, who is also wearing a hijab. Nada is proud of her friend, but said older members of the Somali community don't always agree.

"They think she's crazy," she says. "They don't think a Muslim woman should be a police officer, no matter if she wears a hijab or not."

Mohamed is set on becoming a sworn police officer, even if her mother insists she won't let a gun in the house. "I tell her, 'Mom, you've been though a civil war, how can you be afraid of guns?'"

One day, Mohamed might be working to fight gangs or to identify people who may be extremists in her community. She's not afraid of arresting a Somali man, something that would be unthinkable in traditional Somali culture that is dominated by men.

"I'll speak to him in our language — Somali to Somali," she says. "I'll explain that this is my job. He broke the law and there are steps that must be taken."
