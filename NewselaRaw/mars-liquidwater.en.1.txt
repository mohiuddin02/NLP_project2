NASA announced new evidence that could confirm there is liquid water on Mars, increasing the possibility that future astronauts journeying to the Red Planet could rely on the planet's own water for their drinking needs.

Liquid water is a popular topic, said Lujendra Ojha, the Georgia Tech Ph.D. candidate who led the research. "We're like the thousandth time someone has discovered water on Mars."

There's a good reason that liquid water is so popular: Mars is now the only planet in our solar system to show evidence of water on its surface, other than Earth. Other worlds have water in subsurface oceans, or scattered around as vapor in the atmosphere. But Mars is the only place where there is solid evidence for liquid that sits right there in the open air.

## Where There's Water, Could There Be Life?

It would be a major leap to suggest that Mars may have life on it, even microbial life. But liquid water at least makes it possible that parts of the planet are livable.

The study builds on research from last April. Scientists using information from the Curiosity rover noted that the planet had the seasonal potential for liquid water. The Curiosity rover is a robotic, automated vehicle that explored Mars. Because of the extremely low pressure on Mars, water has a boiling point of just a few degrees Celsius, after which it evaporates. The April study noted the presence of perchlorates - a kind of salt - which could make the boiling point of Mars's water much higher, theoretically allowing it to remain liquid. They proposed that the planet's temperature would be right for liquid, perchlorate-filled water to form every day during winter and spring.

In theory, water that periodically turned liquid before evaporating could form geographic features. Such features are often spotted on the planet and look like the slow movement of dark, damp sand, which are called recurring slope lineae (RSL).

## Evidence Builds

In the new study, published Monday in Nature Geoscience, a different group of researchers took the search for perchlorates one step further. They went looking for them in the very RSL features thought to be formed by salty liquid. They found perchlorates in abundance, and it seems like they have been getting hydrated.

Ojha and his colleagues used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to check out the chemical composition of the wet-looking streaks. The MRO is a spacecraft designed to study Mars from high up in the orbit. They used a method called spectroscopy, which keeps track of what type of light an object absorbs to make conclusions about its composition. With this method, scientists can identify glass, ice and other substances from miles above the surface.

"We're going to places where we thought we were seeing the presence of water and finding chemical evidence of perchlorates," Ojha said. And the correlation goes further than that: The hydrated salts seem to disappear in areas where RSL were not forming anymore, or were shrinking.

"We're observing the leftover molecules of water in the salt," Ojha said. "We're finding evidence that they're getting hydrated."

## Still More Work To Be Done

Morten Bo Madsen of the University of Copenhagen, who co-authored the April study, but was not involved in the latest work, said the new results were significant. "(The) flow of liquid salty water is no longer just a possibility, it does actually occur," he told The Washington Post. "The results shows that liquid does indeed flow on Mars today."

Ojha's work confirms that hydrated salts seem very likely to have something to do with the formation of the wet-looking streaks on Mars. But there is more work to do to confirm the presence of liquid water itself. Ojha pointed out that the MRO's resolution is too low to pick up many of the smaller "wet" features on Mars, and that a new orbiter could get even more information. The MRO only allows us to examine Mars's surface at what Ojha believes is the driest point in the day. Eventually, the hope is that a rover can take a closer look at the streaks themselves.

## Not So Science Fiction Anymore

If liquid is truly forming on the surface because of these salts, it could still easily evaporate - it should evaporate at just 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) or so. But it could create pockets of the planet where microbes can survive, even today.

In theory, it could be extracted and used by astronauts on a Mars mission. Perchlorates could be helpful in their own right, too. They can be used to make rocket propellant.

"If we ever go there, we could probably utilize this. We wouldn't have to bring tons of water," Ojha said. "This stuff seems like science fiction, but in 100 years or so it could be fact."
