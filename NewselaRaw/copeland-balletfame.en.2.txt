NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” Misty Copeland is not just a ballerina. She has also been on television, in a play, and she is the star of her own movie. On top of all that, Copeland has just made history. She the first African-American lead ballerina in a famous ballet company.

Copeland is 33 years old. Just this year, she has done all of those things, and even had dinner at the White House.

She is just starting her first season as a principal ballerina with the American Ballet Theatre. A star of a ballet company who dances in leading parts is a principal dancer.

Copeland is also an example to many people. The American Ballet Theatre has existed for 75 years, and she is its first African-American female principal dancer.

## Dancing And Not Letting The Pain Show

Just a couple of days before she was given her new title, she starred in a show called "Swan Lake." Copeland played Odette and Odile, two girls who look alike, so they are danced by the same ballerina. It is a hard part for any dancer, and it was especially hard for Copeland because the world was watching.

During "Swan Lake," Copeland also faced another challenge. She was in pain, and hardly anyone watching even knew it. Copeland had an operation three years ago to fix a number of cracks in her leg bone. She says,"It's been three years and I'm still not jumping fully."

In "Swan Lake," she dances many difficult steps on her injured leg, Copeland says. She also says that the people watching are not supposed to know that she is hurt. "We're on stage presenting this beautiful, effortless experience for the audience," she adds.

## Filmmaker Offers To Tell Ballerina's Story

Nelson George makes movies. He saw Copeland dance when her leg was still hurt, and he noticed that she was in pain. After Copeland had her operation, George suggested that they make a documentary movie to tell her story.

They made a movie called "A Ballerina's Tale." The movie shows her first dance class after the operation, and a dance that she performed by herself. She says that she was not at her best. "It's so hard to watch!" Copeland says. "But it was just something I had to do."

She also worried that the audience did not see a good performance, and that they did not know that she had an operation. "This may be the first time and the last time they will see me perform," she says.

The movie shows that Copeland felt lonely and doubted herself because many of the ballet dancers that she worked with were white. In the movie, she says that some people think she pays too much attention to the fact that she is an African-American ballerina. She says, "It's brought up to me all the time that I focus too much on that. I'm a black ballerina. It's the fact that I am an African-American woman that makes it a feat." A feat is a big achievement. The movie is opening on screens around the country this week.

## The Higher She Rises, The Less She Dances

Copeland is excited to be a principal dancer, but she says that she actually gets to dance less. There are many principals who want the starring parts.

For now, she will try to dance as much as she can and fit in the rest when possible. She has been busy lately, including starring in a Broadway play for two weeks. Many famous plays are shown in the area of New York City known as Broadway.

Copeland may try Broadway again someday, but for now she is only thinking about ballet. She says she cannot go off to do different things, and show up to dance whenever she wants. "It just doesn't work that way," she says. Still, she adds, "It's not a hard balance. The dance is always first."
