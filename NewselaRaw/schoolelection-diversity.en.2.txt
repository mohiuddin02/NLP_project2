SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. â€” The principal at a mostly Hispanic middle school in San Francisco, California, delayed the results of a student government election. She said the winners did not reflect the school's diverse student body. The decision turned the election into a debate about how democracy should work.

Everett Middle School Principal Lena Van Haren announced the winners more than a week after the results were known. She said that she did not mean the votes did not count, but she wanted to first have a discussion with all the candidates. Van Haren wanted them to talk about how to ensure that underrepresented groups were heard. An underrepresented group is one that makes up a larger part of the student population than is shown in the election results.

One idea was to add representatives to the student council, she said.

"I apologized to parents for causing any anxiety," she said. "I was never planning on changing the elections."

## Hispanics, Blacks Lack Representation

The school of about 500 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders is 56 percent Hispanic or Latino and 9 percent African-American, according to the California Department of Education. The school is in the city's Mission District. Workers at technology companies have moved into the neighborhood, changing it. With the high salaries they receive, they can pay more for apartments. Rents in the area have shot up. The neighborhood is becoming more expensive, and some people are leaving.

Van Haren said African-Americans and Latinos were underrepresented among the students who became president, vice president, treasurer, secretary and representatives for the three grades. Most of the Hispanic or Latino students at the school are native Spanish speakers. They were not represented in the winners, she said.

"I feel really strongly that it's not just about having a diverse student council so it looks nice," she said. "I, as principal, want to elevate student voices and see how they are experiencing school. If I'm missing certain groups, I'm not going to get a clear picture."

## One Parent Versus The Principal

Todd David's son Noah is an eighth-grader at the school. David said the principal hurt the democratic process in the name of social justice.

Van Haren's actions sent an "unfortunate message," he said. The message was that the people elected were not representative of the students, even though the students chose them, he said.

The argument started with an email Van Haren sent to parents. She told them the results had come in, but they did not reflect "the diversity that exists at Everett." She invited all the candidates to meet with school leadership before deciding the next step.

Van Haren said the issue had many sides. As a parent and a principal, she said she believed the school community needed to think before moving ahead. Van Haren said the aim was to have a diverse student council "that is truly representative of all voices at Everett," she wrote.

## A Mother's Hope For Inclusion

Melissa Daar Carvajal has twin sons who are sixth-graders at Everett. She thinks Van Haren may have been wrong to delay announcing the election results. Still, Daar Carvajal thinks her goal of making it a lesson about ensuring that all people are represented was right. The election's outcome shows that some students don't have the money and support they need to run for student council and win, she said.

"I think it's gotten people talking," she said. "I'd like to see them act. I'd like to see them go into the school and support the kind of democracy we all want."
