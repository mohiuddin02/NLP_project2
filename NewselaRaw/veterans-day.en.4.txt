Veterans Day is the day the United States thanks people who served in the military. When New Yorkers gave thanks on Monday, the nation's first four-star female general led them. It was a sign of how the military has changed.

Officials across the nation placed wreaths on monuments. The wreaths honor those who served in wars during the nation's history. Officials also pushed for more jobs for veterans.

"We join as one people to honor a debt we can never fully repay," President Barack Obama said. He was at a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, which is in Virginia. It's very close to Washington, D.C.

In New York, Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody led the parade up Fifth Avenue. Dunwoody retired last year. She had been in the army for 37 years. There were 21.2 million military veterans as of 2012 in the United States. Of that group 1.6 million are women, said the government.

## Tomb Of The Unknowns

One ceremony was for two of the original Tuskegee Airmen. This was a group of African-American pilots. They fought in World War II.

The president laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. It honors soldiers who died, but no one knows their names. The tomb is located in Arlington National Cemetery. This is the main part of the country's remembrance. The usual 21-gun salute was fired. The president was joined by representatives of all of the services: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.

Obama also honored one of the nation's oldest veterans. He is Richard Overton, 107.

Earlier, the president hosted a breakfast at the White House. Veterans and their families were invited.

The holiday began as Armistice Day on Nov. 11, 1919. It was meant to remember the end of World War I. Congress created a yearly day to honor the military in 1926. Nov. 11 became a national holiday in 1939.

The holiday became Veterans Day in 1954 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president. Eisenhower had been the commander of all Allied forces in World War II. Veterans Day was designed to remember all those who served in the military. Memorial Day honors those who died while serving. Memorial Day is at the end of May.

Millions of veterans are still alive from many wars. The government says there are 7.4 million veterans from the time of the Vietnam War. Millions are still alive from the Gulf wars, World War II and the Korean War. About 5.3 million veterans served only in peacetime.

## Some Served In More Than One War

The military is becoming a job that more people spend their whole lives doing. So it is more common for soldiers to have served in more than one war.

Veterans have long been a political force within the United States. The Continental Army was disbanded in 1783 after the Treaty of Paris ended the Revolutionary War. But in June, veterans took to the streets demanding back pay. They forced the U.S. Congress to flee from the then-capital of Philadelphia to New Jersey.

The country began paying soldiers extra money in 1776. The money is called a bonus. By 1932, veterans were marching on Washington. They were called the Bonus Army. They wanted bonuses promised to them by the government. At least two veterans died in fights with federal troops.

Modern restaurants and merchants have also offered various bonuses. They give things like free meals to attract veterans' business.

According to the government, 14.7 million veterans voted in the 2012 presidential election. That is a large turnout, since it's more than two-thirds of all veterans.

First lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden asked businesses to hire veterans. Biden is the vice president's wife. They made their case for hiring vets in a newspaper article.
