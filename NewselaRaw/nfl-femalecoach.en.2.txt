TEMPE, Arizona — Jen Welter loves the chance to be a role model for girls. Most of all, she cannot wait to get down to work when the Arizona Cardinals open training camp this weekend.

Welter is taking on a six-week internship position coaching inside linebackers for the Cardinals. She will be there only through training camp and the four preseason games. Nonetheless, it marks another barrier broken for women in sports.

Welter said she never dared imagine coaching in the National Football League.

"I didn't even dream that it was possible," she said at news conference at Cardinals headquarters July 28. "I think the beauty of this is that, though it's a dream I never could have had, now it's a dream other girls can grow up and have.

"She's a trailblazer," Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said.

## She Has Player Experience Too

Team President Michael Bidwill said that Welter has the enthusiastic support of the Cardinals. The team has long been known for hiring minorities who are underrepresented. Bidwill said he spoke Monday night with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who congratulated the Cardinals on the move.

Known as Dr. Jen back in Texas, Welter has a doctorate degree in psychology, which is the study of the human mind and how it works. She also spent a season as a player on a men's team, the Texas Revolution of the Indoor Football League.

There are a lot of people who are better than her at coming up with game plans. "But the heart factor, the intelligent player factor, the being-the-person-with-the-motor-who-won't-quit factor, those are things I know I can add to," she said.

Welter is the latest woman to enter what had been a men-only position. In April, the NFL announced that Sarah Thomas would be the league's first full-time female official. The NBA long has had a female official. Becky Hammon is an assistant with the San Antonio Spurs.

## Time For A New Message

Welter said that for too long girls have been given the wrong message, that it is so important to be pretty.

"We teach them very early on to be pretty, marry well and then act badly and you'll get on TV," Welter said. "That's what they grow up thinking what fame is or success is.

"I want little girls to grow up knowing that when they put their minds to something, when they work hard, they can do anything."

At the NFL owners meetings last March, Arians was asked about women coaching in the league.

"The minute they can prove they can make a player better, they'll be hired," Arians said.

A short time later, the coach of the Texas Revolution men's team got in touch with Arians. He told Arians he knew someone who might be perfect.

Arians called Welter and offered her one of the team's six internships.

## Football As First Love

Welter grew up in Vero Beach, Florida. She told a story about when she could hardly see out of a football helmet. She would have her family drag a mattress outside so she could have the bigger kids tackle her.

She played rugby at Boston College but football was her first love. She spent 14 years as a linebacker, most of them with the Dallas Diamonds of the Women's Football Alliance. She won two gold medals with the American team at the International Federation of American Football women's world championships.

Welter's first check, she said, came in 2004 — for $12, or $1 for each game she played. She still carries the check, which proved she was a pro.

A year ago, the first barrier fell for her. She became the first woman to play a non-kicking position on a men's professional football team. Last February, she became the first woman to coach for a men's professional team when the Revolution made her a coach.

Then Arians called. The two of them met, "and I knew this was the type of person that I was looking for to start this," he said.

Welter's internship will give her on-the-job-training. Arians called it a steppingstone to working full-time for the NFL.

And that is exactly what Welter has her eye on.
