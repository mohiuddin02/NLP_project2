These are people from the Republican group who do not agree with President Barack Obama on many problems. Carly Fiorina used to lead a technology company. Ben Carson used to work as a doctor. Both believe their background can win votes from different groups of people.

Fiorina will probably be the only well-known woman to run for president as a Republican. Carson will probably be the only African-American. They have not worked in government before. They will be competing with people who have worked in government for a long time.

Fiorina, who is 60 years old, announced she is running for president on a morning television news show. She also posted a video. She said her background in business will help her as president. Fiorina said she knows how to make decisions about important things.

She criticized Hillary Clinton, who is also running for president. Clinton is from the Democratic group. The Republican and Democratic groups do not agree with each other on many issues.

## Fiorina Says Democrat Is "Not Trustworthy"

Fiorina said Clinton is not open enough about the things she does. She said Clinton should not have used private email when she had an important government job as secretary of state.

Fiorina said she admires Clinton but that she is "not trustworthy."

On Monday, Carson also made his official announcement in a speech from Detroit where he was born. He is 63 years old.

Both Fiorina and Carson are considered underdogs, which means that they are unlikely to win. They are expected to run against several people who are experienced in government.

The people who want to become president from the Republican group are different from the people who ran for president four years ago. Two of them are trying to become the first Hispanic president. And most of them are young compared to previous presidents.

Republicans say they want a new kind of supporter. A lot of the group's members are older, white men. The group wants more women and people from smaller ethnic groups like Hispanics and African-Americans. President Obama won re-election in 2012 with the strong support of these different groups.

## Carson Spoke Against Health Law

Carson was raised in Detroit by a single mother. He worked as a doctor for almost 30 years. He did not like President Obama's health care law and spoke publicly about it. Many people who do not like the president were happy about what Carson said.

But he has also made some mistakes. Once, he suggested that Obama's health care law was the worst thing since slavery. That was a terrible period in American history. Some people think that was not a good comparison to make.

Fiorina is more likely to be supported by the Republican group. People got to know her in 2010 when she ran for senator in California. She lost, but people learned about who she was.

Both Carson and Fiorina will be traveling to states that vote early.

Carson is planning to go to Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada. Fiorina is scheduled to go to New York City, Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
