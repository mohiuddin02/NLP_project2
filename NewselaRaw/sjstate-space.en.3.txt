SAN JOSE, Calif. — College student Michael Sandoval has made a remarkable discovery: a galaxy — a large group of stars — so dense that it is unlike anything ever seen before.

Galaxies are made up of millions or billions of stars. The stars in a particular group, or system, are held together by gravity. Normally, stars in a system are much farther apart than what Sandoval spotted.

Twenty-one-year-old Sandoval is a student at San Jose State University. Not too long ago, he enrolled in his first class in astrophysics — that is, the study of the stars and planets.

## Let's See What's Out There

Sandoval stumbled upon his unusual find after only a week of looking. He and his professor have named what he spotted a hypercompact cluster. They believe that it is the remains of one galaxy that has been swallowed up by another.

Professor Aaron Romanowsky said it's astounding how quickly his student discovered something so important. "Some people take years and never find" anything, he said.

The search was a welcome distraction for Sandoval: His mother died of cancer in October. In the last years of his mom's life, Sandoval lived at home, juggling her care with his education. At times he had to rush her to the emergency room at night, then drag himself to class the next day.

Several months after his mother died, Sandoval enrolled in Romanowsky's astrophysics course. He soon learned that classmate Richard Vo had discovered something highly unusual: a super-dense dwarf galaxy — possibly the densest ever found. Dwarf galaxies have fewer stars than our own.

Sandoval's thought was immediate: "I want to find one too."

## The Universe Is Full Of Stuff

Sandoval set to work on his laptop. Using pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, he began combing the universe for unusual objects. "I didn't want to be sitting home, feeling sorry for myself," said Sandoval. "That's not what she would have wanted anyway."

Instead, he and Vo are rushing to release their findings together with Romanowsky.

Romanowsky was on a team of scientists that was among the first to discover a dense dwarf galaxy like the one Vo found. They released their findings in September.

But Sandoval's search for the same kind of galaxy turned up something "weird," Romanowsky said. It was unlike anything he had ever seen.

Think of a dwarf galaxy as being like an apple core, Romanowsky said. What Sandoval found is like the seeds. In other words, it is even smaller and denser.

Until recently, scientists hadn't even thought to look for these dense star systems.

"It's something that's been hiding in plain sight," Romanowsky said.

The new discoveries could lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe.

## Science Really Is Cool

Both students were so passionate about the project, Romanowsky said, that they were pushing him, not the other way around. "They're sending me emails at midnight: 'Professor, will you send me more' information?" he said.

Experiences like theirs could bring more students into the sciences, said scientist Natalie Batalha. Glimpsing something no human has ever seen is an amazing experience, she said. It feels like "all the mysteries of the universe are right there for us to discover."

Not very many young people want to become scientists, she added. Perhaps, she suggested, they mistakenly think scientists are boring and uncool.

Vo certainly doesn't fit anyone's idea of the boring scientist. His forearms are decorated with tattoos, and his sense of humor is boyish. Before beginning his project, he described his task as "basically finding Waldo."

Vo, whose parents are from Vietnam, is the youngest of 10 children. On Saturday, he graduated from San Jose State with a science degree. He hopes to continue doing scientific studies at San Francisco State.

As for Sandoval, his discovery makes him think of his mom. It always embarrassed him when she bragged about his science studies, he said. He felt he had done nothing special.

"After this has happened," he said, "I'm pretty sure she's proud."
