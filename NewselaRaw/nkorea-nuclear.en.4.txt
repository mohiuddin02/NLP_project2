SEOUL, South Korea â€” The ground shook in North Korea on Wednesday. Shortly afterward, the government announced it had exploded a hydrogen bomb. Experts around the world are not so sure if that is the truth.

North Korea is a poor country in Asia. It keeps itself separate from the rest of the world. North Korea and the United States are enemies. Experts are pretty sure that North Korea has some powerful atomic bombs. They do not think North Korea can build a hydrogen bomb, though. Hydrogen bombs are far more difficult to make. They are also much more powerful.

Pyongyang is the capital city of North Korea. People in Pyongyang were excited and proud about the bomb test. A large crowd celebrated in front of Pyongyang's main train station. They watched the announcement on a big video screen. People applauded and cheered.

## World Is Worried About The Test

Kim Sok Chol is 32 years old. He said he does not know much about hydrogen bombs. He thinks that having the bomb will protect North Korea from its enemies. "The U.S. will not attack us," he said.

A North Korean statement reported on television called the test a "perfect success."

Around the world, there was much worry about the test. Park Geun-hye is the president of South Korea. She ordered her army to defend the country against North Korea. Park said the test threatens people in South Korea. North and South Korea used to be a single country. During the Korean War, it was divided into two countries, which are now enemies. The war ended in 1953.

## Earthquake Was Too Small

In the past, North Korea said it had the hydrogen bomb. The United States and other bomb experts did not believe it. North Korea already has a bad relationship with other countries. If it has the hydrogen bomb, the problems would get worse.

Lee Cheol Woo is a South Korean lawmaker. He said the explosion was underground. It caused an earthquake. The quake was not large enough to be a hydrogen bomb. A hydrogen bomb test would have been much stronger.

The United Nations (U.N.) is a group that helps countries work together. The main office is New York. An emergency meeting was held at the U.N. on Wednesday. The United Nations wants to punish North Korea for the bomb test. Many countries have already agreed to not do business with North Korea or sell weapons to the country.
