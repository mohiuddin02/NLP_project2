On Wednesday, Mexican scientists announced an important discovery. They found three rooms buried beneath the ancient city of Teotihuacan. The rooms were hidden at the end of a tunnel.

The city of Teotihuacan is located in the mountains just outside Mexico City. It was founded around 150 B.C. People left the city sometime in the seventh century A.D. At one time, it was the mightiest city in all of North America.

The tunnel was first discovered in 2003. It is located beneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent. Last year, scientists found two rooms in the tunnel. Now they have found three more.

Thousands of objects were in the newly discovered rooms. They include carved statues and rubber balls. Scientists also found jade from Guatemala and a wooden box of seashells.

## Little Is Known Of Teotihuacan

So far, no bodies have been found. Still, scientists think someone important is buried in the tunnel â€” perhaps even a king.

Sergio Gomez is in charge of the search.

"We found very important offerings" outside the rooms, he said. Offerings are placed to honor someone who has died. There were many of them, together with other kinds of objects.

"These findings are very important," commented Professor George Cowgill. It will take years of study to understand what the objects mean, he added.

The people of Teotihuacan did not have a written language. Thus, we know very little about how they lived. Some believe there was just one powerful ruler. Others think power was shared between different groups.

No pictures of Teotihuacan's kings have been found. No royal grave has ever been located either. If a king is found in the tunnel it would be big news. A king's grave could provide much information about life in Teotihuacan.

## Finding Puzzling Objects

Gomez's team has been digging out the tunnel for the past 11 years. In 2013 they made their first great discovery. They uncovered two rooms just across from each other. The rooms were filled with mirrors and strange crystal balls.

The three newly uncovered rooms are close to the first two.

Gomez and his team found many puzzling objects in and near the three rooms. A wooden box filled with seashells surprised them. Teotihuacan is in the mountains. The shells must have been brought from the ocean. The shells had been carved with stone tools.

In addition, there were four jade statues. Each is 2 feet tall. There were also various rubber balls.

## "It's Very Exciting"

The team also found bits of skin. They can't be sure yet if the skin is human or animal. In any case, they haven't found a human body in the chambers.

The newly discovered objects could be offerings, Professor Cowgill said. They could also be the remains of a huge feast. Such a feast would probably have been part of a funeral.

The newly discovered rooms are still filled with dirt and rubble. Gomez's team will continue to dig until they reach the floors. He said it is possible that a grave is hidden under the rubble. It could even be below the chamber floors.

"It's very exciting," Gomez said. He feels certain someone very important is buried in the tunnel. However, "we won't know for sure until next year."
