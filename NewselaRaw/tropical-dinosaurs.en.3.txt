For millions of years, the biggest dinosaurs on the planet stayed out of tropical areas. Now scientists think they know why.

These massive, long-necked plant eaters are called sauropodomorphs. More than 200 million years ago, they became common in the northern and southern parts of the world. Scientists have found proof that they first lived in places like Europe and Argentina. Sauropodomorphs include sauropods like Brontosaurus and Diplodocus.

By studying fossils, scientists learned that sauropodomorphs did not live near the equator until many millions of years later.

So why did it take these big dinosaurs so long to make their way into the middle of our planet? One group of scientists believe it had to do with weather problems in that area. They just published a new report in a science magazine to explain their research.

## Looking At The Ancient Atmosphere

The scientists found that the ancient atmosphere was much different than it is today. High levels of carbon dioxide led to lots of quick weather changes in tropical areas. That made the region near the equator tough for sauropodomorphs.

"It was not a happy place for them to be hanging out," said Nathan Smith. He is a member of the international team of scientists who worked on the new study. Smith is also in charge of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles County, California.

Smith and his fellow scientists used their research to figure out what the environment would have been like when sauropodomorphs lived. They used fossils found in New Mexico. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the area we know as New Mexico was actually closer to the equator, Smith explained. It was part of Earth's only continent then, called Pangea, which later split up into the continents humans now live on.

Smith's team studied bones and grains to see which plants and animals had been present during the sauropodomorphs' day. They also gathered information on what the tropical atmosphere would have been like.

## Weather Was A Big Problem

The scientists learned that the weather in tropical areas of Pangea often switched from very wet to extremely dry. Wildfires wiped out many plants. The tropical atmosphere contained four to six times as much carbon dioxide as it does today.

In spite of those tough living conditions, scientists did find evidence of some animal life. Small-bodied meat-eating dinosaurs lived in the region. So did big reptiles related to modern-day crocodiles.

Smith's team concluded that those reptiles were better at dealing with wild weather changes than the sauropodomorphs. The scientists said that might have something to do with the fact that the reptiles did not need as much food as large dinosaurs. That would have made it easier for the reptiles and smaller animals to adapt to the changes.

Still, larger dinosaurs eventually did find a way to live in the tropics millions of years later. Scientists aren't sure how it happened, but some believe climate change had something to do with it.

"We don't have a great explanation," said Smith. He thinks there was probably a mix of things that made it possible for the sauropodomorphs to start living in the tropics.
