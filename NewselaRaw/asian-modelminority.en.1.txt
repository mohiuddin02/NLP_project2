WASHINGTON, D.C. — In her hometown of Bangkok, Pranee Wilcox worked as an accountant for Thailand's Ministry of Defense. But even with a bachelor's degree, the divorced mother of two struggled. So in 2001, when the Thai ambassador offered her a job as his housekeeper in the Washington, D.C., embassy, she said yes — even though that meant leaving her babies behind. She figured she would make much more money working abroad.

Four years later, when the ambassador returned to Thailand, Wilcox decided to stay. That meant living in the United States without papers and with very little English. Desperate for money, she worked 12-hour days, six days a week, first as a cook, then as a nail technician, so she could send money back to her family.

"I still feel like I'm not a success yet," said Wilcox, 44, taking a break from her mani-pedi duties at a D.C. salon.

## More Asians, Pacific Islanders Entering U.S.

Over the past decade, Asians and Pacific Islanders have become the fastest-growing group to enter the United States, outpacing Latinos. According to new data from the Pew Research Center they are projected to become the biggest immigrant group by 2055.

Asian immigrants come from countries all over that vast continent. As a whole, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are highly successful. They are the most educated, highest-earning racial group in the United States, often stereotyped as the "model minority," or a shining example of hard work and patience to other minority groups.

But dig a little deeper, and the Asian success story looks more complex. The immigrants represent 30 countries and 100 languages. Their ability to access opportunities in the United States varies dramatically, depending on the circumstances that brought them here and where they landed. Some groups struggle, drop out of school at higher rates and have difficulty taking advantage of social services such as language classes, mental health services and food stamps.

## Stereotype As Model Minority Can Be Harmful

Social scientists say dubbing Asian-Americans the "model minority" can hurt some of them who are finding the American Dream — getting a good education, working at a good job and earning a good living — elusive.

"There is a danger in homogenizing the Asian-American experience," said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political science professor at the University of California, Riverside. He is also co-founder of AAPI Data, which tracks data about Asians and Pacific Islanders.

There are hundreds of thousands of Asians who are facing language barriers and living in poverty without access to health care, Ramakrishnan said. Yet in many ways, their difficulties are often invisible to policymakers.

There are 16.6 million Asians and Pacific Islanders living in the U.S., according to the White House Initiative on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. Nearly two-thirds are foreign-born. One-third of the 1 million legal U.S. immigrants come from Asia each year. And 1.3 million of the 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in the United States are Asian, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

## Despite Success Stories, Some Really Struggle

Much is made of the success of many Asians in education, in technology companies in Silicon Valley, California, and in the medical profession. But for others, life here is much harder.

About 14 percent of elderly Asians live in poverty, nearly twice the rate of whites, according to AAPI Data. Some of them who are not citizens may not be eligible for Social Security, the government program that gives money to retirees.

Finding adequate housing poses challenges for many Asians, particularly in high-rent states like California or New York. One in 5 Asians and Pacific Islanders experience housing discrimination. Asians also experienced the largest decline in home ownership in 2008, as the financial crisis hit and people lost their jobs and homes.

A 2013 report by the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development found the number of poor Asians increased 38 percent between 2007 and 2011, in the wake of the financial crisis. Only Latinos experienced a greater increase in poverty.

Vast economic differences are a particular problem among Bangladeshis, Cambodians, Pakistanis and Hmong. For example, the Hmong, who arrived in the U.S. as refugees, have the highest poverty rate of any Asian subgroup, according to the White House Initiative.

## Lack Of Fluency Can Hold Immigrants Back

Language can pose a barrier to advancement. One-third of Asians do not speak English fluently, the Federal Labor Department found. Limited English skills make it difficult to get adequate health care. Southeast Asian immigrants drop out of school at surprising rates.

Experts say better data that looks at different subgroups is necessary so that Asian-Americans needs can be addressed.

If you lump the Asian and the Pacific Islander categories together, many of the smaller groups who struggle are ignored, said Ramakrishnan.

## Finding Community Outside Cultural Group

Here in the United States, Wilcox said, she never felt a sense of community with her fellow Thai expats. There are too few, and they do not seem to look out for each other, she said.

But, she said, she found community elsewhere. Wilcox remarried in 2005, this time to an American, which allowed her to get her green card. Armed with her Social Security card and fueled by the encouragement of a Vietnamese nail salon owner, she went back to school to learn to do nails.

Her marriage did not last and she misses her children, now 21 and 16. But with her earnings in the United States, she was able to buy a house for her family back in Bangkok. One day soon she hopes to become a U.S. citizen, so that she can bring her son here.

That, she said, would make it all worth it.
