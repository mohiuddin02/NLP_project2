Amadou Sy remembers Dakar as a quiet city. Yet, that was many years ago.

Tall buildings are going up across the city. Dakar is the capital of Senegal in Africa. Shops and restaurants are filled with people. Everyone seems to own a cellphone, or even two.

The new changes have given hope to many in Africa. Still, there is war and many people on the continent are poor.

The Pew Research Center is a group that does studies about the world. It just did a study on Africa. It found that people in African countries feel good about their future. They feel that their countries are growing richer and there will be more jobs.

Sy does not feel as positive as the people in the survey. Yet, he is feeling better about Africa's future than he has in a while. Sy runs a project to help Africa at the Brookings Institute. It is in Washington. It does studies and educates people.

## Many People Still Very Poor

Sy said Africa's population has been growing quickly. African countries are becoming richer. Yet, the number of poor people is not dropping as fast there as in other parts of the world.

Almost half of the people in sub-Saharan Africa still live on less than $1.25 a day, says the United Nations. Sub-Saharan Africa is the area south of the Sahara Desert. The United Nations is a group of countries that work together.

Experts also see signs of trouble.

For a while, prices for oil and other goods were high. Africa has much oil, and sells it. High oil prices are good for Africa. Now prices are dropping. China and Europe buy oil from Africa. Problems in both areas are making Africa's leaders nervous.

More than 9,000 people in nine countries were asked questions in the report. The Pew report is based on their answers.

## Nine African Countries In Report

The nine countries are Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. About half of the people in sub-Saharan Africa live in them.

Many of these countries are doing really well, said Staci Warden. She is with the Milken Institute in Santa Monica. It also studies countries around the world. She said that many people are moving from the countryside to the cities. Their governments are making better decisions.

Six out of 10 people said they think their countries will become richer in the next year. Almost half of people in Latin America said that. About one out of three people in the United States agreed. In Europe, just one out of four thought their countries will be doing better.

## Children Will Be Richer, People Say

Many Africans also felt good about the future of the next generation. More than half believed that today's children would be richer than their parents.

They also saw serious problems in their home countries. There are too few jobs, bad health care and bad schools.

Most of the people think their governments should be able to solve the biggest problems. They also had complaints. Most of them thought dishonest government leaders were a serious problem, the study said.

People also thought that aid groups helping Africa were mostly doing a good job. Yet some worried that the groups were not run well. People also worried that their government officials were not honest. Some people also were concerned that oil drilling and mining were bad for the environment.
