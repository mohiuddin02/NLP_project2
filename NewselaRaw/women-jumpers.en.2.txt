KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — First, they strapped on their helmets and goggles, and boldly raced down a steep icy ramp. Then, the female ski jumpers of the 2014 Winter Olympics took flight. In the process, they made history Tuesday night.

Women have been ski jumping since at least 1862, when Ingrid Olavsdottir Vestby of Norway soared 20 feet while wearing a skirt. But they have never been allowed to ski jump at the Olympics.

More than 150 years later, it was finally happening: 30 women from 12 countries competed in the very first Olympic women's ski jump. They had fought long and hard to win the right to be included.

One by one, they flung themselves off the ramp at the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center, just like the male ski jumpers. They were all defying suggestions that the sport isn't right for women — that it is too dangerous, unhealthy and unladylike.

## Flying Through The Air

In 2005 the president of the International Ski Federation, Gian Franco Kasper, had expressed his disapproval. The sport, he said, "seems not to be appropriate for ladies from a medical point of view.''

On Monday, Russian ski jump coach Alexander Arefyev said: "I admit, I'm not a fan of women's ski jumping. It's a pretty difficult sport with a high risk of injury. If a man gets a serious injury, it's still not fatal, but for women it could end much more seriously."

Arefyev added, "If I had a daughter, I'd never let her jump — it's too much hard labor. Women have another purpose — to have children, to do housework, to create hearth and home."

But now, at last, women were competing. They zoomed downhill and flew through the air at 60 miles per hour, traveling about 10 to 15 feet off the ground, for the length of a football field.

Carina Vogt of Germany won the gold medal. Daniela Iraschko-Stolz of Austria won the silver, and Coline Mattel of France took the bronze.

## They're Olympians Now

Jessica Jerome was the top American in 10th place. Lindsey Van, who led the charge for women to compete in the Olympic ski jump, finished 15th.

"We can call ourselves Olympians now,'' said Van, who admitted she had begun bawling at the opening ceremony.

"This is something I've been doing for 20 years, hoping that one day I can go to the Olympics and jump,'' said Jerome. "I didn't perform to my best ability, but I'm still happy, strangely, and I think all the girls from all the countries are just smiling. There is a special camaraderie all the girls have and I really felt it (Tuesday night). We were up there high-fiving with the Norwegians and the Finns and the Canadians. Everybody was just really glad to be sharing this with someone who really gets what we've been trying to do.''

The very first competitor to jump was 19-year-old American and reigning world champion Sarah Hendrickson.

"I didn't realize the significance when I was given bib No. 1," Hendrickson commented. Then someone said, "'You're the first girl EVER to jump in an Olympics.' I kind of took that and ran with it. It's a pretty cool thing. We put on an awesome show and the world saw what we've been working for.''

## Cheered On By Their Families

Watching it all from the stands were the U.S. jumpers' families and others who fought for the sport.

"We've already won,'' DeeDee Corrandini, president of Women's Ski Jumping USA, said just before the start of the event. "Every single ski jumper who's here has already won just to be here."

She added, "Our battle to get the women into ski jumping became much more than ski jumping. It really became a women's rights issue.''

Jerome's dad went to bat for his daughter and started raising money for the team, and other parents were also very involved.

"I think there's a preconceived notion that men are braver than women,'' said Bill Hendrickson, Sarah's father. "It takes a lot of guts and confidence for these women to go off this big ski jump. They are dispelling that myth that just men are brave enough to go off these big jumps. There certainly are ladies out there that" have the skills and "courage to do the same kinds of things men do.''

And, they say, they only want one thing — to be given a chance.
