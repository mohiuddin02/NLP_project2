The U.S. Supreme Court gave gay-marriage supporters a big victory on Wednesday. It said that a nationwide law that would have stopped same-sex married couples from getting government benefits was illegal.

The court also opened the door for gay marriages to start again in California.

The decisions stopped short of saying that the U.S. Constitution guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage. The court did not decide whether same-sex marriages from one state will have to be recognized everywhere. Twelve states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriages. California is also expected to let gay people marry again.

President Barack Obama praised the court.

"We are a people who declared that we are all created equal â€“ and the love we commit to one another must be equal as well," he said in a statement.

## Gay Marriage Hotly Debated

But not everyone in the U.S. agrees on gay marriage. Nor did all nine judges on the court.

Both cases were decided by 5-4 rulings. Different justices were in the majority in each case. On the Supreme Court, the judges are called "justices."

The court threw out part of a 1996 law called the Defense of Marriage Act. The law let states decide not to have same-sex marriage. Both Republicans and Democrats voted for the law. Some who voted for the law later changed their minds.

Justice Anthony Kennedy said that the law was against the Constitution. He also said that the real reason for the law was to make same-sex marriage less important than marriage between a man and a woman.

Doing that hurt "all who enter into same-sex marriages," Kennedy wrote.

He said that the decision is limited to those marriages in states that allow gay marriage.

## Ruling Won't Stop There

But Justice Antonin Scalia said that it was not realistic to think the ruling will stop there.

He also said that the majority ruling was unfair to people who opposed gay marriage.

The ruling affects immigration rights, student loans, taxes and other things controlled by the Federal government.

The case was about Edith Windsor, who married Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007. They lived in New York when Spyer died in 2009. New York said their marriage was legal.

But Windsor had to pay a lot of money in taxes after Spyer died. She would not have had to pay the taxes if she was married to a man and not a woman.

Crowds of people outside the Supreme Court in Washington cheered both rulings.

## The California Case

The court "brings us that much closer to true equality," said David Boies. He was one of the attorneys who represented the people who sued to get rid of the California law. That law made same-sex marriage against the law there.

The people who sued "get to go back to California and, together with every other citizen of California, marry the person they love," he said.

Voters in California first approved the law to ban gay marriage. A state judge said that it was illegal.

California's then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger could have appealed the case, but he passed. Others tried to defend the law. But Chief Justice John Roberts of the Supreme Court said that only California's elected officials had legal standing to defend the law.

John Eastman of the National Organization for Marriage told CNN that the Supreme Court got it wrong in both cases.

"When you destroy or redefine the institution, all of society is going to be harmed,"  he said.

## The Battle Isn't Over

Kris Perry, cheered the decision from the Supreme Court steps. She and her partner were two of the people who sued to get rid of the law.

She said they would be able to tell their four sons "you're just as good as everybody else, no matter who you love, no matter who your parents love."

She and Sandy Stier were married in San Francisco in 2004. But the state Supreme Court quickly said they were not really married. The sons are from previous relationships.

Stier said the battle is not over.

"It's got to go nationwide, and we can't wait for that day," she said.
