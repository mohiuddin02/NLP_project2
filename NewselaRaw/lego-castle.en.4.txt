SEATTLE, Washington â€” Alice Finch builds things with Legos. Big things.

She built a model of the Hogwarts Castle from the "Harry Potter" books. It has about 400,000 pieces. There are different colored bottles in the Potions classroom. There is even a see-through ghost.

Alice used to be a teacher. She lives with her family near Seattle. She is an AFOL. That is the name for Adult Fans of Lego. Her Hogwarts Castle was shown at BrickCon 2012. BrickCon is a gathering for people who love Legos. It happens once a year. Her castle won two prizes there.

## A Home Fit For Elves

She worked with a builder named David Frank on another Lego work. They built Rivendell in 2013. It was a 200,000-brick model. It was just like the place where elves live in books by J.R.R. Tolkien. Rivendell also won a prize.

Alice enjoyed Legos as a child. Her Lego building room at home has about 2 million bricks. They are all carefully sorted by color and size.

Alice read the Harry Potter books with her son. That led to building the Hogwarts castle. She has always been interested in buildings. Her father was an architect. He designed buildings.

## Builder Appeared In Lego Movie

A movie called "A Lego Brickumentary" was all about Legos. Alice was in it. The movie said people all over the world know about Legos. Legos are made by a company in the country of Denmark. The company has made Legos since the 1940s.

Alice said that there are many AFOLs in Seattle. She is part of SeaLUG. It is the Seattle Lego Users Group. About 150 people are in the group. Many of them build only certain things. Some work on castles. Others work on robotics.

## Hoping To Inspire Girl Builders

Alice teaches Lego camps for children. She wants girls to see what she does. Alice hopes girls will build interesting things with Legos when they see her work.

Alice's favorite Lego buddies are her two sons. Thorin is 11. Hadrian is 7. "We're always building together," she said. Hadrian added to Rivendell when he was 5.

He built a train station in the middle of it. He did it so the elves could get to work.
