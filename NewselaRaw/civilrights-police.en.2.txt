NASHVILLE, Tenn. — One day in 1960, Nashville police officers carried John Lewis by his hands and feet to a police wagon. The African-American student had dared to take a seat at a whites-only lunch counter. On the same downtown block, today's police recruits are learning about the difficult history between law enforcement and African-Americans.

About 60 people training to be police officers gathered recently in the Civil Rights Room at Nashville's main library. They listened to stories about Lewis and other college students who helped make Nashville the first Southern city to allow both African-Americans and whites to sit together at its lunch counters. 

Many of the recruits were about the same age that Lewis was when he became a leader of the civil rights movement. On the library wall were written the words, "If not us, then who? If not now, then when?" Lewis said them to urge the other protesters to stay strong although they were threatened with violence.

## Finding Way To Rebuild Trust

Clashes between police and the African-American community are happening once again. Meanwhile, law enforcement leaders around the country are looking for new ways to restore trust. In Tennessee, police departments have turned to the Nashville library's rich collection of materials on the civil rights movement. They are using it to teach new police recruits about the injustices of the past. They hope the officers will learn the lessons of history and treat people more fairly. The classes quickly became a central part of the recruits' police training.

Nashville police Chief Steve Anderson said that the training is designed to help them remember an important lesson. When an officer goes up to someone or someone goes up to an officer, "'I need to think about where they may be coming from,'" he said.

The library's Civil Rights Room is lined with pictures of Nashville during the civil rights era.

## Relearning Lessons From The Past

"Civil rights education is a valuable part of the training we pursue for our agents," said Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. The law enforcement agency also sends its agents to learn about civil rights. He said it is important to remember the lessons learned from the mistakes of the past. The program may help them be better police and be better able to deal with different kinds of people.

The library's first session with new Nashville police recruits was in April. Instructors used images, films and stories of people who lived through the time. These connected the past to situations that the police might face now.

Micah Wright, one of the recruits, said the images show the hurt people feel when their rights are denied.

"As long as civil rights aren't realized, then everyone is going to feel the burden and the pain from that," he said.

## Attracting Notice Of Police All Over Country

Andrea Blackman is in charge of the library's program. She said police chiefs from across the country have visited the library. Some have asked her to put programs together for their departments.

Chuck Wexler is the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which is an organization of law enforcement leaders.

"Today's young officers weren't even alive back then, but this history is alive in people's memories and can't be swept under the rug," he said. The Nashville Police Department is showing leadership by teaching its recruits about the civil rights movement, he said.

That view is shared by some of the famous civil rights leaders the recruits are learning about.

## Leader Calls For Police Protection For All

Bernard Lafayette is one of them. He remembered how during the lunch counter sit-ins, Nashville police stood by as he and other protesters were attacked. He hopes programs like this one will help police better understand that they must protect the public. He also hopes they understand how much trust people have placed in them.

"You do more than simply stop the shootings; you create a sense of community," said Lafayette. He still teaches Martin Luther King Jr.'s principles of nonviolence all over the world. King believed in resisting injustice peacefully through marches and sit-ins. "Because, in my opinion, there is no separation between police and community."

More than a half-century ago, James Lawson started training students in nonviolent protest in a church basement before the sit-ins. He said he believes the civil rights program helps officers "adopt the notion that I'm going to treat this person exactly as I want to be treated."

He said police officers cannot do that in every situation, like when someone's life is being threatened or a crime is being committed. Yet, during 80 or 90 percent of their time as police officers, they can treat people "with that kind of character and spirit."
