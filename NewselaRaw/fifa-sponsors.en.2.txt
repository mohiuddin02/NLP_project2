LONDON — Suspicions of dishonest behavior within the soccer world came to a head on Wednesday. Seven arrests were made within the sport's global governing organization, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Now several FIFA sponsors have been asked to take action and make it clear that FIFA needs to clean up its act.

The U.S. Department of Justice charged FIFA officials with money-laundering, fraud and making money illegally during the past two decades.

## FIFA Already Under Pressure

Charges like these come as no surprise. Lately, FIFA has made headlines for everything from possible corruption to the abuse of laborers building World Cup venues in the small Arabian Gulf country of Qatar.

As a result, financial supporters like Coca-Cola, Visa and Adidas are starting to speak out about how FIFA does business.

Now the Swiss government is taking a closer look at FIFA's decision to host the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 tournament in Qatar. They need to see whether bribes or other illegal activity might have influenced those decisions.

According to Cobus de Swardt, sponsors should not wait to see what happens. They should demand change now.

## Sponsors Have "A Right And Responsibility"

De Swardt leads a global organization called Transparency International. He says that putting millions of euros into FIFA gives sponsors "a right and responsibility to demand that (it is) not tainted."

Wednesday's developments serve as a "wake-up call" for everyone involved with FIFA, says de Swardt. He is calling for big changes to the organization's structures and practices.

De Swardt recommended that FIFA postpone its presidential election, which was scheduled for Friday. He also discouraged longtime leader Sepp Blatter from running again.

"FIFA needs a new start," said de Swardt. "These scandals have taken place under Sepp Blatter's watch."

The vote took place as scheduled on Friday and Blatter was re-elected for a fifth term as president.

## Big Companies Concerned

A large range of companies are involved with FIFA and the soccer world, but some are more closely connected to the organization than others.

FIFA's partners include Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa. They have contracts with FIFA that let them pay for the right to use official FIFA trademarks in their advertising campaigns. Partners also benefit from exposure in and around stadiums and protection against similar advertisers getting involved.

Sponsors like Budweiser and McDonald's take a different approach. They only pay to be involved with one-time events like the World Cup.

The Department of Justice's charges against FIFA mentioned a "multinational sportswear company headquartered in the United States." The unnamed sportswear company is included in the section about bribery charges related to Brazil. Many suspect that the company in question is Nike.

## Nike Concerned About Allegations

Nike didn't confirm whether that is true, but said it was concerned by the "very serious allegations" and was cooperating with authorities.

"Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport," it said.

Right now, it's still unclear whether any of FIFA's sponsors or partners will go further in pushing FIFA to make changes. So far, none of the public statements they have issued have been very harsh.

The reason: there's too much at stake. Companies with long-term connections to the World Cup know their FIFA relationships are very powerful. Much like the Olympics, soccer is popular all over the world. Walking away from FIFA would be like handing rival companies a microphone and giving them a chance to invite customers all over the globe to switch brands.

## Pushing For Change, Not Pulling Out

"We've already seen sponsors making more noise than they ever used to," said sponsorship and branding expert Nigel Currie. "But big sponsors get an awful lot of exposure and they'll be wary: if they pull out, one of their rivals will step in."

That doesn't mean sponsors will just sit back quietly and watch, though.

Last week, for example, Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa urged FIFA to push for changes in Qatar. They want improved conditions for migrant workers preparing sites for the 2022 World Cup that will be held there.

Adidas, FIFA's oldest partner, has said it's "fully committed to creating a culture that promotes the highest standards of ethics," and expects the same from its partners. Visa and McDonald's have issued similar statements.

Currie thinks companies that have financial ties to FIFA would have better luck motivating FIFA to make changes if they united to speak out with a stronger voice.

## Pressure Will Keep Building

"I think we'll see the pressure mounting in coming days," he said. "Sponsors don't like uncertainty or scandal; they want to be involved in something clean."

Sponsors provide almost a third of FIFA's multibillion dollar revenues, so their concerns aren't something that FIFA can simply ignore.

"When a business sponsors an event or association such as FIFA, it is effectively tying part of its brand with them," said advertising expert Peter Walshe. According to Walshe, sponsors and their partners need to be a good fit — and trust is an important part of the relationship.

"When trust issues threaten the organization, the sponsor will need to monitor whether that will have a negative effect on the trust of the brand," he said.
