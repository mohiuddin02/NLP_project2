WASHINGTON, D.C. — People eat salmon all the time. It is a very popular fish for dinner. Soon there may be a salmon on your dinner plate that is a little strange. Scientists have made a new type of salmon. They changed its genes. It has been genetically modified.

Genes are passed down by parents. Genes decide what someone looks like and how their body works. They make a person have wavy or straight hair, or blue or brown eyes. Plants, animals and people all have genes.  

Scientists put genes from other fish into the new salmon. They wanted the fish to grow faster.

## Salmon Will Get To Stores In 2 Years

On Thursday, the government approved the new salmon. It said the fish is safe to eat. This is the first time the government has approved a genetically modified fish. The new salmon could be in food stores in just two years. That is how long it takes to grow.

The new fish is called AquAdvantage Salmon. 

A company named AquaBounty makes AquAdvantage. Ron Stotish is in charge of AquaBounty. He said AquAdvantage brings healthy food to people. It does not hurt the ocean, he said.

The new fish looks just like any other salmon. AquaBounty does not have to write on the package that the fish is different. People may not even know they are buying it.

A few stores say they will not sell the modified fish. 

## Some People Say It's A Bad Idea

Some people worry that AquaBounty could cause allergies. They also worry that it could escape from farms. Then it might mix with other salmon. If that happened, they think natural salmon would die.

"There's no place on our dinner plates for genetically engineered fish," Lisa Archer said. She works for a nature group. Archer said it is not a good idea to sell the fish. She said it has not been studied enough. 

Lisa Murkowski is a lawmaker. She represents the state of Alaska. The new salmon could hurt the fishermen in her state. They catch wild salmon. They are worried about their jobs. She wants a new law. It would force AquaBounty to change its package. It would have to say that the fish is modified.

AquaBounty had to share information about the salmon with the government. Then the government decided the fish was safe.

AquaBounty hopes people will start to feel OK about the new salmon soon. It might happen as they learn more about it, said Stotish of AquaBounty.
