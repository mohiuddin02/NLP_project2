The U.S. national soccer team arrived at the World Cup in Brazil after months of fanfare.

There was much discussion about the team's lineup. There was also a three-game send-off series — three games the team played before the FIFA tournament to warm up. There was even an ESPN film crew following the team around.

Things were very different 64 years ago, when Walter Bahr and his U.S. teammates took off for Brazil. Bahr, a former Penn State soccer coach, is one of two surviving members of the 1950 U.S. soccer team. That year was the last time Brazil hosted the sport's global showcase.

There was little attention paid when the 1950 team left for Brazil, and no more when they returned.

These days, soccer is becoming more popular in the United States, but in Bahr's playing days, not many Americans followed the game.

So when the team for the 1950 World Cup was announced, it wasn't exactly big news.

## A Tough Qualifying Road Ahead

The team had a hard task ahead of it. The U.S. faced a tough series of games against Spain, England and Chile, all top-level teams.

It wasn't realistic to think this group of part-time players from across the country could defeat some of the world's best. The main goal, really, was just to not lose too badly.

Instead, the U.S. team pulled off one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history.

It came in the second game, against England. The English were one of the best teams in the world, and were considered a favorite to challenge Brazil for the title.

Heading into the game, there wasn't much talk about what might happen, good or bad.

Coach Bill Jeffrey's "main comment was, 'Look, we're the underdogs, but the score's 0-0 when we start. We all can play — give it your best shot, let's see what happens,'" Bahr recalled. "He never mentioned once about winning the game, but he never mentioned that we were being led to slaughter."

## Nothing To Lose

In truth, it would have been foolish to think the United States could beat the mighty English.

After all, just two years earlier at the 1948 Olympics, the United States had suffered an embarrassing 9-0 defeat at the hands of Italy.

When the game against England was played, "we were 500-to-1 odds," Bahr said. "No one expected us to do anything."

But, like Jeffrey said, the match had to start 0-0.

Unexpectedly, it remained 0-0 for most of the first half.

England had some good chances to score, but was denied by American goalkeeper Frank Borghi.

In the 38th minute, Bahr took a throw-in from Ed McIlvenny and fired a shot at goal from about 25 yards out. Seconds later, Joe Gaetjens leaped forward and headed the ball.

Gaetjens hit just enough of it to change the ball's path and catch English goalkeeper Bert Williams off-guard. Just like that, the Americans, almost impossibly, had a 1-0 lead over the British.

England controlled the ball throughout much of the rest of the game and almost scored many times. When the final whistle sounded, however, the scoreboard still read 1-0 — in favor of the United States.

"Possession doesn't count — the goal counts, and we got the goal," Bahr said.

## Today's Team Has More Support

It shouldn't be surprising that Bahr can recite the details of the long-ago game so well. He's had to do it frequently — about once every four years.

"Each time there's a World Cup that gets played, that game gets more attention. When we won that game, some of the papers didn't report it," he said.

Back then, the historic victory didn't get much attention here in the United States. Some papers even assumed the 1-0 U.S. win was a misprint.

When the players came home, they were hardly greeted as returning heroes.

"We couldn't even get the whole team on one flight," Bahr, 87, said. "We came back on three separate days and my wife was the only one at the airport that met me."

Even though today's U.S. team has support that Bahr never had, there might be some common ground.

As with the 1950 team, most experts see today's team as underdogs in all their upcoming matches.

Bahr, however, thinks this 2014 U.S. team could benefit from not being the favorite.

"Maybe that's to their favor," he said. "As a player, you don't like to play teams where they're the underdog — it doesn't sit right to you."

He added, "England was a big favorite and we were the underdog. Sometimes the underdog wins."
