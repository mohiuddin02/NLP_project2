LEAVENWORTH, Wash. â€” Biologist Don Youkey reached overhead to a log nailed to a tree. He hung a cow knucklebone and chunk of raw rib meat over the log.

He hopes the tasty bait will lure a wolverine. He is not hunting it; he just wants to snap its photo. It is the newest carnivore cruising these snowy woods.

## Comeback Kid

Wolverines were once shot on sight. They were trapped and poisoned as pests. [They were gone from Washington by the 1930s.](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species)  But they are making a comeback. They are moving back to their historic home range for the first time in decades.

Wolverines used to range along the Cascade Crest from the Canadian border all the way to Mount Rainier. Today, they remain very rare, with perhaps just 25 animals in Washington. There are only about 250 to 300 in the U.S., excluding Alaska.

The wolverine's return to Washington is amazing scientists. "We are witnessing what we think is the expansion of wolverines into their former range," said Keith Aubry, wildlife biologist with the U.S. Forest Service. Aubry led the first-ever radio-tracking study of wolverines in Washington.

## Crossing The Border

Tests show the animals they are finding are related to wolverines in Canada. They returned to the area once the hunting and trapping stopped. Those animals were once just visitors to Washington. Now, some have permanent residences and they are spreading. "We have growing evidence of them using larger and larger areas over time," Aubry said.

"When you see a species like wolverine that needs openness and connected habitat coming here all on its own, this is the celebration moment. It's the success, the reward," said Jen Watkins of Conservation Northwest.

## Still Threatened

Even as wolverines rebound, threats loom in their future. Over the next 100 years, [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) is expected to melt much of the deep snow that lasts until May. Wolverines need such snow to survive. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Friday proposed listing wolverines for protection in at least six Western states.

The wolverine is smaller than a Labrador retriever.  It is pound for pound among the most fearsome carnivores in Washington. It is capable of sniffing out frozen dead animals. It can tunnel through five feet of snow to crack open bones and tear apart even frozen meat. Their powerful jaws are specially adapted to pull off chunks of rock-hard flesh and bone.

## Animal Superheroes

Wolverines roam Washington's wildest country in its worst weather. They can easily travel many miles. Deep powdery snow is no problem for their oversized, snowshoe-like feet.

Their long, thick, brown-and-gold coats shed frost. Underneath is a soft layer of fur that defeats the most brutal cold. Their claws enable them to climb trees and scramble up and down rocky slopes.

"They are the superheroes of the animal world," said Shawn Sartorius, a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "When you follow the tracks of these things, you see they are not taking the easy way around; they will go straight over mountaintops."

## Roaming Far and Wide

John Rohrer, wildlife biologist with the Forest Service, has been surprised to learn just how much territory the wolverines cover, even in winter.

"The North Cascades in winter are pretty hostile to life," Rohrer said. "Most animals will avoid it in winter or hibernate. In summer there are cougar and black bear and bobcat and coyotes and great horned owls. In wintertime, it is only the wolverines."

And wolverines are ferocious. "When you see one in a live trap you never forget it," Rohrer said. "They are growling, trying to bluff you, they are not cowering in the corner. If you crack open the lid they are charging and coming up to the front, snapping their jaws and drooling. They put on quite a show."

## Food Wanted, Dead Or Alive

But hikers have nothing to worry about: Wolverines are mainly scavengers. They feast on a wide variety of foods, including dead animals of every type, usually elk and deer. But they will also take live small mammals, including squirrels, porcupines and snowshoe hares. They will sometimes devour bugs, berries, eggs and roots.

For now, ensuring wolverine survival is about planning for the future, Watkins said. Wolverines need safe access to the habitats they are returning to now. Highway 2, for instance, is a travel corridor wolverines will need to cross if they are to make it as far south as Mount Rainier.

"For these animals to come back to these places on their own, and take up residence there again, sticking around, and calling it home," Watkins said, "that is thrilling."
