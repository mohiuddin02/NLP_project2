CARMEL VALLEY, Calif. â€” The Santa Lucia Mountains rise high along California's coast. They should have some of the country's cleanest air. However, scientist Ian Faloona is finding high levels of pollution there. He says it is blowing across the Pacific Ocean from Asia.

Faloona has been measuring ozone pollution. Ozone is the gas in smog. Smog is air pollution. It can damage people's lungs. For three years, Faloona has been studying the ozone as it reaches California.

## Breathing Problems

His measuring instruments are located on Chews Ridge in the Santa Lucia Mountains. The spot is more than 5,000 feet above sea level. There he can test the air blowing in from across the Pacific.

Ozone pollution is caused by cars, trucks and factories. It leads to breathing problems. It can cause heart disease and even early death.

Faloona says U.S. ozone levels are rising. The problem is particularly bad in the western United States.

The rise in ozone levels was not supposed to happen. Pollution from cars and factories has been cut steeply across the U.S.

## Across The Pacific Ocean

Scientists like Faloona believe they know what is going on. They say pollution in China and other Asian countries is causing U.S. ozone levels to go up.

Factories in China are very busy these days. More and more people in China are driving cars. The result is increasing ozone pollution there.

Winds carry the ozone from China to the U.S. It only takes about a week for the gas to be blown across the Pacific. The ozone then adds to pollution created by American cars and factories.

Western states are more affected by the problem. They are closer to the Pacific Ocean, so the ozone reaches them first. Smog has become much worse in California's cities like Bakersfield, Fresno and Los Angeles.

## Fighting Pollution

It will not be easy to stop pollution from China, said scientist Owen Cooper. The U.S. and China would have to work out a deal. A deal between two countries is called a treaty.

Such an agreement is not likely, said Cooper. The U.S. will have to work harder at stopping the pollution here. Pollution from U.S. cars and factories will have to be cut more.

Even if pollution from cars and factories is cut, it will be tough to make a difference. In Denver, cars cause much less pollution than they used to. Still, Denver's "ozone pollution isn't coming down. It's kind of stuck," Cooper said.

## "It's All Connected"

In the past, pollution in China did not use to worry the U.S. much. Now, people realize that smog in a faraway country can reach us here.

Pollution in China and pollution in the U.S. are connected, Faloona says.

From his site on high at Chews Ridge, he looks west. He sees ozone blowing in across the Pacific Ocean. Looking inland, he sees grey smog over the San Joaquin Valley. The area is covered by a cloud of air pollution.

People used to think Chinese pollution would not reach us here, Faloona said. They did not believe it could travel all the way across the Pacific. However, "we've realized it's all connected."
