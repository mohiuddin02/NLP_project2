Carlo Pedretti is an art expert. People say he once said that the picture could be the work of Leonardo da Vinci. Now Pedretti says he is not sure.

Leonardo da Vinci was a famous Italian painter. He also invented many different things. Most of his paintings are hanging in museums. The most famous of his paintings is the Mona Lisa.

## Art Lovers Are Hopeful

This painting shows a woman named Isabella D'Este. The police found the painting in a Swiss bank. They were looking for evidence for a case. The government of Italy wants to know if the art was taken out of the country illegally.

The police said the picture was painted by da Vinci. They said that Pedretti said so. A magazine had said the same thing in 2013. That made art lovers very happy. They were excited by the idea of seeing a new painting by da Vinci.

Pedretti said he saw the painting years ago. He said it showed hints that da Vinci was the painter. But he asked the owners to study it more before they said anything.

Pedretti said he would not have made that decision on his own. He would have to talk to other experts first.

## Whose Work Is It?

The stories have raised the price of the painting. The police said it is worth $137 million now.

The prices of works of art go up and down. Works by important artists are more expensive. Paintings by da Vinci are very rare and really expensive.

Pedretti is convinced the picture is old and important. It is very likely from da Vinci's time.

Alessandro Vezzosi said it does not look like da Vinci's work. He runs a museum dedicated to the painter.

A drawing of the same woman by da Vinci hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris. It shows that he knew her.

## Painting Assistants

Artists in da Vinci's time had workshops. They had students who worked with them. The experts think one of da Vinci's students could have painted this picture.

There could be a da Vinci drawing under the paint. He might have started it and let one of his students finish it.

Leonardo da Vinci had a lot of interests. He was busy building things and studying science and math. "He didn't have time to stay and work on a painting," Pedretti said.
