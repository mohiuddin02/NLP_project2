PESHAWAR, Pakistan — The north of Pakistan is a mountainous and poor region. Many different tribal groups live there. One of these groups is the Taliban. It is a violent group that is fighting the Pakistani government for control of the country.

The Pakistani army has been battling the Taliban for a year. So far, there has been one clear benefit: more success in the country's fight against polio, a serious disease.

This year, there were six reported cases of polio in the tribal areas of Pakistan. There were 56 the same time last year.

## It's Tough To Get Medicine To Some Areas

Polio was common around the world in the early 1900s. It paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year. In the 1950s, a vaccine, or a shot, was introduced that could prevent polio.

The wide use of polio vaccines has helped to wipe out the disease in all but three countries of the world. Polio is still commonly found in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.

In Pakistan, teams of medical workers and their security guards travel to the tribal areas to give vaccines to people. Some tribal leaders do not want the medical workers to come. Dozens of health workers and their guards have been killed in the tribal areas.

The Taliban is one group that has attacked health workers.

Hafiz Gul Bahadur is leader of a Pakistani Taliban group. He banned the polio vaccine in June 2012.  He said he would only allow it if the United States stopped drone bombings. The U.S. government uses unmanned drone airplanes with no pilots to drop bombs in Pakistan.

## Hoping To Get There Sooner Or Later

The battle in the north has brought more security to some areas. More health workers are now able to get in. In October 2014, teams of medical workers were not able to reach 250,000 children. In May, that number had dropped to 47,000.

Aziz Mermon works for a charity group called Rotary International. He runs the PolioPlus program in Pakistan.

Mermon said that health workers are finding it easier to work in the tribal areas.

But challenges remain. "There are areas that are still not within reach, where fighting is going on, where we hope to get to sooner or later," he said.

Around the world, there is an effort to wipe out polio once and for all — the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

Out of the 24 polio cases reported this year, 23 have been in Pakistan, according to the Initiative.

## Serious Challenges Remain

Polio is caused by a virus. It mainly affects children. In serious cases, victims lose the ability to move their legs or other body parts. It can even cause death.

Most of Pakistan is free of polio, but it remains in a few parts of the country. Polio is present in the tribal areas, the huge city of Karachi, and in a neighboring region.

Pakistan had 307 cases of polio in 2014. More than half of those were in the tribal areas.

The Khyber Agency tribal area, near Peshawar, has seen many cases of polio. Health workers are finding it extremely difficult to reach two areas: Bara and Jamrud.

"Our workers have been attacked in Bara and Jamrud, and they do not feel safe," a health worker in the tribal region said. He asked to stay anonymous to avoid being targeted by the Taliban.

## Doctors Make House Visits With Vaccines

Dr. Naseer Hussain Shah is health director for the tribal areas. He said teams were slowly beginning to visit there. Workers are now able to take vaccinations door-to-door in almost all of the tribal areas, Shah said.

Serious challenges remain, according to international officials. Many Taliban fighters have moved from the tribal areas to Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan.

This migration has increased fears that the virus could spread through the city of more than 20 million people and on to other parts of Pakistan.
