FILLMORE, Calif. â€” In a cave in California, a new reality-show star was born.

The star is a young California condor. A condor is a type of vulture. He is home alone. He plays games on the floor of his cave. He tosses feathers and bones into the air with his beak. He pounces on them with his claws.

Scientists watch him play through a hidden video camera. For the first time, scientists have a full picture of the home life of condors.

California condors are the largest flying birds in North America. They have a 9 1/2-foot wingspan and razor-sharp beaks. There are very few of them left. Wingspan measures a bird from the edge of one wing to the other.

Until now, the condors were observed only from very far away. Scientists had to guess what was going on in nests. Condors live in distant caves and hollowed-out redwood trees. They lay only one egg a year. There was only one way for scientists to get a closer look at them. They had to climb down cliffs and into the nests.

## Keeping A Close Eye

The video cameras make life safer for birds. They also help keep scientists safe.

Scientists used to climb down into condor nests every month. They removed garbage the condors brought home. The garbage could hurt the condors. It can include bottle caps, broken glass and wire.

Now scientists can watch the video. Then they decide whether to enter the nest, said Joseph Brandt. He is a condor expert.

Scientists hope to stream live video one day. Until then, people can watch video clips on Facebook.

## Condors Soar In The Sky

Condors nearly died out 30 years ago. They are slowly coming back. Today, there are 128 free-flying condors in California. The condor population around the world is 433.

Recently, Brandt released three condors into the mountains. All three had been sick or hurt.

The condors were put in large dog crates and taken to a mountain. The crates were opened. The condors took a quick look around. They raced toward the edge of a cliff. Their black-and-white wings flapped hard, and they flew into the bright blue sky.
