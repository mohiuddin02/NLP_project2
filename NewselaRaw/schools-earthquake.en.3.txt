YELM, Wash. — Sixth graders at Lackamas Elementary School leap into the air and all crash to the ground at the same time. Other students are looking at a computer with a scientist. They watch bumpy lines go across the screen. The scientist uses the lines to measure a small earthquake.   

The students in Yelm are not experiencing a real earthquake. They just caused the ground to shake when they jumped. 

Scientist Recep Cakir explains that he and the students are measuring the way the shaking moves across the ground. He and other scientists work for the state of Washington. They want to figure out how hard the ground will shake in a real earthquake.

Cakir and his crew are doing this work at 15 schools. They want to know how well the buildings will stand up to a very big earthquake. The government is paying them for the project.

## Sizing Up Schools For Safety

Building engineers are also helping. Engineers use science and math to make buildings and bridges. Now they are making sure the schools are built well enough to make it through an earthquake.  

The engineers are looking for problems with the buildings. They are also looking for dangers such as bookshelves that are not bolted to the wall. 

Between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains is the area called the Pacific Northwest. Washington, Oregon and part of Canada are included in the area. Scientists have studied the Pacific Northwest for years. They found that the area could have huge earthquakes. 

An earthquake could also cause a high sea wave called a tsunami. It could wash onto land and drown people.

## Older Schools Not Built To Modern Standards

A big fault line on the ocean floor could cause the earthquakes. Parts of the ocean floor can move. If they bump into each other it causes earthquakes. Other Washington cities are also near places where parts of the Earth could move.

Many of the schools in Washington are old. Newer schools are built to stand up to earthquakes. Older schools were not. 

State school leaders figured out how much damage might happen. They found that a giant earthquake could kill around 120 students, teachers and staff members. It could also hurt more than 3,000 additional people.

Another guess is that half the schools along Washington's coast would suffer damage. No one really knows for sure how much. 

In Washington, the safety of schools is mostly the job of the towns where the schools are. Poorer towns do not have money to pay to fix up their schools.  

## Dangers From A Massive Wall Of Water

Many towns have not figured out yet how safe their schools would be in an earthquake. State school leaders checked the area along the coast. They found that 32 schools and other buildings would be in the path of a tsunami. Only a few towns are studying the danger. 

A group that studies earthquake safety says Washington leaders should check the whole state. Lawmakers have not done it yet, because it would cost money. 

Nearby states are doing more about earthquake safety than Washington. The state of California started fixing its schools about 85 years ago. 

Leaders in the state of Oregon checked their schools this year. They found that over 1,000 school buildings might fall in a big earthquake. Oregon is paying to fix the buildings.

British Columbia is north of Washington. It is part of the country of Canada. Leaders there started fixing schools about 10 years ago.
