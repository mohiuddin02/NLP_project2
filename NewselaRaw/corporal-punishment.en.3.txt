JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Jennifer Kavanaugh has been a teacher for 13 years. During that time, she never dreamed of hitting a child — not even once.

Kavanaugh is now a fifth-grade teacher at St. Margaret of Scotland School in St. Louis. Previously, she taught in a school where corporal punishment was used. Simply put, that means that kids who misbehaved were punished with a spanking.

She never used corporal punishment herself — but she knows there are teachers across the state who do. She wants it stopped.

"Corporal punishment does not make for a more peaceful, happier child," she said.

## Some Districts Don't Allow It

Kavanaugh and about 30 of her fifth-grade students attended a hearing Wednesday on a bill that would outlaw corporal punishment in the state. Democratic state Sen. Joe Keaveny is in charge of the bill. The Senate Committee on Progress and Development passed it on Wednesday afternoon. All members voted in favor of the bill.

"We need to stop" hitting "our kids," Keaveny said.

Missouri is one of 19 states that still allows corporal punishment in schools. The latest states to outlaw it were New Mexico in 2011 and Ohio in 2009..

In 2009, at least 70 Missouri school districts allowed the use of corporal punishment.

However, many districts in the St. Louis area do not permit it. These include St. Louis itself, Clayton, Lindbergh and Riverview Gardens.

The Ferguson-Florissant district doesn't allow it either. District officials believe there are better ways to react to bad behavior. They range from calling in parents to suspending or expelling students.

But some districts do allow the practice. About 4,200 students across the state were physically punished in the 2009-2010 school year.

The Fox School District in Jefferson County used to allow spanking in its schools. In the early 2000s, however, it changed its rules, said district official Lorenzo Rizzi.

"I think the board of education no longer sees it as a proper way to punish kids," Rizzi said. Corporal punishment "doesn't change behavior," he said. Often, it just makes things worse.

## Should Bill Cover Private Schools?

The move away from corporal punishment is happening across the country. For the 2009-2010 school year, about 184,500 students were physically punished, compared with about 223,000 in the 2005-2006 school year.

A decrease, however, is not enough for Kavanaugh. She wants to see teachers switch to rewarding students for good behavior.

"We need to" ask "more of teachers," she said.

No one spoke against the bill at Wednesday's hearing. However, Democratic state Sen. Gina Walsh voiced concern about including private schools in the bill. Walsh attended a Catholic school as a child.

"I do not support corporal punishment, but my parents sent me to a faith-based school … I'm opposed to government" telling such schools what they will teach, she said.

Senate committee Chairwoman Jolie Justus said she wants to move the bill forward. Nonetheless, she thinks there could be a problem when it comes to private schools.

"I suspect we'll hear from people who don't want" the state interfering "in private schools," Justus said. "At some point, we may need" to make some changes when "folks come and talk to us. Right now, I haven't heard" from anyone who's against it.
