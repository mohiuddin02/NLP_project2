It is lunchtime at a high school in Los Angeles. Parrish Jackson throws out her food.

The apricots are "sour," Parrish says. The turkey burger is "nasty." Parrish ate the potatoes. But she wanted to buy Cheetos and juice.

Parrish is not alone. In Los Angeles, students throw out at least $100,000 of food every day. Schools here waste $18 million each year.

David Binkle is in charge of meals for Los Angeles schools. "What can we do?" he asks. "We can stop forcing children to take food they do not like."

## Eating Healthy

Many experts disagree. They say kids need to be given fruits and vegetables again and again. Then kids will start eating them.

A law was passed in 2010. It is called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. The law says that students must take at least three foods at lunch. One food must be a fruit or vegetable. Otherwise, the government will not pay for the food. It does not matter if students throw out the food.

Companies that make food for schools want to change the law. They think students should not have to take foods they do not want to eat.

## Food That Tastes Good

Juliana Cohen works with Harvard University. She says the law helps children eat healthier. This is very important for poor students. The food at school might be the only food they eat.

Cohen says the answer is not to get rid of the law. The answer is to find new ways to help children to eat healthy. Make meals taste better. Plant school gardens. Having recess before lunch also helps.

Some students eat all of their food. "Since we are football players, we eat all of it, bad or good," said Daniel Ofa.

A'lea Rendey is another student. She pulled a hair from her burger. She said it was gross. She threw out her lunch. Then she went to buy a Pop-Tart. "If the food was good food, we would have no problems," she said.
