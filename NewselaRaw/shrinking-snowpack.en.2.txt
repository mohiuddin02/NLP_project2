LOS ANGELES â€” On Thursday, California workers poked hollow aluminum tubes into Sierra Nevada meadows to measure the snowpack. They did not find much.

"We will conceivably see more years like this in the future," said Jeffrey Mount, a geologist with the Public Policy Institute of California.

The Earth has been getting warmer, scientists say, and the climate is expected to keep getting warmer. Many scientists blame humans. When we burn fossil fuels like gas, oil or coal it releases gasses known as greenhouse gasses. They get trapped in the atmosphere and heat up the Earth.

## A Dry January

Scientists say the state's mountain snowpack could shrink as a result. The snowpack is the layers of snow that build up over time. By the end of the century, more than half of the snowpack could disappear.

But that doesn't mean nature will provide less water to California. The latest climate studies suggest the overall amount of precipitation won't change much, and may even increase across much of California. However, more of it will fall as rain and less as snow. This change will force the state to alter the way it manages one of the world's most complicated water systems.

On Thursday, the snowpack was just 25 percent of the average for this time of year. A dry January is partly to blame, and the storms that hit the state in December dumped heavy amounts of rain, not snow.

At its peak, the California snowpack holds about 15 million acre-feet of water. That is enough water to fill Shasta Lake, the state's largest reservoir, more than three times. The snow melts gradually over several months, trickling down mountains into rivers and reservoirs in the spring and early summer. The reservoirs fill just when the need for drinking water and water to irrigate farmland goes up.

## Changing Rules For Dams?

Rain, on the other hand, "has to be dealt with immediately. You can't wait," said Kelly Redmond, deputy director of the Western Regional Climate Center in Nevada.

Dealing with the heavy rains was not a problem in December. Because there had been three years of severe drought in the state, the reservoirs had plenty of room to absorb the water. The level of Shasta Lake rose by nearly 60 feet.

Due to climate change, though, there could soon be more rain in winter than California's water system could handle, said Dan Cayan, a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Cayan added that the temperature in California has risen 1-degree Fahrenheit since the 1950s. Even that single degree increase has already cost California and the West 5 percent to 10 percent of its snowpack.

Adapting to the extra winter rainfall could literally require an act of Congress. Dams control the flow of water in and out of the reservoirs. They are operated according to a set of rules developed for each reservoir by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Congress has to approve any changes.

The California Department of Water Resources and the federal government together operate most of California's large dams. They are studying whether the rules should be changed because of the warming climate.

## More Water Storage Needed

The state also is considering taking into account weather forecasts. If heavy rains were headed for the Sierra, for instance, water could be released from the reservoirs to make room.

None of this is simple. Letting water out to make room for rain that never comes would mean less water for people. Yet, filling up reservoirs in the winter may cause flooding during spring storms.

"Who wants to be the responsible person for not having that flood space in the reservoir?" asked Iris Stewart-Frey, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied changes in the snowmelt.

Many experts say an obvious solution is to build more water storage. "I think if you want to replace 5 million acre-feet of lost snowpack, I don't see any other way than more storage," state hydrologist Maury Roos said. Hydrology is the study of water. Roos uses science and math to solve water-related problems in the state.

But should California build new reservoirs or increase groundwater storage, or both? Groundwater is water located beneath the Earth's surface, so groundwater storage is less likely to evaporate. Also, who would pay for the costs of the new storage?

The loss of snowpack is "definitely going to be a problem," said Jay Lund, director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at University of California, Davis. But if it's managed well, Lund said it should not be a disaster.
