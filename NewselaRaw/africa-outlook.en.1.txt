The capital of Senegal, on the western edge of Africa, looks nothing like the sleepy port city that Amadou Sy remembers from his youth.

High-rise buildings are shooting up across the Dakar skyline. Shops and restaurants fill with people, and everyone seems to own a cellphone, or even two.

Changes like these have lifted the outlook of many people on the African continent, although it continues to experience high levels of poverty and conflict.

A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that people in major sub-Saharan African nations were more optimistic about their economic future than many others around the world.

## Region Escaped Global Crisis In 2007

The region was relatively untouched by the global financial crisis that started in 2007, when many countries' stock markets fell. Africa has also produced some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), a group of countries that work together to help the global economy, projects that sub-Saharan Africa will see its economies grow about 4.5 percent in 2015, as more goods are produced and sold in the region. This growth is not as high as in some previous years, but that figure would be envied by many Western countries, including the United States.

"I am not as optimistic as the people in the survey, but I am more optimistic than I have been in a while," said Sy. He heads the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, a think tank of academics in Washington. "I can see there is a window of opportunity — but it is shrinking."

He noted that the region's population has also been growing rapidly. So while the economic expansion represents a notable turnaround from the woes of previous decades, poverty rates have not fallen as quickly as in other parts of the world.

## Many Still Living In Poverty

More than 40 percent of the people in sub-Saharan Africa still live on less than $1.25 a day, according to the United Nations. The U.N. is preparing to approve new goals this month that will shape global development for the next 15 years.

Analysts also are seeing signs that could alter a rosy economic outlook.

Sub-Saharan Africa has benefited from high prices for oil and other commodities, which have started to decline sharply. Economic problems in China and Europe — major buyers of Africa's oil and other natural resources — are also causing anxiety among Africa's leaders.

Pew's report was based on interviews conducted in the spring with more than 9,000 people in nine countries. Together, the nine countries account for about half the population of sub-Saharan Africa.

## Nine Countries Among The Most Stable

The nine countries are Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. They are generally regarded as among the more stable on the continent.

"You wouldn't get the same results from some of the old-school-dictator, badly performing countries," said Staci Warden. She is the executive director of the Center for Financial Markets at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, California.

The findings in Burkina Faso might also have been different had the survey been conducted after last week's military takeover. Instead it was conducted last year, after a popular uprising that unseated one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, President Blaise Compaore.

"But there are up-and-coming countries," Warden said. Many of them have seen economic growth rates topping 5 percent and a population that is increasingly moving from the countryside to the cities. The counties are also experiencing the emergence of a middle class, more democratic elections and better government decision-making.

The countries selected for the Pew poll represent a wide geographic spread. They also reflect different levels of development, which is reflected in the findings, said Katie Simmons, one of the study's authors.

## Less-Developed Areas Want More Foreign Aid

More than 8 in 10 people who participated in the poll in Senegal, Burkina Faso and Uganda said their countries need more foreign aid. This figure can be compared with just 26 percent in South Africa, which has the highest per capita income among the countries included in the study.

Across the nine nations, about 60 percent said they expect their country's economy to improve over the next year, which is higher than in many other regions. Latin America came in second at 44 percent, trailed by the United States at 34 percent and Europe a distant 24 percent.

Many Africans were also optimistic about the economic prospects for the next generation. About 56 percent believed that today's children would be better off financially than their parents.

But they saw serious problems in their countries. Chief among them were a lack of jobs, and poor-quality health care and schools.

Although most of the survey respondents said they were at least somewhat confident that their governments would solve the major problems in their countries, they also had criticisms. A large majority considered government corruption a big problem, the study said.

Foreign aid groups and businesses also received largely favorable ratings. But some participants had concerns about inefficiency and corruption in nonprofit groups, as well as the environmental effects of oil and mining.
