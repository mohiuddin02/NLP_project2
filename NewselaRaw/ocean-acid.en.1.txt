SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — Marine biologist Gretchen Hofmann has a number of sea urchins wriggling in the tank in her laboratory. These violet-colored, prickle-backed spheres live underwater and are not really known for their speed.

But these lowly sea urchins adapt very quickly to environmental changes. So they're helping answer a question that's key to understanding changes in the ocean. As fossil-fuel emissions produced by humans disrupt marine life and make the seas more acidic, will evolution come to the rescue?

These hedgehogs of the sea show nature's stunning capacity to tough it out in the face of huge changes. A number of plants, animals and fish threatened by souring seas are likely to adjust or evolve. But few seem as wired as these saltwater pincushions to come through the next several decades unscathed.

"Evolution can happen, and it can happen quickly," said Hofmann, a marine biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has studied urchins for years. "But concerns about extinction are very real." Hofmann and other scientists are concerned that sea creatures could be pushed beyond what they can tolerate and die out because the water is changing so much.

## "Evolution Is Not A Gentle Sport"

The oceans are absorbing a quarter of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by burning coal, oil and natural gas. Researchers say this is causing sea chemistry to change faster than it has for tens of millions of years.

Which plants and animals can accommodate these harsher seas — and for how long — will depend on many factors. This includes where they live, their population sizes, and the levels of stress they face from other forces, such as warming temperatures and pollution. Survival will vary species by species and not everything will make it.

"Evolution is not a gentle sport," said Stephen Palumbi, an ecologist at Stanford University. Palumbi added that when evolution happens, it is because the "unfit are dying" and it is a "pretty brutal" process.

In the late 2000s, urchin fisherman Bruce Steele feared things were not going very well for the animals, and he had good reasons to think so.

Urchins graze on seaweed and are eaten by sea otters and humans. Steele is a scuba diver who has made his living since the 1970s scooping up the spiny delicacies to sell to sushi restaurants as uni.

But when he read a research paper about sea acidification, he saw right away what it could mean for his business, and for the ocean he loves.

## Fisherman To The Rescue?

So Steele dialed up Hofmann, who is the expert on urchins at his local university, and she started looking into his concerns about their health.

Her first experiment was to put urchin babies in water with high levels of carbon dioxide and observe what happened. Hofmann made a troubling discovery when she found that the babies often got smaller.

Increasing CO2 in the oceans reduces carbonate ions in the water. These carbonate ions are needed by scallops, crabs, coral and sea urchins to build their shells and skeletons.

"Overall, their body size really matters in how well they swim and how much food they get," Hofmann said. "So if you're smaller, it's really bad news if you're a baby sea urchin in the water."

But the scientist noticed that while some of the babies shrunk, some didn't change size at all; so not all of the urchins reacted to the water in the same way. Hofmann knew enough about genetic science to know that this distinction might prove important.

Animals can change in reaction to their surroundings simply, elegantly and quickly. In Manchester, England, a common tree moth evolved from mostly speckled ivory color to black in just decades.

## The Amazing Changing Color Moth

Two hundred years ago in Manchester, there were two types of moths. The most common was ivory colored and the other was black. But when soot from local factories darkened the light trees, the white moths were easily spotted by birds, while the black moths were more difficult to see.

The white moths were eaten and the black moths did well, so the most common moth color changed from ivory to black. Once smoke pollution was controlled, the tree trunks grew light again. After this, the ivory-colored moths returned to dominance.

Like the moths, Hofmann suspected that some urchins were better able to handle changes than others. It all depends on the levels in the water the animals are used to. Near to the shore, for example, water moves around a lot and the levels of carbon dioxide in the water can vary at different times of day.

The CO2 levels are also higher or lower in different parts of the ocean. In the oceans of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, the urchins have spent millions of years in water with lots of CO2. But in Southern California, the animals have experienced much less carbon dioxide.

So Hofmann and a co-worker mated "wimpy" Southern California sea urchins with "tougher" males from the north. The result was that the northern animals passed on genes that are more resistant to acidified water.

"The babies — the kids — of that father were much better at maintaining the size of their body and not succumbing to the stress of high-CO2 water," Hofmann said.

## Urchins Show They Can Evolve

At the same time, the Stanford researchers grew urchins in water from Southern California and from high-CO2 zones in Oregon. They found that some of the animals started to adapt their bodies successfully to higher levels of carbon dioxide.

Urchins, in both cases, have shown they can evolve. "It was really kind of surprising, and a little bit on the hopeful side," Hofmann said. But as the sea continues to fill up with carbon dioxide the scientists still don't know how much the sea urchins can take before it is too much.

Palumbi admitted that the experiments "don't tell us how long it will take for them to reach their limit." Another thing they don't know is how many urchins will shrink and suffer before they have adapted to the new ocean conditions.
