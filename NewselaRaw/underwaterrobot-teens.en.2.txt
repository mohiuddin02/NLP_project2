SEATTLE — A dining room table centerpiece is usually a vase of flowers. Yet in the McConnaughey house, in Puget Sound, a robot sits in the middle of the table.

Snacking on guacamole and chips, Hannah, Haley and Annika begin to pull apart their robot.

Something doesn't feel right.

Haley McConnaughey, 14, explains the advanced mathematical equations she did. She had to figure out the right size for the blades on the robot's propellers. Older sister Hannah quickly wipes away some guacamole that fell onto the machine.

The team asks themselves again: Can their underwater robot save a 200-pound diver trapped at sea?

## The Girls Love A Challenge

That was the task at hand as they were preparing to leave for the upcoming Black Sea International ROV Competition and Exhibition in Romania. An ROV is a remotely operated vehicle, like the robot they have built. The contest is the largest for underwater robotics in Europe. Teams from all over the world will compete to see whose robot can rescue an underwater mannequin diver and turn off an underwater mine. The top three will be taken out to a real shipwreck. There the robots must find and bring back hidden treasure.

"The fact I get to do this before I have my driver's license is crazy," said Hannah, 17. She was also picked to give the opening speech at the competition in Romania.

Hannah's team is the only one from the United States and will face high school and college underwater robotic teams from Egypt, India, Iran, Poland, Russia and Romania.

"We went from middle schoolers to representatives of the United States," Haley said.

"It's incredible how much your life can change in three months," said Annika Hustard. She recently joined the team, and only participated in her first robotics contest in May. The contest in Romania ends on Aug. 20.

The girls say they get bored easily and love to solve problems. They have spent their entire summer working 12- to 14-hour days on their robot.

"This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience," Haley said. "All the things we could do this summer will be here next summer."

## And They Like To Win

Each one has a different motivation.

Annika is 13 and wants to be a part of "innovation that can help so many people."

Haley learned pre-algebra at age 8 and is fascinated with the ocean.

Hannah was reciting Shakespeare at the age of 6. She just likes to win, at everything.

With about $500, their robot is made of donated items and whatever they had lying around.

They use PVC, or plastic pipes. There is an old printer feeder used as gears. The hand is a comb used to groom horses. The lights are LED strips used to light up pools. A bicycle inner tube, cooking racks and pool "noodles" keep the robot floating.

They first thought their team would be an after-school neighborhood nerd club. Instead, it turned into a winning international underwater robotics team. The team, formed a few years ago with elementary and middle school children, started beating high schoolers.

It wasn't easy. Sometimes their robot would die 10 minutes before the contest.

"They would go one step forward and three steps back for months," said Ashley McConnaughey, mother of Hannah and Haley.

## Coming Back Stronger

At a 2012 ROV competition, where Hannah and Haley were on the team, the robot blew a fuse, stopping the team from advancing to the international.

The following year, they came back strong, winning first place in the Pacific Northwest, and 11th in the world.

The girls — who raised the money for their trip to Romania — aren't in it just for themselves. They want to encourage other girls to take an interest in science, engineering and math. They bring their robot to county fairs.

During a recent appearance, they noticed that "the boys will rip the controller out of your hands," while a lot of the girls were more shy, Hannah McConnaughey said.

"Everything we are doing proves girls can do exactly what guys can do, and better," Annika said.
