As students settle back in to school, here comes a big homework assignment: an organization called StoryCorps wants tens of thousands of teenagers across America to record an interview with a grandparent or another elder this Thanksgiving.

StoryCorps, an oral history nonprofit organization, has asked high school history teachers to help spread the word about the challenge.

To take part in "The Great Thanksgiving Listen," students will record interviews using StoryCorps' free smartphone application and upload their recordings to the Library of Congress. The recordings will be shared with the public as part of the American Folklife Center.

## Stories Will Live On

StoryCorps founder Dave Isay says "The Great Thanksgiving Listen" is an assignment that will last for generations.

When young people do these interviews, they know "their great-great-great-great-great-grandkids are going to get to eavesdrop on this conversation someday," Isay explained in a phone interview. Students are giving listeners a chance to understand who their ancestors were, he said.

Isay hopes the Thanksgiving interviews will become an annual tradition. He wants to use modern technology to preserve the wisdom of elders and bring families closer together.

This year's interviews could tap into memories of events dating back to the 1920s, but Isay said the stories are not as important as the fact that two people are talking.

"The purpose of StoryCorps is to have the two people who have this conversation feel more connected with each other and give the person who is being interviewed the chance to be heard," he said. "It's not so much what's in the stories as what the experience is like for the people who are recording."

## "The Importance Of The Moment"

Brandon Clarke, an administrator at the private Berkeley Carroll School in Brooklyn, New York, is enthusiastic about the Thanksgiving challenge. He said StoryCorps, which is headquartered near the school, interviewed some of his teachers while developing an instructional guide for the project.

Clarke said Berkeley Carroll teachers might use classroom exercises to help students sharpen their interviewing skills in the weeks leading up to the holiday. They could cover things like, "How do you develop good questions? How do you go about conducting an interview? How do you build off of a really interesting response?" he said.

According to Isay, interviewing is not hard. In fact, he has decided that people are naturally good at it.

"It's just a matter of concentrating, being present, making sure you're in a quiet place," he said. "I think people understand the importance of the moment and they treat it very seriously."

## History Takes Any Form

StoryCorps has collected 60,000 conversations since 2003. Roughly 10,000 of those were recorded using the StoryCorps app, which was released in March 2015. The app was funded by a $1 million prize from the TED organization and a $600,000 grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

The other 50,000 interviews took place in StoryCorps' mobile recording booth or its permanent booths in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Atlanta.

Using the library is not the only way people can enjoy all those StoryCorps interviews. Every Friday, a popular National Public Radio show called "Morning Edition" plays short clips from the interviews to about 13 million radio listeners. StoryCorps also creates animated videos and podcasts using shorter versions of the recordings.

Isay said the Thanksgiving project will help spread the idea that history, as described by author and broadcaster Studs Terkel, comes "from the bottom up."

Clarke agreed.

"This is a really great example of how oral history is really history," Clarke said. "It doesn't have to appear in print in a carefully edited book. Individual stories, individual perspectives are also part of history."
