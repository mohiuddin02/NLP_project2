WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court effectively made gay marriage legal Monday in 30 states. Unexpectedly and without comment, the justices decided not to hear appeals from five states seeking to prohibit gay and lesbian marriages. The court's order cleared the way for an immediate expansion of same-sex marriage in the United States.

As Chief Justice John Roberts began the court's new term, he did not say a word on the issue of same-sex marriage. His silence frees same-sex couples to marry in five states— Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.

Same-sex couples in six other states — Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming — should be able to get married soon. Federal appeals judges had overturned state gay marriage bans in those states. However, their rulings were put on hold while the Supreme Court reviewed the cases.

The Supreme Court justices did not resolve for now the question of same-sex marriage nationwide. Still, those 11 states would bring to 30 the number of states where same-sex marriage is legal, plus the District of Columbia.

## Supreme Court Criticized From Both Sides

Challenges on the gay marriage issue are pending in every other state.

Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, a same-sex marriage advocacy group, called on the high court to "finish the job." Wolfson said the court's "delay in affirming the freedom to marry nationwide prolongs the patchwork of state-to-state discrimination." He said the denial of marriage still inflicts "harms and indignity" on too many gay couples in too many places.

Ed Whelan of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an opponent of same-sex marriage, also criticized the court for its "irresponsible denial of review in the cases." Whelan said the court would have a hard time eventually ruling in favor of banning same-sex marriage. The justices upheld too many court decisions that support gay marriage, he said.

The situation was changing rapidly Monday in the affected states.

— Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said marriage licenses could be issued to same-sex couples as early as Monday afternoon.

— In North Carolina, lawyers for same-sex couples planned to ask a judge on Monday to overturn the state's gay marriage ban.

— In Oklahoma, the clerk in the largest county said he would await a formal order from the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. After he receives the order, he would begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

Experts and advocates on both sides of the issue had expected the justices to step in and decide gay marriage cases this term.

## Rulings Of Lower Courts Left In Place

Advocates argued the justices have an obligation to settle an issue of such national importance, not leave that responsibility to lower court judges. Because the judges decided not to hear the cases, the rulings of lower courts, which allowed same-sex marriage, were left in place.

Two other federal appeals courts, in Cincinnati and San Francisco, could issue decisions any time in same-sex marriage cases. Judges in the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit are weighing pro-gay marriage rulings in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. They appeared more likely to rule in favor of state bans than the 9th Circuit judges in San Francisco. The judges in San Francisco are considering Idaho and Nevada bans on marriage.

James Esseks is with the American Civil Liberties Union. He said he believes the Supreme Court will quickly take up a case if an appeals court upholds a state's decision to ban same-sex marriage.

It takes just four of the nine Supreme Court justices to vote to hear an appeals case. However, a majority of at least five justices is needed for the court to make a ruling. It's not known how the justices voted on whether to hear the same-sex marriage appeals.

With four justices each in the liberal and conservative camps and Justice Anthony Kennedy more or less in the middle, it appeared that neither side of the court wanted to take up the issue now. It also may be that Kennedy, with his likely decisive vote, did not want to rule on same-sex marriage now.
