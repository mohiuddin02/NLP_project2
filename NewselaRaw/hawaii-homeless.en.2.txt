HONOLULU, Hawaii â€” Many people who are homeless move from colder states to Hawaii for its warmth and beaches. So many in fact, that Hawaii Governor David Ige has declared a state of emergency to deal with the state's homelessness crisis. His announcement came just days after city and state officials cleared one of the nation's largest encampments. Three hundred people lived and slept there in tents on the street.

The move will help the state speed up the process of building a homeless shelter for families. There are four possible locations being considered, Ige said at a news conference.

"We are making sure that we have options for those who are homeless to move into an emergency shelter, and the biggest deficit in the system is shelter space for families," Ige said. The emergency declaration will help with that shortage. It will allow stand-up shelters to be built quickly for families, he added.

## Homelessness Is Growing

Scott Morishige is the state's homelessness coordinator. He said Hawaii saw a 23 percent increase in its unsheltered homeless population between 2014 and 2015. There was a 46 percent increase in the number of unsheltered families.

At last count there were 7,260 homeless people in Hawaii. The state has the highest homeless rate per capita in the United States. Although Hawaii has a lower population than larger states such as California or Texas, a higher percentage of its residents are homeless.

The state has identified $1.3 million to expand services to homeless individuals and families, Morishige said. In addition to a new shelter, the money would go to a program called Housing First. The program provides homes and services to chronically homeless individuals without requiring them to get sober or treat mental illness first. Programs that help families pay deposits and rent would also be funded.

## More Families Will Be Helped

The state believes its new transitional shelter would house about 15 families at a time, Morishige said. Two locations are under consideration. One is in Kakaako, the neighborhood where the large homeless camp was cleared. The other sites are in Liliha and near Sand Island.

The recent clearing of the Kakaako homeless camp could be used as a model in other parts of the state, Ige said. State officials worked with specialists who provide services to the homeless. Together, they were able to move more than half of the 300 camp residents, including 25 families, into shelters and permanent housing, the governor said.

"They definitely are off the streets and in a better situation," Ige pointed out. The state's goal is to help individuals and families find permanent housing, he added.

## Getting People Out Of Tents

Meanwhile, crews recently began installing converted shipping containers for Honolulu's latest homeless shelter on a gravel lot on Sand Island. The rooms in the first units were designed for couples. They have 73 square feet of space.

"If they're living in tents now, the individual units are going to be just as large or larger," said Chris Sadayasu, who works with the Honolulu Office of Strategic Development.

The rooms, which were made from new shipping containers, have a window and a screen door for ventilation. The structures are insulated, and the roofs have reflective coating. An outside awning will provide shade, said Russ Wozniak, an architect and engineer from Group 70, an architecture firm. Insulation will keep the units about 30 degrees cooler than outside temperatures, Wozniak said.

It is as comfortable as you can get without air conditioning, he added.

An on-site trailer holds five bathrooms that each have a toilet and shower. People with disabilities can use a separate portable toilet and shower.

When completed in December, the shelter in an industrial part of Honolulu will temporarily house up to 87 people at a time.
