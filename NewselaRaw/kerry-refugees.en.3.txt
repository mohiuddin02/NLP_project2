BERLIN, Germany â€” Over the next two years many more foreigners will be allowed to resettle in the United States. Secretary of State John Kerry announced the change on Sunday. Kerry is responsible for managing U.S. relations with other countries.

The increase is meant to help refugees who have left their country to escape war. The main group of refugees who will be admitted are from Syria. For the last five years, a terrible war has been raging inside that country. Various fighters have been trying to overthrow Syria's president, Bashar Assad. The U.S. government would also like to see Assad gone. It is supporting some of the Syrian fighters.

The United States will accept 85,000 refugees from around the world next year, up from the 70,000 now permitted. By 2017 the total for the year will rise to 100,000.

Most of the new refugees will be Syrian, while others will come from Africa. Altogether, about 10,000 new Syrian refugees will be admitted next year.

## Many Say U.S. Should Help More

Many people think the U.S. should take in even more Syrians. Kerry said the country will be taking in all it can handle right now. He said it is important to make sure no enemies of the U.S. slip in with the refugees. Carefully checking the refugees takes time, he added.

"We're doing what we know we can manage immediately," he said.

Kerry made his announcement while visiting Germany, where he met with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The two men discussed the Syrian war and the growing refugee problem.

The situation inside Syria has been getting much worse. As many as 9 million people have left their homes. More than 4 million have left the country. They no longer feel it is safe for them and their families.

Some people have asked the U.S. government to accept 100,000 Syrian refugees. Germany says it will accept as many as 1 million Syrians this year.

The increase Kerry announced is much less than what some people want. Still, it is a big change.

## America "A Land Of Second Chances"

America has always been "a land of second chances," Kerry said on Sunday. The decision to allow in more refugees reflects the best in this country's history, he added.

More and more Syrians have been leaving Syria recently. Before making Sunday's announcement Kerry met with a group of Syrian refugees. The refugees said more people are leaving Syria now because many there are finally losing hope that things will ever improve. The war is only getting worse after five years of fighting.

"I personally came here in search of a future," a Syrian woman said. She said her 5-year-old daughter had come to Germany with her but that her two other children were still in Syria with her parents. She hopes they all can leave, too.

Not everyone is happy that so many new Syrian refugees will be resettled in the United States Some lawmakers are worried that fighters from the Islamic State group could slip into the United States pretending to be refugees. They say that kind of thing has happened before.

## Two Iraqi Refugees Jailed As Terrorists

In 2011, two Iraqi refugees who had been resettled in Kentucky were accused of being secret enemies of the United States. Officials said the men belonged to the al-Qaida terrorist group. The two were jailed after their fingerprints were found on bombs that had been planted in Iraq.

Since then, refugees have been screened much more carefully. Some people say they are now screened far too slowly, and often unfairly. That means some people who deserve our help are not let in.

In Washington, Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. "has to do more." Clinton is now running for president, and was secretary of state before Kerry.

Clinton said admitting 10,000 new Syrian refugees was "a good start." She added that she would like to see that number grow to 65,000.

Kerry said the refugee problem can be solved only by ending Syria's civil war. For that to happen, President Assad will have to be replaced, he said.
