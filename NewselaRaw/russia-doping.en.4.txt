MOSCOW, Russia â€” The Olympic Games are held every two years. Most of the world's countries take part.

Each country sends people who are the best at different kinds of sports. These athletes play against each other. The winners are given medals. These are like prizes. The top medal in any sport is gold.

In 2014 the Olympics were held in Sochi, Russia. The Russian athletes did very, very well. They won more medals than any other nation. They also received the largest number of gold medals.

Now those wins are being questioned. A new report says many of the Russian athletes cheated. The wins are for track and field events. Track and field is a sport that has running and jumping.

Russian athletes used drugs that made them stronger and faster, the report says. Such drug use is called doping. It is considered cheating.

## Laboratory Hid Results, Report Says

The report talks about the Federal Security Service (FSS). The FSS is a sort of Russian police force. The FSS covered up doping, the report says.

Athletes are tested for drug use. The report said the FSS visited the lab that does the testing. It said the FSS told scientists to hide evidence of doping.

Before 1991, Russia was part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a group of 15 countries. The countries were headed up by Russia.

The Soviet Union was very good at sports. Its athletes were very well trained.

Then in 1991 the Soviet Union broke apart. Russia became a much poorer country. Young athletes were given much less training. Many athletes left Russia. They went to play for other countries.

The 2010 Vancouver Olympics were particularly bad. Russia only won three gold medals.

## Russian Athletes Might Lose Their Medals

Russia then tried to strengthen its team. It tried to get much better before the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

Russia's athletes did very well at Sochi. They won 33 medals. Thirteen were gold medals.

Now all that may be lost. Some Russian athletes may lose their medals. Russian track and field athletes may be kept out of the next Olympics.

The Russian government says the charges are not true. It says people are trying to make Russia look bad.

It will take time to find out what really happened.
