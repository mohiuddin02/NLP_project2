The four horses had not been visited in weeks. There was no water in their buckets, no hay in their stalls. All of the animals looked dangerously thin.

The horses' caregiver had stopped showing up. So the owner of the stable, Joyce Benes, fed them her own hay, even though they were not her animals. But last year's drought had driven up the price of hay. It increased from $2 a bale to as much as $10. Benes could not afford to keep feeding them forever.

Desperate for help, Benes called the Illinois Department of Agriculture in January. Then she waited. And waited.

"I must've jumped up and down for two weeks," Benes said. "I said, 'I can't have you do this. I can't have you step in when they die. You need to step in now.'"

## Short-Handed State

On Feb. 15, the state took two of the abandoned horses. The state sent the other two back to their original owners. The owners did not know that the caregiver had disappeared, said Jeff Squibb, spokesman for the Agriculture Department.

State officials said they made the case a top priority. They responded as fast as they could, they said. But the agency has only five investigators. They are responsible for investigating animal abuse and neglect complaints in 102 counties.

Dozens – perhaps hundreds – of horses and other large animals have been abandoned or neglected. The owners have not been punished, according to several horse rescuers. They blame the crisis on three things: high hay prices, a bad economy and poor government oversight.

## Horses Running Wild

"It's pretty rough out there right now," said Tony Pecho. He is president of Illinois Horse Rescue of Will County. He estimates that 35 to 50 abandoned horses are running free near his organization's base in Beecher, Illinois. "I'm very, very worried about it."

Horse rescue groups such as Pecho's have picked up abandoned horses on the side of the road. They have found them roaming through the suburbs. Their shelters are crowded to capacity. Sometimes they have three times as many horses as usual. The rescuers have had to turn away new ones, they said.

## No Room At The Pound

Several animal control departments in Illinois say they are getting an unusually high number of calls about horse abandonment. They are trying to cope. But such departments are mostly equipped to deal with cats and dogs.

"I can't keep a horse on this property," said Julie Boudreau of the Kankakee County Animal Control and Adoption Center. "I don't really know of any animal control agencies that have the ability to care for all species of animals."

In the past six months, the Kankakee center has received at least a dozen calls asking for help. The callers complain of horses hit by cars. Some report horses running at large.  "I can only hope that it's not going to get worse," Boudreau said.

## Following The Law

The state's Humane Care for Animals Act determines how cases of abuse or neglect are handled.

County animal control departments have the power to issue fines. Rescue groups and volunteers may handle some abuse and neglect calls. Similarly, sheriffs and police officers can investigate cases. They have the power to seize animals when an owner is arrested.

Animal welfare officials admit it is a challenge to handle all the neglect calls. They blame it on six years of budget cuts.

In 2002, the Bureau of Animal Health and Welfare had 32 employees, compared with 12 now. The bureau's budget was slashed from $7 million to $4.6 million in the same time period, Squibb said.

## It's Up To Lawmakers

Today, five investigators handle animal complaints from across the state. Each investigator is responsible for as many as 15 counties. Last year, 969 neglect complaints were made to the bureau, Squibb said.

Investigators are responsible for other duties. They inspect 2,500 pet shops, kennels, stables and other places licensed to hold animals.

"Everyone's resources are stretched thin, and there's a limit to what we can provide," Squibb said. "If that's not good enough for people, I suggest they contact their lawmakers and tell them to start providing additional resources."
