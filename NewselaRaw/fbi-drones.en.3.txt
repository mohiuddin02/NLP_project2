WASHINGTON â€” The head of the FBI said Wednesday that the bureau had used unmanned spy planes inside the United States. This was the first time he has said this publicly.

The bureau uses unmanned planes "in a very, very minimal way and very seldom," said Robert S. Mueller III. He added that the bureau had very few of the planes, which are called "[drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone)."

The FBI is the top U.S. law enforcement agency. Other government law enforcement groups have tested the planes for use in cracking crimes.

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein wanted to know about people's privacy. She asked Mueller to give details about how the FBI limits the way investigators use video and other information collected by drones. She called drones "the greatest threat to the privacy of Americans."

## Drone Use "Limited"

Mueller said he would have to check on what images from the drones were actually kept. But he said that they were limited to particular needs and particular cases. That was the main protection the bureau had, so far.

Mueller said the FBI was starting to write guidelines to protect Americans' privacy.

"We're exploring not only the use but also the necessary guidelines for that use," he added.

The appearance was probably Mueller's last in front of a congressional committee before he leaves office. Because of recent events, spying on people inside the United States was a big topic.

The National Security Agency has admitted gathering user information from Web sites like Google and Facebook. It used the information to try to stop terror plots. A man who worked for the NSA leaked information about the spy agency's efforts to gather information about people's telephone calls. That caused the NSA to give more details about what information it gathers.

## Privacy Vs. Security Debate

The spy program has been the source of great concern for people who care about privacy.

But NSA Director Keith Alexander said the programs have helped stop more than 50 terror attacks.

Mueller defended the NSA to a Senate committee. He said NSA's surveillance was very important for finding out if anyone in the U.S. was in contact with terrorists overseas.

"You never know which dot is going to be the key," he said. "But you want as many dots as you can. And if you close down a program like this, there will be ... fewer dots to connect."

Mueller said the bureau already was making plans for his successor. President Barack Obama has to name somebody to take Mueller's place. The Senate will have to approve that person.

Mueller said he had met with Obama to discuss his replacement.

## Expect The Unexpected

No matter how much the FBI gets ready, and whoever ultimately takes over, something unexpected probably will change everything, Mueller said. The Sept. 11 terror attacks a week after Mueller took office in 2001 instantly changed the FBI. It went from fighting gangs and bank robberies to focusing more on terrorism and national security.

"It will take, I would say, a month to really get one's feet on the ground," Mueller said. "But in that month, I can tell you something's going to happen. So whatever you planned in terms of sitting down and looking at something, something else will come up and your attention will be diverted."

Committee members from both political parties complimented the departing director. They thanked him for his 12 years of running the bureau.

Some praised him for upgrading the FBI into a more high-tech agency. The bureau can now fight all the new types of computer crime, as well as international terrorism, and investigate complex Wall Street money schemes.
