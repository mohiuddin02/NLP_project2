WASHINGTON — It's an old story: Braving unknown dangers, a team of explorers settles a wild frontier. And then — almost as quickly — bureaucrats tie things up with red tape.

This time, the frontier is outer space. And the regulators — the people who make the rules — are from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). That government agency licenses private, for-profit trips to outer space.

The FAA has so far been very limited in what it can do: Once a spacecraft reaches orbit, it is largely free of regulation.

But that could change soon.

## Space Industry Growing Quickly

This past week, FAA officials and space lawyers began discussing possible new rules. Some of the things they talked about were such things as mining rights and safety practices.

There have been some broad guidelines issued in the past. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, for example, prevents nations from claiming the moon. But space rules have been few and far between. In part that's because few countries — let alone private companies — have had the ability to put people or products into orbit.

But the private space industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Not just governments but businesses as well are now heading into outer space.

In 2012, SpaceX became the first commercial-rocket company to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. And space tourism is taking off too: Both Virgin Galactic and XCOR Aerospace may fly passengers to space later this year.

Those efforts have caught many people's attention. In government and business, there is an increasing attempt to figure out how people and property can stay safe in space.

Many things are being considered. Examples include how to limit the amount of dangerous "space junk" shed by spacecraft and how to coordinate traffic in Earth's orbit.

## Who Should Make The Rules?

FAA administrator George Nield weighed in this week. In the near future, he said, there will probably be more "commercial-transportation vehicles" in space. "It is time to consider" setting rules.

One current law is of particular interest. Written in 2004, it largely bars the FAA from restricting efforts by businesses to launch humans into space. The law is due to end next year.

The law was intended to give the private space business a chance to grow.

Congressman Steven Palazzo argued Tuesday that the law is still needed. FAA rules, he said, could prove to be harmful. They might keep us from seeing "the promise of commercial human spaceflight realized."

But some in the space industry said a few more rules would be a good thing.

Rules are unavoidable, said Mike Gold of Bigelow Aerospace. "The question is who should be" making the rules?

Since the FAA cannot make the rules, the task of crafting regulations for space travel increasingly could fall to NASA. That would not be a good thing, said Gold.

NASA is not an agency that makes rules, he said. And it "has no desire to become one." On the other hand, the FAA does make rules and would be best to do so for space flight.

## Insurance In Outer Space

Demand for rules is coming in part from insurance companies. Those companies protect people and businesses by paying out money if something goes wrong. Lawyer Brian Mitchell said new rules would help insurers operate.

"They are in the business of risk," he said. "If there are no rules of the road up in space, how are you going to" hold anyone legally responsible if something goes wrong?

When it comes to drafting new rules, there's one big problem: the lack of past court cases dealing with space. Indeed, not much space law exists. Because of that, lawyer Russ McMurry said, laws once written for wooden ships might be worth considering.

Some of the "old laws of the sea" perhaps could be applied to space, he said. "Maybe we should go back and look at" what was worked out back then.
