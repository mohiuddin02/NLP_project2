For years, chocolate lovers have been comforted by the fact that chocolate can be good for you. It's long been known that bittersweet dark chocolate improves cardiovascular health. Somehow, the tasty treat helps the heart and blood vessels.

Scientists, however, have always been unsure just why this is so. Until now, that is.

On Tuesday, researchers announced that they had solved the chocolate mystery: It seems that certain chocolate-loving microbes in the gut are responsible. They turn an otherwise indigestible portion of the candy into something useful: anti-inflammatory compounds — that is, mixtures of substances that reduce pain and swelling in the body.

Researchers set up a series of test tubes to mimic humans' gurgling guts. The gut is known by scientists as the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Essentially, it is a long tube that starts at the mouth, feeds into the stomach, and ends at the anus.

## "These Little Guys"

Within their test-tube "gut," researchers exposed cocoa powder to digestive juices and enzymes the body uses to break down food. They then exposed the powder to bacteria found in human feces.

What they found was that after cocoa was "digested," long molecules called polyphenolic polymers remained within the gut. A molecule is the smallest unit or part of a compound.

The polyphenolic polymer molecules are too large to cross the walls of the gut, according to researcher John Finley. Thus they can't be absorbed into the rest of the body as nutrients. Nutrients provide food and nourishment for the body and keeps our body's motor running.

Polyphenolic polymer molecules didn't seem to be of much use at first. They "do nothing for us except travel down the GI tract," Finley said.

That is, until they run into some of the many microbes that inhabit the human colon: in particular, Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria. The colon is the main part of the intestine, which in turn is part of the GI tract. The intestine runs from the bottom end of the stomach to the anus.

"These little guys say, 'Hey — there's something in there that I can use,' and they start to break it down," Finley said.

## Molecules Reducing Swelling

The smaller molecules that result from this breaking down process can travel through the gut wall. Once they leave the gut, they can be used by the body.

"These materials are anti-inflammatory," Finley said. "They serve to prevent or delay the onset of some forms of cardiovascular disease that are associated with inflammation." In other words, by reducing swelling they reduce the risk of various diseases of the heart and blood vessels.

A number of studies suggest that dark chocolate can cause blood vessels to widen. That in turn lowers blood pressure, as blood is able to flow more easily. High blood pressure, of course, can be dangerous: It leads to heart attacks and other serious health problems, like strokes. White chocolate and milk chocolate don't provide this benefit, only dark chocolate, which has higher levels of cocoa.

It has been unclear exactly why this blood-vessel widening happens. Researchers, however, have focused on flavanols, which are found in plants and are considered healthy. In particular they looked at two flavanols called catechin and epicatechin.

Finley said these were among the compounds that were at first poorly digested. Like the polyphenolic polymers, they were eventually broken down by gut microbes. The other main part of the cocoa that was broken down was dietary fiber. It makes up about 30 percent of cocoa powder.

## Cocoa Powder On Oatmeal

Finley said that the amount of cocoa powder needed to produce healthful effects was relatively small: about two tablespoons a day.

There is a problem with dark chocolate, though, Finley said: the amount of sugar and fat that chocolate candy contains. He said you could avoid those substances by putting cocoa powder on oatmeal, as he does.

Finley said that the healthful compounds in cocoa powder might one day be put into pills. He noted that Mars Inc., the maker of M&amp;M candy, is interested in doing just that.

But he said he wasn't very excited by this idea.

"I would rather eat a big old chocolate cookie or a cup of cocoa than . . . take a pill," he said.
