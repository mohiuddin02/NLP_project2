WASHINGTON — Things are buzzing in Washington, D.C., as scientists and leaders are talking about how to save bees. The insect is known for its painful stings. However, it is also a very important part of the American food chain.

Many bees have been dying because they do not have enough food to eat. More and more of the plants that bees feed on have been chopped down. Bees are losing their habitats — the places where they live.

Now, President Barack Obama is stepping in to protect the creature as its habitat disappears.

On May 19, the Obama administration announced its plan to save the bees. Obama also wants to save small birds, bats and butterflies. The program is called the National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honeybees and Other Pollinators. The creatures live in areas that are being destroyed by humans. People are ruining bee habitats through construction, agriculture and pollution.

## Bees Help The Food Supply

Obama's plan will protect the environments that these animals live in. First, it will work to replant forests burned by wildfires. It will also improve the way plants and gardens are taken care of around office buildings. In addition, it will attempt to protect roadside habitats where bees feed.

Sam Droege is a scientist and bee expert for the U.S. government. He said these efforts are necessary to keep bees alive. He called bees the "unpaid and invisible workforce" in America.

Bees help produce much of the world's food supply. They pollinate many different types of food. Bees help pollinate fruit and vegetable crops, alfalfa and clover, nuts, and seeds. Humans aren't the only ones who benefit. Cows, grizzly bears and songbirds do as well. All of these species — along with humans — rely on pollinators to do their jobs.

But over the past five years, the number of bee colonies has been shrinking fast.

Obama cares a lot about protecting these important insects. He also decided to add a beehive to the grounds of the White House. It will also have a pollinators' garden.

## The Dangers That Bees Face

The president's bee plan has two goals: reduce the number of bee colonies that are lost and increase the number of monarch butterflies. In addition, the government will help protect 7 million acres of land across the country for pollinators.

Habitat loss is not the only threat to bees. Another danger is the use of toxic pesticides sprayed on plants. These chemicals can kill bees when they eat from the plant. Some groups want to make these pesticides against the law.

Not everyone thinks this is enough. Mark Winston, a professor at Simon Fraser University, said Obama needs to push large farms as well. Winston believes these agricultural companies should find ways to grow crops that do not need the types of pesticides that kill bees.

Many people describe Obama's efforts — especially protecting bees' habitats — as a step in the right direction. W. Atlee Burpee &amp; Company has given more than 1 million seed packets to the bee program for free.

The White House, National Park Service and Agriculture Department are distributing the seeds to Americans to plant in their yards. Then, hopefully, these gardens will attract and support the pollinators that we all rely on.
