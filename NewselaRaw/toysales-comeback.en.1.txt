NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” It is a good time to be in the toy business.

The U.S. toy industry is expected to have its strongest year in at least a decade after several years of poor sales. There has been more competition in recent years, with kids choosing videogames and mobile apps over Barbie and stuffed bears.

Annual toy sales are expected to rise 6.2 percent to $19.9 billion in 2015, according to The NPD Group Inc., a market research firm that studies what is happening in the toy industry. That is better than last year's 4 percent increase. In fact, it is the biggest increase in at least 10 years.

The 2015 estimates take into account the strong sales expected during the final three months of the year. Thanks to holiday shoppers, October, November and December sales are expected to reach $9.6 million, a 5 percent increase. Last year, there was only a 3.6 percent gain during the holidays.

The strong year of sales comes after 10 years of slow growth and declines as children became more enthralled with technology.

## Movie Toys, And More Movie Toys

What's giving toys a boost? According to experts, there are at least three factors fueling the growth of toy sales. Collectibles for starters, as toys based on Hollywood blockbuster films are becoming more and more popular. At the same time, improving technology is making toys more advanced, allowing them to do things like talk back to children. Finally, toy companies are having more success reaching out to younger children.

Demand for toys related to the movie "Frozen" helped the toy industry achieve a rare gain last year. "Frozen" tells the story of a princess who sets off to find her sister with icy powers, and toys based on the film were extremely popular. In fact, "Frozen" was the top toy brand last year according to NPD, reaching $531 million in sales.

The new "Star Wars" movie, which comes out on December 18, is bringing with it another batch of popular movie-based toys. Hundreds of toys, from puzzles to action figures related to "Star Wars," are expected to boost sales.

## The Holiday Season Sales Race

Marty Brochstein, who works at the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association, says that one "Star Wars" toy is already selling out. Costing $199.99, the toy company's "Kylo Ren" Deluxe LightSaber, which features motion sensor-controlled sound effects is already flying off shelves. He says "Star Wars" appeals to both children and adults.

"It's multi-generational," Brochstein says.

Hasbro, the nation's second-largest toy company, reported a jump in sales this year, helped by toys related to "Star Wars."

Hasbro has the major merchandising licensing rights to make Star Wars toys from now until 2020. It is also teaming up with The Walt Disney Company to make "Frozen" dolls in 2016.

David Brandon is the new head of the toy store Toys R Us. He says that the store is placing big bets this holiday season on brands like "Star Wars" to help boost sales.

"It will be very interesting to see at the end of the holiday season where the growth comes from. And how much growth there is," Brandon says.

## Tech Toys Are More Sophisticated

Another reason experts think that more toys are being sold has to do with technology. Toymakers have begun using computer chip technology, which is getting cheaper and more powerful, in toys. As a result, toys are becoming more complex.

"The selection is much greater than in the past," said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of an online toy review site called TTPM. "Technology is much better in the toy aisle, and it's really inspiring young kids to play, but also bringing older kids to things like radio control and role-play items."

Toy companies are pushing remote-controlled cars and flying droids controlled by smartphones. Meanwhile, robotic toys are becoming more life-like and now include voice recognition features. A toy unicorn made by Hasbro called StarLily My Magical Unicorn, for example, responds to voice and touch with more than 100 sound and motion combinations.

Mattel, the nation's largest toy company, also is hoping technology will help it reverse years of slumping sales.

"You want to make sure that you give them enough that they're going to want to walk away from their iPads and phones," Mattel's Executive Vice President Geoff Walker said.

Mattel's new Barbie features speech recognition and can have a two-way conversation with girls. Another popular toy is "Smart Bear," an interactive plush bear that links to a smartphone app to help kids learn.

## Video Games Are Still Hot

Toys continue to be popular with young kids, but toymakers are also focusing on grabbing the attention of the tween and preteen crowds. Kids between 8 and 12 years old account for 22 percent of toy sales, according to NPD. However, they are also the biggest users of mobile devices. Rather than buying toys, many preteens prefer video games and apps.

Now, toymakers believe they can get these kids' attention because features like voice recognition are more affordable, allowing toys to become more advanced.

For example, a toy robot called Meccano Meccanoid G15 allows kids to build and program their own personal 4-foot-tall robot that records and plays back audio and it learns from them. It has more than 1,200 parts and tons of computer memory.

Even classic toys are getting updated to appeal more to older kids. Hasbro spiffed up its Nerf gun to attract teenagers, creating a version called Nerf Rival for kids older than 14. It shoots balls 100 feet per second. Think paint ball meets Nerf.

Still, it could be a hard sell. It's hard for toys to compete these days.

"It's fun. But I don't know how long I would play with this until I got bored." Jackson Roberts, 14, from Manhattan said, referring to Nerf Rival. On Roberts' holiday wish list: a 3-D printer and a droid that takes pictures.
