A strong earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday, killing more than 3,000 people. The quake — Nepal's most powerful in 80 years — tore apart highways and destroyed buildings. It also triggered avalanches on Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.

Laxmi Dhakal, an official with Nepal's Home Ministry, said the death toll was almost certain to rise.

Residents reported seeing collapsed walls, broken windows and fallen telephone poles.

The earthquake struck just before noon local time. The center of the magnitude-7.8 earthquake was 48 miles northwest of Kathmandu, Nepal's capital and home to 1.4 million people.

## Kathmandu Valley Hit Hardest

Magnitude is a measure of how strong an earthquake is on a 1 to 10 scale.

The capital and Kathmandu Valley were hit hardest by the earthquake. It also shook several cities across northern India, and was felt as far away as Pakistan, Tibet and Bangladesh.

Officials said the earthquake occurred only 7 miles below ground, which is considered shallow. The closer an earthquake is to the earth's surface, the greater its destructive power. Witnesses said the trembling of the earth went on for several minutes.

A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later, and at least 20 other aftershocks followed the huge quake.

"This quake was so big," said Prajana W. Pradham, who is helping coordinate the emergency response for the CARE relief organization. "We've been feeling tremors for four hours. I just felt another big jolt."

Kathmandu's airport was closed, its television and Internet services were disrupted, and phone and electricity lines were down.

## Buildings Damaged Or Destroyed

A number of historic buildings were severely damaged or destroyed, including Patan Durbar Square. The area is considered a World Heritage site, a place considered by the United Nations to be of great cultural importance. It is filled with temples and an ancient royal palace. The 200-foot-tall Dharahara Tower, which was built in 1832, collapsed, trapping some people underneath.

Video from the scene showed people digging through the rubble of the collapsed tower, looking for survivors.

As the quake became worse, residents ran out of homes and buildings in panic. Large cracks opened up on streets and walls.

An Indian Air Force plane carrying 40 rescue and medical workers and supplies arrived in Kathmandu. Three other aircraft were sent from India, one of them carrying a mobile hospital, said Indian government official Sujatha Singh.

"There has been heavy damage in and around Kathmandu," Singh said. Nepal's government has asked for tents, blankets as well as teams to help search for survivors. On Sunday, Singh said 10 helicopters would be sent for local rescues, medical transportation and food distribution.

## The Devastating 1934 Quake

Nepal, a country of about 30 million people, is bordered by India and China.

Many structures in Nepal are made of brick or rubble and stone, and people were injured by falling bricks.

The quake was of the same magnitude as the one that nearly destroyed San Francisco in 1906. It was about 16 times more  powerful than the magnitude-7 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

In January 1934, a magnitude-8.2 quake struck Nepal, killing an estimated 10,000 people in Nepal and more than 7,000 in India. Much of Kathmandu was destroyed in that quake.

It has still not yet been determined how much damage the quake has caused. However, it will likely put a huge strain on this poor country best known for Mount Everest. Nepal depends  heavily on money from tourism, mainly people trekking and climbing the Himalaya Mountains.

## "Huge Disaster ... Many Dead"

Javier Camacho Gimenez is a mountaineer and photographer who was at an Everest base camp to attempt the ascent to the summit. He said that avalanches had buried some of the camps.

He estimated that eight people had died and 40 were injured. "The situation in the Everest base camp is now chaos," he told a Spanish news agency. "Helicopters cannot access the area due to bad weather."

Alex Gavan, a mountaineer, posted on Twitter that the quake triggered an avalanche about 5 miles west of Everest. "Huge disaster," he wrote. "Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured."

Ariani Soejeti is with the aid group International Organization for Migration. She said that recently built structures in Kathmandu seemed to have made it through the quake. Severe aftershocks continued after nightfall and people had been told to stay outdoors.

Nepal's government said roads were blocked, delaying rescues. Rain was forecast for Sunday, which could add to the misery of those whose homes were destroyed.
