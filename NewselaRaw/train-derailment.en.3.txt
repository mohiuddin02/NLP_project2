NEW YORK  â€” A New York City train came off the tracks as it went around a curve along a river on Sunday. Four people died and more than 60 were injured.

Passengers were thrown from the toppling cars. The crash left twisted wreckage just inches from the water.

About 150 passengers were on a train heading to Manhattan when the crash happened at 7:20 a.m. Some were asleep. They were awakened by screams and the frightening feeling of their train car rolling over on a bend in the Bronx where the Hudson and Harlem rivers meet. When the motion stopped, four or five of the seven cars had jumped off the rails.

"Four people lost their lives today in the holiday season, right after Thanksgiving," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.

## Happened Along A Sharp Curve

The train operator was among the injured, Cuomo said.

The governor said the track did not appear to be broken. That left speed as a possible reason for the crash. But Cuomo noted that federal officials would figure out what happened.

Thomas F. Prendergast is in charge of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA. It is in charge of New York City trains, and some other trains around the city and in Connecticut. He said investigators would look at many things. Among those will be the train, the track and signal system, the operators and the speed of the train.

The speed limit on the curve is 30 miles per hour, compared with 70 mph in the area approaching it. The train's information recorders should be able to tell how fast it was traveling.

Frank Tatulli was a passenger on the train. He told a television station that the train appeared to be going "a lot faster" than usual as it approached the sharp curve near a station.

The train was about half full at the time of the crash, rail officials said. Some passengers were probably heading to the city for holiday shopping, officials said.

## Boom Shakes Nearby Buildings

Joel Zaritsky was sleeping on the train when the accident happened.

"I woke up when the car started rolling several times. Then I saw the gravel coming at me, and I heard people screaming," he said. His right hand was bloody. There was smoke and debris everywhere, he said. "People were thrown to the other side of the train."

A huge boom shook nearby buildings. Angel Gonzalez was in bed in his high-rise apartment that looks over the train tracks when he heard the roar.

"I thought it was a plane that crashed," he said.

Firefighters shattered windows of the toppled train cars to reach passengers. Rescuers also searched the water and nearby woods.

Investigators planned to turn the train cars upright. They want to be certain no one was trapped beneath.

Three men and one woman were killed, the MTA said.

The wreck looked like a twisted toy train, the governor told CNN.

The crash could have been even worse if it happened on a weekday, when the train is full. Or the lead car could have plunged into the water.

"It would have been a tremendous disaster" on a workday, Salvatore Joseph Cassano said. He is in charge of New York City's Fire Department.

## Special Safety Equipment Urged

Government accident investigators have been asking railroads to install special equipment. The equipment can stop accidents caused when trains go too fast.

Congress passed a law in 2008. It gave railroads until the end of 2015 to install the equipment. They use satellites, wireless radio and computers to monitor trains.

But the equipment is expensive and complicated. Railroads want another five to seven years to finish putting it in.

Metro-North is putting in the equipment right now. It already has what's called an "automatic train control" signal system. The system automatically applies the brakes if an engineer doesn't answer an alert that tells him when a train is speeding.

Such systems can slow trains some of the time, but not bring them to a halt, said Grady Cothen. He used to be a railroad safety official for the government.

It's very unlikely that the accident was caused by a brake failure, Cothen said.

Sunday's accident was the second time in six months that a passenger train operated by this company came off the tracks, or derailed.

On May 17, a train derailed in Connecticut. It was struck by another train. The crash injured 73 passengers, two engineers and a conductor. Eleven days later, a man who worked for the MTA was struck and killed by a train.
