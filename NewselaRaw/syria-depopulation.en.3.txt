HOMS, Syria â€” Homs is a large Syrian province, or state. It is also the name of the province's main city.

The city of Homs was once busy and full of life. Now, not much of it is left. Much of the city has been destroyed.

A terrible war has been going on inside Syria for the past five years. Several groups of fighters have been trying to remove President Bashar Assad from power. Their aim is to take over the country. They have been fighting government forces all over Syria.

Today much of the city of Homs is in ruins.

Before the war started, more than 2 million people lived in Homs province. Now many of them are gone. They have moved to safer parts of Syria or to other countries.

## City Feels Empty And Strange

Some people have remained in Homs, though. For them, the city feels strangely empty and ghostly.

Elia Samman grew up here. He now lives in Damascus, the country's main city.

When he was growing up in Homs his family was friendly with nine other families, Samman says. Now, only three of those families remain in Syria. The rest have left for Sweden, Germany, Egypt, countries in the Persian Gulf, or other countries.

The same thing is true all over Syria. More than 4 million people have left the country since the war began. Another 8 million were forced to move to a different part of Syria.

Still, Syrians try hard to stay in touch with family and friends. Apps like Skype and WhatsApp help them talk and send text messages with family scattered around the world.

"Every night we spend at least an hour on WhatsApp trying to catch up," Samman says.

## Gunfire In Some Places

In some parts of Syria, life still seems much as it was before the war. In Damascus, the famous market is still crowded with shoppers. Families still go out for ice cream together.

Just a few miles away things are very different, though. Here the walls of apartment buildings are covered with bullet holes. Shops have been blown up. Gunfire can be heard in the distance. Drivers passing through the area are told not to stop.

Things are also rough in many parts of the city of Aleppo. The large city is now divided into zones. Some zones are controlled by the government. Others are controlled by forces trying to overthrow the government.

Fighting goes on right inside Aleppo. Most of those who have been killed were not fighters at all, just ordinary people.

## "Aleppo Is My Home"

Aleppo's Old City neighborhood has been hit hard. It is full of burned storefronts, bombed buildings and hidden gunmen. Nonetheless, Mahmoud Badawi still keeps his small shop open.

These days almost all of Badawi's customers are government soldiers. They line up to buy food, drinks and cigarettes.

Once the Old City was lively and busy. It was full of all sorts of small businesses. Today only a few remain.

As for Badawi, he plans to stay put. He says he cannot imagine living anywhere else.

"Why would I leave?" Badawi says. "Aleppo is my home."
