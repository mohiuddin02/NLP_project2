WASHINGTON — Faith Spotted Eagle figures that building a crude oil pipeline from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast would bring little to Indian Country besides more crime and dirty water. But, she doubts that [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) will be able to block the project.

"There is no way for Native people to say no — there never has been," said Spotted Eagle, 65, a Yankton Sioux tribal elder from Lake Andes, S.D. "Our history has caused us not to be optimistic."

South Dakota is home to some of the nation's poorest American Indians.

Opponents may be down after a State Department study found that the proposed $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline would not contribute to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming). But they haven't abandoned their goal of killing what some call "the black snake."

Tribes are busy preparing for nonviolent battle with TransCanada, the company that wants to develop the 1,700-mile oil pipeline.

## Tribal Members Divided

While organizers said they want to keep their plans a secret, they're considering blockades and keeping watch at the construction site. The goal is to prevent the moving of construction equipment and the delivery of materials.

"We're going to do everything we possibly can," said Greg Grey Cloud of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. He attended a conference last week sponsored by the Oglala Sioux Tribe called "Help Save Mother Earth from the Keystone Pipeline." Tribes are considering setting up camps nearby to follow the construction. He stressed that any actions would be peaceful. "We're not going to damage anything or riot or anything like that," he said.

Like much of the country, however, tribal members are divided over the pipeline. In South Dakota, on one side are those who fear irreversible effects on the environment and public safety. On the other are those who want the money and jobs from the type of big development project that rarely comes along.

In Winner, S.D., where the population numbers fewer than 3,000, Mayor Jess Keesis is eager to welcome construction workers. If President Barack Obama approves the pipeline, a 600-member "man camp" would open just 10 miles from town.

"Out here on the prairie, you know, we're a tough people," said Keesis, who's also a member of the Potawatomi Nation. "We deal with drought and 8-foot blizzards and all kinds of stuff all the time, so anytime we can get something like this to give us a shot, it's a good thing."

Opponents say the risks are too great.

## Protecting Their "Sacred Water"

Two weeks ago, an alliance of Native American groups approved a statement saying that no pipeline would be allowed in South Dakota. The tribes say that they stand ready to protect their "sacred water" and other natural resources.

That includes Native women. Opponents of the pipeline say they would become easy prey for thousands of construction workers housed in work camps. According to the federal government, one of every three Indian women are either raped or sexually assaulted during their lifetimes. The majority of attacks are done by non-Native men.

Opponents said they don't want to have to follow through on their plans. They hope that they have sway with a president who just happens to be an adopted Indian. That would be Barack Black Eagle. The president was formally adopted by Hartford and Mary Black Eagle of Montana's Crow Indian Tribe in 2008, when he visited the tribal reservation.

Grey Cloud said Obama would be "going against his word" if he approves the pipeline: "His main promise was to not allow pollution in our area."

Keesis said the project carries risks but eventually would be a winner for the region. He said the city of Winner and the surrounding county would get a windfall of money. Roughly $900,000 a year would come from construction workers spending money in the town's restaurants, bars and movie theater.

After spending 20 years working in oilfields and oil towns, he's convinced that much has changed. Nowadays, he said construction workers are "under the gun to behave."

## Project Gets A Boost

Obama, who has not said when he'll make a final decision, is under heavy pressure to approve the project. Just last week, all 45 Republican senators sent a letter to the president, saying thousands of jobs are at stake. They reminded him that he had promised them to make a decision by the end of 2013.

Nationally, project backers got a boost from a State Department report on Jan. 31 that minimized the climate change effects of building the pipeline.

In South Dakota, the proposed line would not go through any of the state's nine reservations. But, opponents say it's close enough to still pose a risk.

The argument for building the pipeline is a hard sell in South Dakota, where history is still raw. It's the scene of some of the bloodiest battles between Indians and the federal government. In 1890, U.S. troops massacred nearly 300 Sioux at Wounded Knee Creek.

Spotted Eagle said she feels obliged to try to stop the pipeline. She wants to provide toxic-free land and water for her grandchildren and to protect women from attacks.

"This is a form of militarism, bringing in these man camps," said Spotted Eagle. She said it's a reminder of "when they put us in forts and they wanted our land."
