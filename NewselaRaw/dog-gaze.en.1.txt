Start petting a friendly dog and it may be hard to stop. Unlike other animals, like porcupines, dogs are a relatively hands-on species.

But research suggests that dogs aren't the only ones deriving happiness from this physical contact. Studies have found that positive interactions between people and dogs can be beneficial for both species. Indeed, there is an increase in endorphins in both dogs and people after enjoyable interactions, like petting, play and talking. These endorphins, specifically oxytocin and dopamine, are neurochemicals released by the brain. They are associated with positive feelings and bonding.

A new study indicates that locking a stare with a dog may be enough to trigger the rush of good-feeling endorphins. Dogs are incredibly attentive to human faces and, in some cases, even specific facial expressions. The act of gazing at your dog — or your dog gazing back at you — could actually hold a very important piece of the puzzle in understanding our relationship with dogs. The study was published this week in Science.

## The "Cuddle Hormone"

The new study, by Miho Nagasawa, of Azabu University in Japan, and her colleagues,  found that owners and dogs sharing a long mutual gaze had higher levels of oxytocin in their urine than owners of dogs giving a shorter gaze. Oxytocin is sometimes called the "cuddle hormone" and is an important part of social bonding. It is also key to the hormonal changes women experience leading up to and following birth. Nagasawa and her colleagues concluded that their finding was "a manifestation of attachment behavior." The researchers theorized that a gaze between a dog and human, particularly a human the dog knows, will be similar in certain ways to mother–infant relationships.

This new study investigates whether a dog's gazing behavior affected not just the owner's oxytocin concentrations but the dog's as well. In the first experiment, the researchers collected urine from 30 dog-and-owner pairs before and after they spent 30 minutes together. As in the earlier study, owners whose dogs showed the most gazing behavior had a notable increase in oxytocin concentration. But this time, the researchers also found a similar increase in the neurochemical in the dogs.

The story that emerges from this study will likely make dog lovers cheer: Mutual gazing between dogs and the people who care for them produces a very similar physiological reaction to what's observed between mothers and infants. This may help explain our intense and deep-seated relationship with dogs.

Reflecting on her findings, Nagasawa recommends that "dog owners not just say commands at their dogs, but to build up the relationship (and) consider the potentially beneficial role that mutual gaze can hold."

## Nurture Versus Nature

Nagasawa's findings feed into a larger discussion among researchers about the theory that there is a biological synchronization between dogs and humans — indicating a coevolution between the species. Nagasawa and colleagues also investigated whether the increased oxytocin levels they observed in dogs would appear when testing wolves in a similar way. They tested wolves that had been raised by humans. The wolves, however, rarely held a gaze with the humans for more than a few moments. This major difference led the researchers to assume that gazing "probably evolved during domestication" with humans. In other words, dogs learned to communicate with humans through eye contact because they are pets.

Testing evolutionary theories like coevolution can be tricky. While it can be exciting to test animals who have been socialized in different ways, there are many other factors to consider. Zsófia Virányi, a scientist at  the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna and a co-founder of the Wolf Science Center, reminds us to consider that some differences between species are due to evolutionary reasons, and others to how an animal was raised. It is an example of nurture versus nature, a common topic in evolutionary science.

In testing wolf behaviors, it is important to understand all of the factors in the studies. For example, in the gazing study, were the wolves exploring the new environment where the testing took place or trying to get out? If so, those factors could contribute to why they did not focus on the handler and were unable to hold a gaze. Virányi even wonders if other social exchanges between wolves and humans — besides staring —would show a positive attachment between wolves and humans.

## Bonding With Wolves?

Monique Udell, a professor at Oregon State University who has investigated human–wolf interactions, said: "We know that maternal–offspring attachment is important to this species and many other nondomesticated animals and that humans and wolves can show attachment bonds." Maybe we simply haven't discovered all the details of wolf oxytocin mechanisms yet.

While the study suggests that there is a deep biological relationship between dogs and humans, we shouldn't rule out wolves, or other species, just yet from sharing a similar hormonal connection. "I'm not convinced that this is something dog-specific," Virányi adds.
