WASHINGTON â€” On Monday, a group of scientists and inventors gathered at the White House to share their work with President Obama. They weren't from NASA, though. They were students from all over the county, ages 6 to 19. They were invited to the fifth annual White House Science Fair to show off their winning projects.

The fair featured 35 young scientists exhibiting 12 different projects. The inventions on display included implants to support the spine, carbon-dioxide powered batteries, and a tool for protecting computer information by identifying how someone types on a keyboard.

One device, built out of Legos, automatically flipped the pages of a book to help paralyzed or arthritic patients read despite their disabilities. As he watched a demonstration of the machine, Obama seemed impressed, and with good reason. The five inventors were just six years old.

"How did you figure this out?" Obama asked.

"We had a brainstorming session," one replied.

## More Money For STEM

In addition to giving young scientists a chance to show off their work, the White House Science Fair shines a spotlight on science, technology, engineering and math. Together, these subjects are known as STEM. Obama used the fair as an opportunity to encourage more students to study STEM subjects in school. He also announced more than $240 million in donations to boost study in STEM fields.

This year's fair focused, in particular, on increasing diversity in STEM. Historically, most of the people working in science and technology have been white men, so Monday's fair aimed to inspire girls and minorities to enter these fields as well.

One of the new pledges that Obama announced was $150 million to help scientists who are in the first stages of their careers to stay on track. Another was a $90 million campaign to expand STEM opportunities to youths who aren't as involved in STEM programs, such as minorities and girls.

Additionally, more than 100 colleges and universities have committed to training 20,000 new engineers, and a group of companies have promised to expand high-quality STEM education programs to an additional 1.5 million students this year.

Obama has been interested in supporting STEM education and careers for many years. In 2009, he launched "Educate to Innovate," an effort to encourage the study of science, technology, engineering and math.

## A Work-In-Progress

On Monday, he was impressed by all of the displays, but none seemed to delight him more than the Lego page-turning machine. He pointed out that the device might need a little adjustment, though. It was turning pages so quickly that a reader might only have time to read three sentences per page.

One of the device's inventors explained to the president that the machine was a prototype. A prototype is one of the first models of an invention. It is a work-in-progress.

"Have you ever had a brainstorming session yourself?" one little girl asked the president.

Indeed, yes, he replied.

"What did you come up with?"

"I mean, I came up with things like, you know, health care," he said, amused. In 2010, he signed a famous health care law called the Affordable Care Act. "It turned out OK, but it started off with some prototypes."

Obama said the fair is one of the most fun events held annually at the White House. "Every year I walk out smarter than when I walked in," he added.

## "What She's Been Doing"

A scientist who advises Obama named John Holdren joined the president at the fair. "Amazing," he said, as he examined the students' work. "These kids are so much more advanced than when I was in school."

At each of the 12 display stations, Obama quizzed the participants about their projects. At one, Anvita Gupta, a 17-year-old from Scottsdale, Arizona, described the special mathematical algorithm she had devised to identify new medical uses for medications that already exist.

Obama turned to the group of reporters and photographers trailing him.

"Just saying, I don't know what you all have been doing," he said. "This is what she's been doing."

Later on, Obama addressed students and scientists in the White House. "It's not enough for our country just to be proud of you," he said. "We've got to support you."
