In Roman times, many people believed Jupiter was the king of the gods who killed a race of giants to rule heaven and Earth. Now scientists have a theory about how our planet was formed that makes Jupiter the king of the planets in our solar system.

Jupiter, as the largest planet, helped form the solar system many millions of years ago. The force of its gravity pushed out the pieces left over when the sun and other planets formed. Some pieces may have landed on Earth, providing the water the planet needed to develop life. Jupiter is still surrounded by asteroids and sometimes sends one into Earth. It also might have had a role in the asteroids that fell on Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. The event let mammals grow and helped our human ancestors develop.

## The Oddball Solar System

Scientists now say that even Earth itself would not have existed without Jupiter's help. A study says Jupiter crashed through the solar system as it formed, clearing the way for Earth and other, smaller planets to come to be.

Scientists suspect that our solar system developed like most others in the universe, but that it used to have more and bigger planets. Other studies have found other solar systems are packed with planets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. Astronomers call them "super-earths," but those planets do not have an atmosphere like ours that can support human life. Their atmospheres are packed with hydrogen that humans cannot breathe.

Most solar systems in the universe have a lot of those planets, said Greg Laughlin. He is a scientist from the University of California in Santa Cruz and one of the authors of the study. Our solar system is looking like an oddball, he said.

There is no reason to think the planets in our solar system formed differently than other planets, said Konstantin Batygin. He is a scientist from the California Institute of Technology who also worked on the study. The explanation for our solar system's differences could be in how Jupiter controlled what happened after the planets formed, he said.

## When Planets Collide

Scientists used to think planets stayed the same after they formed and remained in the same place. They would form from the gas and dust spinning around young stars. Small, rocky planets would form close to the sun and large, cold planets with atmospheres made of gases, called gas giants, would form away from the sun. Scientists believed all planets stayed in the same orbit around the sun after they formed. That pretty much agreed with what we knew about the solar system, but it could be wrong.

Twenty years ago, scientists found the first planets around other stars and noticed some planets did not go around in even circles around their sun, like our solar system. Some planets would swing very close to their suns and then far away. Sometimes, they would get pulled away by other planets.

Ever since the discovery of other planets, scientists have studied their movements to understand how our solar system was formed. One theory says Jupiter moved from its place in the solar system to where Mars is today. As Jupiter moved, it caused a space demolition derby, smashing planets against each other.

Batygin and Laughlin studied how Jupiter's movement formed the solar system. The crashes among the large planets would have pushed smaller planets into the sun, which is why there are so few small planets between the sun and Earth.

## Crushed, Cooked And Other Grim Outcomes

As Jupiter returned to its place, the pieces left over from the broken planets would have come together to form Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. This explains the evidence that those planets formed later and why they have different atmospheres. It would also explain why Mars is so small, compared with its neighbors, because it was formed from pieces of a larger planet. It also explains why there would be very few planets like Earth in the universe, Laughlin said.

If this is true, the study would mean that most of those planets that scientists are watching for signs of life, cannot be inhabited by humans. Visiting them, you would be crushed, cooked and smothered by their atmospheres. Very few solar systems had a Jupiter that visited and let new worlds like Earth develop.

It may really be Saturn that we must thank for being here, because it pulled Jupiter back and kept it from settling close to the sun. That makes sense, because in Roman mythology, Saturn was Jupiter's father and the god responsible for Earth. Next time you look up at the sky, uncrushed and uncooked, send a knowing nod to Jupiter and Saturn.
