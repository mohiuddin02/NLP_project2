DALLAS — The Dallas Zoo has a great collection of snakes. Most of them are poisonous.

The zoo also has one of the best supplies of antivenom in the country. Antivenom is a cure for a snakebite. It is made from the venom of snakes. Venom is another word for poison.

## Zoo To The Rescue!

Not long ago, an African bush snake bit its owner. The snake was poisonous. The zoo came to the rescue. It sent antivenom to cure the man's snakebite.

Some people keep poisonous snakes as pets. A snakebite can make people very sick.

When treating a bite, doctors check the kind of snake. They see how harmful the poison might be. They choose the best antivenom.

Then they often call the Dallas Zoo.

The zoo sends its antivenom anywhere in the country.

The zoo keeps thousands of tubes of antivenom. They are worth about $200,000.

Antivenom is not cheap. Antivenom costs $200 a tube for snakes from Asia. It can cost $2,500 a tube for Australian snakes.

## Careful Handling Of Snakes

At the Dallas Zoo's reptile house, each cage has a sign that tells about the snake. Antivenom information is on it as well. The zoo has 90 different snakes. About 65 of them are poisonous, said Ruston Hartdegen. He is in charge of the reptile house. Snakes are reptiles.

The zoo workers learn how to handle poisonous snakes. Some get extra training. The extra training lets them work with really dangerous snakes.

In more than 100 years, only three zoo workers have been bitten. None of them got sick.

The zoo workers are big fans of the snakes. Bradley Lawrence likes the cobras and mambas. Matt Vaughan also works with the snakes. He says the pit viper is cool. The snake has pits under its eyes that can sense heat.

People should visit poisonous snakes at the zoo, they say. Deadly snakes should not be kept as pets.

## This Is How Antivenom Is Made

Workers milk a healthy snake about every two weeks.

A worker holds the snake. He gently presses the mouth so the fangs come out. The snake bites on a piece of glass. The venom runs down into a tube.

The venom is injected into an animal. Often a horse or goat is used. The animal makes special cells. These cells recognize a threat to the body and kill it.

These cells are made into antivenom.
