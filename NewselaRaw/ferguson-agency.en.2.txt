FERGUSON, Mo. — A little more than a day after a black teen named Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer last August, the peacemakers arrived.

They introduced themselves to police and city officials. Late that night, they met with Brown's family, in a police truck down the street from where he was killed. Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was killed in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis. The shooting set off demonstrations by members of the local black community, who felt that Brown wouldn't have been killed if he was white.

The peacemakers were with a little-known unit of the U.S. Department of Justice called the Community Relations Service. They are also called mediators, because they mediate, or help all sides reach an agreement. They were the first federal officials to arrive in Ferguson.

Since then, the mediators held dozens of meetings with police, residents and community leaders, nearly all of them in secret. They have run town hall meetings closed to everyone except residents.

## "God Bless Them"

The Justice Department won't provide basic information about the mediators or what they are doing in Ferguson.

And yet they are playing what may be the most important role in Ferguson. They are persuading worried residents, overwhelmed city officials, angry protesters and frustrated police to sit together and talk.

"God bless them," said Patricia Bynes, a leader in Ferguson.

Days after the shooting, the Justice Department launched an investigation. About a month later, following almost nightly protests and violence, the department said it would look into whether the police used too much force against black people in Ferguson. It also sent its community policing unit to examine police methods and offer training.

But the Community Relations Service has a different purpose. The 50-person, $12 million-a-year unit does not investigate.

## Allowing "People To Speak"

Its goal, said Director Grande H. Lum, isn't to make arrests or file lawsuits, but to give all sides a private place to talk. The hope is that they will solve their own problems.

"Those are the longest-lasting solutions — when the people themselves resolve their own disputes," Lum said. The unit, he said, allows "people to speak."

Lum said mediators are trained to identify the underlying cause of conflict, who is involved, and who needs to be included in the conversation.

"We are going to be there," Lum said, "as long as it is needed."

But Lum and his team will have to overcome the idea, among some, that they take sides.

The Community Relations Service calls itself the nation's peacemaker. The unit was created as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that outlawed unequal treatment based on race, color, sex, religion and where a person was from. Since then, it has responded to problems between the races and unrest in American cities.

## From Geneva, New York ...

In 2013, mediators visited the small town of Geneva, New York. An officer had shot a black man, and protesters gathered in front of the city police department.

Geneva Police Chief Jeffrey E. Trickler said that mediators helped create a community agreement. It included police training, increasing the number of non-white officers  and improving how the department handled complaints. "Anything we felt we needed, they were a phone call away," Trickler said. "From my eyes, things have improved."

In St. Louis, Adolphus Pruitt is president of the city's branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He said he can't list all the times he has called a police department with a problem. Sometimes they respond, but more often they don't, he said. Usually, they just try to protect their department and officers.

But when Justice Department mediators get involved, Pruitt said, the different groups are willing to talk.

"They don't like to talk to the press, and don't like to talk about what they do," said Rue Landau, who is with city of Philadelphia. That secrecy, Landau said, is in part why the agency is so effective.

## ... To Ferguson, Missouri

Two Sundays after Michael Brown's shooting, mediator Rita Valenciano called a morning meeting of nine community leaders. They talked for three hours. "No breakfast. No orange juice. No nothing. Just us in a room," said Patricia Washington, a county spokesman.

The conversation was tense, she said. Ferguson police and city officials were there, and some in the room didn't want to talk with them.

However, before that meeting, "nobody was talking," Washington said. Although some of the discussions are still difficult, at least they're happening, she said.

Moreover, mediators are giving practical help. They have provided training for those who want to protect protesters and want information.

The situation is far from over. Washington said she's been trying for weeks to get the angriest protesters to come to the meetings, without any success.

Still, she said, there's been progress. Now the protesters are calling her and four have promised to come to the next meeting.
