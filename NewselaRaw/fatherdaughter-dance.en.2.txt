Willie Bailey twirled his partner on the dance floor. Soul music played as the two dancers bopped back and forth. Tonight was special for Bailey because his dance partner was his 7-year-old daughter.

"I feel so happy," Bailey's daughter, Taniya, said after they stopped moving. "I feel pretty."

Father-daughter dances like these are very popular on Chicago's South Side. The parties celebrate how important fathers are in the lives of their young girls. The evening is also a fun reason to get dressed up.

"I wouldn't miss this for the world," said Bailey. "I love it because it gives us a chance to spend time together, just us."

## A Special Bond

Father-daughter dances can also promote the special bond between fathers and their daughters. Over the years, African-Americans have started to host dances to give dads the chance to show their daughters how much they care.

Haley Elementary Academy is organizing a dance of its own. School leaders will hold their first father-daughter dance later this year.

Many black kids don't grow up with both a mom and dad in their lives. They are being raised in single-parent homes. Still, these dances show that many fathers are still involved in the lives of their kids, and that they care.

The relationship a girl has with her father is important because it can affect the relationships she has with men as she grows up.

## Male Role Models

Kelly Fair has a mentoring organization called Polished Pebbles. The group connects young black girls with successful adult women who can offer advice about school and work. Fair said it is also important for the girls to realize how men affect their lives.

"There are men out here who are responsible, loving, trusting, caring and doing good things," said Fair. "We want our girls to see them."

Polished Pebbles also hosts a father-daughter dance in Chicago. Girls can bring their fathers, uncles, cousins or brothers to serve as male role models. Fair finds volunteer "dads" for girls who do not have another man to invite.

The event is light-hearted and fun. The men introduce themselves to the girls and play group games. They do not dance one-on-one. Instead, they line dance, play musical chairs and boogie down a soul train line.

At the father-daughter dance that Bailey and Taniya attended, about 70 men spent the afternoon with the special girls in their lives. Most men were there with their young daughters. Some men brought nieces, cousins and girls from their neighborhoods so they could party, too.

## "He Dances Weird"

Once the dance started, Joe Dunford, a dad, floated from side to side, bouncing his shoulders and nodding to the music. His daughter did her own dance moves in front of him. He reached out for her hands and pulled her arms into smooth movements, training her to dance.

"It's a little embarrassing, but it's fun," said Miranda, 8. "He dances weird. I like it though."

This was Dunford's first time at a father-daughter dance. It meant a lot to him to be there. He wants to teach Miranda from an early age what to expect from a man and how she should be treated.

Bailey and his daughter turned the dance into a special day. They had breakfast together and got dressed for the dance at his mother-in-law's house. They took photos in their outfits. Taniya wore a tan gown with a pearl necklace. Bailey wore his Sunday best with a cap and tan blazer.

"She loves to get dressed up and look pretty," Bailey said. "I love to do what makes her happy and keeps her smiling. Our bond is unbreakable."

After the dance, they went to Taniya's favorite restaurant, Red Lobster.
