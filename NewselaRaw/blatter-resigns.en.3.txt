Sepp Blatter's decision came just days after several other soccer officials were arrested. They were accused of taking money illegally.

It is not known what led Blatter to quit. However, an American law enforcement official said that Blatter is under investigation for wrongdoing. Blatter will remain president of FIFA until someone else is elected. FIFA stands for the French name, Fédération Internationale de Football Association. It is a sports league like the American NBA or the NFL, but its teams are in about 200 different countries. In most of the world, soccer is called football.

## Boss Says He Did Nothing Wrong

At FIFA's offices in Switzerland, Blatter said he did nothing wrong. He admitted he had lost the support of "the entire world of football." Blatter said he plans to make important reforms in FIFA while he is still president.

Blatter said that he would limit the number of years officials are allowed to hold office. He also said FIFA's powerful executive committee must be changed. The committee decides on the dates and locations of soccer tournaments.

"I cherish FIFA more than anything, and I want to do only what is best for FIFA and for football," said Blatter, 79. He has served as FIFA's president since 1998. Blatter said FIFA needs to be changed from top to bottom.

On May 27, the Swiss government arrested several FIFA officials, including two vice presidents. Hours later, the American government announced 47 criminal charges against officials at FIFA and sports companies. The government said FIFA officials took a bribe or money from countries competing to host the World Cup. They also took money from companies wanting to broadcast soccer tournaments. Investigators are talking with the arrested soccer officials. They are looking for information to find others involved in the wrongdoing.

Blatter has not been charged with a crime. The Justice Department thinks FIFA Secretary General Jérôme Valcke was involved in a $10 million secret deal in 2008. The money was paid by South African officials who wanted to host the 2010 World Cup.

South African officials have denied paying the bribe. Valcke has not been charged with a crime.

## Many Rumors Of Secret Deals

For many years, questions about secret deals have swirled around the soccer world. These questions usually were about FIFA's presidential elections and votes on World Cup sites. It is not known whether the 2022 World Cup will go on as planned in Qatar.

Blatter's announcement was welcomed by government officials, players and experts across Europe and the Americas. U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati called it "an opportunity for positive change within FIFA."

In Latin America, players and officials celebrated Blatter's announcement. They spoke of their hope that soccer would become honest and open.

Brazilian soccer legend and current lawmaker Romario de Souza Faria wrote on Facebook that Blatter's resignation was the "best news in ages." He said it "begins a new era for world football."

## Soccer Star Says "The Truth Is Out"

Diego Maradona is one of the most famous soccer players of all time. He told a radio station that "today the truth is out and I am enjoying it."

"They hate soccer," Maradona said of FIFA officials. Maradona said it is time to stop the bribes and secrets. "Enough lying to the people," Maradona said.

John Whittingdale is in charge of sports and culture for the English government. He said Blatter's resignation was the first step to changing FIFA.

In Germany, the news of Blatter's resignation was greeted with relief and even joy.

Hans Sarpei is a German-Ghanaian former professional soccer player. He tweeted, "I'll go to my office now and dance with joy."

"This is the absolutely right decision, and it is overdue," said Wolfgang Niersbach, the president of the German Football Association. He said Blatter should have quit earlier.
