SOCHI, Russia â€”The Sochi Olympics has found its new ice princess.

Fifteen-year-old Julia Lipnitskaia has caught everyone's attention. She is a figure skater from Russia who skates fast and artfully.

On Sunday, Lipnitskaia competed in the team ice skating event. The team event adds up the scores of one male skater, one female skater, one pairs team and one ice dancing team. Ten countries compete.

Russia has a history of winning pairs, ice dancing and men's skating. No Russian woman has ever won in singles.

Lipnitskaia just might change that.

## President Putin Leads Cheers

In the team event, Lipnitskaia skated after Evgeni Plushenko. He is a three-time Olympic medalist and 2006 champion from Russia. He had hurt his back last year. People love him for his soaring jumps, power and his charm.

When he finished skating, the audience went crazy. His fans threw flowers and stuffed animals to him. There were so many that it took 12 skaters to go around the ice to pick them up.

Lipnitskaia said she was nervous to follow Plushenko.

"I was a bit nervous skating after Evgeni because I didn't want to let the team down,'' she said. "He was very happy for me at the end and congratulated me in the kiss and cry (area). My main motivation today was not to let the team down."

Lipnitskaia didn't let her team down. She stepped onto the ice and landed 10 jumps. When the music stopped, the crowd stood up and roared with applause. The crowd included Russian President Vladimir Putin. The people whistled and chanted for her and for Russia.

She had helped Russia win its first gold medal of the Games. She also become the youngest person ever to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics.

Canada took home the silver medal. The United States took the bronze.

## Young Skater "Incredibly Composed"

Lipnitskaia won the highest women's score in the short and long program over the past three days. She is also a favorite to win a gold medal in next week's ladies singles event. In the singles event, she will skate without a team. Russia has a long history of winning pairs, ice dancing and men's skating. No Russian woman has ever won in singles.

She tried to explain how it felt to skate so well on the world's biggest stage.

"I don't know how to explain the feeling I had out there,'' she said. "I'm very happy to have helped win the first gold medal for Russia. I got nervous in the middle of the program, I'm not sure why, it's completely unlike me, so the jumps weren't great in the second half, I didn't feel totally comfortable. The jumps didn't feel like mine at that point. I wouldn't say I got tired, but some errors still crept in. But even with some flaws it was OK.''

Other ice skaters had a lot to say about the young winner.

"A young genius,'' said Russian ice dancer Ekaterina Bobrova.

"She was incredibly composed,'' said U.S. champion skater Ashley Wagner. "She's like a wise 40-year-old woman trapped within a 15-year-old's body.''

Fellow American Gracie Gold added: "She's only 15. She's completely unfazed. She's got no spine, but she's got iron in her bones."
