LOS ANGELES — Amy Fine was on a Delta flight from New York to Palm Beach, Florida. She laid her head on the tray table to take a nap.

The passenger in front of her wanted to relax with some knitting. She reclined her seat — smacking Fine's head and sparking an emotional explosion.

The resulting screaming match caused an unscheduled landing in Jacksonville, Florida. It was the third time in nine days that a flight was forced to land early because of passengers fighting over shrinking legroom.

Airlines have been packing more people onto planes to make more money. Travelers were already angry about security hassles and being charged for baggage and meals and other things that used to be free.

## "On Top Of My Knees"

Such moves have led airline profits to near-record levels. But have they pushed passengers to a breaking point?

Two other quarrels caused planes to land early last week. A United Airlines flight was grounded when a passenger installed a plastic device known as a Knee Defender. He wanted to prevent the flier in front from reclining.

Surveys show that uncomfortable seats and shrinking legroom have become the top gripes of travelers. Passengers hate them more than ticket prices and security lines.

Airlines have become more focused on making money, said frequent business traveler Alex Gerwer. "They don't realize you can't balance your budget on the back of passengers."

Gerwer is 6 feet 2 inches tall. He said he understands how cramped quarters could make some travelers fly off the handle.

"I can't control being this tall," he said. "Occasionally I will ask people not to recline. I will say, 'You can't go back any farther. You are on top of my knees.'"

## No Airline Apologies

The tighter seating arrangements are made worse by increasingly crowded flights.

The airline industry makes no apologies. Travelers who want more room can simply pay for roomier seats, said Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America. The group represents America's largest airlines.

"Planes are more full, a reflection of the fact that flying remains affordable," she said. "Fuller flights in turn help keep flying more affordable."

Not everyone sees value in less space on more crowded planes. Ira Goldman invented the Knee Defender because — at 6 feet, 3 inches tall — he needed a device to protect what little legroom he had.

"The airlines don't want to acknowledge there is a problem," Goldman said.

The crowding keeps many travelers on edge. In the latest incident, Fine erupted at the passenger in front of her. She cursed at the three flight attendants who tried to calm her, and demanded that the plane land immediately.

Airlines have also tried thinner seating materials to squeeze in more people.

## Paying More For Legroom

Sometimes airlines use the extra space to add roomier seats for first- and business-class passengers. Those passengers pay more for their seats.

But the trend has often meant less legroom for passengers who pay less.

Spirit Airlines — the industry leader for sardine-like cabins — stuffs 178 seats on an Airbus 320. By comparison, United puts 138 seats in the same aircraft.

Airlines have also started charging passengers for extra legroom.

JetBlue's Even More Space seats offer 5 to 6 inches of extra legroom for $10 to $65 more than the lowest-priced tickets. Spirit's Big Front Seat has 6 extra inches of legroom. It costs an extra $12 to $199 more.

Things are likely to get worse, said Jan Brueckner, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine.

He said he gets irritated when somebody leans the seat in front of him all the way back. "But I think people need to be more considerate in these tight cabins," he said.

## Unfriendly Skies?

But Seth Kaplan, of Airline Weekly, predicts that passengers will continue to fly on airlines with cramped seats. The reason is that the prices are so affordable.

Spirit Airlines, Kaplan noted, has the least legroom in the industry. It also makes the most money on each dollar passengers spend.

But the crowding can prove too much for some passengers, bargain or no bargain.

On Aug. 24, a traveler on a United flight from Newark to Denver found she couldn't lean back because the flier behind her had installed the Knee Defender. She threw a glass of water in the passenger's face and the flight was diverted to Chicago, where the two passengers were removed.

On Aug. 27, an American Airlines flight from Miami to Paris was sent to Boston after passenger Edmund Alexandre reportedly began fighting with another traveler in front of him over a reclining seat.

In a statement, government lawyers said Alexandre began to argue with another passenger. Their dispute escalated and Alexandre followed a crew member to the back of the plane and grabbed her arm.

At that point, federal air marshals on the plane identified themselves and placed Alexandre in handcuffs. He could face charges of disrupting a flight.
