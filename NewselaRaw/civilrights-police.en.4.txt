NASHVILLE, Tenn. â€” John Lewis was a civil rights leader. He worked to get equal rights for African-American people.

One day in 1960, Nashville police officers dragged Lewis out of a restaurant. They carried him to a police wagon. What was his crime? He sat at a whites-only lunch counter. At the time, African-Americans and white people could not sit together in restaurants.

Nashville has changed much since then. Its Police Department is teaching its student officers about the civil rights movement.

## Nashville Was First To Change Law

About 60 people are training to be Nashville police officers. They gathered recently in the Civil Rights Room. It is in Nashville's main library. They listened to stories about Lewis and other college students. They helped change the law. Nashville became the first Southern city where African-Americans and whites could sit together at restaurants.

On the walls of the library were the words, "If not us, then who? If not now, then when?" Lewis said this 55 years ago. He wanted the other students to stay strong and not give up.

## Building Trust Between Police, People

Today there are again problems between the African-American community and police. Many African-Americans feel that the police are not fair. Police leaders want people to trust them again. The Tennessee police has turned to the Nashville library for help. It has many books and papers about the civil rights movement.

The first police civil rights class at the library was in April. Teachers used pictures and video from that time. They also told the stories of people who lived then.

Micah Wright is one of the student officers. He said that people feel pain when they do not have rights. The pictures show that, he said.

## Civil Rights For Everyone

Chuck Wexler is the head of the Police Executive Research Forum. It is a group of police leaders.

Today's young officers were not alive during the civil rights movement, he said. Yet, many people know about it. Civil rights cannot be ignored. Wexler said that Nashville police are showing leadership.

Some of the famous civil rights leaders agree.

They said the program is important. It teaches officers to treat people just how the officers would want to be treated.
