For hundreds of years, humans have looked to the sky and wondered: Are we alone? Could there be life on other planets? As far we know, only Earth has living people, animals and plants.

So in 2009, NASA launched the Kepler mission. This is a spacecraft with a big telescope that can look at 150,000 stars at once. Kepler is searching for planets like Earth that could host life.

On April 18, NASA announced that it had some important news.

## Planets Like Earth, Orbiting A Star Like Our Sun

No, it did not discover any little green men or other alien life forms. But space scientists did find three planets in what they call a "habitable zone."

A habitable zone is an area in space where a planet could have water. Many planets are too hot or too cold to have liquid water. But water is very important for living creatures. The Kepler telescope spotted three planets that could have water. They are called Kepler-62e, 62f and 69c.

## "Like Walking Around On Earth On A Cloudy Day"

William Borucki is a scientist at NASA. He told CNN that these planets are "quite different to planets in our own solar system."

Experts believe that Kepler-62f is the most similar to Earth. It is about 40 percent bigger than our planet. Planet 62f might have rocky land and several seas. This sounds familiar, doesn't it?

Imagine standing on the surface of 62f. The sun on this planet would seem bigger than the sun from Earth. But sunlight would be dimmer on 62f. Borucki said it would be "like walking around on Earth on a cloudy day."

Kepler-62e is the second new planet. It is around 60 percent bigger than Earth. Both 62e and the third planet, Kepler-69c, are possibly "water worlds." This means they may have oceans that are thousands of miles deep. No one knows what sort of strange creatures may swim in these huge seas.

Scientists are excited by 69c. This world seems to orbit a star that is similar to our sun. Planet 69c is estimated to be 70 percent bigger than Earth.

## Searching For A Place Like Home

"The Kepler spacecraft has certainly turned out to be a rock star of science," said John Grunsfeld. He is space scientist at NASA. "The discovery of these rocky planets in the habitable zone brings us a bit closer to finding a place like home," he added.

The Kepler telescope finds new planets by watching lots of stars at once. The brightness of a star dims when an object passes in front of it. That object could be a planet

Scientists can figure out the size of the passing planet. They do this by studying data they get from Kepler. So far, Kepler has found 122 new planets.

These planets are interesting. They are also a very long way from home. Kepler-62e and 62f are around 1,200 light-years away. Kepler-69c is about 2,700 light-years from Earth.

A light-year is a measure of distance. It is not a measure of time. A light-year is the distance that light travels over one year. One light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles.

## Numbers Or Names?

These exciting new planets do not have very exciting names. That's because space discoveries are given a number first. Then they are given more interesting titles later.

If you make a new space discovery, you are usually allowed to name your find. People often name new planets after their friends, family or even themselves. Imagine having a planet named in your honor. That is one good reason to study space.

For now, Kepler-62e, 62f and 69c are known as numbers not names. But they may be very important in the future. These planets may even be the homes of our nearest living neighbors.
