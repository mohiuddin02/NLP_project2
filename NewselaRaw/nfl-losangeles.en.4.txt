LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” There is no National Football League (NFL) team in Los Angeles. But the city has been important for the football league. Many teams say they might move to Los Angeles. It is a threat. They do this to get new places to play at home. They want their cities to give them new stadiums.

The Indianapolis Colts did that in 2002. The team threatened to move to Los Angeles. It worked. The Colts got a new stadium. They now play in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The stadium cost $720 million. The team paid only $100 million. The city and Indiana paid the rest.

Stan Kroenke, the owner of the St. Louis Rams, is now looking at Los Angeles. He said he has plans to build a stadium near the city.

## The Threat Works

The NFL has 32 teams. Two of them, the Rams and the Oakland Raiders, used to play in Los Angeles. Both teams left the city after the 1994 season. Since then, more than half the league's teams have threatened to move to Los Angeles. Some were serious about it. Others were not.

Using Los Angeles as a threat works. In the last 20 years, 27 NFL stadiums have been built or fixed up. Cities and states helped pay for it.

The last time someone almost came to Los Angeles was in 1996.

Ken Behring owned the Seattle Seahawks back then. He wanted a new stadium. The team starting working out in Los Angeles for a week. The NFL said the Seahawks would have to pay money if they didn't return. Soon the team moved back to Seattle.

Behring still won. The Seahawks got a new stadium in Seattle.

## Time To Return For Real?

Kroenke's plan is different. It is the first time an NFL owner has had a plan for a place to play and the land to build it on.

Using the threat of moving to new city isn't new. Baseball teams threatened to move to the Tampa-St. Petersburg area in Florida for years. Then, the Rays arrived there in 1998. Moving to Seattle is used as a threat by basketball teams. Las Vegas is mentioned as a spot for a hockey team, for the same reason.

An NFL team has returned to every big city that has lost a team. Except Los Angeles.

Even without a team in Los Angeles, the country's second-largest city, football is America's most popular sport. It also makes the most money.
