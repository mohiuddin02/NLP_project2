CHICAGO — Walking high above Chicago, daredevil Nik Wallenda broke two world records on Sunday in a stunt that critics had said was too dangerous to perform without safety equipment. He's a seventh-generation member of the Flying Wallendas family, famous for their high-wire feats.

Wallenda, 35, walked on a tightrope suspended across the Chicago river — from the Marina City west tower to the Leo Burnett Building. Wallenda's high-wire walk, which took 6 minutes, 51 seconds and was done at a 19-degree slant, set the world record for steepest incline for tightrope walking between two buildings.

After making the first crossing, Wallenda took an elevator back down to the street and returned to Marina City for another tightrope walk. This time he was blindfolded as he crossed from the west tower to the east tower. This stunt, completed at more than 500 feet, was the highest blindfolded tightrope walk ever recorded.

"You guys watching think I'm crazy, but this is what I'm made for," Wallenda said after his first few steps on the first wire.

## TV's 10-Second Delay, Just In Case

Police estimated that more than 50,000 spectators lined the streets to watch the stunt, which Wallenda undertook without a harness or safety net.

Even high above the city, Wallenda repeatedly acknowledged the cheering crowds below during his first walk.

"Listen to that roar," he said, adding, "I love Chicago and Chicago definitely loves me."

While crossing above the Chicago River, Wallenda's average height was about 630 feet, about the same height as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. Wallenda walked into the wind as he crossed the river, but he played down the wind's impact.

"It's not bad, but it (the cable) is definitely moving," he said.

Wallenda's walks were shown live on the Discovery Channel, though the channel was using a 10-second delay and planned to cut away if he fell, producers said.

## Walking A 19-Degree Incline

If Wallenda did lose his balance or slip, he planned to grab onto the wire and hang on. He frequently practices slipping and then grabbing the cable at his training facilities in Sarasota, Florida.

The 35-year-old, who is married with three children, said he has the strength to hang there for up to 20 minutes while waiting to be rescued. His crew can reach him in about 90 seconds anywhere on the cable.

Weather-related delays while installing the high wire forced Wallenda to change his game plan.

On Sunday, the cable between Marina City and the Leo Burnett Building was at a 19-degree incline in order to make sure the cable had the proper tension, Wallenda said. He had planned and practiced to walk at a more moderate 15-degree incline.

Far below the tightrope, a large crowd gathered on the streets to watch the event.

## "It's A Little Windy"

Nikki and Rich Ross and their 7-year-old son Jake had set up stadium chairs at the intersection of State Street and Wacker Street.

The Rosses, of Tinley Park, Illinois, arrived at 4 p.m. and ate an early dinner of sub sandwiches as crowds started to gather around them.

The family had seen Wallenda cross the Grand Canyon on a tightrope on television, Rich Ross said, but the atmosphere in Chicago on Sunday was much more exciting.

"It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience to see this firsthand instead of on TV," he said. "It's incredible just to experience being down here."

Jake Ross said he looked forward to seeing Wallenda walk blindfolded and said he has practiced tightrope walking even though he is afraid of heights.

Rich Ross said he wasn't worried about a fall and hadn't thought about if he would cover his son's eyes.

"There are a lot of safety precautions in place. They have to have it completely safe before they let him walk," Ross said. "It is a little windy, though."
