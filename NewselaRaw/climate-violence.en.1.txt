Social observers have long suggested that extreme hot weather can unleash the beast in man, but no one has been able to confirm the heat hypothesis.

The theory that high temperatures fuel aggressive and violent behavior is only just beginning to be studied. Using examples ranging widely from road rage, ancient wars and Major League Baseball, scientists have taken early steps to quantify the potential influence of [climate warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) on human conflict.

Three researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have pulled together data from these and other studies. They concluded that outbreaks of war and civil unrest may increase as much as 56 percent by 2050 because of higher temperatures and extreme rainfall patterns predicted by climate change scientists.

Likewise, episodes of personal violence — murder, assault, rape, domestic abuse — could increase as much as 16 percent. Their study was published on Aug. 1 by the journal _Science_.

## From Trivial To Sublime

"We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict ... across all major regions of the world," the researchers concluded.

The study assumes a global temperature increase of at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit over the next half-century. The assumption is based on data from the World Climate Research Program in Geneva. It also assumes that humanity will do little to adapt to large changes in regional climate or altered rain patterns.

The team examined 60 papers. The papers covered a variety of fields, including climatology, archaeology, economics, political science and psychology.

Study topics ranged from the trivial to the sublime.

Researchers in one case held up traffic at a sweltering Phoenix intersection. They wanted  to see whether motorists in cars without air conditioning were more likely to honk in anger than drivers in climate-controlled vehicles.

Psychologists in another wanted to see whether Major League Baseball pitchers were more likely to throw balls at opposing batters when it was hotter.

Another group used data from tree rings in Southeast Asia to see how severe drought influenced the collapse of the Angkor kingdom.

## Link Between Heat And Conflict

No matter where in the world they looked, and no matter when, the researchers said they observed a link between temperature, precipitation and conflict. They calculated that large-scale group conflict could increase 28 to 56 percent over the next 37 years. Personal violence could increase 8 to 16 percent.

"The result is alarming," said study co-author Marshall Burke, a UC Berkeley graduate student. He specializes in how climate change affects food supplies. "However, if we get our act together and we mitigate future climate change ... the effects will be much smaller."

The authors say they can only speculate on the reasons why increased temperatures and changed patterns of rainfall would move humans to violence.

"The physiological mechanism linking temperature to aggression remains unknown," they wrote. One traditional explanation is that climate shifts hit farming communities particularly hard. "People are more likely to take up arms when the economy deteriorates," study leader Solomon Hsiang said.

Hsiang and the other researchers make no attempt to establish a clear cause, though they say there might be a physiological link between heat and aggression. But they are not biologists; their intent, they say, is to spur further research and encourage adaptive planning in the face of global warming.

"We like to compare it to smoking," Burke said. "In the 1930s scientists were figuring out there was this really strong relationship between smoking and lung cancer." But it took decades to figure out precisely what linked smoking to cancer.

## "Presents A Strong Case"

Researchers who were not involved in the study were impressed by the team's work.

The paper "presents a strong case for the effects of rapid climate change on violence," said Craig A. Anderson, an Iowa State University psychology professor who studies violence. "There is considerable evidence that when people are uncomfortably hot, they become more physically aggressive."

Yet others said the paper fell short of its intended goal.

"The study does not give a single example of a real conflict" where all the evidence suggests the violence was partly due to a change in climate,  said Halvard Buhaug, a professor of political science in Norway.

An editorial by _Science _Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt ran in the same issue of the journal. The geophysicist called on scientists from different fields to help study how the added effects of climate change affect the earth.

"There is a need for all scientists to rise to this challenge," she wrote.
