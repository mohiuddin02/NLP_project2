CROW AGENCY, Mont. — The Crow Tribe and the Lummi Nation live nearly a thousand miles apart, yet they are locked in a bitter conflict.

At 2.2 million acres, the Crow reservation is one of the largest in the country. It is also rich with coal, which is used to produce electricity. Recently, the Crow signed an agreement to mine 1.4 billion tons of coal from their land.

The Crow hope to sell their coal to Asia. To get it there, they plan to transport the coal by rail to the coast of Washington state. Trains would unload the Crow coal at a new shipping hub that would be built in a deep-water port just north of the Lummi reservation.

The Lummi, who occupy a 13,000-acre peninsula north of Seattle, say that the proposed terminal location is home to their historic burial grounds. They say it threatens a fragile fishery that the Lummi and others have depended on for thousands of years. Now the Lummi are leading dozens of other tribes in a campaign to block the project.

## Which Is Most Important: Water Or Coal?

"Everyone says it's Lummi against Crow," Johnny Felix, a member of the Lummi tribal council and a commercial fisherman, said as he watched his son and others practice for wooden canoe races against other coastal tribes this summer. "It's not. It's not a tribe against a tribe. It's a resource against a resource. That's our resource — out there in the water. And their resource is coal."

In this case, the Crow's resource is an especially controversial one. President Obama's Clean Power Plan will put strict new limits on power plants that burn coal. It claims coal-burning plants give off hazardous pollutants and greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.

The Crow's potential trading partners in Asia do not have to follow American laws, but pressure is increasing worldwide to reduce the use of coal. It is unclear how much longer Asia will be interested in buying coal from the Crow.

For the Crow, the mining project is a matter of survival. There are no hotels on the reservation, its modest casino provides very little revenue and the tribe's unemployment rate is well into the double digits. Tribal leaders say the new mine could provide high-paying jobs for decades to come.

## Mine Would Benefit Entire Tribe, Not Just Workers

Even those who do not work for the mine would see a financial benefit from the project. Each of the more than 13,000 members of the tribe would receive an annual payment of up to $5,000.

But the Lummi say they are fighting for survival, too - and they hold a potential trump card in the fight. They were one of several tribes in the Salish Sea region to sign the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott with the United States. It guarantees the Lummi will always have access to their "usual and accustomed" fishing areas.

Earlier this year, the Lummi used those treaty rights to try to stop the mining project plans, infuriating Crow leaders.

Crow chairman Darrin Old Coyote accuses the Lummi of being influenced by environmental groups from Seattle. He says that he has visited the Lummi several times and even went fishing with Felix, but the Lummi still refuse his invitations to come to Montana.

## Urging Compromise In Energy Production, Use

"They don't want to understand where we're coming from," Old Coyote said. "These ... (environmental groups) are going out there saying all these horrible things are going to happen and at the same time those people … are going home and plugging in their cars and their iPads and their iPhones and still depending on electricity."

Old Coyote has had some political support from Montana Senators Steve Daines, a Republican, and Jon Tester, a Democrat, who have proposed the renewal of a special Indian mining tax credit that expired in December. In April, Daines hosted a field hearing at Little Bighorn College on the importance of coal to the Crow and Montana economies.

## Only Two Tribes Support Mining Plan

During the hearing, pre-selected speakers spoke in favor of mining, but only two were elected leaders of a tribe: Old Coyote and Lorenzo Bates, the council speaker for the Navajo Nation in Arizona. The Navajo have long depended on coal mining, but production there has also declined.

"When we go to D.C., coal's a bad four-letter word," Old Coyote said in an interview. "But if there's a blackout in the U.S. every so often because they say we want to rely on renewable energy, they're going to be saying bad four-letter words to try to get that power back on."

Old Coyote pointed out all the work the Crow have done to restore land at an existing mine called Absaloka and pledged to do the same at the new mine. "We're the ones who are going to live here, to stay here," he said.

## Past Decisions Don't Apply To Today's Situation

The Lummi, who have gained economic strength in recent years thanks to an expanded casino and hotel, say the same. They did not put up this kind of resistance decades ago when two other terminals were built in their area to serve oil refineries.

"That's what I've never understood," Felix said. "Why did our leaders in the past let that happen? But now is a different time and I'm saying no — no to everything."
