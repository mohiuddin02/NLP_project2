Americans these days are drinking much less milk then they used to. Now, the dairy industry is fighting back. It has launched a new $500 million campaign, which includes products such as milk cartons that don't need to be refrigerated until they are opened.

In 2013, about 6 billion gallons of milk were sold in the United States, which is the smallest amount of milk purchased since 1982. Milk sold for other purposes, such as making cheese, was not included in those sales figures.

According to the dairy industry, three things are behind the steady decline in milk sales: changing consumer habits, more drink choices and a lack of new dairy products.

Americans still consume about as many gallons of beverages as they did in the past — however, they are drinking much less milk.

## New And Improved Milk Products

Tom Gallagher is chief executive of Dairy Management, a national organization that promotes dairy products. Milk sales have fallen so low, he says, it may be impossible to curb the decline if the new campaign fails.

"The numbers are devastating," Gallagher said. At some point, he added, milk could become a drink choice the average consumer will not even consider.

The new campaign stems from an alliance between Dairy Management and seven business partners. Among those partners is Dairy Farmers of America, a cooperative that represents thousands of farmers nationwide.

Monica Massey is a Dairy Farmers of America senior vice president. According to her, it is essential for the dairy industry to develop new products, such as flavored milk and dairy-based sports drinks.

"We need to understand consumer trends. We can't just put a gallon of milk on a shelf and hope someone buys it," Massey said.

## Packaging Appeal

To appeal to children, milk has been sold in small packages that look like a cow's head. There has also been more emphasis on packaging that allows milk to be kept unrefrigerated on a store shelf, much like a juice box.

Consumers want more "grab and go" options in drinks, Massey said.

"We are still a country where people want to buy milk refrigerated," Gallagher said. Nonetheless, businesses can save money if milk can be moved on non-refrigerated trucks or stored without having to be kept cold.

Past advertising campaigns, such as the one featuring the "Got Milk?" slogan, did not slow the decline in sales.

The problem was the dairy industry lacked the products and packaging needed to attract consumers, Gallagher said.

"It would be like Coca-Cola doing great advertising but not having a product that matched it," he said.

Another problem is that cold cereal sales — and thus the amount of the milk poured on cereal — have been declining as well.

Sometimes new uses for even small amounts of milk can make a big difference. Quaker Oats, for example, has changed its oatmeal cooking recipe to include milk instead of water. The change could lead to millions more gallons of milk being sold.
