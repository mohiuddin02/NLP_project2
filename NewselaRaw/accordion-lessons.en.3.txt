LOS ANGELES —Back in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, it was common for young people to learn the accordion. Salesmen sold accordions door-to-door. Dozens of schools taught the instrument.

Accordion students from all over the country came to LA once a year for a contest.

One boy's life was changed when a salesman knocked on his door almost 50 years ago. Alfred Matthew Yankovic's parents bought him an accordion and lessons when he was 7 years old.

Later, "Weird Al" Yankovic would use an accordion to record his first song. That song started a career that has lasted more than 30 years and earned him three Grammy Awards.

Even as a popular accordion-playing musician, Yankovic knew his instrument wasn't "cool."

## Pushing And Pulling Air

"The accordion got a reputation of being kind of unhip," Yankovic said with a laugh.

But now things are changing. The accordion has a new reputation: it's becoming cool.

Popular musicians and bands such as Tom Waits, Gogol Bordello and Mumford &amp; Sons have used the accordion. The 2001 French film "Amelie" featured the accordion in its soundtrack.

Also, young people nowadays are finding "weird" things, and making them cool again.

Yankovic said he noticed the accordion getting more popular about 10 years ago. He joked that he probably had something to do with it.

But for some people, the accordion was always cool.

Latino musicians like Faco Jimenez and Ramon Ayala are masters of the button accordion. In this world, the accordion was never a joke, it has always been respected as a serious instrument.

Button accordionist Otoño Luján never thought of the instrument as weird or embarrassing.

In Latino culture, it doesn't have the same kind of reputation of being nerdy, said Luján, who teaches button accordion lessons and plays one in a band.

"It's a very simple music," he said. "But it's got a soul to it that really pulled me in."

Although he's trained on the button style, Luján loves all accordions. "There's all these different flavors," he said. But one thing they all have in common is how they create sound and tone by pushing and pulling air in and out of the instrument. He compared it to human speech.

## "People Just Love The Tone"

On a street in Los Angeles, surrounded by bars and restaurants, a small red-and-white neon sign reads: "DAVE'S ACCORDION SCHOOL."

Inside, black and tan cases cover the floor, and two shelves hold a selection of accordions and other instruments for sale.

Pictures of Weird Al Yankovic and Irish band the Pogues hang on the wall.

Owner Dave Caballero, 68, sat on a piano bench examining the inside of a brown accordion.

Down a narrow hallway, his wife, Veronika, was finishing a lesson with 92-year-old Emily Gaughenbaugh.

Gaughenbaugh, who is active and energetic, said she took up the instrument a couple of months ago, partly because it's better than doing crossword puzzles.

She waited for her 66-year-old daughter to finish her guitar lesson in another room. She listened as  a man with graying hair played a French song on an accordion.

Soon a young women with a pixie haircut and a young Russian boy showed up for their lessons.

"Accordion is coming back," Gaughenbaugh said, smiling. "For a while it was kind of a joke."

Caballero opened his shop in 1971. He has always thought of the accordion as cool, but many students say they were inspired by certain musicians or by "Amelie".

Some students like the accordion because it's easy to carry around. Others are fascinated by it, but they aren't sure why.

"I think it's just the general curiosity," he said. "People just love the tone of the accordion."

Even with three helpers, it's difficult for Dave to repair all the accordions people send him. Some come from as far away as Tahiti and Hawaii.

"We can never catch up," Caballero said. His shop is full of accordions all the time.
