ST. PETERSBURG, Russia — U.S. President Barack Obama said the world's credibility "is on the line" when it comes to punishing Syrian President Bashar Assad for his regime's alleged use of chemical weapons.

Speaking at a press conference Wednesday in Stockholm, Sweden, Obama said the "red line" he set a year ago against Syria's use of chemical weapons isn't his, but an international standard. Assad must be punished for that standard to mean anything, he said.

"I didn't set a red line; the world set a red line," Obama said. "My credibility's not on the line. The international community's credibility is on the line. And America and Congress's credibility's on the line."

From Sweden, Obama heads to a global economic meeting in Russia. He will seek to rally support for a U.S. military strike against Syria at the meeting. U.S. officials have said evidence shows that Assad's forces used poison gas during an attack last month near Damascus.

## Sweden Wants U.N. Involvement

It will not be easy for Obama to get the world leaders at the meeting to agree. At the press conference, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt came out against the use of chemical weapons and said he understood Obama's predicament. But he also said Sweden wants United Nations involvement and a political resolution to the carnage in Syria. A civil war has raged in the Middle Eastern country for two years.

"I understand the problem of not having a reaction to abuse of chemical weapons and what kind of signal that sends to the world," Reinfeldt said. "But this small country will always say 'Let's put our hope into the United Nations, let us push on some more to get a better situation.'"

Obama staunchly defended his push for a strike, evoking the death of children from exposure to poison gas.

"The moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing," Obama said. "I do have to ask people if in fact you're outraged by the slaughter of innocent people, what are you doing about it?"

Obama has chosen to act before a U.N. investigation is completed. But he said U.S. intelligence shows there's no doubt that chemical weapons were used by the regime.

"Keep in mind I'm somebody who opposed the war in Iraq, and I'm not interested in repeating mistakes about basing decisions on faulty intelligence," Obama said.

## Russia Warns U.S. Against Strikes

The press conference came hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview with The Associated Press warned the U.S. against military strikes in Syria. He said that without the approval of the United Nations, any assault would be "inadmissible and can only be interpreted as an aggression."

Putin said the Russian government has provided some pieces of the S-300 air defense missile system to Syria, but has suspended shipments "for now."

Russia has routinely vetoed sanctions against Syria in the United Nations, but Putin did not rule out supporting a U.N. resolution to support military strikes. But there must be proof that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons, he said.

He made clear his threshold for such support is high, calling it "absolutely absurd" that the government would use chemical weapons at a time when it was closing in on the rebels.

In the interview, Putin insisted he and Obama could have constructive talks — even though he said he was disappointed Obama canceled a meeting with him in Moscow.

## Frosty Relations Between Obama And Putin

A White House official said that although there was no plan for a formal meeting with Putin at the summit in St. Petersburg, the White House "would expect the two presidents to have an opportunity to speak" outside the meetings at the summit.

Obama will hold formal meetings with President Xi of China, Prime Minister Abe of Japan and President Francois Hollande of France.

Putin downplayed his frosty relationship Obama, which Russia analysts have said is among the worst in U.S.-Russian and U.S.-Soviet leader relationships.

"President Obama hasn't been elected by the American people in order to be pleasant to Russia," Putin told the AP. "And your humble servant hasn't been elected by the people of Russia to be pleasant to someone either."

Putin added, "We work, we argue about some issues. We are human. Sometimes one of us gets vexed. But I would like to repeat once again that global mutual interests form a good basis for finding a joint solution to our problems."
