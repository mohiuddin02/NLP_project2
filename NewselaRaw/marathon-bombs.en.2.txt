A pair of bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, killing three people and wounding nearly 200. The deadly attack stirred familiar fears that terrorism can strike the U.S. homeland.

The explosions took place in a crowd of people who were cheering for the runners. The first blast was followed by a second 12 seconds later and one block away. The devices sprayed pellets and nails. The victims' injuries included wounded legs, blown eardrums and heavy bleeding.

Emergency workers rushed to assist the wounded. Police, firefighters, marathon officials and regular people worked together to pull down fencing so they could reach the injured. The wounded were rushed to nearby hospitals. Boston is home to several of the world's best medical facilities and doctors were able to save many lives.

One of the victims who perished was 8-year-old Martin Richard, who had been watching his father race in the marathon. The other victims killed were a 29-year-old woman and a female student from China. Boston hospitals reported that some of the wounded suffered terrible leg injuries. More than 180 were wounded.

## Asking For Photos And Videos With Clues

The FBI vowed to find whoever was responsible. FBI agent-in-charge Rick DesLauriers told reporters that investigators would "go to the end of the Earth" to find the attacker or attackers. DesLauriers asked for the public's help in sending in their photos and videos of the marathon in case they could provide clues.

On Tuesday, President Barack Obama called the attack a terrorist act. "Anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror," he said.

American civilians have not been victims of terror on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. The New York Times noted that terrorism in the United States is down since the 1970s. The past decade has been especially safe because Sept. 11 led to stricter security and laws.

## Keeping Life Normal

Officials promised they would not let the bombings disrupt normal life. "We want people to come and go. We want you to live your life," said Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis. But he warned that people must remain alert.

Boston is in Massachusetts. The state's governor, Deval Patrick, said the attack would not stop Boston from enjoying its sporting tradition. "Next year's marathon will be bigger and better," he promised.

Obama praised the runners for their courage. He noted that many kept running all the way to the hospital to give blood. He also praised police, firefighters, doctors and priests who did anything they could to help.

"What the world saw yesterday in the aftermath of the explosion were stories of heroism and kindness, generosity and love," Obama said.

The president will go to Boston on Thursday. He will attend a ceremony in honor of the victims.

The timing of the attack was cruel. "Marathon Monday" is a special day for the city. Boston invites the whole world to the marathon. Runners from nearly 100 countries compete.

The 26.2-mile race takes place on a Massachusetts state holiday called Patriots Day. The state celebrates its history as the birthplace of the American Revolution. Schools and offices close for the day so that many local residents take the time off to watch the race.

After the tragedy, the Boston Bruins canceled a hockey game scheduled for Monday. The Boston Celtics called off a basketball game on Tuesday.

"Even a day later, the notion of playing a basketball game didn't feel right to us," said Celtics President Rich Gotham. "Some things are bigger than basketball."

Meanwhile, The Boston Globe reported that several Boston art museums will open their doors for free. They hope to provide some peace and comfort to the stunned and heartbroken people of Boston.
