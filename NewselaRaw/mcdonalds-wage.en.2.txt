CHICAGO — Facing protests from workers for higher wages, criticism of its healthiness and slow sales, McDonald's is making changes. Some workers will get a $1 per hour raise, starting in July. The company also announced plans to give employees paid time off and to expand educational programs for employees.

Still, many of these changes will only apply to a fraction of the 750,000 McDonald's workers around the country. Most of these employees don't work directly for McDonald's. Restaurants are franchised — independently owned and operated. Each owner can make his or her own decisions about wages and other issues.

The $1 pay increase will apply to about 90,000 employees, who worked at locations that are owned by McDonald's.

## Company Wants To Reinvent Itself

After months of slow sales, McDonald's is trying to turn things around. It must reinvent itself as "a modern, progressive burger company," said Steve Easterbrook, the company's new CEO.

McDonald's and other giant fast-food companies are trying to deal with a nationwide protest movement called "Fight for $15." Fast-food workers are organizing and protesting outside restaurants. They are calling for a "living wage," estimated at $15 per hour.

Many of these workers said Wednesday that they would continue to pressure McDonald's on the pay issue, calling the $1 bump insufficient.

Still, the wage increase could help improve McDonald's reputation, said Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's business school. Happy employees are a key component of the company's turnaround efforts, he said.

"One of the most important insights about brands is that if your employees aren't excited about the brand, it is difficult to get them to deliver great service," Calkins said. "A lot of this is about the employees and getting them to feel better about working at McDonald's."

## Competitors Won't Want To Lag Behind

Calkins expects that other fast-food chains will follow McDonald's example.

"Companies don't want to seem like they're lagging behind when it comes to high-profile issues like this," he said.

Competitor Wendy's said it regularly reviews wages and benefits for employees at company-owned restaurants to remain competitive. At Wendy's, like McDonald's, the vast majority of restaurants are run by franchisees. Burger King declined to comment about its wages and benefits.

The federal minimum wage is $7.25, but state and local minimums can be higher. The average hourly wage across company-owned McDonald's U.S. restaurants is currently $9.01 an hour. It will go up to $9.90 with the change announced Wednesday, said Karen King, the company's chief people officer.

McDonald's projected that by the end of 2016, the average wage rate for employees at its company-owned locations would be higher than $10 an hour.

The company also announced plans to give paid personal time off to employees who have been with McDonald's for at least a year. If workers choose not to take their earned paid leave, they will receive a check for the value of that time.

"We understand that life balance is important and believe that this will make a difference for our people," Easterbrook wrote.

It's not clear if franchisees would follow McDonald's lead on pay and paid time off.

## Many Workers Say Raise Isn't Enough

The third part of the new plan is offering employees at all restaurants educational opportunities. McDonald's said it would help employees pay to finish their high school diploma or take certain college courses. It also is expanding access to its free English classes.

For many fast-food workers who have been demonstrating for better conditions and higher wages, the $1 raise is not enough. It's still not a living wage, they say.

Kendall Fells, organizing director of the Fight for 15 campaign, said McDonald's is raising wages in response to protests and strikes. These won't stop "until workers get what they've been fighting for," he said.

## Forcing Small Changes

Workers protested in front of McDonald's stores across the nation on April 2. Nationwide protests are also scheduled for April 15.

Fells said workers have been acting like a union and forcing McDonald's to make changes. Still he said, the changes have been tiny.

The next step, he said, is for employees as a group to talk directly with McDonald's over wages, benefits and working conditions.

"McDonald's was forced to pay up, but it's not nearly enough," said Mary Kay Henry, international president of the Service Employees International Union. The SEIU is a major supporter of the Fight for 15 campaign.

## "Fighting For A Living Wage"

Nancy Salgado is a McDonald's worker at a franchised restaurant in Chicago. Salgado said McDonald's new policies are one victory for the Fight for 15 movement, but it will not affect her or thousands of others who work for franchisees.

"It's just a slap in the face," said Salgado, who often protests with Fight for 15.

Salgado said she makes $8.35 per hour and will get a bump to $10 in July under the city's new minimum.

"It's still not enough," Salgado said. "We are fighting for a living wage."
