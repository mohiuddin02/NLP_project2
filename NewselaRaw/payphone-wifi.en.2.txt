NEW YORK, N.Y. — A 9-foot-tall, narrow structure was installed recently on a Manhattan sidewalk. It is part of a plan to turn payphones into what is being billed as the world's biggest and fastest city Wi-Fi network.

The first of at least 7,500 planned hot spots are due to go online early this year. They promise super fast and free Wi-Fi service. They will also have street phones with free calling, ports to charge personal phones, and will bring in extra money for the city through advertising.

## Hot Spot Undercover

Other cities are also making new pushes for public Wi-Fi after earlier attempts failed. New York officials say their project is making data available to everybody, or democratizing data access. They say the plan will also modernize old street phones.

For now, the first hot spot is still being tested and sits under a gray cover. Some passers-by are curious and like the sound of what is in store.

"It's always helpful" to have Wi-Fi to reduce the bite that apps and Web-surfing take out of a user's cellular data plan, Jack Thomas said while texting near the nonworking hot spot. Many consumers' plans also limit the amount of data they can use.

Others, however, are worried about New Yorkers using their devices on a public network. The city has said data will be coded to keep it safe and any information gathered for advertising will hide the names of the users.

"I think it makes us all more vulnerable to wrongdoers," Bee Mosca said as she eyed the future hot spot.

## Old Payphones To Get 21st Century Makeover

Payphones might seem old fashioned. After all, more than two-thirds of Americans own smartphones, according to the Pew Research Center on Internet, Science & Technology. About 8,200 payphones still dot New York streets.

Some were put into service during outages after Superstorm Sandy in 2012, but their numbers have declined overall and few people use them. In addition, more than one-third of the New York payphones inspected last year did not even work.

The city experimented with providing Wi-Fi from a few payphones in 2012. Afterward, it came up with the current "LinkNYC" plan.

## Wi-Fi Kiosks Could Be Big Moneymakers

A group of companies, including wireless technology company Qualcomm, will pay the estimated $200 million it will cost to build the network. In return, the group will get half the money from the kiosks' digital advertising, projected at $1 billion over 12 years. The city gets the other half. It will more than double the $17 million a year New York currently earns from payphones.

Each hot spot covers about a 150-foot radius. The service is supposed to be some 20 times the speed of average home Internet service. Officials have said the service is intended for outdoor use. It is not clear whether it might extend inside some businesses and homes.

Many Americans now get Internet service from their cellphones. Still, the New York network can help users who can save on their cellphone plans, said Erik Stallman, a lawyer with the Center for Democracy and Technology, a group that supports people's Internet rights. It can also help cellular networks that run slowly when they are used too much, Stallman said.

Tourists without local cell service also could benefit, said John Breyault. He works at a group that supports consumer rights.

## Cities Give Public Wi-Fi Another Go

LinkNYC is not without opponents. A payphone company has sued the city, saying it created a business where only the new group can offer the Wi-Fi service. The city has said it believes the arrangement is legal.

Many U.S. cities tried to install public Wi-Fi in the early 2000s. A number of the plans stalled as more homes got Internet access. Money made through advertising was also lower than expected and people did not use the networks are much as was expected. Some Internet service providers also complained the city networks were unfair competitors to the services they were selling.

But some cities are trying again. Boston is working to expand a Wi-Fi network with more than 170 hot spots and Los Angeles is encouraging companies to provide free basic wireless to all homes and businesses, with outdoor coverage as a goal.
