In January 1964, President Lyndon Johnson declared "all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States." Millions of Americans have been helped by The War on Poverty since then. But many of the states that were among the poorest decades ago remain so today.

The average poverty rate among the states was 24 percent in 1959. But some were in much worse shape than others: Mississippi's rate, for example, was 55 percent then. The rate in Arkansas was 48 percent. In South Carolina it was 45 percent.

Fifteen states had official poverty rates of 30 percent or higher in 1960, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which surveys the U.S. population every 10 years. That year the official federal poverty level was an annual household income of $2,973 for a family of four. That is like $23,800 today. The poverty level is the minimum amount of money that people need to live on.

By 2012, the average poverty rate had plummeted to 14 percent.  The current poverty line is a household income of less than $23,492 for a family of four.

## Same States Stay Poor

But a Stateline study found that some states are still much worse off. Many are the same problem states from 1959. Mississippi still has the nation's highest poverty rate, at 22 percent. Arkansas also remains above average at 20 percent.

Other states, such as New Mexico and Louisiana, had above-average poverty rates in 1959 but have fallen further behind in the years since. In 2012, New Mexico and Louisiana had the second- and third-highest poverty rates.

Experts say that in some regions, the same causes of poverty decades ago are still around today. Among them are a less-educated workforce and lower rates of health care. They also have low levels of being involved in anti-poverty programs, and long distances to major cities and metropolitan areas with plentiful jobs.

"You have these persistently poor regions," said James P. Ziliak. He runs the Center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky. "There has been some catch-up over the decades," Ziliak said. "It just hasn't been enough."

Some states that were better off in 1959 remain so today. Connecticut's poverty rate in 1959 was 9.6 percent. It was the only state below 10 percent. In 2012, its rate was 10.3 percent â€” no longer the lowest in the nation (New Hampshire, at 8 percent, was), but among the lowest. Others have seen vast improvement: Minnesota's 1959 rate was 19 percent, today it's 10 percent.

Stateline looked at poverty numbers from the 1960, 1970 and 1980 Census surveys. It then looked at state-by-state poverty levels from 1980 to 2012 from a government survey.

## A Fuller Picture Painted

The Census Bureau's official poverty rate is based solely on income. It doesn't include the cost of living. That cost differs significantly from state to state. Nor does it include the effect that tax benefits and safety-net programs can have on a household's bottom line. Some of those programs came from the War on Poverty.

A supplemental measure the Census began using recently paints a fuller picture. It includes the cost of living. It also looks at how much government help is available. Nationally, this measure shows a similar poverty rate. But some states with low official rates have a higher rate under the supplemental measure. California has a high cost of living. By the supplemental measure it is worst in terms of poverty at 24 percent. That figure is more than 7 percentage points higher than its official rate.

Even with this adjustment, some of the same states that had elevated levels of poverty in 1959 are still poor. The two measures together paint a complicated picture of the effects of the War on Poverty.

A study of Census numbers from the Pew Research Center found the South is still home to the largest share of poor Americans. The biggest change has been in the West, which had 15 percent of poor Americans in 1969 but 24 percent of them in 2012.

Louisiana and Georgia each had official poverty rates of nearly 40 percent in 1959. Those states continue to have elevated levels today, by both Census measures.

There could be a few reasons why: The two states rank in the top 10 nationally for share of population under 65 years old without health care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. People in both states also have slightly lower education levels than the national average, according to Census figures.

## Safety Net's Benefits

On the other hand, some of the states that were poorest in 1959 and 2012 appear much better under the supplemental measure. This underscores how government programs can keep families above the poverty line.

Mississippi's nation-leading official poverty rate of 22 percent in 2012 falls to 16 percent under the supplemental measure. New Mexico's 20 percent drops to 16 percent under the supplemental standard. Arkansas' 20 percent falls to 17 percent.

Poverty experts and supporters of the government safety net give credit to programs that prop up family incomes. The Census, for example, has said 5 million more Americans would have been considered poor in 2012 without food stamps, not to mention other safety-net benefits. Food stamps were created as part of the War on Poverty.

"We're doing the best we can to fight poverty, and we're doing a pretty good job," said Timothy Smeeding, who runs the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. He says that debates about the War on Poverty should include the broader measure and the benefits of the safety net.
