WASHINGTON â€” Barbie can finally get off her aching feet.

Mattel, the toy company that manufactures the American doll, has released a line of "Fashionista" Barbies. For the first time in more than 50 years, Barbie can wear comfortable shoes.

Ever since Mattel first introduced Barbie in 1959, she's been forced to hobble around in high heels. Even when you took off her shoes, her plastic feet remained stuck on tiptoe.

## Ankles Can Adjust For Flat Shoes

The 23 new "Fashionista" Barbie dolls have flexible ankles. Their feet adjust to wear either heels or flats. The dolls also come in a greater variety. They have eight skin tones, 14 face shapes, 22 hairdos, 23 hair colors and 18 eye colors.

"The Barbie Fashionistas line was designed to represent the world girls see around them," explained Ani Istanboulian. She is a spokeswoman for Mattel.

Istanboulian said the "Fashionista" Barbie takes the doll to the next level.

She said new Barbies have "authentic street style" and many of them look great in flats.

## Barbie "Set Free Of Her Misery"

The news created much online buzz this week. Many grown-ups who had long felt sorry for Barbie's sore feet reacted to the change in footwear.

"Finally, Barbie has been set free of her misery," MTV Style said.

"There's no word on if or when an official Mattel plus-size Barbie is in the works," said an online Cosmopolitan magazine article. "In plastic world, this is all huge news." The piece was shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook. "One small step for Barbie, one huge leap for womankind," the article said.

Mattel's Barbie website shows Fashionista dolls wearing flats.

## Ad Says She's "Ready For Anything"

The "Film Director" doll wears jeans, scarf, pink top and black flats. With her new ankle, the doll "can go from running-around-the-set flats to movie-premiere heels!" the ad says.

The "Pink Petals" Barbie wears a feathery pink skirt and white tank top. She has a pair of silver flats and a matching silver bag, the website states.

The "Teresa" doll wears a jean skirt, a flower-print top and sandals. She's "ready for anything dressed in a trendy outfit that's perfect for daytime or nighttime fun," the ad says.

Unfortunately, the switch to flats hasn't solved one longtime problem for these Barbies. Mattel warns that the dolls with long legs still "cannot stand alone."
