### PRO: Navy needs more ships to stay powerful

WASHINGTON — Some people say aircraft carriers aren't as useful anymore.

Aircraft carriers are giant ships that can hold many planes. They have a long deck that planes can use to take off and land. They cost a lot of money to build.

Over the past 10 years the U.S. has been fighting terrorists and rebels. That type of fighting doesn't need carriers. Because of this, the number of carriers in the Navy has already been reduced from 11 to 10. And the government may cut spending. That could shrink the number to eight or nine.

## A Long History Of Carriers

Yet, carriers have taken part in almost every big U.S. military action since World War II. They have been used to put pressure on other countries. They have given our military the ability to handle many situations. They have supported several missions at the same time.

Carriers allow us to fight in any region in the world. And they've reduced the need to rely on military bases in other countries.

The U.S. needs a large fleet of quality carriers. Otherwise, the U.S. Navy may not be able to continue to secure the seas and shipping routes around the globe much longer.

The U.S. has built new carriers that are an important step toward a better fleet. The first is the USS Gerald R. Ford. It's named after a U.S. president. The Ford has important advances. They will allow it to be a powerful ship for a long time. It is expected to remain in service for about the next 90 years.

The carriers have an advanced aircraft launching system. And they have gear that can slow down planes when they land. That will allow them to operate planes heavily loaded with weapons and fuel.

It also has a larger flight deck. And it has improved elevators to move missiles from below the deck to the surface. The Ford runs more by itself than older carriers. And fixing the new carriers is easier. That will make it cheaper to run the ships.

## Carriers Across The World

It's true that missiles fired at the carriers could cause damage. But, the United States is not the only country building new aircraft carriers.

About a dozen nations operate carriers. India, China, Brazil and Thailand all do. This shows that carriers are important in both peacetime and war.

Countries like China are improving their navies. And they're becoming more advanced. The U.S. has had the strongest navy for a long time. But, these countries could change that.

This is worrisome. Possible battles in the future could make America fight far from home. Enemy forces would have more ships and planes close by. American forces there would be on their own until help could be sent.

This is a problem because the U.S. has been building smaller ships. These ships are more open to attack. Using smaller ships leads to a weaker navy.

A strong military is worth spending money on. Americans don't want to fight anytime soon. But, the best way to win a war is to not fight one at all. If the U.S. keeps a strong military, other countries won't want to fight us. Spending money to keep the U.S. as the strongest military would achieve this goal.

Aircraft carriers face new risks as other countries get stronger. But, the answer is not to give up. Instead, the United States needs to make better use of its technology.

New advances in technology could make carriers last longer. New inventions can shoot energy or lasers, instead of missiles. They're kind of like ray guns. [Drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) are planes that fly without pilots in them. They can be used on carriers now.

Aircraft carriers are still necessary. Our nation cannot afford to not have a fleet of new super-carriers.

### CON: Giving the Navy money to buy super-ships will only cause more wars

WASHINGTON — Since March 2013, the military has been getting less money from the government. And it wants some of that money back to buy new planes and ships. But, it shouldn't be given any more money. It has enough already.

A law passed back in 2011 requires the government to stop giving out money to stop the U.S. from spending more than it takes in.

It was a dumb idea to lower spending. So many people are out of work. They need help from the government. However, since government spending was going to be cut, the military was a good place to cut. It already had too much money.

Now we hear whining from private companies that sell weapons and equipment to the Pentagon. They say that America will become less safe. The Navy is especially concerned. It wants huge new ships that can hold lots of planes.

## Money Not Keeping Americans Safe

But a lot of the money spent on the military isn't protecting Americans.

For instance, how has the U.S. war in Iraq made us safer? And it cost the lives of more than 4,400 Americans. Several hundred thousand Iraqis also died. The war in Afghanistan hasn't increased our safety. And we've bombed Pakistan, Yemen and other countries. All of these actions are making new enemies for us.

The one's that are scared are the military and companies. They are worried that people will see that the cuts don't put us in danger. If there's no loss of safety, people may want more cuts.

According to surveys, the public already wants bigger cuts in military spending. But our leaders in Congress get support from military companies. So, they want to keep the money flowing. These leaders want to increase American power in the world. But, they don't send their own sons and daughters to war. Nor do they take the hit to their own wallets.

Some military spending has been frozen since March. But, the military is still spending a lot of money.

The Navy plans to build on a new war ship. And it wants more submarines that can carry missiles.

## Less Military, Less War

Do you really want these new weapons? Or would you rather hire thousands of more teachers to help children?

And these Navy toys are small change. The military is planning hundreds of billions of dollars in spending in the next 10 years. It will just result in more waste.

The worst deal of all would be a "grand bargain." Some leaders in Congress want a big deal to avoid the cuts in military spending. Instead they would cut Social Security and Medicare. These programs provide money and health care to old people.

This is no bargain; it is more like "grand theft" from the elderly: their average Social Security check is about $1,100 a month. It makes up most of the money they get in old age.

It is often said that Pentagon spending creates jobs. But, there are other ways to find jobs for people.

We almost got into the war in Syria in September. But, the American people were against it. So, Congress didn't vote for it. President Obama wasn't going to bomb Syria without Congress agreeing to it.

A smaller military will force out leaders to scale back their goals. That will mean fewer wars. Fewer lives will be destroyed. We don't need more spending by the Navy or the military. We need a country that doesn't send its military all over the world.
