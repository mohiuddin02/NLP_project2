JERUSALEM â€” Last month, Mohammed Dajani took 30 Palestinian students to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp. He didn't expect Palestinians to support the trip. But he had no idea how much anger the visit would stir up.

In online posts and comments, Palestinians called it treason. People told the professor to be careful. They suggested that he stay away from his university and go on vacation.

"People said we were giving support to (Israel) as if we were giving up on our rights," said Dajani. He directs the American Studies program at Al Quds University. The university is located in East Jerusalem in Israel, which is in the Middle East. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. He also heads a group called Wasatia. It promotes moderation and peace among Palestinians.

The Palestinians are seeking their own state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The two territories border the State of Israel. Israel controls the West Bank.

## One Trip Sparks An Idea

Dajani traveled to Auschwitz three years ago. After he came back, he began thinking of taking a group of students there. About 1 million Jews were killed at Auschwitz during the Holocaust. During the Holocaust, which ended in 1945, Nazi Germany tried to destroy all the Jews in Europe.

Palestinians know little about the Holocaust, Dajani said. Some of them deny the Holocaust ever happened.

"People don't want to recognize the suffering of the" Jews, Dajani said.

Israel was created in 1948 after the Holocaust ended. Many of the Jews who survived the Holocaust found a home in Israel. In the minds of many Palestinians, the Holocaust is linked to the Jewish State.

When Israel began, the Israeli army forced many Palestinians to leave the country and their homes behind. Many Palestinians think the founding of Israel was a disaster. They think of it as their own Holocaust. They remember each year just as Jews remember the Holocaust. Holocaust Remembrance Day was last Sunday.

## Important History Lessons

"The Holocaust is not taught in Palestinian schools and universities," Dajani said. "It is a history ignored."

Dajani wants Palestinians to learn about the Holocaust. The program also included a visit by Israeli students to a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank. Many of the families of the Palestinians there originally lived in what's now Israel.

In Poland, the Palestinians visited the city of Krakow. It is near Auschwitz. There, they learned about Jewish life before the Holocaust. In Auschwitz, they heard from two people who survived the Holocaust. This is believed to be the first trip to a concentration camp by Palestinian students.

"I visited the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem three years ago, but here it was different," said Salim Sweidan. He is a Palestinian student who went on the trip. He said the trip had a big effect on him.

Palestinians accused the students of showing sympathy with Israelis. "But I say no, this was sympathy with the human beings who were killed there," Sweidan added.

Nasser al-Qad is a student at Al Quds. Going to Auschwitz was his duty as a human being, even though he disagrees "with the Israeli side."

He said Israelis should also recognize Palestinian suffering.

Abdullah Dweikat is a Palestinian writer. He said the students should not have gone. He said he is against the killing of any human being. But he also said he could not ignore "wounds and pain of our people."

Dajani said he used to be angry at all Israelis. Then his father became sick. He was cared for in an Israeli hospital. Dajani said that the treatment of his father and other Arab patients at the Israeli hospital changed his feelings toward Israelis.

In the end, why did Dajani take the students on the trip? "I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do," he said. "I would do it again."
