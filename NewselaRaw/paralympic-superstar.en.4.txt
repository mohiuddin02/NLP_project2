BALTIMORE — Tatyana McFadden was once a little girl in Russia. She was disabled. Her legs didn't work at all. And her mother couldn't take care of her. She lived in an orphanage — a place for children without parents.

Years ago, she was adopted by an American woman. She now lives in Maryland.

McFadden is now 24 years old. She still can't walk, but she is very strong and fast. Nicknamed "the Beast," she is a superstar athlete.

Starting Friday, McFadden will be competing at the winter Paralympics. These games are just like the Olympics for athletes who are disabled. This year, they are being held in Sochi, Russia.

## A Brand-New Challenge

McFadden is already a champion at wheelchair races. But this is a brand-new challenge for her: She will be cross-country skiing at the Winter Paralympics. She'll be taking on the best in the world after just 50 days of training.

She will compete in the country where she was born. Her birth mother will watch.

In 2011, McFadden went back to the orphanage for the first time. People were shocked by how different she was.

"They were absolutely amazed," McFadden says. They couldn't believe how she'd changed. How she'd gone from "from scrawny to how strong I've become."

Tatyana also met with her birth mother, Nina Polivikova.

## Racing In Front Of Birth Mom

Some say McFadden was "abandoned" by Polivikova. But McFadden doesn't see things that way. Polivikova was very young. She didn't have enough money to take care of a disabled baby.

"I wanted her to know, 'It's not your fault,'" McFadden said. "'You did what you could. You did the best that you could at that time and moment.'"

McFadden has remained in touch with Polivikova. She is looking forward to racing in front of her in Sochi. Some of her Russian cousins will also be there.

"I'm sure I'll never forget being able to see them at the starting line," she said. Or their "being there when I cross."

McFadden is focusing on doing her best as an athlete. Still, these games will have an extra meaning for her because they are happening in Russia.
