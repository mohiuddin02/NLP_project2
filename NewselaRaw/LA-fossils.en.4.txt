LOS ANGELES — Some day years from now, Los Angeles will have several new subway stations. The work has already started. Seventy feet below Wilshire Boulevard, subway construction crews are busy. They are digging up dirt and drilling through rock.

But the underground work isn't only about subways. The other day, Kim Scott was busy with her own task. She is a paleontologist — a scientist who studies life on Earth before humans. Digging in this part of Los Angeles turns up plenty to interest her.

Scott is searching for remains from a beach that had been buried long ago. Waves from the Pacific Ocean washed over what is now Wilshire Boulevard.

The city won't begin building new subway lines until next year. But a shaft has already been dug. The goal is to check soil conditions. What workers find will help the city plan future stations and tunnels.

## Mollusks And Sand Dollars

When the shaft-digging started, people expected discoveries down there. The dig is near the famous La Brea Tar Pits. Many fossils have been found in the tar pits over the years.

Fossils are the remains of animals and plants from long, long ago. Those ancient bits and pieces can be petrified — over time they turn into something like stone. Or they can be trapped in actual stone.

Paleontologists have recovered various fossils so far: mollusks, sand dollars, pieces of driftwood and cones from Monterey cypress trees. For Scott, two finds are particularly exciting.

One is a rock that probably contains a 2-million-year-old sea lion's tooth. The other is a 10-foot limb from an ancient pine tree.

This stretch of Wilshire Boulevard, said Scott, is special. It contains the world's "best record of life from the last great ice age."

In the shaft, she added, it's as if you are back in the past. "You're walking along an ice age shoreline."

## Preserved In The Muck

The surrounding area is indeed one of the world's richest when it comes to fossils. Over many thousands of years, underground oil oozed to the surface. This formed into swamps of tar. Animals wandered into the sticky tar and became trapped. After they died, their skeletons were preserved in the muck.

Scientists have uncovered parts of many ancient animals in the La Brea Tar Pits: wolves, saber-toothed cats, ground sloths. And it's all right in the heart of Los Angeles.

The shaft is near the La Brea pits. It is 18 feet wide by 38 feet long. Eventually, it will be 75 feet deep. That's twice as deep as any earlier dig in the area.

The farther down the shaft you go, the older the fossils are. Fossils from the upper 40 feet range from modern times to 50,000 years ago. Below that, they range from 100,000 to 330,000 years old.

"We're finding fossils older than what's found at La Brea," Scott said. But none of them are from plants or animals that have died out. "We can still find all the plants and animals in California."

## An Ancient, Vanished Sea

But who knows what will be discovered as digging continues.

Work on the shaft began last April. By the end of March, subway workers expect to hit 75 feet. They will then lay down a floor of concrete.

Once the shaft is finished, it will be covered by metal street grating. Over the next six months, engineers will enter the shaft from time to time. They will check for water. And they will study soil conditions.

Years from now, a new subway station will open in this very spot. Commuters will rush back and forth, trying to catch their train. Few will realize what surrounds them: leftover bits of an ancient, vanished sea.

Dave Sotero works for the subway system. Right now, he said, L.A.'s ancient past is "meeting its subway future."
