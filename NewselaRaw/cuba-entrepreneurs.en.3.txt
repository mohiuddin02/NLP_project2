New rules are making it easier for entrepreneurs in Cuba to sell their goods to customers in the United States. The U.S. State Department has announced that private businesses in Cuba could export — or sell — certain products to the United States. Many people were left wondering how this policy would affect both countries.

An attorney in Miami named Lenny Feldman made a list of the products that could be exported. He calls it his "yes" list. The list includes the specific items that entrepreneurs — businesspeople — from Cuba can now sell to the United States.

The new policy is called the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule, and it opens doors between the countries to allow for more trade. Right now, Cuba and the United States do not trade goods back and forth because there is a law against it — the U.S. put a trade embargo on Cuba.

## Two Countries Beginning To Make Peace

The U.S. government put the embargo on Cuba in 1960, after Fidel Castro's Communist government came to power. The embargo made it illegal for Americans to trade with Cuba. It has been in place for decades. This year, President Barack Obama announced the two countries would begin to make peace after years as enemies. The U.S. government has begun to make exceptions to the embargo as part of that process.

There are many exceptions on Feldman's list. Cubans can now sell many types of items to the United States This is good news for the 480,000-plus entrepreneurs in Cuba. These workers are called cuentapropistas in Cuba.

The U.S. government hopes that the Harmonized Tariff Schedule will make it easier for cuentapropistas to be successful.

The new policy allows for some goods to be traded, while prohibiting others. It says that live animals and animal products cannot be exported from Cuba to the United States. However, it allows for animal skins, leather, furs, saddles, handbags, and travel goods to be sold.

Paper products, plastics and rubber, glass, hats, umbrellas, toys and games, flowers and feathers are also allowed to be exported.

Cuentapropistas can sell soap, candles, waxes, perfume, jewelry, watches and musical instruments to customers in America as well.

## Some Items Are Still Banned

While the State Department will allow many items to be exported, they have also banned some items. Sugar, prepared food and drinks and aircraft are not permitted.

Many of the items on the "no" list are made by companies that the Cuban government controls.

Ted Piccone is an economic researcher. He said the new policies are supposed to support independent companies and workers in Cuba, not companies controlled by the Cuban government.

The goods that can or cannot be traded are often very similar. Some items are on the "yes" list even though they are similar to products on the "no" list. Feldman said it can get tricky.

For example, wool and cotton cannot be exported. However, other fabrics can be. Lace, knits, carpets and felt fabrics are allowed.

## Import List Should Help Improve Lives And Communities

The State Department said the import list should help independent Cuban entrepreneurs do more business. It could help these entrepreneurs have better lives and improve their communities.

Even though the policies make it legal for the countries to trade, it does not mean it will be easy or simple. The American economy is large. Working with small private Cuban businesses and entrepreneurs may be difficult at first.

Piccone said that Cuba might have to change some of their own laws. He said the Cuban government is not ready for the products and money that may come into the country as a result of the new policy.

The State Department said it "cannot predict what the Cuban government will or will not allow." U.S. officials hope that Cuban officials adopt the ideas and continue to provide opportunities to private workers.

## Dual-Currency System Is A Challenge

Another challenge is that there is no direct mail service between Cuba and the United States. That could make shipping goods between the countries difficult. Currently, products that are sent to Cuba from the U.S. go by ship.

Another challenging factor is that Cuba has a complicated money system. They use two types of money — a dual-currency system. They use the Cuban peso and the Cuban convertible peso (CUC). Pesos are used for everyday purchases. CUCs are used by state companies and the government.

Nobody knows yet how the policies will change the economy in Cuba. It remains to be seen how the countries will handle the money going back and forth and what new products will be traded.
