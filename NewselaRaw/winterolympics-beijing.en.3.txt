KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia â€” Beijing has been chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. The Chinese capital will be the first city in history to host both the winter and summer Games.

Beijing's rival city was Almaty, Kazakhstan. The final vote was 44 to 40, which was surprisingly close.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is in charge of the Games. It saw Beijing as a safe choice. With more than 300 million people in northern China, Beijing also offered the chance to make a lot of money. The northern Chinese city hosted the Summer Olympics in 2008.

"We know China will deliver on its promises," IOC President Thomas Bach said of the selection.

## Fair Elections

The IOC had to vote twice. The first vote was done with electronic tablets, which had technical problems. Members voted again using paper. The result of the first vote was not released.

Bach was asked at a news conference about possible cheating. He sounded a bit angry when he answered the question.

"This is an unfair question," Bach said. He explained that the IOC decided to vote again to make sure the election was fair.

Going into the vote, Beijing was the strong favorite, although it does not get any snow. For sports such as skiing, it will use fake snow.

## Close Result Surprised Many

Almaty had hoped to bring the games to Central Asia for the first time. Kazakhstan is on the northwest border of China. The city Almaty was not as well known. It was also seen as a riskier choice by IOC members.

Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov made a last-minute plea for the IOC to be "brave" and give the Games to his country.

"Almaty is not a risky choice for 2022," Massimov told the IOC delegates. "In fact, we are quite the opposite."

Massimov said Kazakhstan hosting the Winter Games would be "a golden opportunity."

It would prove that smaller countries can successfully host the Olympics.

Most IOC members were surprised by the close vote.

"Gee, you wouldn't have picked that close result a few months ago," said John Coates of Australia. He is the IOC vice president. Coates said he thought that Kazakhstan almost won because of Massimov's speech. In the end, China was chosen because it is so large. It has millions of people who can learn about winter sports.

## Third Time Is The Charm

The Olympics will be held three times in a row in east Asia. The 2018 Winter Games will be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The 2020 Olympics will be in Tokyo. The 2022 Olympics are now set to be in Beijing.

Human rights groups were unhappy with the IOC decision. People in China do not have many freedoms. They can be put in prison for criticizing the government.

Sophie Richardson is the China director at Human Rights Watch. She said the IOC must get the Chinese government to improve human rights.

## New, Small Nation Wants To Play In Big Leagues

No one thought Beijing or Almaty had much of a chance when the 2022 contest opened two years ago. Then four European cities pulled out for different reasons. Beijing and Almaty wound up being the only two candidates left.

The contest showed the difference between the world's largest country and a small, new country. China's power was a big advantage against tiny Kazakhstan. It only became its own country in 1991.

Andrey Kruykov is the Almaty Olympic vice chairman. He said the city might to try to get the Olympics again.

Beijing plans to hold Olympic snow and sliding events in Yangqing and Zhangjiakou. The cities between 37 and 87 miles away from Beijing. A high-speed train to Zhangjiakou is being planned. It is supposed to cut travel time to 50 minutes.
