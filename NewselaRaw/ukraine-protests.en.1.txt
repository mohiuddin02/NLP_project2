KIEV, Ukraine â€” The 3-month-old uprising against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich flared to a deadly crescendo Tuesday. First, anti-government protesters set fire to the ruling party's headquarters. Then, security forces stormed their tent camp in what officials called "an anti-terror operation."

The Interior Ministry reported that at least nine people were killed: two police officers, an official of the ruling Party of Regions, and six protesters. Opposition lawmaker Oleksandra Kuzhel said the death toll had grown to 15 after security forces moved against the tent camp with stun grenades and water cannons. Other reports put the number of dead as high as 19.

Even the lower death toll would represent the worst one-day loss of life in the battle over the republic's future. At issue is whether Ukraine will be a nation tied more closely to Russia or to the West. Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union and since its breakup in 1991 has remained closely linked to Russia.

In recent years, however, there have been increasing calls within Ukraine for the country to shift itself toward Western Europe and its economic alliance, the European Union. Supporters of that approach claim closer ties to the West would bring both economic benefits and greater democratization.

## Smoke, And An Orange Glow

On Tuesday, fiery explosions illuminated the protesters' grimy tent city in Kiev's Independence Square. Police in riot gear had stormed the area around 8 p.m after protesters ignored a warning to clear out. Officers set fire to tents and lobbed tear-gas canisters into the crowds of defiant protesters.

Clouds of smoke wafted over the chaotic scene, which was eerily back-lit by an orange glow. The light flowed out from the blasts, and from burning sandbags and smoldering debris ignited by police trying to drive away the protesters. Despite the choking fumes, thousands of people remained in the protest camp, also known as Maidan.

Unrest also broke out elsewhere in western Ukraine, with protesters attacking local government offices in a number of areas.

Ukrainians in favor of closer ties with the West, most of them city-dwellers, have been demanding Yanukovich's resignation. Their anger was ignited by his decision last November to scrap an accord between Ukraine and the European Union.

Yanukovich opted instead to maintain close economic ties with Russia. Russia has promised Ukraine $15 billion in aid, which the opposition sees as an attempt to buy Yanukovich's loyalty and an effort to steer Ukraine into joining the Eurasian Union. The Moscow-directed economic alliance has been touted by Russian President Vladimir Putin as an alternative to the European Union.

Opposition leaders told journalists in Kiev, the capital, that they had requested negotiations with the government to defuse the escalating violence. The nation's leadership, they said, had agreed to meet with them Wednesday. However, police continued to set fire to tents and barricades well into the night.

## Appeals To Resume Talks

Protest leaders remained defiant. Opposition politician Arseny Yatsenyuk, an economist and former foreign minister, appealed to Yanukovich to "spare Ukraine from becoming a country covered with blood." He called on the president to pull back security forces and adhere to a cease-fire if he wanted dialogue with his opponents.

"This is an island of freedom and we will defend it," vowed another opposition leader, former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko. He urged the protesters to hold their ground against police attacks.

The government also held its hard line against the unrest, which it blamed on protesters.

"Today we were able to see that only the government is interested in peaceful resolution of the situation," government official Viktor Pshonka told state-controlled television. "Opposition leaders should take the responsibility for everything happening in the street of Kiev today. It is the opposition who announced a peaceful rally that turned into (a) violent standoff."

In Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney called on Yanukovich to restart negotiations with the protesters. Negotiations, he said, would serve "to immediately de-escalate the situation."

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also urged the Ukrainian government and opposition to show restraint and resume "sincere dialogue."

## Call To Curb Presidential Powers

The surge in violence followed a short-lived period of peace. Authorities released the last 234 detained protesters and promised to drop criminal charges against them. In exchange, the opposition vacated Kiev City Hall and removed some barricades blocking streets around the Supreme Council, the national parliament.

But protesters were still intent on pressing their demands. They called not only for Yanukovich's resignation, but also for parliamentary action to curb presidential powers. On Tuesday afternoon, protesters marched toward the parliament building, demanding reinstatement of the 2004 constitution. This had been amended in 2010, following Yanukovich's election, in order to reduce the authority of the legislature and increase the powers of the president.

The demonstrators turned more belligerent when Yanukovich's Party of Regions postponed debate on the legislative changes sought by the opposition. Police then tried to block a procession of about 20,000 people who attempted to enter the parliament. Some managed to penetrate the security barrier around the building as well as the Party of Regions headquarters, which was set on fire.

Marchers pulled cobblestones from the streets to hurl at police, who tossed tear gas back at the protesters.

The short-lived easing of tension during the weekend apparently fell victim to renewed worries on both sides. Protesters and the government both recognize that the fight over the future of Ukraine remains unresolved.
