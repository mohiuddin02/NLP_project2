LE BOURGET, France — Nearly 200 nations have just adopted the first global agreement to fight climate change. Known as the "Paris agreement," the deal was signed in Paris on Saturday. It calls on the world to first cut and then end greenhouse gas pollution.

Greenhouse gases come mostly from the burning of oil, coal and gas for energy. Once released they cause heat to build up in the atmosphere, leading to the steady rise in overall global temperatures known as global warming. 

Global warming creates all sorts of problems for the planet, including a rise in sea levels caused by melting polar ice caps. As water levels rise, coastlines and small island nations are increasingly threatened. If unchecked, global warming may also increasingly cause serious droughts. Agriculture could be seriously disrupted and many people could be left without enough water.

## Goal Is To Cut Pollution From Humans

The Paris agreement seeks to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the level that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally. The goal is to reach that level at some point between 2050 and 2100.

Loud applause erupted in the conference hall after the agreement was finalized. Some delegates wept and others embraced.

"It's a victory for all of the planet and for future generations," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. The agreement will "prevent the worst, most devastating consequences of climate change from ever happening," he added.

Brazilian Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira declared: "Today, we've proven that it's possible for every country to come together, hand in hand, to do its part to fight climate change."

The deal is the first agreement to ask all countries to join the fight against global warming. Previous talks required only wealthy nations to reduce their emissions. Many poorer nations had long maintained that they needed to expand their energy use in order to develop economically.

## "A Monumental Success For The Planet"

"History will remember this day," U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said. "The Paris agreement on climate change is a monumental success for the planet and its people."

President Barack Obama said the climate agreement offers "the best chance to save the one planet we have."

The deal commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures by the year 2100 "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). It says countries will try to limit them even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius in recent history.

Scientist Ben Strauss said limiting warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees would make a significant difference. It could potentially cut in half the number of people whose houses will eventually be submerged by rising seas. Scientists now estimate that 280 million people will lose their homes to rising sea levels.

## No Countries Would Be Punished

The agreement sets a goal of getting global greenhouse gas emissions to start falling "as soon as possible." However, it imposes no punishments on countries that do not meet their targets.

Achieving the agreement's goal would require a complete transformation of how people get energy. Many environmental activists worry that despite the pledges, countries are not ready to make such dramatic and costly changes.

More than 180 countries have already presented plans to limit greenhouse gas emissions. However, those pledges are not enough to achieve the goals in the agreement. Countries will need to cut much more to meet the goal.

"We've agreed to what we ought to be doing, but no one yet has agreed to go do it," said Dennis Clare, a negotiator for the Federated States of Micronesia. The islands of Micronesia are severely threatened by rising sea levels.

## Protesters Say Plan Is Too Weak

Many activists are unhappy with the new agreement, which they say is too weak to save the planet. Thousands of protesters demonstrated across Paris. People held hands beneath the Eiffel Tower and stretched a 1.2-mile-long banner calling for stronger action.

Kumi Naidoo of the environmental group Greenpeace said the agreement is a good start but is not enough.

"Today the human race has joined in a common cause, but it's what happens after this conference that really matters," he said. "This deal alone won't dig us out of the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep."

The agreement is an important breakthrough, however. Never before have so many of the world's countries pledged to work together to reduce man-made emissions. The U.N. has been working for more than 20 years to get such an agreement.

French President Francois Hollande said France is ready to cut emissions even further than required and to increase aid to poor countries that are affected by the agreement. He challenged all nations to do more.

"The 12th of December, 2015, will remain a great date for the planet," Hollande declared. "In Paris, there have been many revolutions over the centuries. Today it is the most beautiful and the most peaceful revolution that has just been accomplished — a revolution for climate change."
