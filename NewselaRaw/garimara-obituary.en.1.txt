When she was 4, Doris Pilkington Garimara was forcibly removed from home and sent to a camp for "half-caste" aboriginals. There, she grew up believing she had been abandoned and forgotten by her mother.

Decades passed before she learned the full story. It would not only answer painful questions about her past but help Australians understand one of the ugliest chapters of their history

Pilkington Garimara and her mother belonged to "the stolen generations." They are among the estimated 100,000 children of mixed aboriginal and white parents who were snatched from their homes by the government and reared in lonely settlements. The aboriginals are the native people of Australia and had lived there long before the British settled the Australian continent.

The white Australian government thought that its culture and traditions were superior to the aboriginals. By separating lighter-skinned aboriginal children from their darker-skinned family members, the government sought to erase their aboriginal identity and raise them as white.

## Reclaimed Her Heritage

The forced removals occurred through most of the last century, ending only in the 1970s. The aboriginals who were taken from their homes kept the secret far longer, in part because they accepted what the government told them, that aboriginal people were dirty and evil.

"I actually despised my own traditional culture because we were taught to," Pilkington Garimara once said to an Australian newspaper. "I was taught to deny my own people."

Pilkington Garimara, who was believed to be 76 when she died of ovarian cancer April 10 in Perth, Australia, eventually reclaimed her heritage. She told the moving tale of her mother's escape from the government camp and 1,000-mile walk home in her 1996 book "Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence."

"Her impact on Australians' sense of themselves can't be overstated," said director Phillip Noyce. In 2002, he made a highly praised film based on her book. The film in part led to a formal apology from the Australian government to the aboriginal people in 2008.

"She helped Australians understand and come to terms with our previously hidden history," said Noyce, who was born and raised in Australia. Noyce is also the director of the Hollywood blockbusters "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger."

For Pilkington Garimara, the story began in 1931, when government agents seized her mother, Molly, her mother's sister, Daisy, and a cousin from their home in the tiny town of Jigalong. The girls were sent to the Moore River Settlement 1,000 miles away.

At the camp there were bars on the windows, locks on the doors and buckets for toilets. Anyone who tried to run away was beaten and isolated.

## Escaping The Settlement

After one night, Molly persuaded the other two girls to escape with her. Pretending they were going to the edge of the camp to empty their toilet buckets, they fled when no one was looking.

Pursued by trackers, they followed a fence built in the early 1900s to protect farmland from rabbits, which ran the length of the continent.

They greeted this "rabbit-proof fence," Pilkington Garimara wrote, "like a long-lost friend ... a beacon that would lead them out of the rugged wilderness across a strange country to their homeland." Nine weeks after beginning their trek, Molly and her sister were given a hero's welcome in Jigalong, but they arrived without the cousin, who had turned herself in to authorities.

Molly married an aboriginal man and had two children, the eldest of whom was a girl she named Nugi Garimara, later renamed Doris. Doris was born in 1937, but because the government did not record aboriginal births, her exact birth date is unknown.

That year, A.O. Neville, by law the chief protector of all aboriginal and "half-caste" children, said: "We have power ... to take any child from its mother at any stage of its life. Are we going to have a population of 1 million blacks in the Commonwealth or are we going to merge them into our white community and eventually forget that there ever were any aborigines in Australia?"

In 1941, while Molly was in the hospital, Neville ordered agents to grab her daughters and send them to the Moore River Settlement.

At Moore River, Doris was beaten for speaking her native Mardudjara language. At 12 she was placed at a farm run by missionaries who turned her against aboriginal culture.

## "Rabbit-Proof Fence"

Doris worked for many years as a nurse. She married and and raised six children, and later studied journalism.

She is survived by four children, 31 grandchildren and 80 great-grandchildren, said her daughter, Bernadine Pilkington.

Pilkington Garimara grew up thinking, "my mother didn't want me and gave me away," she told the Australian newspaper. But she gradually learned the truth and wrote down her aunt's stories. She filled in the gaps with research from state records where the escape had been well documented. She eventually wrote four books, of which "Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence" was best known.

Australian filmmaker Christine Olsen worked with the author to develop a screenplay. She persuaded Noyce to put aside a project with Harrison Ford for a film about three aboriginal girls torn away from their families called "Rabbit-Proof Fence."

The movie's success led Pilkington Garimara in 2002 to join former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser as a leader of a national campaign of racial reconciliation. The effort is called Journey of Healing.

She had taken her own healing journey decades earlier, when she was in her mid-20s and traveled back to Jigalong to find her mother.

"I asked her: 'Why did you give me away?'" she recalled. "She just broke down and said: 'I never did, the government came and took you away.' She had no rights as a mother or an aboriginal woman."
