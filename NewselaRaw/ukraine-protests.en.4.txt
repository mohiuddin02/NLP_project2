KIEV, Ukraine â€” For the last three months, Ukraine has experienced a bitter uprising. Protesters have taken to the streets in large numbers. Their anger is directed at the country's president, Viktor Yanukovich.

On Tuesday, the uprising turned deadly. First, anti-government protesters set fire to the ruling party's main office. In response, police stormed a tent camp set up by protesters.

At least nine people were killed: two police officers, a government official, and six protesters. Protest leader Oleksandra Kuzhel said the number of people killed increased to 15 after police stormed the tent camp. Other reports put the number as high as 19 dead.

Whatever the number of dead, one thing was clear: Tuesday was the bloodiest day yet in the battle over Ukraine's future. The battle is being fought to decide one big question: Will Ukraine be a country tied more closely to Russia or to Western Europe?

## Police And Protesters Fight

Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union. This was a union of separate republics. But, it was under the control of Russia. In 1991, the Soviet Union broke into several different countries. Ukraine became its own country. Since then, it has remained close with Russia.

But recently there have been calls for a new direction: Some people in Ukraine want closer ties to Western Europe. This would lead to more jobs and greater freedom, they say.

On Tuesday, explosions lit up the protesters' tent city in Independence Square. The square is located in Ukraine's capital Kiev.

Fighting began after protesters ignored a warning to clear out. Around 8 p.m., police stormed the area. They set fire to tents and threw cans of tear gas. But protesters refused to back down. Thousands of people remained in the square.

Ukrainians who want closer ties with the West are asking Yanukovich to step down. They are furious over a decision he made last November. Yanukovich ended an agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, a partnership of 28 European countries. This agreement would have made buying and selling things between Ukraine and Western Europe easier. Yanukovich chose to stay close to Russia instead. Russia promised money to support Ukraine.

Protest leaders said the government had agreed to new talks, set for Wednesday. However, police continued to set fire to tents in Independence Square well into the night.

## Both Sides Won't Back Down

Protesters aren't backing down. Protest leader Arseny Yatsenyuk appealed directly to Yanukovich. He called on the president to pull back police.

But, the government also refused to back down. It blamed the fighting on protesters.

Tuesday's unrest came just as things seemed to be getting better. Over the weekend, the government released 234 protesters it had put in jail. The government also promised to drop all charges against them.

But protesters decided to keep on pressing their demands. They want Yanukovich to step down. They also insist that the president's powers be cut. The president was given greater powers in 2010, when a change was made to the constitution. Protesters demand a return to the constitution as it was before.

On Tuesday afternoon, protesters hit the streets. They began marching toward the parliament building. Parliament is a branch of the government like Congress in the United States.

The demonstrators grew angry after the government announced that parliament wouldn't discuss changes to the constitution right now. Police tried to block the crowd of about 20,000 from entering the parliament. Some protesters managed to get into the building. Others succeeded in breaking into the ruling party's main office. They set it on fire.

The short period of peace over the weekend came to an end because neither side was satisfied. Protesters and the government agree on only one thing: The fight over the future of Ukraine isn't over.
