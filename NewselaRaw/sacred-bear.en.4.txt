BILLINGS, Montana — American Indians in the Western United States are fighting to save grizzly bears. Right now there is a law to protect the huge bears. The government might change the law. Then people would be allowed to hunt a few bears. 

Many bears live in Yellowstone National Park. It is in the state of Wyoming. The tribes are worried hunters will kill the bears near there.

Native American tribes believe the bears are sacred. The bears are important to their culture and history.

## Grizzlies Used To Roam More Freely

Grizzly bears once lived in much of the Western United States. Many of them were killed by hunters. Then laws were made to protect the grizzlies. There are now between 700 and 1,000 bears in the West.

Ben Nuvamsa is a leader of Arizona's Hopi Tribe. His people believe the grizzly bear has healing powers. They think of the bear as part of their family. They call the grizzly an uncle.

"It doesn't matter where the bears are. We pray to them when we see them," he said.

## Some States Say It Is Time To Hunt

Some state leaders say the grizzly bear is not endangered anymore. When there are very few of an animal left in the wild, it is called endangered. The government will soon decide what to do about the bears. If the law gets changed, states can allow hunting.

States might let hunters kill some bears. The states that want to do this are Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. Their leaders think hunting bears could save human lives.

The bears in Yellowstone Park sometimes attack hunters. They also attack animals, like cows on ranches. The ranches are near the park. The people on the ranches worry about their animals. They do not want to protect the bears.

## Tribes Are Not Happy

Serena Baker works for the government. She works in a government group in charge of fish and wild animals. Baker said they will think about both science and the tribes' feelings. She knows the tribes feel close to the bears.

Leaders of many of the tribes are angry. They say the government did not ask what they think about the bears. The tribes have treaties with the United States. A treaty is an agreement. The treaty the tribes have says the government must talk with the tribes about important changes.

The government spoke with five tribes so far. Baker invited more than 50 tribes to talk about the problem.

"We need to hear from them on when and where we can meet, because we are ready to meet at any time," Baker said.
