SEATTLE — Are employers required to give employees days off for religious holidays, time to pray during work hours, or other religious accommodations?

On Tuesday, the Washington State Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case closely watched by legal groups. It is being followed because it could set a standard and finally clarify the state's discrimination law.

The lawsuit was brought by four employees of Gate Gourmet, an international company that prepares food for airline passengers. For security reasons, it prohibits its workers from bringing their own meals to work.

The four men — vegetarian, Orthodox Christian, Muslim and Hindu — say the meals the company had been serving during the workers' shifts led them to eat pork without knowing it. Eating that and certain other foods is in conflict with their religious and moral beliefs.

## Law Less Clear On Religious Accommodation

Asegedew Gefe, one of the workers, is an Orthodox Christian, which is a form of Christianity practiced in Ethiopia and Egypt. He has been working at Gate's warehouse at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport since 2010.

"We're not asking for this or that," he said. "If it's broccoli, tell us it's broccoli. If it's pork, tell us pork."

But does the company have to?

It is illegal under state law to fire or refuse to hire someone because of his creed, defined as a system of religious beliefs. But, the law is less clear — some say silent, even — on whether employers must accommodate religious practices in the workplace. This comes at a time when employees are increasingly asserting their religious identities at work.

Some say the protection is understood as being part of state law.

"Failure to recognize a religious discrimination claim under (state law) would leave a gaping hole." That's according to a brief filed by the ACLU of Washington and the Washington Employment Lawyers Association with the state's Supreme Court.

A year ago, a Washington judge, Mary Yu, granted Gate's request to dismiss the workers' lawsuit. She said state law does not require employers to accommodate religious practices.

Yu wrote that her order was based on an earlier court case in which a devout Christian woman sued a school district for religious accommodation. She claimed her supervisor told her to give false information to another employee against her religious beliefs.

The court dismissed that case. In doing so it concluded that the high court, lawmakers and Human Rights Commission, which enforces the state anti-discrimination law, had never formally recognized religious accommodation under state law.

## High Court's Ruling Will Guide Lower Courts

Some believe the Supreme Court agreed to take the Gate case in part because of its importance.

A high court ruling in the case would guide lower courts in deciding such lawsuits in the future.

Specifically, a decision in the case could shift some lawsuits from federal to state court. It could set the standard for the accommodation employers must make. It might allow workers to sue smaller employers — those with eight workers versus those with 25 as required in federal cases.

Attorneys for Gate said that it "takes its legal obligations very seriously, including those that are designed to protect the rights of its employees."

They declined to comment further, citing the upcoming Supreme Court arguments.

Aaron Rocke, attorney for the Gate workers, said religious accommodation is understood as being part of state law.

"The primary legal issue in this appeal is an important matter of civil rights," Rocke said.

While low in numbers, religious-based workplace complaints to both state and federal governments have been on the rise since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

A poll this year by the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding in New York looked conflicts that are based on religion. It found that the most common religious-based conflicts involved being required to work on a religious holiday or attending company events where foods were not halal, kosher or vegetarian.

## Many Cases Filed In Federal, Not State, Court

A state law banning discrimination in employment and other areas based on a person's race, religion and other characteristics was established in 1949. That was 15 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 created those rights at the federal level.

But the federal law was later updated and regulations established to provide for "reasonable" religious accommodation in the workplace. The Washington one was not updated.

While Washington state has not written regulations, it has published guidelines around such protections. And it has investigated such complaints and made determinations on cases. Those decisions implied that such protection exists, whether under state law, or by extension of federal law.

Still, most attorneys in this state say they file employment-discrimination cases in federal, rather than state, court.

Hardeep Rekhi, a Seattle attorney, recently won a lawsuit he filed on behalf of a Muslim man. He was fired from his job as a security guard after he refused to shave his beard, which he wears in keeping with his religion.

Rekhi said he filed in federal, instead of state, court because he recognized a lack of clarity in state law.

In 2005, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers settled a federal lawsuit brought by a server in one of its restaurants. The employee was fired for refusing to cover up wrist tattoos. He said the tattoos were part of an ancient Egyptian religion he follows.

Rocke said he proceeded in state court with the Gate suit, believing state law protected his clients.

"Our position is that Washington, just like both the U.S. government and a majority of the states, require employers to reasonably accommodate religion in the workplace," he said.
