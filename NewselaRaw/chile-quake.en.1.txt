ILLAPEL, Chile — Thousands of residents of this small Chilean city slept outside Thursday after a powerful earthquake destroyed their homes. The quake forced more than 1 million to evacuate and killed at least 10 people.

Several coastal towns were flooded by small tsunami waves set off by late Wednesday's earthquake. The quake shook the Earth so strongly that rumbles were felt across South America.

## "End Of The World"

The magnitude-8.3 quake lasted for three minutes. It caused buildings to sway in the capital, Santiago, and prompted authorities to issue a tsunami warning for the earthquake-prone country's entire Pacific coast. People sought safety in the streets of inland cities, while others along the shore took to their cars to race to higher ground.

"I thought it was the end of the world and we were going to die," said teary-eyed Manuel Moya, 38, sleeping with his wife on the ground outside their destroyed home in Illapel, 34 miles east of the quake's epicenter. The town and surrounding areas have about 35,000 residents.

Moya said he and his wife were in bed, watching television when the quake hit. Fearing they would be killed if they remained inside, they ran outside in their underwear. By the end of the shaking, their home, made of concrete, had been reduced to rubble.

## "Powerful Blow From Nature"

"They said it was a magnitude 8 but it felt like a 10," Moya said, adding that neighbors had brought them clothes.

Speaking to the nation late Wednesday, President Michelle Bachelet urged people who had been evacuated to stay on high ground until it was clear that the danger was over. Officials said schools would be closed in most of the country Thursday.

In the past year, the nation of 17 million has endured devastating floods, wildfires and two volcano eruptions.

"Once again we must confront a powerful blow from nature," Bachelet said.

## Aftershocks And Tsunamis

Authorities said 10 people had been killed, mostly in the areas closest to the epicenter, from causes ranging from a collapsed adobe house to heart attacks. That number could climb as emergency crews reach hard-hit areas.

Mahmud Aleuy, the Interior Ministry's deputy secretary, said 1 million people were forced out of their homes and electrical power was cut off to 240,000 households. Many people had returned home by midday Thursday.

Dozens of aftershocks, including one at magnitude 7 and seven at magnitude 6 or above, shook the region after the initial earthquake. The initial event was the strongest tremor since a magnitude-8.8 quake and the tsunami it caused killed hundreds in 2010 and flattened part of the city of Concepcion.

Following the quake, tsunami advisories were in effect for Hawaii and parts of California. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center originally issued a tsunami watch for Hawaii but downgraded the alert to an advisory. Tsunami warnings in Chile were lifted early Thursday.

## A Good Motto: "Be Prepared"

It appeared that Wednesday's quake had a much smaller impact than the more powerful 2010 tremor. In part this was because Chile's already strong risk-reduction measures and emergency planning have gotten even better in the past five years.

"Earthquake impact is a little like real estate: What matters is location, location, location," said Susan Hough, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. "But it is true that preparedness and risk reduction in Chile is ahead of that in much of the world, and that makes a difference."

## Shaking Up South America

The tremor was so strong that people in Buenos Aires, Argentina, felt it. People in Peru and Brazil also reported feeling the shakes, though no injuries were reported outside of Chile.

Claudio Moreno was in a Santiago bar when the quake hit. The shaking was powerful, but more worrisome was how long it lasted, he said.

"We went out in the street when we felt it was going on too long," he said. "It was more than a minute."

The 2010 earthquake killed more than 500 people, destroyed 220,000 homes, and washed away docks, riverfronts and seaside resorts. So much energy was released that the Earth's rotation was momentarily altered, making the day a fraction of a second shorter.

## Chile's Dubious Distinction

The 2010 quake prompted Chile to improve its alert systems for both quakes and tsunamis.

While Wednesday's tremor was strong by any estimation, the 2010 quake was more than five times as powerful in terms of energy released.

Chile is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries because just off the coast the Nazca tectonic plate plunges beneath the South American plate, pushing the towering Andes mountain chain to ever-higher altitudes. The strongest earthquake ever recorded on Earth happened in Chile — a magnitude-9.5 tremor in 1960 that killed more than 5,000 people.
