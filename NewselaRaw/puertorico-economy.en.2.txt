SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Some call Puerto Rico "the island of enchantment," but Yessenia Puente does not see it that way. For her, the island has lost its charm.

Puente became a widow six years ago. Public schools don't provide a safe setting for her three children. The money she earns as a hotel manager is barely enough to live on and it's not enough to pay for a private school. Every two days, she must deal with no running water at home. A drought has forced the government to limit how much water they use.

Recently, a new 11.5 percent sales tax took effect. That means, for every dollar a person spends, they must pay an additional 11.5 cents to the government. It became too expensive for Puente to stay in Puerto Rico, so she has decided to move.

A truck showed up at her apartment near San Juan to load up her belongings. They would be shipped to Orlando, Fla. The boxes were marked with "1465" — that is the number of families this one moving company has packed for Orlando since January.

"I've been thinking about it for a while because I've seen how things are deteriorating," said Puente, 35. "But with everything happening now, I decided it's time to go. The system doesn't work here."

## Thousands Move To The Mainland

Like Puente, thousands of others are saying goodbye to their lives on the island. They will start over elsewhere in the United States. Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the U.S. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, which means they can live and work anywhere in the mainland, like Americans can.

Researchers say that between 2010 and 2013, 144,000 people left Puerto Rico for the U.S. mainland. The island's population now stands at 3.6 million. That's down from its highest population of 4 million in 2009.

Several moving companies in San Juan confirmed they are extremely busy these days. They are packing up homes as people move to destinations across the United States, including Miami, Orlando, New York, Boston, Chicago and cities as far as the West Coast.

## Huge Debt, High Tax

People are moving away at a time when Puerto Rico owes $72 billion in debt. That means the government owes $72 billion to people, banks and businesses that it has borrowed money from to pay for things like roads, bridges and schools. But the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, says the government doesn't have the money to pay. He says, if the debt situation continues, every person in Puerto Rico would owe $40,000 by the year 2025.

"It's hard to quit and start over but I have no choice," said Puente, who was born in the Puerto Rican town of Bayamon. "My kids are worried and ask many questions but they understand. We don't even have money to go to the movies. The cost of living is too high."

The new 11.5 percent sales tax is higher than the tax in any U.S. state. It's just one of the many ways the Puerto Rican government is trying to fix its money problems.

Nelson Rodriguez runs a family-owned grocery store in San Juan. He says the tax is really bad for shoppers. "For every $100, the government takes $11.50. People are going to have to rethink how to stretch their dollars."

## No Quick Fix

On June 29, government leaders said publicly that they could not fix Puerto Rico's money situation. Since then, they've been meeting with lawmakers, business people and community leaders in an effort to find a solution.

The White House has said it will not give Puerto Rico the money it needs. But some U.S. lawmakers are trying to pass laws that could eventually allow Puerto Rico to file for bankruptcy. That means courts could help erase some of Puerto Rico's debts.

In the meantime, Puerto Ricans have come up with various solutions of their own. One idea is to make government employees take unpaid days off. Another is to lower the amount employers must pay their workers. But both of these ideas would result in people earning even less money than they do now. And a very high number of Puerto Ricans – more than one out of ten – are not working.

"It's sad, really sad," said Blanca Valentine, a Puerto Rico native visiting from New Jersey. "How are people supposed to survive?"
