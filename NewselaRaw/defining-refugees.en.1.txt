RICHMOND, Va. â€” Asein Ta was not yet a teenager when he left his native Myanmar (also known as Burma) in Southeast Asia. He followed his uncle, who hobbled on one leg, on a treacherous three-day journey across mountains and into one of Thailand's largest refugee camps.

"He said there was good out there, something different," said Ta, now 21. Ta's mother sent him away so he could escape the persecution his family and other ethnic Karens faced in their native land. She died shortly after he left.

Five years later, Ta was on a plane to Richmond, Virginia, helped by a little-known program called the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program. It is operated by the U.S. government with help from states and local charities. In nearly 35 years, the program has helped some 13,000 children from Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America escape from war and other disasters and settle in the United States.

## How Refugee Status Can Help

Now, some see URM as a way to help some of the unaccompanied Central American children who have been surging across the U.S. border with Mexico. In 2014, 44,000 children crossed the border alone, compared with fewer than 4,000 in 2011.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has argued that the Central American children, some of whom have been victims of violence, kidnapping or other crimes, are refugees who should be eligible for safety in other countries.

The U.S. government has not chosen to label them as refugees, which if it did, would help the incoming children use the URM program to settle in the United States.

There is also the question of the program's limited money: URM served 3,828 children at its peak in 1985, and today it serves about 1,800. It's unclear whether the program could be expanded to help many of the Central American children if they were considered to be eligible.

Some argue that labeling the Central American children as refugees would be the surest way to get them the help and care they need. Kimberly Haynes, who works for Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, a charity that partners with URM, said there is little difference between the Central American children and refugees from Asia or Africa who have used the program over the years.

## Growing Refugee Crisis

Haynes says that both the Central American children and groups of children from other parts of the world that have used URM in the past face the same kinds of difficulties. "The situations are pretty horrific."

The federal government largely pays for URM, but relies on states and local agencies to carry out the program, since they have the most experience providing social services such as foster care and housing aid.

Fourteen states and the District of Columbia administer their own URM programs.

As attention to refugee crises has grown since the early 1980s, more states have agreed to participate.

Under the program, states are required to ensure that children get health care, legal aid, education, housing and other services. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service also supply caseworkers and care-giving help: both private agencies have experience in dealing with refugees.

In 2013, there were 1,850 children in the program, up from 1,409 in 2011. According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement's 2012 report to Congress, 342 children entered the program that year. Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico were among the top five countries of origin for those children. During that year, one-third of the children in the program were from Latin America.

## The Door Is Open

The way to determine if someone is a refugee, and therefore eligible for URM, is to investigate the circumstances of their lives back home. The federal government has dedicated more resources to doing just that.

President Barack Obama opened the door for the children to be treated as refugees earlier this year when he said that some of the Central American children might apply under "narrow circumstances."

He cautioned, however, that being considered a refugee "is not granted just based on economic need or because a family lives in a bad neighborhood or poverty." Obama also said that it is better for people to apply to be refugees in their home countries before making the trip to America.

## It's A Challenging Process

The federal requirements are a high bar for many of the Central American children, and identifying those who might be without family entirely is even more challenging, said Kristyn Peck of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. "They're not necessarily going to come forth and say, 'I'm a refugee, help me,'" she said.

Those who argue that the Central American children are not refugees say that is as it should be. "In the case of genuine refugees, these services are very appropriate," said Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit research organization that advocates tighter immigration policies. "People feel sorry for them, and there's no question that times are tough in these countries. But generalized violence, or civil unrest, or lack of civil society, has never before been an excuse for designating people as refugees."
