SALENTO, Italy â€” There is only one certainty in the emerging crisis in Puglia, a region in southern Italy known for its olive groves: olives trees are dying due to the deadly Xylella fastidiosa bacterium. Hundreds of acres of once postcard-perfect groves that have prospered for centuries have now become cemeteries. Twisted, dead tree trunks protrude like zombies from the fertile soil in which other plants like grass and flowers grow easily.

Every other aspect of this dire situation is far less certain. No one is even sure how many trees have perished thus far. Some estimates suggest that more than 1 million of Puglia's 60 million olive trees are infected by the bacterium. The trees are either dying on their own or are being cut down and burned by authorities who are under pressure by world leaders who fear the bacteria could wipe out olive groves across the continent. Among the charred remains of a small grove, officials paint olive trees with red X marks to signify their eventual destruction.

## Many Unanswered Questions

No one can even say exactly how this bacterium sickens the trees. Nor can they say anything about how it moves or whether burning the trees actually works. Puglia produces more than 40 percent of Italy's olive oil. It is considered to be among the world's finest. This outbreak could cost the region more than $225 million in olive oil production losses this year alone. Consequently, it could raise the price of oil worldwide substantially.

No one even knows whether all of the currently dead trees actually had X. fastidiosa. Random sampling indicates that trees did die from the bacterium, but only a small fraction of the dead trees have been tested.

Less certain still is how the bacterium was introduced to the area. The scientific community believes it was accidentally brought in with a shipment of plants from Costa Rica. But local Italians have their own conspiracy theories, which range from the intentional killing of the trees by land developers who want to use the land to build resorts to the so-called ecomafia that supposedly wants to use the land as a chemical dump. Even that a U.S. company is somehow responsible for the disease so it can come in and cure the area.

## "Does This Tree Look Sick?"

A far more pressing problem is how to keep it from spreading through Europe. Xylella is carried by meadow spittle bugs that feed on the trees' xylem, the tissue that supports the plant and directs water. The bugs hold the bacterium in their throats and move among the trees and inject the bacterium in the trees when they feed. Scientists cannot agree on how far these bugs can travel.

Alarmed, the European Union has declared that everything south of the Pugliese town of Lecce is a dead zone, and have created a buffer zone above Lecce. In and above the buffer zone, every tree within 100 meters (109 yards) of any infected tree will be cut down. Farmers are understandably upset. "There is no such thing as Xylella," said Pasquale Spina, a farmer whose trees are in the dead zone. "Does this tree look sick to you?" he asks as he strokes new growth sprouting from the top of a stump from a supposedly infected olive tree. "Xylella only exists in the head!"

One of the heads he is referring to is that of Donato Boscia, a virologist who found the first confirmed case of X. fastiodosa in his father-in-law's olive grove in 2013. Boscia is leading a battle against the government and major funding cuts by asking for money to implement an open-air research center to study the disease and find ways to stop it. "We need to work on containment," Boscia said. "We have to adopt good practices to live with Xylella because stopping it is not going to be easy."

## Science Under Suspicion

It is important to note that Boscia is also at the center of a criminal investigation being conducted by a court in Lecce. The court is investigating the potential responsibility of scientists for either introducing the bacteria or succumbing to financial persuasion not to stop it. Boscia is unfazed, at least on the surface and vowed to continue to find enough proof to implement what is necessary to stop the bacteria. "We can't get distracted," he says. "To beat this we need to stay focused."

Science does not always play well in a land where adherence to tradition is combined with suspicion of authority. Boscia's main concern is convincing the public that the EU's plan is Puglia's best option. This is becoming increasingly complicated, as many people believe the government has not provided enough money to combat the disease, making discussion between the government and public nearly impossible. If an olive grower notices a suspicious patch of drying leaves on a tree limb, he is more likely to cut the tree down and burn it himself than wait for authorities to destroy the entire grove. Many growers feel they have to take care of the crisis on their own.

## Olive Trees Are Symbolic

Few experts are as versed in the X. fastidiosa bacterium as Professor Alexander Purcell, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He has written extensively on the effects of Xylella on agricultural crops. He said that the iconic symbolism and cultural impact of the ancient olive trees in Europe and the Mediterranean is giving the disease an impact he has never experienced before. However, he thinks that until the majority of people are willing to cooperate, nothing is going to slow down.

The only good news for Puglia's legendary olive growers is that the bacterium has no effect on the fruit and oil the healthy trees produce, because infected trees cannot produce olives. Thus, the only danger people who consume the unique Pugliese oil is that there will not be enough to go around. But the bad news, is that these ancient trees are dying fast, and with them, a culture.
