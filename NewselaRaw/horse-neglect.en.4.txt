Nobody had visited the four horses in weeks. There was no water in their buckets. No hay was in the stalls. All of the animals looked dangerously thin.

The horses' caregiver had stopped coming to the stable. Joyce Benes owned the stable where the horses lived. She could not stand to see them starve. So she fed them her own hay, even though they were not her animals. But hay was getting more expensive. It used to cost just $2 a bale. Then came a drought. Now it costs as much $10. Benes could not afford to keep feeding them forever.

Desperate for help, Benes called the Illinois Department of Agriculture in January. Then she waited. And waited.

"I must've jumped up and down for two weeks," Benes said. "I said, 'I can't have you do this. I can't have you step in when they die. You need to step in now.'"

## Short-Handed State

On Feb. 15, the state took two of the abandoned horses. The state sent the other two back to their original owners. The owners did not know that the caregiver had disappeared, said Jeff Squibb, spokesman for the Department of Agriculture.

State officials said they responded as fast as they could. But the agency has only five investigators. They investigate animal abuse and neglect complaints in 102 counties.

Dozens – maybe hundreds – of horses and other large animals have been abandoned or neglected. Horse rescue groups blame the crisis on three things: high hay prices, a bad economy and poor government oversight.

## Horses Running Wild

"It's pretty rough out there right now," said Tony Pecho. He is president of Illinois Horse Rescue of Will County. He estimates that 35 to 50 abandoned horses are running free near his group's farm in Beecher, Illinois. "I'm very, very worried about it."

Horse rescuers have picked up abandoned horses on the side of the road. They have found them roaming through the suburbs. Their shelters are crowded. Sometimes they have three times as many horses as usual. The rescuers have had to turn away new ones, they said.

## No Room At The Pound

Several animal control departments in Illinois say they are getting a lot of calls about horse abandonment. They are trying to cope. But the departments are used to dealing with just cats and dogs.

"I can't keep a horse on this property," said Julie Boudreau of the Kankakee County Animal Control and Adoption Center. "I don't really know of any animal control agencies that have the ability to care for all species of animals."

In the past six months, the Kankakee center has received at least a dozen calls asking for help. The callers complain of horses hit by cars. Some report horses running free.  "I can only hope that it's not going to get worse," Boudreau said.

## Following The Law

Illinois has laws about animal abuse and neglect. The laws explain what state workers can do to deal with the cases.

County animal control departments can issue fines. Rescue groups and volunteers may handle some abuse and neglect calls. Sheriffs and police officers can investigate cases. They have the power to seize animals when an owner is arrested.

Animal welfare officials admit it is a challenge to handle all the complaints. They say the state does not give them enough money for staff. Their budget has been cut for six years.

In 2002, the Bureau of Animal Health and Welfare had 32 employees. Now it has 12. The bureau's budget used to be $7 million in 2002. Now it is only $4.6 million, Squibb said.

## It's Up To Lawmakers

Today, five investigators handle animal complaints from across the state.  Each investigator must cover about 15 counties. Last year, there were 969 neglect complaints made to the bureau, Squibb said.

Investigators also have other duties. They inspect 2,500 pet shops, kennels, stables and other places licensed to hold animals.

"Everyone's resources are stretched thin," Squibb said.  "There's a limit to what we can provide. If that's not good enough for people, I suggest they contact their lawmakers and tell them to start providing additional resources."
