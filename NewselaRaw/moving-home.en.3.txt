More young adults are moving back in with their parents after college. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, a new study says.

All signs show that they're a generation doing it their own way. And it may be the right way.

A new report found that about one in three adults ages 18 to 31 live in their parents' homes. This is the highest percentage in at least 40 years. Some people say that this means they're lazy and don't want to find a job.

But a closer look at the numbers shows this may be a reason to celebrate.

"This generation is making wiser, more careful choices," says Robin Marantz Henig. She is co-author of "Twentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck?"

## The Y Generation

First, a look at the numbers. There are 21.6 million members of what's called the millennial generation. A generation is all the people born about the same time, usually during a 20-year span. Many have names. The baby boomer generation was born after World War II.

The millennial generation, also called the Y generation, are those born from about 1982 to 2004. The Z generation are kids born after that. The study by the Pew Charitable Trust found that more than half of the people aged 18 to 24 live at home. Many of them are in college.

But, the millenials are not spoiled brats, says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett. He is the head of a group that studies this generation.

That idea "doesn't hold up," says Arnett.

For one thing, more young people are in college than ever before.

## A Lifeline At Home

What they're not necessarily getting, however, are jobs. The report found that fewer 18- to 31-year-olds had jobs in 2012 compared to 2007.

This is partly because there aren't as many jobs. But it's also partly because millennials are looking for jobs they really like.

They are looking for meaning and purpose "and self-growth in their careers," says Varda Konstam. She is a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Konstam also wrote "Parenting Your Emerging Adult: Launching Kids From 18 to 29."

Arnett says young Americans change jobs an average of seven times from ages 20 to 29. That is much different than earlier generations. Their parents and grandparents settled into jobs shortly after graduating high school or college and stuck with them.

Living with parents can be a lifeline. It could mean the difference between getting by and not having enough to live on, Henig writes in "Twentysomething." In 2009, the U.S. government discovered that people in their 20s and 30s would be much poorer if they didn't live with their parents.

## Wanting An Independent Life

Also, most young adults don't stay with their parents for long. They get jobs and move out within six months to a year.

"They almost all move home for (money) reasons. And they almost always move out as soon as possible," says Arnett.

They want to live a full, independent life. They're parents want that also, says Konstam.

"What their parents want for them is very frequently the same thing the kids want," she said. "They do want to be successful at work. They do want to commit to another person. They do want to own a house. But they tend to do it in their own way."

And a short stay at home gives them time to figure out what they want to do. It also helps them make better decisions, Konstam said.

In 2013, Clark University surveyed parents of 18- to 29-year-olds.

The parents, whose grown kids were at home, were asked how it was going. Most of them said it was going great, Arnett said.
