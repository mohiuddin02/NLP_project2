NEW YORK — Back home in Guinea, West Africa, Nasser Diallo had a law degree and a good job working as a reporter for a radio station. That all came to an end in 2009, he said, when the military abruptly opened fire at a protest he was covering, massacring dozens.

Diallo never went home again. Word reached him that the military government was hunting him, he said. Fearing the worst, he fled to Paris, and then to the United States, where he was granted political asylum, but once here, he couldn't find a job as a reporter.

## "Restart From Scratch"

"I had to make a very, very tough choice to go back to school and restart from scratch," said Diallo, 33. "I didn't have a choice. I was going nowhere. By the time I'm going to graduate, I'll be maybe 50."

Diallo is part of America's rapidly growing population of black immigrants from Africa, many of whom are highly educated and underemployed, and cannot find a good job in their profession. A handful of states are trying to help immigrants like Diallo climb the economic ladder. However, many African immigrants face obstacles, including obtaining licenses to work in educational, medical and other professions.

At home, they were doctors, lawyers, accountants or professors. Here, they are cabdrivers, parking lot attendants, cashiers or nannies. They often live in poverty, though as a group they are more likely than any other immigrant group to hold at least a university degree, according to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a think-tank based in Washington, D.C.

## "This Is Brain Waste"

"We've all heard about brain drain," said Jeanne Batalova, senior policy analyst with the MPI. "This is brain waste."

According to the MPI, one in five college-educated immigrants from all countries is unemployed or underemployed.

Other immigrant groups face similar challenges, but African immigrants have a harder time in the American workforce, experts say.

Africans from relatively prosperous, English-speaking countries such as Nigeria and South Africa have an easier time navigating the system, according to Jeff Gross. He is the director of the New Americans Integration Institute at the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA).

But others struggle. Among recently arrived African foreign-educated immigrants, the underemployment rate is 39 percent, compared to 20 percent of the college-educated U.S. workers and 25 percent of all foreign-educated immigrants, according to the MPI.

## Who Gave You Your License?

The reasons — from a lack of professional networks to cultural barriers to misguided advice to racial discrimination — are complex.

Many immigrants have difficulty getting licensed to work in their professions in the United States, and may have to start school all over again. A law degree from a West African university is the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in the United States.

"Foreign degrees in general are often less valued than U.S. degrees," Gross said.

Some states are trying to streamline the process. Michigan, for instance, worked to create clear-cut licensing guides for 20 professions, said Karen Phillippi, deputy director of the Michigan Office for New Americans.

Last year, the state passed a "Barber Bill." In the past, barbers needed 2,000 hours of training to get licensed. Now, experienced barbers who can prove they have recent experience and training can drastically reduce the number of hours required to get a license.

## A Welcoming America Network

In February, a bill was introduced in the Illinois General Assembly declaring that legal immigrants cannot be denied a professional license. Some cities have become part of a Welcoming America network, creating new rules to aid immigrants. Shelbyville, Tennessee, which experienced a sudden influx of Somali immigrants, was one of the first cities to tackle this approach, said Rachel Peric, Welcoming America's deputy director.

"The dividends of investing in this community have a multiplier effect," said Tadd Wamester, director of regional growth and online programs for Upwardly Global. "This should be looked at as going across generations. Investing in parents is also investing in children."

Black African immigrants are a rapidly growing population. Between 2000 and 2013, their numbers jumped 137 percent, from 574,000 to 1.4 million, according to an April Pew Research Center analysis of census data of the U.S. population. African immigrants now make up 36 percent of the black immigrant population; their numbers are expected to grow.

When they arrive in the United States, many Africans feel the pressure to get a job, fast. In 2013, according to the MPI, 76 percent of them were working in the work force, compared to 67 percent of the overall foreign-born population and 63 percent of native-born Americans.

## "You Don't Have To Aim High"

The pressure to find a job, any job, means that they often find work beneath their skill level, social scientists say. When he first came to the United States, Diallo said, he stayed with his uncle, who urged him to just drive a cab. "You have to survive," his uncle told him, "you don't have to aim high."

Back home in Gambia, West Africa, Haddi, the owner of Fatima's African Hair Braiding and Boutique, said she had a college degree and a job at a bank. Twenty-six years ago, she moved to New York to be with her husband who was studying there.

Eventually, she found work on a factory assembly line, and later, she opened her own hair-braiding salon on the side and put two kids through college.

"I want my children to have the education I didn't have," said Haddi. "Yes, I went to college. But I want more for them. All parents want more for their children."
