Mosquitoes cause a lot of trouble. They spread diseases. Some of the diseases they carry can kill people. In warm, wet places like South Florida, people have to deal with mosquitoes in the summertime. They do this by spraying pesticides. The chemicals in the pesticides kill the mosquitoes. But a new study showed that the pesticide spraying is also killing Florida's butterfly population.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asked experts to do a study. They wanted to find out why so many butterflies were becoming extinct. They hired Gary Rand, a scientist from Florida International University. He spent five years studying the effects of the pesticides on butterflies.

## Proving The Pesticide Danger

Rand found two common chemicals used in pesticide spraying were poisonous to butterflies. For a long time, scientists believed pesticides killed butterflies. Rand's study proved it.

Now wildlife officials have decided to do more to protect the areas where endangered butterflies live in Florida. They will stop spraying pesticides near the rare butterflies' habitats.

"It's up to us to protect them. They don't protect themselves," Rand said.

## Tests Need To Go Beyond Bees

Rand thinks wildlife experts need to look at how pesticides harm other insects, too. Right now, the scientists test only honeybees. Around the world, scientists have found that pesticides have damaged the honeybee population. However, other insects have dropped in numbers, too, because of pesticides. Monarch butterflies, wasps and beetles have all declined in population.

Rand said it is no longer enough to test how pesticides hurt honeybees. They must look at other insects, too.

## Protecting People From Mosquitoes

Dry weather has made this mosquito season one of the mildest in years. Mosquito experts say the new spraying restrictions mean they will have to work a little harder at educating the public about the risks from water standing in potted plants or other areas. Mosquitoes can breed in standing water.

"It's not going to be easy," said Chalmers Vasquez, who works for Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control. He thinks the human population needs to be protected before the butterflies.

Mosquito season starts about two weeks after the rainy season. Mosquitoes get blown inland from the Everglades National Park or Biscayne Bay to areas where people live.

## Going, Going, Gone

Risks linked to spraying date back to at least the 1990s. Back then scientists began connecting the drop in the butterfly population to pesticides. As the years went by, butterfly numbers continued to go down. In 2013, officials announced that two types of Florida butterflies had been wiped out completely. A report found three more butterfly species have probably disappeared. This was because their habitats were destroyed by construction. Pesticide spraying also played a part in the dwindling numbers - or disappearance - of rare butterflies.

Last year, two more species were added to the endangered butterfly list. They were called the leafwing and hairstreak. This brings Florida's total number of endangered butterfly species to four. Another three are considered threatened.

One of the answers to this problem is to improve the management of the places where the butterflies live. This is more important in some areas than others. On Big Pine Key in Florida, for example, people there rely on spraying for mosquitoes to make the summer months more bearable. However, ocean winds carry the pesticides to the butterflies' habitats nearby.

## Toxic To Butterflies And Caterpillars

For his study, Rand selected five species of Florida butterflies. He studied the common buckeye, painted lady, zebra longwing, atala hairstreak and white peacock. Then he studied three pesticides. These were the most commonly used pesticides in spraying for mosquitoes across South Florida.

Rand found that the chemicals in two of the three pesticides harmed both butterflies and caterpillars.

When people spray the right amounts of these chemicals to kill mosquitoes, it is enough to kill a number of other insects, too, Rand said.
