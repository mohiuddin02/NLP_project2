Joe Arpaio is a county sheriff in Arizona. He calls himself "the toughest sheriff in America." Many people like him because he is tough on criminals. He makes jail inmates wear pink underwear. He doesn't allow them to have salt and pepper with their meals. Other people hate the sheriff. They think he treats minorities unfairly.

## Posse On Patrol

Sheriff Arpaio is famous for his "posse." They are a group of volunteers who help the sheriff. Arpaio first formed the group in 1993. Back then, there was a problem with shopping mall thefts. The posse did patrols of the malls during the holidays.

Later, the posse became known for helping the sheriff with immigration raids. The sheriff did the raids to find and arrest foreigners. They were arrested because they don't have the proper documents to work in the United States.

In December there was a tragic school shooting in Connecticut. Sheriff Arpaio turned his attention to school safety. He decided to give his posse a new task. They will patrol 59 schools in the county.

## Who's In The Posse?

The sheriff's posse volunteers drive around and near school grounds. They look for suspicious activity. They are not inside the schools or on school property. They are in cars that look just like the sheriff's deputies' cars. They also wear uniforms that they pay for themselves.

Posse members do not get paid for working. They receive basic training from the sheriff's department. Some of the volunteers carry weapons with them while they are on patrol.

Sheriff Arpaio talked about his plan on some national television news programs. School officials were not asked ahead of time if they wanted the help from volunteers. Neither were parents. Some found out about the plan from watching the national news.

The sheriff's plan has critics. They wonder if it is safe to trust the volunteers. The posse includes retired police officers. It also includes some men who have served in the military. A local TV news investigation found out more about the volunteers. It uncovered that some have criminal records, including violent crimes. The sheriff says that he has faith in the posse.

## Some Question The Plan

Arizona lawmaker Chad Campbell does not agree with the sheriff's plan. He points out that the volunteers don't even interact with school officials or teachers.

The sheriff says that the publicity about his new program will help keep schools in his county safe.

"This will be mainly a deterrent, prevention, that's why we're sending marked cars out there," Sheriff Arpaio told J. J. Hensely of The Arizona Republic.

## Guns On The Nation's Mind

The sheriff's actions come just as the rest of the country is talking about guns, schools and safety.

In January, President Obama announced his plan to help end gun violence. Children who wrote him letters about gun violence appeared with him.

President Obama wants to convince the public to support his plan. It would make it harder for people to buy guns. It would also ban some types of guns. The National Rifle Association (NRA) is against these measures.

The NRA has a different idea about how to handle school safety. It wants armed police officers in every school in America.

One NRA ad tries to persuade people to agree with their idea. It asks, "Are the president's kids more important than yours? Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school."

The White House called the NRA video "cowardly." Obama's spokesman said most Americans agree that a president's children should not be part of the debate. Secret Service agents protect the president's daughters. There are no armed guards employed at their school.

## Like It Or Not, Here Comes The Posse

Sheriff Arpaio agrees with the NRA's plan. But he also says that his plan is a little different. He says that the posse will focus on security surrounding the county's schools.

Whether the schools want the patrols or not, the posse will be circling. The sheriff said his plan is not up for debate.

"It doesn't matter whether they like it or don't. I'm still going to do it," Arpaio said. "I can't imagine criticism coming when they're given free protection."
