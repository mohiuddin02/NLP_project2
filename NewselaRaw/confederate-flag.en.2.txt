WASHINGTON â€” South Carolina's leading national lawmakers and the 2016 Republican presidential field are split over what to do about the Confederate battle flag that flies on government property.

Questions about the flag have resurfaced since the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston last week. The gunman supported symbols like the Confederate flag.

The flag is a symbol of the Confederacy, which fought during the Civil War to keep slavery in the American South.

James Clyburn of South Carolina is a Democrat in the House of Representatives. He is also the highest-ranking African-American member of the House. He said the flag needs to be removed.

## Symbols Seen As Factor In Church Shooting

"That is a flag of rebellion," Clyburn said. Symbols like this flag are connected to a history of racism in America. He said that these kinds of symbols create the environment in which awful events like last week's shooting are able to take place.

Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said the Confederate flag is part of the "rich history" of the state. But he said that at the same time it represents a painful history for some people.

He declined to take a position on the flag Sunday. However, he said he would participate in discussions about the flag and race relations after the church shooting.

"My voice will be clear," said Scott, who is one of two African-American senators. "My position will be stated. I'm not going to make any breaking news here. I have made the commitment to wait until after the funeral to start that debate. And I'm going to honor that commitment."

## Civil War Pride Or Racism?

In 2000, a compromise was made to take the flag off the top of the government building and put it on the surrounding property. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a presidential candidate from South Carolina, said it is time for the people of South Carolina to look at the compromise again.

"(That) would be fine with me, but this is part of who we are," Graham said Friday on CNN. "The flag represents to some people a civil war, and that was the symbol of one side. To others, it's a racist symbol, and it's been used in a racist way."

Other Republican presidential candidates are split on what to do.

More people started paying attention to this issue after former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, posted on Twitter Saturday: "Take down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims."

## It Should Be State's Debate, Some Say

Some insist it's a state issue.

Former Senator Rick Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said on Sunday that he doesn't think that the government or candidates "should be making decisions on everything. This is a decision that needs to be made here in South Carolina."

Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee had a similar view. He said that voters don't want candidates giving their views on every "little issue in all 50 states."

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker urged more time and debate. "I think they're going to have a good, healthy debate, and should have a healthy debate in South Carolina among officials at the state level," he said Saturday. "Before we have that discussion, we should allow the families of the loved ones to bury their dead."

Senator Ted Cruz is a Republican from Texas. He said he understands both sides of the issue, but that it's a matter for South Carolina residents to decide.

There were those who said the flag should come down.

Ohio Governor John Kasich is expected to announce his presidential candidacy in the next few weeks. He said in a statement Saturday that it is "up to the people of South Carolina to decide, but if I were a citizen of South Carolina, I'd be for taking it down."

## Florida Removed Flag In 2001

In 2001, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Katherine Harris had a Confederate flag removed from the Florida state Capitol. At the time Bush said, "It was appropriate to take those flags down and put them in the museum where people can appreciate our heritage, but not have them fly as a symbol of what we are today as a state."

Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, said Saturday that "ultimately the people of South Carolina will make the right decision for South Carolina, and I believe in their capacity to make that decision. The next president of the United States will not make that decision."

Rubio said he supported taking down the flag in Florida. He also supported a measure saying no war artifacts "may be relocated, removed, disturbed or altered."

Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, speaking to reporters at last week's Faith and Freedom Coalition's conference in Washington, said the Confederate flag is "clearly a symbol that is very offensive to many" but that her personal opinion was not important.

She added that what is important is "what the people of South Carolina choose to do next."
