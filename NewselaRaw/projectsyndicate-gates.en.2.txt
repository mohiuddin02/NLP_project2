SEATTLE, Wash. – A few years ago, my wife Melinda and I visited with a group of rice farmers in Bihar, India. It is one of the most flood-prone regions of the country. All of the farmers there were extremely poor. They depended on the rice they grew to feed and support their families. When the monsoon rains arrived each year, the rivers would swell, threatening to flood their farms.

Often, their crops would be ruined, and they would flee to the cities in search of jobs to feed their families. By the next year, however, they would return – often poorer than when they left – ready to plant again.

The visit had a powerful effect on us. It was a reminder that for the world's poorest farmers, life is a high-wire act – without safety nets. They don't have the things farmers in rich countries have. They did not have access to improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems and other technologies. They also have no crop insurance. If they could buy insurance, they would be given money if their crops are destroyed.

## Poorest Farmers Could Suffer The Most

Now, climate change will add a new risk to their lives. Rising temperatures in the decades ahead could damage agriculture, particularly in tropical zones. Crops won't grow because of too little rain or too much rain. Insects will thrive in the warmer climate and destroy crops.

Farmers in wealthier countries will experience changes, too. But they have the tools to manage these risks. The world's poorest farmers are likely to suffer the most.

At the same time, the world needs their help to feed a growing population. By 2050, global food demand is expected to increase by 60 percent. Declining harvests would strain the global food system and increase hunger. With less food, more people would slip into poverty.

I'm hopeful. I think we can avoid the worst effects of climate change and feed the world — if we act now. Governments must spend money to make new clean-energy technology that will dramatically reduce greenhouse-gas emissions caused by burning fossil fuels and stop rising temperatures. At the same time, we need to recognize that it's already too late to stop all of the effects of hotter temperatures. Even if the world discovered a cheap, clean energy source next week, it would take time for humans to stop using fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. That's why it's critical to spend money to help the poorest adapt.

## Newer Tools Needed For New Problems

Many of the tools they'll need are quite basic. They need money, better seeds, fertilizer, training and markets where they can sell what they grow.

Other tools are new and help to manage a changing climate. The Gates Foundation and its partners have worked together to develop new varieties of seeds. The seeds will grow even during times of drought or flooding. The rice farmers I met in Bihar, for instance, are now growing a new variety of flood-tolerant rice – nicknamed "scuba" rice. It can survive two weeks underwater. They are ready for the floods. Other rice varieties are being developed that can withstand drought, heat, cold and soil problems.

All of these efforts have the power to improve lives. When poorer farmers have the right tools, it's quite common to see them double or triple their harvests and their incomes. The extra money allows them to improve their diets, improve their farms and send their children to school.

## From New Seeds To Satelites

There will also be threats from climate change that we can't foresee. To be prepared, the world needs to speed up research into seeds. It needs to support smallholder farmers, who typically farm a small plot of land to support a single family. One of the most exciting technologies to help farmers are satellites. In Africa, satellite images can help create detailed soil maps. With these maps farmers can be informed about what plant varieties will thrive on their land.

Still, we need to get those better seeds and new technologies into their hands. A number of groups, including One Acre Fund, are finding ways to do just that. One Acre Fund works closely with more than 200,000 African farmers to find them money, tools and training. By 2020, they aim to reach one million farmers.

Melinda and I have made a bet that Africa will be able to feed itself in the next 15 years. Even with the risks of climate change, that's a bet I stand by.
