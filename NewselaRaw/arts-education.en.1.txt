WASHINGTON â€” On Tuesday, Michelle Obama delivered a forceful argument for the importance of the arts in education. The arts, the first lady said, aren't something to be introduced after student test scores go up. To the contrary, they are a critical element of achieving those higher test scores in the first place.

Mrs. Obama argued her case while opening the first White House student talent show. This featured spirited song and dance routines by students whose schools had performed so poorly they were chosen for a new federal arts education program.

By the end of the hour-long, toe-tapping, hand-clapping show in the East Room, Mrs. Obama had joined all the students on the makeshift stage to dance during their closing number. It shared its name with her husband's "Yes We Can" presidential campaign slogan.

## President Drops By

President Barack Obama even broke away from his work elsewhere in the White House for a surprise appearance and to make his own pitch for arts education. The president also made a point of congratulating the elementary and middle school performers.

The talent show was a vehicle to showcase the "Turnaround Arts" program. This was created as an experiment in 2012 by the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in collaboration with the White House and the Education Department. Its purpose is to test whether arts education can help improve student outcomes and create more positive learning environments. Major artists adopted each school.

Encouraged by the results so far, including higher reading and math scores and fewer disciplinary problems, Mrs. Obama announced that the program is being expanded this year. It is growing from the original eight schools to 35 schools in 10 states and the District of Columbia. Those 10 states are Iowa, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Louisiana, Oregon, Montana, Colorado, California, Illinois and Minnesota.

Two of the original eight schools have improved so much that they are no longer in need of "turnaround," she said. Those schools are Findley Elementary School in Des Moines, Iowa, and Orchard Gardens in Boston.

## The Arts In Every School

The arts, the first lady said, help get students excited about taking their seats in class. Students are happy to be in school because they are looking forward to the next musical they're performing in or the instrument they can't wait to play.

"But if they're not in their seats then we can't teach them anything at all," Mrs. Obama said. "The bottom line here is very clear: Arts education isn't something we add on after we've achieved other" goals, "like raising test scores and getting kids into college. It's actually critical for achieving those" goals "in the first place."

Six million children do not have access to art or music instruction in their schools. Millions more have only minimal exposure to the arts, she said.

The president added that arts education is a necessity, not a luxury.

"The arts are central to who we are as a people, and they are central to the success of our kids. This is not an afterthought," he said. "This is not something you do because it's kind of nice to do. It is necessary for these young people to succeed that we promote the arts."

## Actors Work With Their Adopted Schools

A few big-name artists, such as actresses Sarah Jessica Parker and Alfre Woodard, performed with students from the schools they have adopted, in Portland, Ore., and New Orleans, respectively. They also spoke about the changes they have seen in their students.

"Our kids are glimpsing the fact that they have" worth, Woodard said. "That confidence just spreads across their lives."

Students spoke about what the arts mean to them, too.

"I think that the arts are important to our school because it gives kids an opportunity to see what they want to do in their life as careers and then also because it gives students a level of confidence," said 8-year-old Sinai Jones, who attends the Martin Luther King Jr. School in Portland.

Sinai and an all-girl group that included Parker on backup performed "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from the musical "Annie."

The expanded program will be paid for over the next three years with $5 million in public and private funding. Money will come from the Education Department, the National Endowment of the Arts, the Ford Foundation and other private foundations and companies.
