MIAMI, Fla. â€” The Florida bonneted bat is a rare animal. Scientists know of only one area where they live in the wild. There are only a few hundred left in Florida. They fly very high in the sky and are hard to see. Luckily, they are very chatty.

It is now easier to hear them, thanks to a group of volunteer scientists. They recorded their songs and learned more about them.

All the attention has made the bats with their funny pug noses into stars. People have made a Facebook page for them and thrown parties to study them. It is all thanks to Kirsten Bohn. She a scientist who is an expert in bat songs. Bohn began organizing groups to find out more about the bats.

Her group of volunteers found bats near a golf course. They recorded their calls with iPads and phones. They found out that no bats sing quite like the bonneted bat.

Frank Ridgely is a veterinarian at the Miami zoo. He recently released the first bonneted bat raised at the zoo. A tracker was attached to the bat to let Ridgely follow it in the wild.

## Studies Could Help Protect Rare Bats

The new studies could help protect the bats. The government wants to set up an area where bats will live safely.

Ridgely said tougher steps must be taken to help the bats. He thinks other parks should be studied to find new homes for the bats.

Bonneted bats are large and fly high. They need plenty of room to fly. The bats used to live in pine woods where they could fly easily among the trees. Now, most of those woods are gone. Building have been built there. The bats now live where they can find space, like the parking lot around the Miami zoo.

Saving the bats has become more important. Millions die each year from diseases and other problems. It is bad for farming because bats pollinate plants to help them grow. They also eat the insects that eat crops.

## Bats May Have A Language

Bohn helped write a study about bat singing. It found bats don't chirp just to find their way or find food. They also sing to mate, fight and call their young. Bats sing from their nests and they sing when they fly. Like people, they may have a language.

Florida scientists knew bats came to the golf course to feed. Bohn was lucky to move to the neighborhood in 2012. In a few weeks, she heard the bat songs and began recording them. She set up recorders at the golf course. Amazed at the number of calls, she began recording in other areas

Neighbors read about the study and called Bohn. She formed the Bat Squad to help. Hundreds of people came to their first bat night at the golf course.

Their study found that bonneted bats make calls differently than other bat species. It could make it easier to count them.

Bohn heard bat calls all over the area. It must mean the bats travel far to find food. She also found that the bats do not like cold weather. They fly out only on warm nights. Counting them in colder months could get the wrong number.

Bohn did not have money to do more studies. She hopes volunteers will keep recording, so she can continue later.
