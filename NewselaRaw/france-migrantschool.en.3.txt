CALAIS, France â€” The school's floor is sandy from the beach nearby. Its roof is held up by tree branches covered in flowered cloth. Inside, the students are seated at small desks.

"'Light' is 'lumiere,'" said the teacher, giving a French lesson in English to migrants. They have come from around the world to this huge camp in this French city. "A lamp gives you light," the teacher said.

The one-room school is located on one edge of the camp. Every day, students pack the four to six classes held there.

The school began on July 11. It was started by Zimako Jones, who is from Nigeria, in Africa. He lives in the camp along with about 3,000 migrants, who sleep in huts of sticks and tarp. They fled wars and poverty in their home countries and hope to find safety in France. Many are waiting to see if they will allowed to stay in Europe.

## School Offers Refuge From Hard Life

Virginie Tiberghien is among the 20 volunteer teachers. She said the school is a refuge for the students. Their lives are very difficult.

Most of the migrants hope to sneak away from France through the Channel Tunnel. It connects France and Britain and runs under the English Channel that separates the two countries. The migrants believe they would have better lives in Britain. With help from the school, some are trying to learn French and stay in France instead.

The teachers offer French, English and painting. Students can also take tai chi, a Chinese form of exercise.

## Writing On Outside Walls Reflects The Hope Inside

Writing on the outside wall of the schoolhouse shows the hopes and dreams of the students. "Never give up hope," says one. "Hey everybody. We are in school," says another.

Zimako arrived in France as a migrant in 2013. He built the school with the help of five Sudanese from Africa. He wanted to improve the lives of people in the camp, which the migrants call "the jungle."

"I thought of doing this to help the people of the jungle, to unite them," he said. "It's a school without religion, without color. We are all together, people."

Today, a big chalkboard covers the front wall of the classroom. Pictures of objects from animals to airplanes are posted on walls with their French names. The classroom can squeeze in up to 35 students.

## Classroom Offers Dignity And Lessons

"We give them a bit of dignity. I think their dignity is being trampled here," said Chris Jaumotte. She is an artist who lives nearby and teaches French and art at the school. Jaumotte gives the students an A for their effort.

Charity groups have given notebooks and pens. Jaumotte bought the paints and brushes for her art class.

At one desk, a young African painted a boat full of people. It was much like the boatloads of migrants who make the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean Sea to France. He called the picture "Dangerous Days."

Zimako keeps thinking big. He wants to build a second, larger school.

"It's ideas at work," he said. "It's not me."
