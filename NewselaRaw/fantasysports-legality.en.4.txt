LAS VEGAS, Nev. â€” Internet fantasy sports has hit it big.

In fantasy sports, people pay money. They pick real players from different sports teams. Then they make up their own team with their favorite players. It is a fantasy sports team.

The fantasy teams play against each other. People win money based on how well the real players do.

## Most Gambling In U.S. Is Illegal

Jim Leach was a lawmaker in Washington, D.C. He says fantasy sports are gambling. In America, most gambling is against the law.

Leach should know. He wrote a 2006 law. It made most Internet gambling against the law. Gambling is when a person bets money on a game. The law allowed fantasy sports, though.

At the time, hardly anyone played fantasy sports. Leach said lawmakers did not know it would become so popular.

## Websites Must Still Follow Other Laws

Leach's law was supposed to stop gambling on the Internet. It was not supposed to encourage it.

The fantasy sports websites say that Leach's law gives them the go-ahead. The two biggest sites are FanDuel and DraftKings. They say they offer games of skill. They do not call these games gambling. Leach said the sites still must follow other laws. These could stop online fantasy sports.

Just five states outlaw fantasy sports. The sites say they can be in business in every other state. The sites think Leach's law allows this.

## Games Of Skill, Or Gambling?

Every day people bet millions of dollars in fantasy sports. Leach said they are not games of skill at all. In a game of skill, a person has to be good at it. Instead, he says fantasy games are gambling. He says they are just luck.

Fantasy sports have been in the news. Last week, a DraftKings worker won $350,000 on FanDuel. People think it might not be fair. People also are complaining about fantasy sports ads. They say that fantasy players can win millions of dollars. Most people do not win that much money.

The sites have become important in the sports world. Major League Baseball owns part of DraftKings. National Football League teams have deals with DraftKings and FanDuel.

Leach said people can make up their own minds. They should decide if America is better off with or without gambling.

**UPDATE:** Nevada regulators ordered daily fantasy sports sites like DraftKings and FanDuel to shut down last Thursday. They say the sites cannot operate in the state without a gambling license.
