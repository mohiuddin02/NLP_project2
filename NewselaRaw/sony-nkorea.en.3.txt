WASHINGTON â€” Last month, Sony Pictures Entertainment's computer system came under attack. Using computer code, intruders got inside the movie studio's computer system and caused a lot of damage. Such computer attackers are called hackers. When they attack computers it is known as a cyber attack.

The unknown hackers demanded that Sony not release its film "The Interview." They also issued a threat: If the film was released, movie theaters that showed it would be destroyed.

"The Interview" was already attracting attention before the cyber attack. North Korea has strongly objected to the film, which involves the make-believe assassination of its leader, Kim Jong-un.

## Choices Seem Limited

Experts now say the cyber attack seems likely to have been led by North Korea. On Thursday, U.S. government officials were scrambling to figure out how they should respond.

Right now their choices seem limited. In part this is because the United States is already punishing North Korea for trying to develop nuclear weapons. The punishments that are already in place are known as sanctions. They make it difficult for North Korea to buy from and sell to other countries, and for North Koreans to travel.

"How do you sanction the world's most heavily sanctioned country?" asked Asia expert John Park.

The hackers who broke into Sony Pictures' computers caused tens of millions of dollars in damage. They destroyed valuable files and leaked five unreleased movies. They also exposed private information about actors and workers at Sony.

In response to the threat against movie theaters, Sony canceled the release of "The Interview." The film is a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. In the movie, their characters are asked by U.S. spies to set out and kill Kim Jong-un.

## A Useful Tool For North Korea

The U.S. government hasn't officially said that North Korea was involved in the attack. In part this is because it is unwilling to say what proof it does have. The government does not want North Korea to know how closely its computer systems are being watched by the United States.

The government may respond to last month's attack by mounting a cyber counterattack. Hackers working for the U.S. military could be used to shut down the computers that launched the attack on Sony. However, such a counterattack would probably be done in secret and not announced.

Proving that North Korea was involved in the attack will not be easy. Experts believe the country lacks the ability to break into Sony's computers on its own. They claim the attack would have required the assistance of outside computer hackers, possibly hired for the job. North Korea might even have gotten help from unhappy Sony employees.

North Korea is an extremely poor country. Most of its citizens have no experience with computers. However, experts believe the country does have a small group of skilled hackers working for it. Computer attacks are a useful tool for North Korea, because they are inexpensive to carry out and hard to trace.

In June, North Korea called the plot of "The Interview" an "act of war." After the attack on Sony began, though, North Korea's government declared that it was not involved. Still, it praised the hacking as a noble act carried out by "supporters and sympathizers."

## History Of Hacking

North Korea has a history of going after those who criticize it. Last year, North Korea was blamed for several cyber attacks on South Korea.

The attack on Sony was very similar to the cyber attacks on South Korea, said South Korean computer expert Kim Seung-joo. He believes that proves North Korea was responsible for the latest attack.

President Barack Obama said that the attack against Sony is alarming. It shows that the United States must do more to keep its computer systems safe.

Obama said the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) should know more about the cyber attack soon. He added that the United States will be working hard to prevent new attacks.

People need not be too worried in the meantime, though, he said.

His advice for Americans, the president said, "would be that people go to the movies."
