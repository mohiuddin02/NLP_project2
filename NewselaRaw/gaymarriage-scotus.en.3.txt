WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for gay people to get married in 11 states.

On Monday, the head of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, began the court's new term. He did not say a word on the issue of same-sex marriage. His silence means that smaller courts' decisions to allow same-sex marriages in five states will be legal. The states are Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. Each of these states has tried to prevent gay people from getting married there.

The five states had asked the Supreme Court to override the decisions of lower courts. The lower courts had said the states can't treat gay people unfairly and must let them get married like anyone else.

The Supreme Court decided not to hear the cases trying to challenge the rulings that gay marriage should be legal. Therefore, the lower courts' rulings will stand. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. Its decisions cannot be challenged in court.

## Group Says Court Should "Finish The Job"

Same-sex couples in six other states should be able to get married soon. The states are Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming. All of these states tried to ban same-sex marriage. In each case, federal appeals court judges ruled that the states could not do that.

Same-sex marriage is still not legal in every state across the country. Same-sex marriage is when a man marries a man or a woman marries a woman. Still, the court's decision means that same-sex marriage is now legal in 30 states, and also the District of Columbia.

Neither side is completely happy with the Supreme Court, though.

Evan Wolfson is the president of Freedom to Marry. The group is in favor of same-sex marriage. He said the Supreme Court should "finish the job" and make same-sex marriage legal in every state. Wolfson said it's unfair that gay people are allowed to marry in some states but not in others. He called it harmful and insulting that so many couples are not allowed to get married because they are gay.

Ed Whelan is with the Ethics and Public Policy Center. The group is against same-sex marriage. He criticized the Supreme Court and said it was not acting responsibly. Whelan also thinks that Supreme Court should have heard the same-sex marriage appeals.  Whelan said that so many states allow same-sex marriage that the court will a hard time stopping it.

## Order's Effect Already Felt

The situation was changing rapidly Monday in many states.

— In Virginia, same-sex couples could get marriage licenses as early as Monday afternoon.

— In North Carolina, lawyers planned to ask a judge to allow same-sex marriages.

— In Oklahoma, same-sex couples will receive permission to marry soon. The county clerk is waiting until he receives an order from a federal judge.

Both sides had expected the justices to decide gay marriage cases.

They argue that high court justices should settle an issue that is so important to the nation. They don't think the court should have left the decision to lower court judges.

For the Supreme Court to hear an appeals case, four of the nine justices must vote to take it up. However, a majority of at least five justices must agree to reach a decision. It is not known how many justices voted to hear the gay marriage case.

There are two groups on the court who tend to vote the same way. Each group has four justices. Justice Anthony Kennedy is more or less in the middle. It seemed that neither group wanted to deal with gay marriage now. It also may be that Kennedy did not want to make a decision. He would likely be the tie-breaker.
