Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, California, typically bustles this time of year as workers prepare to haul in millions of pounds of Dungeness crab. The crustaceans are a tradition at Thanksgiving and other holiday meals.

But crab pots are sitting empty and boats are idled as fishermen anxiously wait for California authorities to give them the go-ahead.

California delayed the Nov. 15 beginning of its commercial crab season after finding dangerous levels of a toxin in crabs. Officials in Oregon and Washington state are testing crab samples and will decide soon whether to open its crab season by Dec. 1 as planned.

A massive bloom of microscopic algae in the Pacific Ocean is threatening the crab industry during a time when many fishermen earn the most money. The algae produces a natural toxin called domoic acid, which is harmful to wildlife and fish â€” as well as marine ecosystems.

## Holiday Crab Is Key To Profits

A closure along the entire West Coast would be a blow to the industry, which harvested nearly $170 million worth of Dungeness crab in 2014.

"Everybody is counting on crab to make it, so this is pretty disappointing," said Larry Collins, president of the San Francisco Crab Boat Owners Association. "Whenever they test clean, we'll go get them. I'm very hopeful that it's sooner than later."

Experts say that warm water set up the toxic algae bloom. Although not caused by climate change, it does offer a picture of what's to come as ocean temperatures are expected to warm up. Already, warmer ocean temperatures off New England have shaken up fisheries there. It has contributed to the collapse of the region's cod fishing and the shift northward of the lobster population, studies have found.

"I don't have a crystal ball, but I think we're being given a warning here," said Vera Trainer, who manages the marine biotoxin program at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, Washington. "We're being shown what the future is going to look like. This is more of what we can expect."

## Razor Clams Are Out Of The Picture Too

Razor clams, for now, have been taken off menus in Oregon and Washington. Fishermen were banned from digging for clams after dangerous levels of domoic acid were found in them. Those closures have led to tourists spending $22 million less, said Dan Ayres, coastal shellfish manager for the Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife.

Crabbing was also closed along parts of the Washington coast over the summer.

Matt Hunter, a shellfish expert with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, said crabbing is huge in the state and that any closure will have a "trickle-down effect on the economy," hurting other businesses in the state and "not only on the coastal communities."

Crab can still be found in many restaurants and stores, including San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, and health officials say crabs sold in stores are safe to eat. Some crab on the market now may have been harvested months ago and frozen for later; commercial crab fishing is currently open in some parts of Alaska, Oregon and Puget Sound.

## Hoping For Best But Ready For Disappointment

In California, crab fishermen are bracing for a tough season.

"Needless to say, this is devastating," said Steve Fitz, who owns Mr. Morgan Fisheries in Half Moon Bay. Crab sales make up much of the annual income for many in the fishing community, he said. Still, he is optimistic that toxin levels will go down and the season will open soon.

Restaurants and customers say they will adjust their habits.

"It's a disappointment because we really look forward to it every November," said Matt Watson, manager of Woodhouse Fish Co. in San Francisco. Watson said the company will do its best to buy whole crab at a reasonable price from other states.

Kris Ducker, who grew up in California, looks forward to her family's holiday tradition of eating crab served ice cold, with a side of sourdough bread. Even though she now lives in Texas, she still tries to find fresh Dungeness crab.

"We're looking forward to having Dungeness crab for Christmas Eve. We could move on to something else. It wouldn't kill us, but we would be sad," she said.

Scientists say the warm waters that led to the massive toxic algae bloom off the West Coast this year is probably short term.

## A Sign Of Changes To Come

"Whether this warming itself is a direct function of climate change or not, we can't say," said Mark Wells, an oceanography professor in the School of Marine Sciences at the University of Maine. However, the climate change models forecast warming along the coastlines over the next several decades. "This type of event probably is going to become much more frequent in the future," he said.

On the Northeast coast, marine species have moved to different areas because of the warmer waters, which has changed what is caught and where.

"We see lots of shifting going on," said Richard Merrick, chief science adviser to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, a government agency. Large fish populations have been moving northward and deeper into cooler waters along the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, he noted. The New England cod fish industry collapsed but haddock fishing has gone up as fishermen switched from cod, he said.

Another study found that warming seas will likely send West Coast fish species northward by about 20 miles a decade. Likewise, some species probably will disappear from southern ranges off California and Oregon.
