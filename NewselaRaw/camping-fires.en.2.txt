SAN JOSE, Calif. — Happiness is right around the corner.

That's the message posted on the Facebook page of San Jose Family Camp near Yosemite National Park. The camp was partly burned in a huge wildfire last summer. But the camp will be ready for returning campers when it opens for the season on Friday.

In many ways, though, happiness is only a dream for the camp next door, called Berkeley Tuolumne Family camp. Instead of hopeful messages of happiness, the Berkeley camp's Facebook page is now a memorial site.

This summer, the Berkeley camp is moving to a temporary site high in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Last August, its beloved camp near Yosemite was destroyed by the same raging fire that threatened the San Jose camp.

## Region's Biggest Wildfire

The Rim Fire was the biggest wildfire in the Sierra Nevadas' history. It destroyed more than 400 square miles — almost as large an area as San Antonio, Texas, — before it was extinguished in early September. The blaze also wiped out the heart of Berkeley camp, built by the city in 1922. No one was hurt. But the fire destroyed the dining hall with the stone fireplace and the outdoor theater where talent shows and musicals were performed under the stars. The fire also burned the "Green Chair Circle" that campers enjoyed on lazy afternoons.

"It's like your home burning down," said Scott Gelfand, 55. Gelfand hadn't missed a year at Tuolumne Family Camp for 29 years since he worked his first summer there. He has been bringing his family there ever since. "The memories are so deep and so important and so loving and so family- and community-oriented, I think most people are still in shock."

Until the camp is rebuilt, the city is inviting campers to a second, smaller youth camp a mile from Echo Lake near Lake Tahoe. It is called Sierra Family Camp. Located at a higher altitude, Sierra Family Camp is windier and colder at night. It can accommodate only about half the campers, who will have to eat meals in shifts. Hardest of all? It has a swimming pool instead of a river.

Rikki Moreno has mixed feelings. She's been camp nurse for six years and took her two young children to Tuolumne Camp for a week every summer. She plans to try the new camp this year.

## Threat Of Another Fire

"It's like everything's been shaken underneath us. We're super-excited, but it's kind of scary," said Moreno. Her daughters are at the prime camper ages of 7 and 9. "While my kids know the camp is burned, it's going to be a very different experience to show up at camp but have it not be camp."

In the midst of an extreme drought, the threat of fire is severe again this summer. But that's something that, as Moreno puts it, "I just can't ... I can't think about it."

Cal Fire, California's Department of Fire and Forest Protection,  has hired extra firefighters as it gets ready for summer. San Jose Family Camp is as ready as it can be.

"There's always a chance for another fire," camp manager Jena Sorrells said. "We can't sit and worry too much, but we can do a lot of prevention."

In the meadow, the trees have been trimmed way back and brush hauled away. It's here that Cal Fire stationed its trucks to battle last summer's fire. Unlike the heavily wooded and harder-to-access Berkeley camp, the big open meadow at the San Jose camp was what saved it. Cal Fire was able to station its firetrucks in the meadow and battle the blaze from there.

## "No Place Like Camp"

"If you're standing in the middle of camp, you would have no idea that a fire happened," Sorrells said. "We're so lucky to have what we have. But they've got nothing left."

Scott Ferris, Berkeley's head of parks and recreation, says his staff at Echo Lake will "try to recreate the Tuolumne Camp experience as best we can." In late May, volunteers spent the day making 20 green chairs for a new "Green Chair Circle."

Tears at Sierra Family Camp are sure to flow when the campers sing the campfire song they've been singing for generations: "There's no place like Camp Tuolumne, there's no spot that I would rather be."

But the show must go on, says Gelfand, who also has written and produced the staff musical.

This year, the musical will be a takeoff of "The Wizard of Oz" called "The Wizard of Echo Lake." In it, Dorothy is sad because she doesn't have a camp to go to. She meets up with a dishwasher, a cowardly maintenance guy and a recreation leader who sings, "If I only had a camp."

The characters fight the evil camper from the east who takes away their camp spirit, Gelfand said. And they find another camp with the same traditions: the circle of green chairs, the theme days and dances, the same campfire song.

It has a happy ending.

"The camp lives inside you and friendships never die," Gelfand said, "even if they get burned down."
