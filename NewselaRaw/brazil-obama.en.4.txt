WASHINGTON â€” The president of Brazil was supposed to come to Washington for a big visit next month. On Tuesday, she called it off.

President Dilma Rousseff is angry that the United States spied on her and other Brazilian officials. She made that clear when she canceled the meeting. It was another sign that Brazil and the White House are growing apart.

A White House spokesman said both sides made the decision to delay the meeting. He wanted to make it seem like it was not a big deal. But it was an insult. And it came from an important U.S. friend and business partner, Latin America's biggest country.

The White House said that Rousseff and Obama agreed it would be better to have the visit later. It could happen when the two nations were getting along better.

## Snowden Leak Sours Relations

Obama "understands and regrets" the concern in Brazil, the White House said.

A statement from the Brazilian president's office was tougher. The U.S. had not explained the spying or agreed it would stop. That's why the visit was canceled, Brazil said.

Brazil said spying was not something that countries do to their friends.

There have been three news reports in Brazil based on top secret papers since July. The information was leaked by Edward Snowden. He used to work on computers at the National Security Agency. The NSA is part of the U.S. government. One report said that the agency had intercepted communications between Rousseff and her staff. The NSA also spied on other senior officials, the report said.

Rousseff quickly blasted the eavesdropping.

## U.S. Tries To Ease Tension ...

Obama tried to make things better. He added a meeting with Rousseff to his schedule at a gathering of top countries in Russia earlier this month. He offered to address her concerns. National security adviser Susan Rice met with her Brazilian counterpart last week.

But it did not work. The two leaders spoke by phone Monday. They agreed to delay the visit. A state visit has a lot of ceremony. They did not want one issue between the countries to get all the attention, "no matter how important or challenging the issue may be," the White House said.

Snowden had already led to another canceled meeting. Only then it was Obama doing the canceling.

He had planned to meet in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month. But then Putin let Snowden stay in Russia temporarily. So Obama canceled the meeting.

But the two leaders met informally later in St. Petersburg. Both governments have since worked together. They have agreed on a plan to take away Syria's chemical weapons.

## ... But Brazil Balks Big Brother

Rousseff's was the only state visit planned for this year. It was supposed to be big for Brazil. It was seen as showing that the country was becoming more important. But Rousseff appears to have decided that scolding Washington over spying was more important to Brazilians than a sit-down in the Oval Office.

"Slapping Obama in the face, standing up to the big neighbor in the North" could make her more popular, said David Fleischer of the University of Brasilia. Rousseff faces elections next year.

"The issue of spying would have dominated the Washington visit," said Peter Hakim. He is president emeritus at the Inter-American Dialogue. The Washington group focuses on relations with Latin America. Rousseff must have also been worried that another Snowden leak could come before the meeting, he said.

Rousseff plans to speak about spying next week at the United Nations.

The cancellation could affect U.S. businesses. A big contract to sell Boeing aircraft was probably going to be discussed at the state meeting. So was letting U.S. companies work Brazilian oil fields, said Carl Meacham. He runs the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"This signals a different kind of environment for the U.S.," said Meacham.
