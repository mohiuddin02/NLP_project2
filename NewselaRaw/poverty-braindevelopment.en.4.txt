Not having enough money can be hard on children. It can make it harder to stay healthy. Healthy foods cost more money than unhealthy foods. Fruits and vegetables are expensive. As a result, some poor children do not eat enough healthy food. Not eating well makes it harder for the body to grow.

Growing up poor is hard on children in other ways, too. Being poor even makes it harder to do well in school.

## Studying Children's Brains

Scientists are trying to understand why this is. They want to know what being poor does to children. A new study looks at children's brains. It shows that being poor is bad for children's brains. Not having enough money can make it harder for the brain to fully grow. It might be one reason poor children struggle in school.

The study was done by Seth Pollak. He is a psychologist. A psychologist is someone who studies people's minds. The study included 389 people. They were between the ages of 4 and 22. Some of them came from poor families. Others came from families with more money.

Pollak looked at the brains of all the people in the study. He took pictures of their brains with an MRI scanner. An MRI scanner is a machine used by scientists and doctors. It can take pictures inside people's bodies.

## Brains Not As Fully Grown

Pollak looked at the brains of the people who grew up in poor families. Next he looked at the brains of the other people in the study. Then he compared the two groups.

The results of the study were clear. The brains of children growing up poor were different. Some parts of their brains were not as fully grown.

In other words, not having enough money can hurt children's brains. Pollak was hoping that the problem would go away when children got older. He hoped that the brains of poor children would end up looking like everyone else's. This is not what he found. The brains of people who grow up poor still look different at age 22.

## Schoolwork Can Be Harder

Pollak also looked at how the children in the study were doing in school. The poor children's brains were less fully grown. They also struggled more in school. Pollak may have found one reason why. When the brain does not grow fully, schoolwork can be harder.

Pollack has found a problem. Now he hopes he can find ways to help poor students. Free lunches or other programs might help poor children succeed.
