TOPPENISH, Wash. — In the sacred forest where the Yakama people hunt and gather food, something else is happening: outlaws are growing marijuana plants. The crop does well in the rich soil and long growing season.

A year has passed since Washington state changed the law to allow any adult to use marijuana. Before, people could only use it as medicine for an illness. State officials are about to give people permission to grow and sell what once was against the law.

But the Yakama have battled for years with problems with drugs and alcohol on their reservation. The tribe wants no part of the marijuana business.

That's why George Colby stepped up to the microphone during a loud autumn meeting with state officials who enforce laws about alcohol and drugs. He had a stern warning for anyone thinking about growing marijuana in central Washington.

## Fighting Drug And Alcohol Abuse

"The Yakama Nation will come after you," Colby promised the crowd. "And under our treaty, all we have to do is pick up the phone and call the federal government and tell you to get off of our land."

The tribe is ruled by a 158-year-old treaty that bans strong alcohol on its land. But almost every family has had relatives who had problems with alcohol.

Yakama Chairman Harry Smiskin wrote an opinion article about marijuana. He wrote that the Yakama people do not want anyone to use, grow, or sell marijuana on their land. "We have had a long and unpleasant history with marijuana — just as we have had with alcohol. We fight them both on our lands."

Concern about drugs and alcohol dates from at least the 19th century, when the Yakama signed the Treaty of 1855. The treaty is important to the tribe. It is celebrated every summer with two parades, a powwow, a rodeo and a royal court.

Under the treaty, the Yakama reservation consists of just over a million acres; the tribe gave up more than 12 million acres to the federal government. But it retained the right to fish, hunt and gather traditional foods there, and to not allow strong alcohol. The tribe's law, which is different from the treaty, also does not allow marijuana on the land.

But what happens now that the laws about the drug have changed in the state?

Brian Frederickson works with the Yakama Nation tribal police force. He soars above the reservation in a helicopter to look for people growing marijuana. Each year, his team catches more and more. But each year his job gets harder as the growers find new ways to hide the crop.

## "You Have To Let People Know"

Frederickson said he was against allowing the use of marijuana. He has worked so hard to get rid of it in his area.

Drinking alcohol has hurt a lot of people here, said Frederickson. He doesn't understand why people don't think marijuana will hurt people too. They had problems when there was just one legal substance, alcohol.  "Now we have two to deal with," he said.

Eleanor Davis had a reason to vote against changing the laws on marijuana. She's a tribal leader and spent 20 years counseling young men and women with drug and alcohol problems.

Davis, 67, comes from "five or six generations of alcoholism." It's easier to count up family members who aren't addicted than the ones who are still struggling. The list of people she's lost includes her 23-year-old daughter, who died of alcohol poisoning. And it includes her dead daughter's 21-year-old son.

The grandson, whose Indian name was Kush-a, got drunk and drove his car after a party five years ago. A small white cross marks the place on the highway where he died in a car accident.

Davis, who quit alcohol 27 years ago, remembered what her grandmother said after Kush-a passed away. "You have to go out in the community, and you have to let people know," she said.

About alcohol. And now about marijuana. Because buying it will now be as easy as it is to buy beer. "It's just going to create more damage to our people," she said.
