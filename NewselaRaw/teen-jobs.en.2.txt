During the study, teens were selected to participate in a jobs program for eight weeks. The youths who were offered jobs were arrested for violent crimes 43 percent fewer times than their peers. And it was not simply because employed teens were too busy to break the law.

For a year after the program ended, the teens still committed fewer violent crimes.

Sara Heller, a professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania, led the study. Her findings were published last week in the magazine Science. Most of the teenagers participating in the study were from lower-income families. About one-fifth of the teens had been arrested in the past.

## Results Are "Surprising And Exciting"

The study took place in Chicago and the city government worked with researchers to run the project. Heller said it is not immediately clear why the summer jobs have such a long-lasting positive effect on the participants.

One reason may be that the teenagers learned "soft skills" on the job. The teens learned skills such as conflict resolution and self-control. Each participant was paired with an adult who provided advice and support. The adults may have helped teach the teens these important skills. Heller called the results from the study "surprising and really exciting."

"We don't have a lot of success stories for reducing violence among disadvantaged youths," she said.

The study stands out. There is not a lot of other evidence out there that shows that teen job programs can decrease crime rates, according to Dan Bloom. He works at a New York anti-poverty research group called MDRC. The few programs that have been found to lower crime rates typically gave the participants housing and are more expensive.

## More Information To Work With

The Chicago program was called One Summer Plus and cost less than $3,000 per teenager. The money went toward the teen's wages, paying for the mentors and costs of running the program. The teens were paid $8.25 an hour, the minimum wage in Illinois, for 25 hours of work every week.

Evelyn Diaz is commissioner of Chicago's Department of Family and Support Services. She said that most programs that are as inexpensive and short as the One Summer Plus project do not have such long-lasting effects.

Bloom, who researches different types of programs, was not involved with the Chicago project. However, he said that Heller's study was designed well and the findings are important. Bloom said this study gives researchers a lot more information about teen employment than they knew before.

The study followed 730 teenagers who were picked at random from 1,634 teens. During the eight weeks the chosen teens were employed, the number of arrests in that group was slightly lower than the rate among the 904 other teenagers. After the jobs were over, the selected teens were arrested even less than other youths.

## Teens Take On Responsibilities

Heller said it was too soon to be certain whether the program was a good use of money. Researchers will need to collect long-term information on employment. It will take time. Still, Heller said there are other types of evidence to look at that could prove the program is working, such as reduced costs for the justice system and less suffering by victims of violent crimes.

The news was not all good, however. While the jobs program may have reduced the number of violent crime arrests, it did not appear to affect how many nonviolent crimes were committed. Heller said that the soft skills that teens learned during One Summer Plus might not have helped them resolve nonviolent offenses.

Teens in the study held many different types of jobs, including serving as a day-camp counselor, cleaning empty lots, planting community gardens, and performing office work for companies and government offices. Some of the responsibilities teens had at office jobs were not always the most exciting tasks, like paper-shredding.

"We explained that everybody's first job is a horrible job," Diaz said. "You've got to do some of that."

The program assigned one adult mentor to every 10 teenagers. The adults were available to give advice at all times of the day.

"Lots of people will write off teenagers, especially if they've already gotten in trouble with the law," Diaz said. "We don't give up on any child."
