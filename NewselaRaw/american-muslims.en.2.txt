WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last month, gunmen carried out a wave of attacks in Paris, France, which left at least 132 dead and more than 400 injured. A week later, Lena Badr Abdelhamid's husband sat her down and warned her that the top suspect in the attack happened to have the same name as them. Even the spelling of the man's name, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was the same.

Abdelhamid worries she might be targeted just because she shares a name and a religion with a suspected terrorist.

## Hate Crimes "Sure To Follow"

"I wonder often how long will we have to pay for crimes that we haven't committed. I immediately began to dread the hate crimes that were sure to follow," said Abdelhamid, 25, who is Muslim. A hate crime is an attack against a person because of his or her race or religion.

After the attacks, some people around the world expressed hatred toward Muslims, frightening Muslims in the United States. Some women say they face a difficult decision over whether to remove their headscarves. Some Muslim women wear the scarves out of modesty. Students avoid walking across campus alone.

For older Muslims, it reminds them of days after the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, which were carried out by Muslim extremists. They recall the hateful voicemails, vandalized mosques and insults shouted at the grocery store. Members of a younger generation do not remember that era. However, they live in a different one where social media is full hate speech against Muslims.

## Things Get More Tense

Things have gotten even more tense for U.S. Muslims. A Muslim couple in California went on a shooting rampage, killing 14 people and wounding 21 others. The couple died in a shootout with police. Before they went on their killing spree, the woman made a Facebook post pledging allegiance to the extremist group Islamic State. The Islamic State is trying to set up its own country governed by extreme Islamic law that almost all Muslims oppose. Its fighters have taken over parts of Iraq and Syria and carried out the Paris attacks.

Aysha Khan, a Muslim woman who lives in Maryland, said she is been upset over the years to see anti-Muslim crimes grow more frequent. These attacks are fueled by anger over extremist groups such the Islamic State.

## Anti-Muslim Attacks On The Rise

This week, Khan called her parents to tell them about a job interview that would require her to travel from Baltimore to Washington. Her father warned against taking the subway and offered to drive her. She refused.

"Ordinarily, I would feel like they were being paranoid, but they are actually not," she said.

Muslim advocacy groups say she is correct.

The FBI said that only anti-Muslim incidents are on the rise; incidents involving other minorities declined in 2014. The number of anti-Muslim incidents rose from 135 in 2013 to 154 in 2014, according to the FBI's figures. Advocacy groups consider them on the low side because they say many more incidents go unreported. That number is expected to increase this year, as attacks by the Islamic State and other extremists fuel anti-Muslim feelings.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has keeps track of apparent revenge attacks. They include terror threats and attacks on mosques. In one, a Canadian mosque was set on fire. The group also recorded shots fired at a Muslim family's home in Florida, anti-Muslim hate graffiti and countless hate messages.

## Some Shows Of Support

Muslims say they have been grateful to non-Muslims who have offered their support in phone calls, religious services and emails. The story of Jack Swanson went viral. The Texas boy donated the piggy-bank money he was saving for an iPad to a mosque that was vandalized in Pflugerville, Texas. Arsalan Iftikhar, a prominent Muslim magazine editor and human rights lawyer, mailed Jack an iPad with a note of thanks. It was signed, "Love, The American Muslim Community."

At the same time, some politicians want to let only Christians refugees into the United States and require all Muslims to register with the government. Badi Ali is the imam of a mosque in Greensboro, North Carolina. He said he tells nervous members to avoid attracting attention.

"You have to become like the palm tree. When the wind comes, you have to bow down a little bit until the wind goes away," Ali said.

## "Here We Go Again"

After terror attacks, many American Muslim groups hold a news conference or go on television. They emphasize that Islam is a peaceful, tolerant religion.

But that approach is not good enough anymore for many young Muslims. They argue that the Muslim community should not condemn deadly attacks as Muslims. It only reinforces the idea that there is something in common between Muslim extremists and ordinary believers, they say. They want to condemn the attacks as Americans, as human beings. They say the Muslim community should not go out of its way to "apologize" for behavior that is completely against what they stand for. 

"I saw an immediate trend of Muslims condemning the terrorist attacks," said Uzma Hussain, who lives in Maryland. "Here we go again, guilty until proven innocent." She said Muslims might as well sign a document stating they are not terrorists.
