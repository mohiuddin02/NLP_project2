WASHINGTON â€” National and state parks will be open for business this summer, but it won't be business as usual. Washington is cutting its budget for parks. States will be contributing fewer dollars as well. The result will be overflowing trash cans, closed visitor centers and fewer Junior Ranger programs. Many vacationers will walk over runaway vines, wait in long lines at park entrances and miss out on campfire talks.

Visitors will notice the spending cuts at some of the nation's most loved natural and historic sites.

State parks attract more than 741 million visitors a year. Many had to cut staff and shorten hours back in 2008-2009 when the recession caused intense money problems across the country. In states that are still struggling, those cuts have not been reversed. Meanwhile, automatic budget cuts went into effect March 1. These cuts forced the National Park Service to trim its budget 5 percent. It also cut 5 percent from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which helps states pay for their state parks.

Overall, the federal cuts will take away about $150 million from the National Park Service. Some 401 national parks, monuments, battlefields, historic sites, seashores and other national sites could all be affected. The Park Service has put hiring on hold. It will leave 900 jobs unfilled. In a normal summer, the Park Service hires an additional 10,000 people to handle the larger crowds. But this year, it will reduce that number by 1,000. Fewer workers means less frequent mowing, sand-covered bike paths, messier restrooms and fewer tours.

## Private Donors Help Some State Parks

State parks have been tightening their belts for several years, but some are in better shape than others.

In some states, donations have made a difference. California was able to keep open all of its state beaches, reserves and parks, thanks in part to more than $3 million raised by donors.

Even with the donations, California's state parks must cut back on maintenance and reduce park hours. Five hundred fewer rangers, scientists and other workers will be on the job, said Roy Stearns, a state parks spokesman.

In Washington state's 117 parks, there will be fewer workers, shorter hours and fewer guided tours, Virginia Painter, of the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission, said. Some park maintenance and repairs will be delayed. A new entrance fee has brought in only about half of the money that was expected. The park system has had to make other cuts to make do with the smaller budget.

The conditions at national parks also will vary. At Grand Canyon National Park, for example, the visitor center will open an hour later and close an hour earlier.  Fewer entrance workers will lead to longer lines at the gates. "We have said for a long time we'll continue to do more with less. We're beyond that. We're going to do less with less," park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said.

## Nearby Towns Hurt By Park Cutbacks

National parks in 2011 brought $13 billion in visitor spending to their nearby communities, a study  found. Park tourism creates 162,400 local jobs, the same study found

When Yellowstone National Park officials announced they would wait an extra two weeks to open two snowy park entrances, local businesses came to the rescue. The towns of Cody and Jackson take in $334 million a year from 3.6 million Yellowstone visitors. The towns figured the two-week closure could cost them as much as $4 million in lost hotel, restaurant and other spending. Businesses raised $175,000 for snowplowing to open the roads on time.

After the snowplow savings, Yellowstone was still short $1.75 million. It met the gap by cutting jobs. Visitors at the sprawling park probably won't notice, said spokesman Dan Hottle.

Yosemite National Park is coping with its $1.8 million budget cut by leaving about 20 jobs unfilled, said park spokesman Scott Gediman. Visitor centers will close an hour earlier, at 5 p.m. There will be no rangers in Mariposa Grove to leading walks amid the towering sequoia trees.

## A Quiet Fourth Of July In Washington, D.C.

The Fourth of July will be a more muted affair on the National Mall. The popular Washington Monument concert will be canceled. The mountains of litter will take longer to collect, due to cuts in cleanup-crew overtime.

Other national parks around the country also have had to make budget-related changes: At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, a $1.2 million cut means that six buildings will be closed. Visitors will not be able to visit the site where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. The Liberty Bell and Independence Hall are canceling evening visitor hours.

The Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida and Mississippi must deal with a $359,000 cut. It plans to shut three visitor centers a few days each week and close some restrooms. Most trash cans are history, replaced by a take-out-your-own-garbage policy.

The Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky has absorbed a $324,000 cut by leaving four jobs unfilled. It will have no park electrician. Long response times for any electric problem deep in the cave means that tours to the deepest sections will be canceled. Last year, 28,000 visitors toured those parts of the cave.

Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming is facing a $700,000 budget cut. The park has canceled Junior Ranger programs and reduced campfire programs and guided walks. Waits could be longer for medical help and rescue searches, said spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs. It also had to close some backcountry areas. "We've already started hearing from the people who go there, people who have their beloved secret places," she said.
