SANTA MONICA, Calif. â€” The Weiser family grows fruits and vegetables. Right now they don't have many vegetables to sell at the farmers market.

It was a very different picture a couple of stands away. There were cherries and apricots. There were even peaches and nectarines.

That tells the story of California's fruit and vegetable business.

Fruit has been ready to pick early this year. At the same time, there are not enough of some vegetables. The problem has caused much higher prices than usual.

Sometimes fruits and vegetables are hard to find. Then people pay more for them. Other times, there are too many fruits and vegetables. Then they become cheaper. Farmers sell them cheaply so they will not go bad.

## Lettuce At Twice The Usual Price

In California, farmers are selling their lettuces for twice as much as usual. Cauliflower has doubled in price since February.

Part of the reason is four years of little rain. The winters have also been too warm. For shoppers, it means less salad and more fruit.

Warm weather makes plants grow faster. It also makes fruit ripen earlier.

## Crops Grow Faster In Warm Weather

Farmers plan when they plant. They want to make sure there are fruits and vegetables all year. They want one crop to be ready to pick just as another one has been picked.

The warm weather has messed this up.

For the Weiser family, their flowers bloomed a month too soon. The same thing was true of other crops, like carrots.

On the other hand, summer will come early. The Weisers planted melons three weeks earlier. The melons will be ripe in a couple of weeks.

Mark McBride is with Coastline Family Farms in California. The farm has been weeks ahead of schedule. For the next few weeks, he will have little to sell.

## Cheaper Cherries In May

The situation is better for fruit lovers.

The cherry harvest started three weeks early. Usually, farmers start picking cherries in May. Cherry prices have gone down. The cherries were a dollar a pound cheaper than last year.

Walter Manzke is a famous cook in California. Recently, he visited a farmers market. He pulled a cart. It was piled high with vegetables and fruits.

Manzke usually does not like buying nectarines in May. This year, the nectarines have a lot of flavor.

"When it's good, it's good," Manzke said.
