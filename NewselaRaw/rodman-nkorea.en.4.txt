PYONGYANG, North Korea â€” The country of North Korea is cut-off from most of the world and very few foreigners visit. That's why Dennis Rodman's arrival in the capital city Monday was rare.

Rodman and several other former NBA players were there to play basketball. The game will be a "birthday present" to Kim Jong Un. Kim is the North Korean leader. He is one of Rodman's most unlikely fans.

Rodman's team has ex-All Stars Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson and Vin Baker. They will play against a team of North Koreans. The game will be on Wednesday. That is believed to be Kim's birthday. The team also includes Eric "Sleepy" Floyd, Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith, who played for the New York Knicks. Four streetballers are also on the team.

Rodman told The Associated Press he was glad to be in North Korea. He also said people have threatened to kill him for his repeated visits. Money from the game will go to help deaf people in North Korea.

## Rodman's Friendship With Kim

"The marshal is actually trying to change this country in a great way," Rodman said of Kim. "Marshal" is the leader's official title. "I think that people thought that this was a joke, and Dennis Rodman is just doing this because fame and fortune." Instead, he sees the game as a "birthday present" for Kim and his country.

"Just to even have us here, it's an awesome feeling. I want these guys here to show the world, and speak about North Korea in a great light," he said. "I hope people will have a different view about North Korea."

Rodman has a surprising friendship with Kim. The North Korean leader rarely meets with foreigners. Very little is known about him outside of his country. Rodman is the highest-profile American to meet Kim since the leader inherited power after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in late 2011.

Rodman traveled to North Korea for the first time last February. He went with the Harlem Globetrotters for an HBO series. After spending time together, Rodman called Kim a "friend for life." Rodman came back just before Christmas to hold tryouts for the North Korean basketball team. But he did not meet with Kim then.

The Hall of Fame basketball player has been given special treatment on each of his trips. But visiting North Korea for any American is very tricky. To keep the game itself friendly, the two sides will only play against each other in the first half. They will mix together in the second half.

Americans are seen as enemies in North Korea. In the 1950s the two countries were at war. But they never signed a peace treaty to officially end it. Thousands of U.S. troops are still based in South Korea. The North's nuclear weapons also make the situation delicate. It has said it would use them if a war breaks out with the United States or South Korea.

## American Missionary Being Held

Rodman has been criticized for other things too. He has not tried to use his friendship with Kim to get Kenneth Bae released. Bae is an American missionary with health problems. He is being held in North Korea on charges of committing "anti-state" crimes.

Rodman, however, says none of that is his concern.

"I'm not a president, I'm not a politician, I'm not an ambassador," he said before arriving. "I'm just an athlete and the reason for me to go is to bring peace to the world, that's it. That's all I want, no money. I want no money, no money."

Charles D. Smith also spoke about the game. He said he hopes it will lead to better understanding between the two countries.

"It's new being here," but the idea of such a game isn't, Smith said. "The team is made up of a lot of guys who really care, that's the most important. It's not about bringing dream-teamers. It's about guys who are coming that want to be a part of this, that care, and really that care about humanity."
