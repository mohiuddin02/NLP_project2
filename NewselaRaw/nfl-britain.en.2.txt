LONDON — The National Football League (NFL) may soon have a new football team — based in London, England. The team would be treated like any other in the league. It would play against U.S.-based teams and might even host a Super Bowl.

According to a study released Wednesday, such a team could be very good for the British economy. It would likely generate more than $250 million a year for Britain.

However, the study also suggests that it might be difficult to host a successful Super Bowl in the British capital. It warns that American football fans could react negatively to the idea of their Super Bowl in London.

The idea of permanently basing a team in London has been growing since the NFL first brought regular-season games to the city in 2007. The games in Britain are part of the NFL's International Series, and feature U.S. teams. So far this season, there have been two games held at London's Wembley Stadium. The third and final game will be next Sunday.

## Fans Would Bring Spending Money To Britain

The benefits of a new London team could be significant. If the team hosts eight home games a season, the study predicts, the city could see $165 million in increased profits. This money would mainly come from fans buying things like food and merchandise, and staying in hotels.

The study also considered what people might spend on football outside the capital, such as travel to the games or merchandise. With that added in, the boost from having a British NFL team is even larger. Throughout Britain as a whole, the study concluded that a London team would generate $252 million in profits per season.

Overall, the study views the idea of a new London team favorably, but it does raise doubts about Wembley hosting the Super Bowl.

## Time Zone Troubles

One big problem with holding a Super Bowl in London would be the difficulty of selecting a suitable kickoff time. If it started when it was 4 p.m. on the East Coast in the United States, that would mean it was 9 p.m. in London. The game would finish very late, which would make getting home from Wembley challenging on a Sunday night. A 6 p.m. local-time kickoff, the study says, would "be unlikely to attract the desired television audience in the U.S.," where it would be 10 a.m. on the West Coast.

The study also predicts that many die-hard fans in the United States would be unable to travel to London. It cautions that the atmosphere inside the stadium and on television could be affected by their absence. Lower game attendance and a drop in crowd enthusiasm could hurt football's international image.

## Money Weighs In

In addition, the study says, NFL fans in the United States could be angered by the idea of moving something as American as the Super Bowl overseas. They might believe that the only reason the NFL wanted to host it there was to make more money.

Adding a new London team is not the only way the NFL can bring increased profits to Britain, the study claims. If the NFL instead chose to increase the number of International Series games held in London, the city would still benefit greatly.

The two games held in 2013 generated $52 million for London, the study says. A switch to four games a year would likely bring an additional $42 million in profits, bringing the total to some $94 million.
