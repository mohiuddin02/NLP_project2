Imagine a city where 1 out of every 3 children is poor. One out of every 10 adults cannot find a job. Imagine a place where 4 out of 10 students never finish high school. What do you think happens to them? Their future is not very bright.

That was New Haven, Connecticut, just a few years ago. Many of New Haven's youths had no way out of poverty. They looked ahead to their future and saw no opportunities. They knew they could not afford to go to college. This was especially hard to accept because Yale University is right in the middle of New Haven. Yale is one of the best colleges in the world.  Yale graduates go on to become U.S. presidents and senators.

## A Big Plan

Then things began to change. New Haven's mayor and other leaders decided to do something about the problem. They heard about a program in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that paid for college for high school students. It was working there, so why not in New Haven?

They called it New Haven Promise. The program would pay college tuition for all high school graduates who qualified. That was three years ago. Now, 7 out of 10 high school students are graduating.

Even the poorest New Haven students have a chance to go to college. Yale University is paying for the program.

## A City In Search Of A Makeover

New Haven is like so many other cities in the Northeast and Midwest. It has serious money problems and many unemployed people. New Haven used to have factories where people worked. They did not need special skills or a college education to work there. Those factories are gone now.  New companies have come that need skilled workers with more education. New Haven youth want those jobs, but they do not have the education or the skills. Many do not have the money to get the training they need.

That is where New Haven Promise comes in.  It will make a difference by paying for college.

## A Two-Way Promise

New Haven Promise is no one-way street. The students have to sign a pledge to "do their best." They must live in New Haven and attend New Haven public schools. They must get high grades and have excellent attendance. Their behavior must be very good. They also have to give several hours of their time to a community group.

But it turns out that providing free tuition is not always enough. Many students do not have enough support at home. They need someone to set a good example for them. They also need someone to encourage them to work hard. Otherwise, they might not stick with college.

## Teaching Success

So New Haven started another program called College Summit. The goal is to create a "culture of success," but not just in high school. It must start in kindergarten and go all the way through 12th grade. Students, teachers and parents must all be on the same page. They must all expect that every student can and will attend college. The high schools now have "college readiness" courses for their students. New Haven Promise is giving parents classes about how to apply to college.

The Promise program wants students to finish college and earn a degree. What happens if the students are not keeping their grades up? What if they do not have the study skills needed for college? New Haven wants all of its students to succeed. The city is finding ways to help and guide them all the way through college.
