LOS ANGELES — Alisha Chen is a California real estate agent. She began selling homes 10 years ago. Back then, she did not expect to work with buyers from other countries.

Today, most of Chen's customers are from China.

Chen's job takes some special skills. Her buyers come from Hong Kong, mainland China, and Taiwan. She has to know their different tastes. It helps that she was born in Taiwan.

Most of her buyers have never even been to the United States. She has to explain to them what different neighborhoods are like.

Chen also has to tell them how home buying works in this country. Many of Chen's customers run their own businesses. They are successful in their country. However, buying a home is not the same in the United States.

"In Taiwan you can still buy property on a napkin. Here, it's a book full of paperwork," she said. "There's a lot of education I have to do."

## Late-Night Phone Calls

For Chen, it means a lot of Skype Internet calls in the middle of the night. It also means some missed sleep. There is a big time difference between China and the United States.

"Eleven p.m. to 2 a.m. — that's the best time to talk," she said.

Chen lives in Irvine, California. About five years ago, she saw a business opportunity. Homes in Southern California were selling very slowly at the time. However, rich overseas Chinese were looking to buy.

Many of Chen's customers were Chinese-American. She began asking them if they knew anyone back in China who might be interested in buying a house here. She told them that good money could be made. Buyers could rent homes out and sell them for more money later on.

## Baby Steps At First

At first, overseas Chinese buyers were a little cautious, Chen said. "They'd say, 'OK, I'll buy one property.' Six months later they were amazed at how much they were getting back. They'd call and say, 'I want to buy more.'"

Today, many Chinese are interested in buying homes in Southern California. Los Angeles and areas nearby are favorite places.

Some buyers are planning to move here. Others are buying homes for their children to live in while they go to college. Others buy houses to make money.

Selling homes to overseas buyers can be complicated.

U.S. home buyers can explore the streets near a house. They can get a feel for a neighborhood. A buyer from China cannot do that. Often all they can do is look at pictures on the Internet. Many of Chen's overseas customers buy homes without ever seeing them. Chen has to spend a lot of time describing different neighborhoods.

## Changes Could Be Coming

Chen now has offices in California and Taiwan. Business has been good. However, she wonders how much longer that will last.

Both the Chinese and U.S. governments are promising changes. It could become harder for Chinese to buy U.S. homes and make money from them. If that happens buyers might not pay as much for houses.

Chen would then make less money. Her earnings are based on the price of homes she sells. She would probably have to look elsewhere for new customers.
