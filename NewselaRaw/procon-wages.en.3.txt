### PRO: Better pay for fast-food workers is important for fairness

WASHINGTON – Last November, fast-food workers began demanding higher wages and the right to join a union. By the end of August, the movement had spread to 60 cities nationwide.

The inspiring movement is led by some of the nation's poorest employees. Their cause should be supported by everyone who has a sense of fairness.

First, let's throw out some of the nonsense that people have been told about these workers. Despite what some people think, they are not mostly teenagers.

The majority of them are at least 23 years old. Only three in 10 are teenagers. More than a quarter of them are raising at least one child.

## Lack Of Good-Paying Jobs

How are they supposed to survive on about $9 an hour, which is the average wage? The lowest amount you can be paid, or the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage), is $7.25 an hour. Many of the workers make that.

Clearly, they are not just working at these jobs for a short time and then moving on to great careers. Our unstable economy does not have enough good jobs for them. In fact, nearly half of employed college graduates say their jobs do not need a college degree.

Fast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that the majority of employees have lost ground for decades: the rules of the economy have been rewritten against them.

The richest 1 percent of Americans have doubled their share of America's total income from 1980 to 2011.

They didn't double their slice of the pie because of changes in technology or because they had the most needed skills.

They did it because the link between how much a person produces and how much he or she takes home has been broken. If  wages had increased since 1968 the way they did in past decades, the lowest wage someone could take home would be $17 per hour today. Not a measly $7.25.

## "Reforms" Hurt Workers

Why are wages no longer tied to productivity? It's because most workers have lost the power to bargain with their employers. And that is a result of so-called "reforms" the government made on purpose, including:

Changes to labor law. Failure to enforce existing laws. Both made unions weaker;

Trade agreements that put American workers into competition with cheaper labor overseas;

And many other law changes that take money from the poor and give it to the rich.

These changes have left the country in a weakened state. Jobs are still scarce. Workers have even less power than before.

The protests by fast-food workers is another sign that it is time to end the 40-year-old experiment on the American worker. This kind of mass protest around wage and work issues has not been seen for a long time, perhaps since the Great Depression.

President Obama supports a higher minimum wage. Unfortunately, he didn't keep his promise to push for the Employee Free Choice Act. The act would have gone a long way to give workers the rights to form unions and ask for higher pay.

Obama and his allies just tried to drag the country into another war. They failed, because Americans showed the Congress that they were sick and tired of senseless wars. They showed lawmakers that whoever voted for another war would be held accountable. Maybe we should make these politicians understand that we are also sick and tired of a system that delivers the goods to fewer and richer people each year, and leaves tens of millions of people struggling to get by. Then we might begin to reverse some of the wrongs here at home, too.

### CON: Better pay for fast-food workers could suck the country dry of jobs

WASHINGTON – In the Middle Ages, doctors stuck blood-sucking leeches onto their patients. But the treatment did not improve their condition – far from it. It left them worse off. Raising the wages of fast-food workers to $15 an hour would produce similar results: it will hurt the ones the plan was designed to help.

In America, minimum-wage workers are better paid than the average worker in Mexico. Why? It's not because U.S. employers are more generous than their Mexican companies. Nor do Americans somehow deserve better pay.

American minimum-wage earners make more because they produce more. Better education and better-funded companies allow American workers to be more productive, raising their earnings.

Competition forces businesses to pay workers according to their productivity. If companies pay less, their employees will jump ship to competitors. And if they pay workers more than they produce, they go out of business.

## More Machines, Fewer Workers

For better or worse, fast-food jobs are relatively low-productivity positions, typically filled by inexperienced workers. Most fast-food customers want a quick, inexpensive meal. They will not regularly pay premium prices for a burger and fries.

Doubling McDonalds' wages would raise its total costs by 25 percent, meaning the company would not make any profits on its sales. But raising prices would drive customers away.

If Congress forced fast-food restaurants to pay $15 an hour, they would have to get a lot more productive to justify those higher costs. That would mean replacing current workers with machines and hiring fewer, more skilled workers to maintain them.

Restaurants could do this in a variety of ways. They could use iPad stations instead of cashiers to take orders, or install the new robotic burger flipper that makes up to 400 hamburgers an hour.

At current wages these costly, high-tech improvements make sense for only a few restaurants; if wages doubled the machines would become widespread. The end result: far fewer jobs in the fast-food industry and higher pay for those who remain.

Those who consider such a trade-off worthwhile miss the economic role of minimum-wage jobs. For most workers, they are entry-level positions where they can gain experience that makes them more productive and helps them command higher pay in their next job.

Businesses value skills like reliability, discipline and the ability to accept instructions. Fast-food jobs instill these basic skills in inexperienced workers.

## Fast Food Is Entry-Level Work

Most Americans started out in a job paying within a dollar of the minimum wage. Few stay there long. The average fast-food employee stays at his or her restaurant for less than a year. These are simply gateway jobs, the first step on a career ladder. That is why the vast majority of fast-food workers are under the age of 25.

Super-sizing fast-food wages would eliminate many of these entry-level positions, making it harder for young people to land that all-important first job and start climbing the ladder of success.

Most lawmakers and leaders recognize this. Not even the most liberal state has a minimum wage anywhere near $15 an hour. American Samoa is an example of would happen if the supporters of the "living wage" movement prevail.

The island territory used to have a separate minimum wage because of its lower incomes. However, in 2007 Congress applied the U.S. minimum wage to Samoa. For the tiny Pacific Ocean nation this was equal to $20 an hour.

It did not boost purchasing power, increase the demand for goods and services or improve the way people live. Instead, unemployment septupled. More than 35 percent of the islanders were jobless.

The Samoan economy collapsed. The islands' governor begged Congress to suspend the wage hikes, pleading: "Our job market is being torched. Our businesses are being depressed. Our hope for growth has been driven away. How much does our government expect us to suffer?"

The laws of economics are not like government laws that can be repealed, no matter how good the intentions are. Requiring dramatically higher fast-food wages would make hundreds of thousands of entry-level jobs disappear. This would no more help fast-food workers than bleeding them with leeches.
