SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. â€” Kathryn "Tubby" Johnston Massar was the first girl to play Little League baseball. Back in 1950, girls could not play with boys. Massar made herself look like a boy so she could play. She cut off her braids and tucked her hair under her cap.

Massar played more than 60 years ago. Today, two girls are playing in the same Little League World Series.

"It's truly amazing. I'm very happy to see girls playing," Massar said. She is now 78.

## Girls Give It Their Best

Mo'ne Davis plays for Philadelphia. Emma March plays for Canada. They are the 17th and 18th girls to ever play in the tournament. The World Series has been going on for 68 years. It is just the third time that two girls are playing in the same series.

Davis pitches for Philadelphia. Her team beat Nashville 4-0. She only gave up two hits.

Fans cheered loudly when Davis struck out the last batter. It made her the first girl to give up no runs in a Little League World Series game. She pitched what is called a shutout.

"It's very unreal. I never thought at the age of 13, I would be a role model," Davis said. "Hopefully, more girls play Little League."

March did not do as well.

She batted fourth and played first base. Her brother Evan batted right after her. March had no hits. Canada lost 4-3 to Mexico. The fans were still excited to see her play.

## Little League Is Changing

Massar thinks more girls will play Little League. She believes a woman will also play in Major League Baseball someday.

Massar played in Little League in 1950. When people discovered she was a girl, a new rule was made. It stopped girls from playing baseball with boys. The rule was changed in 1974.

Massar is happy about her place in history.

"It's something I'm proud of," she said. "Why not play baseball with the boys?"

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett watched Davis play. He said she seemed to handle the pressure well. He said he was wondering if she would play professional baseball one day.

"I don't know," Corbett said. "She's played as well as any kid out there right now."
