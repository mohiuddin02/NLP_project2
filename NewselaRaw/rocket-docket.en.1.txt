WASHINGTON — Florida immigration courts are increasingly swamped by children who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border on their own to escape violence back home. From the border, the children make their way more than 1,500 miles to find family members in Florida. Courts are creating "rocket dockets" to quickly decide whether they should be sent back to their turbulent homelands.

Volunteer attorneys are scrambling to prepare for as many as 50 hearings a day per judge. The lawyers will be trying to prove the children's right to become permanent residents, or at least avoid immediate deportation.

The speedy procedure stems from a rush of children fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. More than 3,000 have come to Florida this year to join family members, but they still must establish their right to remain.

Three immigration judges in Miami and two in Orlando are now focusing entirely on cases of border children who have settled in Florida. Government officials promise to give the children their day in court, but immigration advocates fear that even though justice may be swift, it will not necessarily be fair.

## Immigrant Cases Have Skyrocketed

Only three of the 25 children who appeared before one Miami judge on a recent Friday afternoon were represented by attorneys, said Lesley Mendoza. She runs the Cuban American Bar Association's free legal help program.

"The rest were expected to appear by themselves," she said. "Without speaking the language, without any knowledge and limited education, they are expected to navigate the legal system on their own. That's just wrong."

She added, "By expediting hearings and not giving them time to find an attorney, many who do have a legal right will be sent back. Being sent back for some of these kids means continuing to get raped on their way to school. For the boys, it means doing whatever a gang asks them to do, or being killed."

A similar rush is clogging the Immigration Court in Orlando. Legal-aid attorneys there are rounding up volunteer lawyers to represent large numbers of children seeking safe haven.

"A lot of children are appearing before immigration judges alone, without any legal counseling," said Camila Pachon Silva, immigration attorney for the Legal Aid Society of the Orange County Bar Association. The group is training lawyers to deal with the cases.

"We have seen a dramatic increase in the last year, but these are not the first children to come," she said. "The numbers right now have skyrocketed, but children have crossed the borders on their own ever since we've had immigration in the United States."

## Children Flee Lawless Homelands

Federal officials reported that 3,181 of the children apprehended on the border — most of them teenagers from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — had come to Florida this year as of July 7. Florida's share was the third highest, following Texas and New York, of the 30,340 who resettled with sponsors, typically family members. Dozens more are expected to arrive this month to be sheltered and placed in homes.

Under a 2008 law signed by then-President George W. Bush, unaccompanied minors cannot be removed from the country immediately. The law allows them a chance to claim they should remain because they face danger if returned to their homeland. Some of the children have become permanent residents and some have been deported.

The numbers have gradually increased to crisis proportions. Children are fleeing countries such as Honduras that have descended into lawlessness as drug trafficking escalates and violent gangs attack families, including children. Many come to Florida, home to nearly 4 million immigrants and the largest Honduran community in the nation.

"By having a special docket, you can move these cases, hopefully without stepping on anybody's rights," said Jeffrey Brauwerman, a former immigration judge and now an immigration attorney in Fort Lauderdale. "I think the judges will be pretty fair-minded. The key thing is to unclog the docket."

Florida has absorbed large inflows before — including the Mariel Boatlift, which brought 125,000 Cubans in 1980. Haitians fled to Florida in the 1980s and '90s. But rarely have immigration courts resorted to expedited proceedings, sometimes dubbed a "rocket docket," to quickly resolve cases.

"This is a major stop," Brauwerman said, "because when they come over the border, many hit the Greyhound bus and come all the way down to Miami, where there's a lot of family. Remember, we're still the gateway to the Americas."
