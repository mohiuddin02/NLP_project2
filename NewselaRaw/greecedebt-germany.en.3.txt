LONDON â€” The country of Greece has borrowed money from many countries. It now owes more than $332 billion to them.

A new report argues that Greece should get help with the money it owes. Money owed to another person or country is called debt. The report was put out by a large group that many countries are a part of. It is called the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The IMF lends money to countries when they need it. The IMF says that much of Greece's debt should be forgiven. It says countries should not make Greece pay back all the money.

Germany has loaned Greece more money than any other country. It does not want to forgive Greece's debt.

## When Germany Got Help

Yet Germany knows what forgiving debt can do. After World War II, Germany got help with its debt from its former enemies.

Who helped Germany then? Greece.

In 1953, Greece and about 20 other countries forgave much of Germany's debt. Soon Germany's economy became strong again.

It might seem strange that Germany will not forgive Greece's debt.

After World War II, the countries that won the war made a deal with Germany. The amount of money Germany owed was lowered. Germany was also given more time to pay back the other countries.

Germany was able to pay when it had the money to do so. Other countries bought things from Germany, which gave Germany money to pay its debt.

Other countries were not allowed to ask Germany to pay for the damage it caused during the war.

## Greece Wants The Same Help

Greece wants the same chance that was given to Germany.

Still, there was a big reason Germany got help. It was much more important to the world than Greece is today. After World War II, the world was a mess. The United States wanted Germany to be strong again to help stop the spread of communism to Western Europe from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

Germany also had more economic power than Greece has now. Germany made many goods and sold them to other countries. Greece does not produce and sell very much to other countries.

The deal to help Germany gave it an easy way to pay its debts. Unlike Germany, Greece has had to pay even though it has not had the money because its economy is weak.

Greece borrowed money from countries that were its friends. Now those friendships are in trouble. One reason for this is that the countries can't agree what to do about Greece's debts. Countries want all the money they are owed.

## Giving Greece More Time?

Yet now there are signs of change. On Sunday, there will be a meeting of European countries. They will try to decide how to solve the problem of Greece's debt.

The IMF report blamed the Greek government for being slow to make changes. It also said Greece's government has been spending money it does not have.

A person who works for the IMF said giving Greece more time to pay back the money could help too.

One idea is to give Greece 20 years before it has to start paying loans. After that, Greece would have 40 years to pay back all the money.
