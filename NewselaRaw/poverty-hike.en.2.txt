Cierra Schell finished her ninth day of backpacking limping down part of the Appalachian Trail, the hiking trail stretches from Maine to Georgia.

Cierra, who will be a junior at Philadelphia's High School of the Future this fall, was in misery, but so proud of it.

"This is ridiculous," she said. "I feel dirty. My feet got blisters all over but it was worth it. I reached my breaking point yesterday. I fell. I didn't want to get up, but I did it for my team. So we could reach camp and get some sleep. I felt I couldn't go on, but I pushed myself past that, and I made it."

She had never seen a mountain, much less climbed one. Nine days without a shower evolved from unthinkable to unimportant. "I don't even smell myself anymore," she said.

She hobbled into the Visitors Center at the Delaware Water Gap and dropped her 40-pound pack. Next would come the canoeing phase of her two-week adventure.

## A Summer Search For Confidence

Cierra and 19 other city juniors were recently sent into the wilderness in two groups by Summer Search. The nonprofit organization works with students in several cities. This trip was the first big step in a five-year effort to push these teens to see and achieve lives they never imagined possible.

Cierra and her group of 10 circled their packs, put hands to the middle, and together shouted, "Savages!"

"Going through the hard stuff that we went through up there, hurting ourselves, going through mental things, I felt like that was a strong word for us," said Frank King, 15, from Boys Latin school. He named the group.

"I live in a really bad neighborhood," Frank said. "Before I didn't really care for other people. But seeing people cry, and seeing the girls struggle, I liked helping them."

Frank was what the instructors called a "rock star." He emerged as a leader who worked hard to keep the group together.

Mickai Mercer, 15, melted down. "Sleeping under a tarp with four people I don't even know, it was hard for me," he said. "I cried. I lashed out. I screamed at everyone. I broke sticks and rocks. People would pick on me and make it worse."

But "after a while" he continued, "we just all started to get along. I started getting used to all the work that it is, walking up the hills and everything. I started getting ahead of people, becoming the fastest person. I'm always in front now."

Mickai explained, "The instructors helped me see that if I stay positive and keep thinking positive, then I'll have positive outcomes. I really started to change. I'm not afraid of bugs anymore. I'm happy and I'm actually really having fun."

## Pushing Through Life

At home, Sarah Kone carried around her baggage inside, not on her back. She held in how she felt and because of it, rage built up.

Her feelings spilled out at night in camp, where she was encouraged to tell others if they had been mean or selfish. And she got resolution when they worked it out. "For the first time I feel like I can talk," she said. "I think this trip is going to change me forever."

Summer Search serves 2,000 teens annually. Its mission is to break the cycle of poverty among poor people living in cities and to launch them on a path toward college and success.

It is based on a belief that character is a better predictor of success than grades and tests, particularly among low-income students. Character is demonstrated by showing self-control and being careful, dedicated and persistent.

"Summer Search says we can't undo the 10 years of (education) deficiency these kids are coming to us with," said Amanda Jefferson, who works at the program's Philadelphia office. "But we can teach them how to push through life."

She says local kids are "about 30 percent riskier" than those from Summer Search sites in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Seattle. "In Philly, there is much more intergenerational poverty. One in seven of our kids have a family member in jail. I could count on one hand the number of black boys in our program who have a dad at home."

## Often, A Second Summer Abroad

Teachers and counselors at school look for a spark of grit or resilience and recommend students, who are chosen during their second year of high school. Their first big adventure is a trip like this one, run by Outward Bound.

The second summer they often go abroad, on more challenging trips. They have weekly conversations with counselors and receive support until they graduate from college.

Nationally, more than 90 percent go to college, and 85 percent are on track to graduate, Jefferson said. In Philadelphia, 50 percent of the first class in 2006 graduated from college, but now 75 percent are on track to finish, she said.

Jefferson admits 35 students is but a tiny fraction of all of the city's students.

"It's all about the ripple effect," she said. "We're making a really deep (commitment) to a small number of kids, and what effect is that going to have on their school, their family, their community? I always say to my kids, 'Yes we want you to be a college graduate, but we also want you to be a good dad, a good husband.' That's where you're going to break the cycle."

## Canoeing To Rock Climbing

The second group called itself the Warriors.

They canoed the first part of the trip, and one day took a break from backpacking to do rock climbing on a 50-foot wall known as Rick's Rocks.

After scaling Rick's Rocks, Tyron Williams of Boys Latin said, "Sometimes I feel like I'm weak because I've always wanted to be in the shadows, or the last person. But I've learned I can be a leader."

Many of campers cried when they were first interviewed by Summer Search. As camper Marieli Lopez of Mariana Bracetti Academy said, "When you talk about it, you realize what you're going through."

Stephon Freeman however, said he cried "tears of joy. Someone actually listened to what I went though in my life."
