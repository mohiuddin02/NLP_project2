It is a mystery why the Airbus A320 crashed in the middle of the flight. The pilots did not send out a distress call and had lost radio contact with air traffic controllers, France's aviation authority said. The plane crashed while flying from Barcelona, Spain, to Duesseldorf in Germany.

The crash left officials and families across Europe in shock.

## Crash Site Needs To Be Studied Carefully

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a black box had been located at the crash site and "will be immediately investigated." He did not say whether it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder.

"The crash of the German plane with more than 140 people on board is a shock,"  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. She is the head of the German government. The crash "plunges us in Germany, the French and the Spanish into deep sorrow."

Merkel said that officials do not know much beyond the basic information about the flight. She said it was still too soon to guess what happened.

"All that will be investigated thoroughly," Merkel said.

France's prime minister said a helicopter crew landed briefly in the area of the crash. They saw no signs of life.

Germanwings is the airline company that operated the flight. It said Flight 9525 carried 144 passengers and six crew members. Officials believe 67 German residents were on board, including a group of high school students. Dutch officials said one Dutch citizen was killed.

## The Wreckage Is Tough To Reach

The plane left Barcelona Airport at 10:01 a.m. It reached an altitude of 38,000 feet in the air, then suddenly began dropping rapidly, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said.

The plane crashed in the French Alps at an altitude of 6,550 feet at Meolans-Revels, near a popular ski resort. The area is 430 miles southeast of Paris.

French government spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told French television that the mountainous area is very remote. He expected "an extremely long and extremely difficult" search. The weather in the area became worse Tuesday afternoon, and a chilly rain began falling.

There are no roads in the area, said Gilbert Sauvan, a local French lawmaker. It is impossible to get to the crash site from the ground.

## Plane Made Weird Noises

Winkelmann said the airplane's pilot had more than 10 years of experience working for Germanwings and Lufthansa. Germanwings is a low-cost airline owned by Lufthansa, Germany's biggest airline.

Airbus delivered the plane in 1991 and it had been flown 58,300 hours over about 46,700 flights, Airbus said. The plane was last checked on Monday. Its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013.

Pierre Polizzi owns a campground near the crash site. He said he heard the plane making strange noises shortly before it crashed.

"At 11:30, I heard a series of loud noises in the air. There are often fighter jets flying over, so I thought it sounded just like that. I looked outside, but I couldn't see any fighter planes," he said.

Polizzi said the plane crashed about 3 to 11 miles from the campground.

"It's going to be very difficult to get there," he said. The mountain is snowy and very isolated.

## "A Tragedy"

In Paris, French President Francois Hollande called the crash "a tragedy on our soil."

The A320 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation. The jet has two engines and flies to cities between one and five hours apart. The A320 is built to fly up to an altitude of 39,000 feet. That is more than 7 miles high. It can begin to experience problems as low as 37,000 feet, depending on temperature and weight, including fuel, cargo and passengers.

Around the world, 3,606 A320s are in use, Airbus said.

The A320 family also has a good safety record. It has had fewer than one fatal accident for every 1 million takeoffs, Boeing said.
