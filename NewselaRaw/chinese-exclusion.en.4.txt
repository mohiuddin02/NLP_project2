Most Americans know there were once slaves in this country. Many also know what happened to Japanese-Americans during World War II: More than 100,000 were put in special prison camps just because their families were Japanese.

Another great injustice is less well known. For more than 60 years, most Chinese people were not allowed to come to the United States.

The Chinese Exclusion Act was first passed by Congress in 1882. It was not lifted until 1943.

The law kept many Chinese people out of the U.S. â€” but not all of them. Some were still able to get in if they had money to start a business.

## One Family's Story

Hoy Fung was one Chinese person who did manage to settle here. He grew up in Guangdong, China.

Fung opened what may have been the first Chinese restaurant around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was called the Bellevue Tea Garden. The restaurant was in business from 1926 to 1997, said his daughter, Karen Yee.

During much of the 19th century, the Chinese were not banned. Many Chinese men came to the U.S. to help build the railroad across the continent.

Work on the railroad was completed in 1869. Suddenly, there were 10,000 unemployed railroad workers on the West Coast.

The Chinese who had come here were mostly male. Many Americans were afraid they might take jobs away from local workers.

In the 1920s, it was common for Chinese families to send one son overseas. They earned money and sent it back to China. Fung was one such person.

## A Brave Marriage

Fung's restaurant served what Americans thought of as Chinese food then: mostly chop suey and chow mein. Only later did he add Cantonese dishes and egg rolls.

One of the first people he hired was a waitress: Lorraine Kristoff. Her family was from Hungary.

"She knew two weeks after she met him that she was going to marry him," Yee said.

Both of their families were against a wedding. Kristoff's brother even threatened to hurt Fung.

The two went ahead and got married anyway. Fung agreed to let the children be raised Catholic.

Yee and her twin sister were born during the 1930s. They were followed over the years by two brothers and a sister.

## Ending The Exclusion Act

Everywhere in the country, most Chinese were male. Most Chinese women had been kept out of the U.S.

The exclusion act was very hard on families. Some Chinese-American men had families back in China. Often they were unable to see them for years.

When the law was finally lifted in 1943, there were two benefits. One was that new people from China could enter the United States. The other was that Chinese men who were already here could live with their families.

In 2012, Congress apologized for the exclusion act.

Yee has never forgotten her Chinese roots. Still, she has grown to love America over the years.

"I think every group that comes in to America faces difficulty. But I also think America is a country where if you really work hard and sacrifice, you can make it. I really still think it is the best country in the world, even though it has problems," she said.
