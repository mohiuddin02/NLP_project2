BOSTON — Will the 2024 Summer Olympic Games be held in the United States?

Boston will be making the United States' bid for the 2024 Games. It beat out Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington to be the U.S. city entered in the competition. The final decision about who gets to host the Olympics will be made in 2017. That's still two years away, but Bostonians are already having their doubts.

## Small City, Huge Event

The first question: can Boston's trains, buses and roads handle it? This winter, strong storms called nor'easters have dumped snow on the city. Getting around the city has been difficult, leaving residents frustrated.

Residents wonder: If Boston can't handle a snowy winter, can it handle hosting the 2024 Olympic Games in just nine years?

Other concerns include the expense of hosting an Olympics and the difficulty of planning a large event in one of the nation's smallest major cities.

"We're already crazy," said Debbie Jones, whose 45-minute trip to work had been taking 2 1/2 hours. "I can't imagine the Olympics, with 10 times more people."

Eventually winter will end and spring will come. The snow will melt, but will residents' cold feelings melt with it?

## Already Famous

Part of Boston's reluctance may say something about the city.

Boston is already a leader, residents say — in medicine, higher education, technology — even sports. The city is home to teams like the New England Patriots in football and Red Sox in baseball.

Boston is already on the world stage. It does not need the attention, the way Atlanta or Sochi, Russia, might, locals say.

"People already know where Boston is," said Pat Shaughnessy, who was also waiting for a train.

Other Boston residents are tired of huge, multibillion-dollar projects. The Big Dig was a massive transportation project that included building highways, tunnels and bridges. It cost billions of dollars more that it was supposed to and tore up central Boston for more than 10 years.

## A Wicked Price Tag?

The Boston Olympics could cost about $4.7 billion to run. However, supporters of the Olympics say that would be covered by private money — not by the people of Boston. The federal government would pay $1 to $2 billion in security costs. State officials are already planning to spend $5.2 on transportation projects, supporters say.

In a February survey, less than half of Boston voters supported bringing the Olympics to the city. Other cities that have hosted the Games have had much stronger support: as much as 70 or 80 percent of residents. Of course, Boston is two years away from the final decision.

## Please Come To Boston

The campaign to bring the Olympics to Boston is being led by a group of business leaders, including one of the city's wealthiest men. They know they have a challenge ahead of them.

In the past, people in Denver, Colorado, and cities in Germany and Poland have voted against hosting the Olympics.

A U.S. city has not hosted the Summer Olympics since Atlanta in 1996. If Boston supporters can convince Bostonians that it's a good idea, the city could have a chance when the International Olympic Committee chooses the 2024 host in 2017.

Ed Hula runs Around the Rings, a website that writes about the Olympics. Hula said Boston's main competition to host the games would come from European cities.

## Walkable, And A Legacy

Richard Davey, head of Boston 2024 — the group pushing for the Boston Olympics — says the city can save money by using college and university sites to host events. The Games could be "the most walkable in history," Davey said.

It would not be completely walkable however: early rounds of baseball, soccer and basketball might be held as far away as Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York.

Mayor Martin Walsh said the Olympics would allow the city to start making improvements that would be done in time for Boston's 400th anniversary in 2030.

It would create an incredible legacy for Boston, Walsh said.

He said that Boston won the right to be the U.S. choice in the competition to host the Olympics "because of the city we are. We're going around the world now marketing that."
