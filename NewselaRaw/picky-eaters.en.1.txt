There is no scientific definition of picky eating but it is still a very common challenge for many parents of young children. Parents say they know it when they see it, and according to new research, they are likely to be right.

Picky eaters are not all the same. What parents call picky eating can actually be influenced by a broad range of behaviors, depending on the personality and preferences of each individual child. Knowing which type of picky eater a child is may help parents develop constructive responses.

The researchers gathered 170 2- to 4-year-olds, about half of whom were described by their parents as being choosy. For two weeks the parents fed the family standardized meals provided by the researchers and then observed and recorded their children's responses.

Non-picky kids ate more and did not make a fuss about eating, while those seen as picky acted differently before and during meals. Some kids simply refused to even come to the table while others showed mild suspicion of certain foods before eventually sitting down. A few kids even cringed and gagged.

## Behavior Plays A Role

Sharon M. Donovan is a professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and co-author of the study. Donovan and her team conducted focus groups with parents after observing their children. The researchers identified four possibly overlapping types of behavior that could cause parents to identify their children as picky eaters.

Some of their preferences, such as blankly refusing to eat broccoli, Donovan notes, may be hardwired. There are always going to be foods some kids just do not like eating. Research indicates that children can be genetically more sensitive to bitter flavors than others and may therefore take longer to acquire a taste for certain vegetables.

Other bad behavior at mealtimes, such as looking sad or even gagging, may not have to do with the food at all. For example, a child may be upset that a mealtime has interrupted her playtime. So she attempts to express her independence by refusing to eat, explains study co-author Soo-Yeun Lee, who is also a nutrition professor at the University of Illinois.

## Don't Give Up On New Foods

Picky eating is not uncommon. Donovan says that 19 to 50 percent of kids up to age 2, when the phenomenon peaks, are considered to be difficult eaters by their caregivers. How parents react can influence just how long this behavior lasts.

The researchers may not have scientifically proven ways to treat each kind of picky eater but that does not mean their research is without purpose. Lee still thinks it will help parents to recognize that their kids' reaction to mealtime may not always be about food or eating. Therefore it does not make much sense for parents to get into power struggles with youngsters every time they sit down for dinner. In all likelihood, the behavior will usually go away or lessen after age 5.

Until they understand more about the differences between picky eaters, the nutritionists recommend a few time-tested approaches. For a child who does not like mixed foods, show him or her the individual ingredients the first time you the item is served. Acknowledge that your child has preferences but serve foods they do not like along with their favorites. Do not force your child to eat something new but encourage him or her to take a taste. Most of all, keep trying, Donovan says. "Children may need 10 exposures to a new food before accepting it. Parents often give up before then."

## Four Types Of Finicky Eaters

Sensory-dependent eaters reject a food because of the way it feels or how it smells ("Yuck, slimy!").

Preferential eaters try to avoid new or mixed foods.

General perfectionists have specific needs, such as foods not touching one another.

Behavioral responders may cringe or gag when right is not "right" ("Ham and cheese should be on white bread, not brown!") or may refuse to come to the table before they even know what's for dinner.
