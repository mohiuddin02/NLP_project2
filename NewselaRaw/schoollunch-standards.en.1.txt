WASHINGTON — Nothing exasperates Brad Kramer more than watching high school students dump their required servings of fruits and vegetables in the trash. Kramer is the director of food services for the Grain Valley R-V School District in Kansas City, Missouri.

"We have some of the healthiest trash cans in the nation," he laughed.

Behind the joke, frustration simmers. Kramer and other critics of the federal standards for healthy school lunches say the rules, imposed in 2012, are too costly and restrictive, and that Congress should loosen them.

Kramer wants to serve healthy food, but points out that it does not do any good unless students actually eat it.

## Loosening Standards

Ronda McCullick, director of food service operations for Kansas City's Park Hill School District, shares Kramer's frustration. "What we're asking for is flexibility," McCullick said. She wants to "go back to making some of those decisions at a local level."

McCullick and Kramer belong to the School Nutrition Association, a professional organization that represents school cafeteria workers and companies that supply their food and equipment. One thousand of the group's members converged on Capitol Hill this week, lobbying lawmakers to change the school lunch standards.

The School Nutrition Association wants lawmakers to drop the requirement that students take half-cup servings of fruit or vegetables as part of every meal. They also want to stop further sodium reductions and loosen requirements on whole grains.

## Flexibility Is Key

It's the latest uprising in a food fight raging in Washington over the fate of the 2010 law that mandated the new standards. That law — the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act — is about to expire and must be renewed.

"It's not about government standards," Pat Roberts, a Republican senator from Kansas, said in a speech to the association's members as they wrapped up their lobbying efforts Wednesday. "It's about taking the opportunity to make government programs work for the people and not the other way around."

Providing more flexibility to school districts is emerging as a top priority for Roberts. He is the newly minted chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which is responsible for the lunch program.

Roberts has been visiting schools in Kansas to sample meals and talk to students and administrators. "If you think about how many school districts there are in the U.S. and how different they all are, it's clear that a one-size-fits-all approach won't work," he said.

## Biscuits And Gravy

Last month, the senator stopped by his alma mater, Holton High School. The Holton Recorder reported that he and the students shared sausage biscuits with gravy, hash brown cakes, green beans, apples and milk.

Roberts told students that obesity is a problem, but he feels the government is over-involved in "our daily lives and pocketbooks."

Nearly 15 percent of 10- to 17-year-olds in Roberts' home state of Kansas are obese. So are 30 percent of adults, according to a report by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The battle over school lunches pits Roberts and other Republican lawmakers against First Lady Michelle Obama. The rules they are trying to change are part of Obama's "Let's Move" campaign to end childhood obesity.

## Study Says Kids Are Eating More Fruits, Veggies

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) says the new rules are working. The agency cites a new study from the Rudd Center for Food Policy &amp; Obesity at the University of Connecticut that shows children are eating more healthfully at school and tossing out less food since the rules kicked in.

The study found that 66 percent of students added fruit to their lunch trays last year, up from 54 percent in 2012. Students also ate 20 percent more vegetables and 13 percent more of their lunch entrees, according to the study.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says the updated healthy school meal standards were based on doctors' recommendations. "For Congress to meddle with doctors' recommendations and go back to less healthy meals now would not be in the best interest of our children," he said.

Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, has plans to introduce a bill endorsed by the School Nutrition Association. Hoeven says the bill amends the sodium and whole-grain rules, but still ensures that schools provide healthy meals. It "provides the flexibility (schools) need to serve meals that are not only well-balanced but also appealing to students," Hoeven says.

## "We Need Solutions"

USDA spokesman Cullen Schwarz said the department has shown flexibility in the timing and implementation of the school lunch rules.

Schwarz also noted that the USDA has done so without the need for legislation. "We're going to be wary of allowing politicians to override the recommendations of pediatricians to the point where these standards are no longer meaningful and helping kids to be healthy," Schwarz said.

In his speech, Roberts called for a civil policy debate, saying he wanted to bring all sides to the table and noting that disagreements on the subject have had a tendency to get out of hand. "We don't need that," Roberts said. "We need solutions."
