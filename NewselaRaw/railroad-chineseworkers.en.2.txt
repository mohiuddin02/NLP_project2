STANFORD, Calif. â€” Like thousands of Chinese-Americans, Connie Young Yu's parents had forefathers who helped build the U.S.'s first coast-to-coast railway. In May of 1969 the two attended ceremonies marking the hundredth anniversary of the massive project's completion. During the 1860s many thousands of men migrated from China to work on the project. Yu's parents were proud of the Chinese contribution to the building of the transcontinental railway.

Their pride quickly turned to dismay as they listened to Transportation Secretary John Volpe's remarks during the ceremonies. Volpe completely ignored the Chinese migrant contribution.

## U.S. Official "Had No Clue"

"He gave this oration saying, 'Who but Americans could have blasted tunnels through the Sierras? Who but Americans could have built 10 miles of track in one day?'" recalled Yu, 73, a historian and author. "He had no clue of the history."

In the years since, Yu and others have sought to flesh out the stories of these long-anonymous Chinese migrants and win wider recognition for their role in the building of the American West. Until recently, their success was limited.

Now, however, their efforts are getting a boost from Stanford University.

Scholars at the school have launched the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project. Their goal is to put together the most complete record of the experiences these migrants had in North America, both while working on the railway and after.

## Educated Railroad Workers

Remarkably little is known of the 12,000 Chinese migrants who came to build the railways. Many are listed in surviving records only under nicknames like "China Sam" or "China Jim." So far, no letters home or diaries have been found.

Researchers believe that many of the laborers were merchants, traders and blacksmiths seeking opportunity in the United States. Most of the migrants came from the southern province of Guangdong. Many were educated men.

"They were not just strong backs," said Gordon Chang, director of Stanford's Center for East Asian Studies. "They were ambitious people making their way." The men had "different skills, including cooking, accounting, carpentry and masonry," Chang said.

In early June, about 250 people came to Stanford University for a conference on the migrants. Descendants of about 50 railway workers came from as far away as Hawaii. They shared their family histories, a key source of information for the project.

## "Nameless, Faceless Men"

San Francisco filmmaker Barre Fong has conducted video interviews with dozens of Chinese-Americans about their railway-worker ancestors. He is aiming to create an hour-long documentary on the subject, as part of the Stanford effort.

"Up to now, we kind of have this image of nameless, faceless men with big straw hats," said Fong. "We got some pretty interesting details about who they were," and about their life in the United States, he said.

Chin Lin Sou, for example, was a fluent English speaker and went on to become a prominent businessman in Denver, Colorado. Hung Lai Woh came over as a teenager and built sheds to protect the rail tracks from heavy snowfall. He later ran a cigar business in San Francisco, California.

Lisa See's great-great-grandfather was hired to serve as a traditional Chinese herbal doctor for the laborers.

## "Adopted" By An Indian Chief

Another descendant, Sandy Lee, told researchers that her great-grandfather's work team was attacked by an American Indian tribe. The tribe's chief, who had recently lost his son, "adopted" the young Chinese man for two years. After he was freed, he went back to China, married, then joined his brother in Maryland and took up farming.

Many Chinese who built the railroads were not eager to describe their experiences. Filmmaker Fong himself had a great-grandparent who served as a cook on the railroad, but rarely discussed it.

"It was not a proud time in his life, so it was only mentioned in passing, never in detail," Fong said.

Now, Chang said, many Chinese-Americans regard this period as something to be honored.

## Now They Are Heroes

"These workers were the ancestors of many Chinese-Americans today," Chang said. "There's a romanticism and a heroism around them now."

While working on the American railroads, Chinese laborers faced severe discrimination. They received less pay than Irish workers and had to provide their own food and housing. Later on, laws were introduced that restricted their schooling and property ownership.

These days, Chinese immigrants to the United States have a much easier time. "With enough money you can buy a home anywhere you want, you can send your child to Stanford or UCLA, you can start a business anywhere. But that was not the case even in my lifetime," said Fong, who is 48.

## They Paved The Way

Recent Asian immigrants who think it "was always like this in America" are badly mistaken, Fong said.

"The way was paved by several generations that really suffered and worked very hard," he said. "I hope projects like this help the newly arrived see this."
