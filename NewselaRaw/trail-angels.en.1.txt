LOS ANGELES — By any measure, the Pacific Crest Trail is a beastly thing. It slithers up the entire length of California and all the way to Canada, for some 2,650 rugged, often brutal miles.

Along the way, however, relief is at hand for tired and hungry hikers.

Near the southern trail head, Sandy and Barney Mann open their five-bedroom San Diego home to as many as 60 hikers a night. They even pick them up from the airport and ferry them, gear and all, to the starting point an hour east.

Up the trail, in Agua Dulce, Donna and Jeff Saufley provide a night's rest to more than 1,000 hikers a season. In addition, they offer food and shelter to the hikers' dogs and horses, along with the occasional llama.

East of the San Francisco Bay Area, Hank Magnuski provides hot coffee and fresh fruit topped with whipped cream to hikers coming off a particularly grueling 300-mile stretch.

They are all part of a small network of outdoor good Samaritans called "trail angels."

## Something They Were Meant To Do

These self-appointed volunteers assist long-distance hikers along what is considered to be one of the most difficult trails in the world. They do it with little or no reward, other than the grateful smiles and occasional post-trail postcards.

Estimated at fewer than 100, the trail angels may be America's least-known charitable army. They reach into their own pockets to provide food, shelter, medicine and hot showers to hikers. If you insist on leaving money under your pillow, they will usually donate it toward trail maintenance.

The trail angels explain their generosity by raving about the types of people they encounter. Many, including Donna Saufley, consider helping the hikers a spiritual endeavor, something they were ordained to do.

"We're our better selves out there," she says of the hikers she helps.

An angel among angels, Saufley is the best-known of the trail volunteers.

## Tents, Trailers and Tales

Beginning in April, she and her husband set up tents and a trailer to handle the spring crush. Their home, dubbed "Hiker Heaven," is a popular mail drop where backpackers — always desperate to lighten the load — can send and receive packages.

However, Saufley sees the long-distance hikers unload more than just unnecessary gear. She talks fondly about the payoffs of being a trail angel, which include witnessing the hikers' grit and enthusiasm, and having people share their hopes and fears with her.

Traveling the trail "is humbling," she says. "I compare it to the peeling of an onion — you see people for what they are.

"I have to say, far and away, these are some of the most interesting people on the planet," Saufley says. "I always say that it's a river of life that washes up to my shore."

## Home Filled With Hikers

Almost none of the trail angels consider what they do an act of pure charity. Rather, they think they get as much from the experience as the hikers themselves.

"I am involved on a selfish level because I want to get to know the hikers," says Pea Hicks, a San Diego musician who helps hikers get started at the Mexican border.

It is also a way to stay involved in hiking, says Hicks, who walked the trail in 2006.

As hiking the trail has become more popular, the trail angels have gotten busier.

Saufley says that during her first year, 1997, she hosted 50 hikers all season. Last year, she often had that many staying per night, with about 1,200 for the summer.

Saufley loves it when her home is filled with hikers.

"The sounds of conversations mingling with music and laughter is divine to my ear," the 58-year-old says.

## The Unpredictability Of It All

Most of the hikers travel significant stretches of the trail, with about 1,000 attempting the entire length. Only about half of those who try manage to complete the whole thing.

The percent of hikers who do complete the trail has been growing each year, though, by as much as 25 percent. The trail has become quite popular, drawing enthusiasts from as far away as Australia.

Part of the trail's difficulty is its unpredictability. Around one S curve lies a rockslide, while around the next sits a fallen ancient cedar, as big as a bus.

Then there are those endless upward climbs — in the Sierra alone, there are nine granite passes of 10,000 feet or more.

Some hikers complete the trail several times, while others add their own unique twist. Two years ago, Portland native Ron Ulrich hiked the whole thing dressed in a bridal gown.

## "We Are So Lucky"

Facing their 10th year of taking in hikers, the Manns say those they have helped often stay in touch with post-trail notes and cards. Almost through word of mouth alone, they have become a go-to resource.

"We get the strangest emails — 'I've never written to a total stranger before asking to stay at their house, but I'm told it's OK,'" Sandy says.

Barney, a retired lawyer, confesses that providing airport runs and meals to hundreds of strangers each spring can leave him and Sandy feeling exhausted.

Still, he said, "We are so lucky to be able to do this."

"We do it because we can," adds Sandy, a retired science teacher.

For Saufley, the transformations she sees in people are a fair trade for the expense and fatigue.

"They go out for the nature," she says of her long-distance guests, "and they end up finding the peace within themselves."
