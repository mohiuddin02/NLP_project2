A lot of what we know about how chimpanzees interact with each other is because of one person: Jane Goodall.

Goodall spent more than 40 years studying chimpanzees in Tanzania, which is a country in East Africa. A new children's book titled, "Untamed: The Wild Life of Jane Goodall," documents Jane's life and her important scientific discoveries.

Several other children's books have been published about Goodall because of her work in primatology, which is the study of animals such as apes and monkeys. "Untamed" is slightly different than other books about Goodall. Anita Silvey is the book's author. She thought it was important to cover all 81 years of the scientist's career up through the present, not just her work on chimpanzees. "Her entire life fascinated me," Silvey says.

## Goodall's Early Dreams

"Untamed" begins with Goodall's childhood in England. Silvey writes that Goodall enjoyed observing her family pets as a child. She also loved being in nature and reading books like "The Story of Doctor Dolittle," a fictional tale about a veterinarian who travels to Africa and learns to speak to animals.

Like Doctor Dolittle, Goodall would later become famous for her connections with animals in Africa.

Silvey is also an expert in children's literature. She says, "A lot of reading for children is actually about thinking." She goes on to say that children often ask questions while reading: Can this story be a map for my life? Is there something I can learn here that is actually a way for my life to go? These may have been the very questions Goodall had when reading her childhood stories.

## Falling in Love with Africa

In her early 20s, Goodall got an invitation from a school friend to visit Africa. She became excited by the idea and worked hard to earn enough money to get there.

Once she was in Africa, Goodall quickly got herself a job with Louis Leakey, a famous scientist who studied early humans in Africa. Leakey encouraged Goodall and helped her study chimpanzees in the wild.

The Gombe Stream Game Reserve is now a national park in Tanzania. A national park is an area of land protected by the government to help preserve it. It was in Gombe that Goodall changed scientific research of animals forever. Silvey writes that Goodall "focused on chimpanzees as individuals, with their own special personalities."

At the time, the scientific community recorded animals with numbers. Goodall wanted a different system, because she insisted that every individual chimpanzee was different. She removed the numbers and decided to name the chimpanzees, giving them names like Fifi and David Greybeard.

Silvey's book contains many wonderful pictures, including four pages that make up a chimpanzee "family scrapbook." This scrapbook lets the reader see the personalities of these chimpanzees that Goodall describes. It also shows the special relationships that Goodall formed with many of the chimps she studied.

## Be The Change In The World

Silvey writes that Goodall also faced many difficulties, "It wasn't easy for her, but she is somebody who always pushes through hard times. Whatever the problem, she finds a solution."

"It's not that everyone can have Jane Goodall's life," Silvey says. "But her story lets kids know that if you love something and you work hard for it, you can change the world."

Goodall took her childhood love for animals and made it into a career. Silvey wants other children to understand that if they also follow their dreams, they may be able to change the world for the better.

Goodall is now traveling the world and working to improve the treatment of chimpanzees and other great apes. Silvey's book also offers her own ideas for helping endangered animals so that Goodall's work may continue. Silvey offers simple ways for young people to get involved, as well as a few more significant ways.

As Goodall writes in the introduction to Silvey's book, "You make a difference every single day. And you get to choose what sort of difference you want to make."
