CHICAGO – On their first day of training, one mother after another paused in the classroom doorway. They were unsure where to sit or even if signing up for the parent program was a good idea.

Trainer Monica Soto-Espinoza knew they were wondering what they could offer. She was once just like many of them. She was a mother who had come to the United States as a teenager, spoke little English and never finished school.

Now 35 years old and fluent in English, Soto-Espinoza told them she was able to help. They could too. A lot of parents have been able to help their children's schools through a program created by a Chicago community group called the Logan Square Neighborhood Association.

Parents play an important part in the success of their children and their children's schools. Too much parent involvement can cause problems, as happens in some rich schools. But many schools struggle to get parents involved. It is especially tough when teachers and students speak different languages.

## "Somebody They Know"

Many schools end up in a bad situation, said Ann Ishimaru. She teaches at the University of Washington. Teachers put together events and if parents do not show up, the teachers decide they just don't care.

In the Logan Square program's 18-year history, 1,800 parents have spent two hours a day, five days a week in their children's schools. The program operates in 65 Illinois schools.

Principals and teachers in Logan Square schools say parents have helped many students improve in math and reading. They also believe parents help motivate students.

Soo Hong is a professor at Wellesley College. She said students "are quite moved and inspired by having their parents being involved in the school."

And, she said it makes them more responsible for how they act. "Students know if they start messing up in the classroom ... sure, maybe it's not their mother who's there, but it's their aunt's neighbor or somebody they know," she said.

The neighborhood group has helped start a teacher-training program, too. So far, 23 have graduated. One of them, Ebelia Mucino, started working in Logan Square schools about 15 years ago, and now finds great joy in teaching kindergartners to read.

Mucino came to the United States from Mexico as a teenager. She saw herself as "just" a stay-at-home mom, who had nothing to offer teachers. But she found that she had a knack for helping students.

And when the teacher had to leave the class briefly, he would encourage her, "You know what to do." Mucino realized she could go into education, saying she saw windows opening for her — "a million windows."

## Teacher-Parent Partnership

The parent program began in 1995 at Funston Elementary. Most students from the school are from poorer immigrant Latino families.

Before the program started, a few Funston parents would show up to help each day. But the principal wanted to attract those who dropped off their kids each morning, and never went inside.

She turned to the neighborhood group. From the beginning, the program was designed as a partnership. The hope was that teachers would learn as much from parents as parents would gain from watching and talking with teachers. The neighborhood group tries to work together with principals. They know the program will not work unless they support it.

Teachers were hesitant at first. They worried that having parents in class would cause trouble or add a lot of work. But they soon saw how much help parents could offer. They could give more time and encouragement to students than teachers could do on their own.

One morning at school, Pete Rodriguez sat at the back of a first-grade classroom. He is a dad. He was helping four boys, who jumped up at nearly every distraction.

Other students worked on their own and teacher Jessica Dye sat with another small group. Meanwhile, Rodriguez patiently worked to keep the four focused on the task: a sentence about a grandma, her grandson and a teddy bear.

A new study this fall will look at the parent program at two schools. They want to see how students assigned to parents are doing on tests and how they behave in class.

Some experts think programs like Logan Square's will help improve education.

Ishimaru of University of Washington said parents are often left out when trying to fix schools. They are "the folks who have the most at stake and sometimes the most expertise on their own children," she said.
