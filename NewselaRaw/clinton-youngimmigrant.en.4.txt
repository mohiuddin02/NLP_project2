NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” Lorella Praeli has an important job. She is helping Hillary Clinton run for president. Yet Praeli has never voted before.

That may soon change.

Earlier Praeli was not able to vote. She was not a legal citizen in the United States. When Praeli was a young girl, she moved from Peru to the United States without permission. She did not have the right to vote. Praeli became a citizen three years ago, when she married a U.S. citizen. Now she is excited to vote for Clinton.

## She Tells Latinos About Hillary Clinton

If Clinton wants to become president, she will have to win the votes of many Latinos. Praeli is in charge of talking to Latinos. She tells them why Clinton will make a good president. Latinos make up a very large group of people in the United States. Many Latinos are from South America. They also speak Spanish.

It will be a tough job for Praeli. Latinos do not vote as much as other groups of people. They do not vote as much as black or white people. Also, many young Latinos are not interested in voting.

Praeli has to tell Latinos why voting is important. It will take much hard work.

## Bullies Made Her Work Hard In School

Praeli has been working hard since she was little. She was 2 years old when a car hit her. Doctors had to cut off her right leg. She learned to walk with a fake leg.

When she was 10, her family moved to the United States. They came without permission.

Praeli and her younger sister were the only Latinas at their school. Other kids teased her. They made fun of her fake leg, calling her "peg leg." They also teased her for being an immigrant.

She stood up to the bullies and reported them to the school police. Praeli also did very well in school. She earned money to go to college for free.

After college, Praeli wanted to help other Latinos like herself. Praeli likes her new job working for Hillary Clinton. She knows Clinton will make a good president. Clinton says she will help Latinos if she becomes president. Praeli is excited to help make it happen.
