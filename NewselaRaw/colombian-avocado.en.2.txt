We import them from far and wide, from Mexico to as far south as Chile. We also grow our own in California. Now, Colombia is hoping to become the newest region to sell avocados to the United States.

To start exporting avocados to the United States, Colombian growers need to get over a few hurdles. First, they need to show that their avocados are properly grown and safe to eat. They will also have to get legal permission to sell avocados in the United States, which can be a complicated process. Despite these challenges, most people think Colombia will start exporting avocados to the United States within the next 24 months or so.

## Lucky Number 81

Colombia already has a business relationship with the United States. According to Colombian Minister of Agriculture Aurelio Iragorri, his country exports 80 agricultural products to the United States. Avocados could be number 81.

U.S. demand for avocados has jumped 174 percent in the past 14 years. In other words, it has nearly doubled. With the increase in demand, there has also been an increase in competition among avocado sellers.

Mexico supplied 1.3 billion pounds of avocados to the United States in 2014, followed by California with 282 million pounds. Peru sold 144 million pounds and Chile sold 89 million pounds.

Some Colombians think they can compete, especially with Peru and Chile. Colombia is closer to the United States than Peru and Chile are, so it might be able to sell avocados there more easily.

## Avocado Welcome Mat Is Out

Andrés Eduardo Mejía is the executive director of CORPOHASS, the association of Colombia's avocado producers and exporters. He believes that, despite the competition, the Colombian avocado market will be successful. Avocados are extremely popular in the United States, and that popularity seems only to be growing.

Even so, the process to start selling a product in the United States is slow. The government has tried to speed things up by providing training and expertise to help Colombian companies.

This week, U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Kevin Whitaker visited an avocado processing plant in Colombia. As ambassador, part of his role is to maintain good relationships with the Colombian people and government. The avocado plant he visited was just outside Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city.

Agricultural Counselor Michael Conlon works with Whitaker. He commented that the visit showed that the United States and Colombia had a strong partnership. The economic partnership of the two countries would be strengthened by avocado trade.

## "Avocados Have A Great Future"

Colombian companies have already begun expanding their avocado production while they wait for permission to sell in the United States. Colombian land dedicated to avocado production more than doubled from 2008 to 2014. The country is on track to produce 42,500 tons this year, Iragorri said.

"But 42,000 tons isn't enough," he said, looking forward to a U.S. opening. "Avocados have a great future."

While Colombia tries to enter an already crowded market, there is one avocado-growing region that does not have to worry about competition. Florida is the second-largest avocado-producing state, behind California. It is expected to harvest somewhere between 1 million and 1.2 million bushels this year, or about 66 million pounds, according to the state's Avocado Committee.

## Variety Is Good

Unlike California and Colombia, however, Florida specializes in green avocados, a different variety from the dark-skinned Haas avocados that most Americans are used to.

Brooks Tropicals is South Florida's largest grower of avocados. It has started calling Florida's green avocados "SlimCados" to highlight the fact that they have less fat than Haas avocados.

Mary Ostlund, director of marketing at Brooks Tropicals, pointed out that consumers may enjoy having more than one kind of avocado from which to choose. "People are realizing they like to eat more than one kind of avocado," she said. She added that most grocery stores stock both varieties.

She sees the green avocado market and the Haas avocado market as separate. As far as green avocados are concerned, Florida has little competition.

"It's just kind of a separate market," Ostlund said. "I guess we have staked out our own little corner."
