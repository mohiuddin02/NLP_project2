UFO Sightings Daily is a website. It posts pictures from NASA, the U.S. space agency. UFO means Unidentified Flying Object.

In a picture of Mars, the post's writer saw an alien. He also saw alien ships and a face looking up.

Scott C. Waring wrote the post. He claimed the picture shows that aliens really exist.

Ashwin Vasavada is a NASA scientist. He works on the Mars rover project. Scientists are not trying to hide evidence of aliens, he said.

The scientists would be thrilled to discover aliens, he said. So far, they have not found any.

## Brain Games

The brain can play tricks on people, Vasavada said.

It is called pareidolia. It explains why some people see what they think are aliens on Mars. Or faces on potato chips.

The brain spots patterns. It looks for things it already knows. That skills lets people recognize things that are important. This could be a smiling face. It could be the sound of an scared voice. It could also be the growl of an animal.

Christopher French is with Goldsmiths University of London. He studies the human brain. From time to time, the brain gets things wrong, he said.

Pareidolia comes from the brain's ability to find meaning in unclear pictures. It helps people remain alive.

Scientists say all people think this way.

## If We Really Want To See It

Human brains are made to recognize faces, said Kang Lee. He is a scientist at the University of Toronto. They can see faces in all kinds of places. They can recognize even a hint of a face.

An area of the brain turns on when people think they see a face. It has a funny name. It is called the right fusiform gyrus.

Scientists still do not really understand how it works. They know that it is linked to dyslexia. It is a learning problem. Dyslexia makes it hard for people to read letters and numbers. Even when this area is working, it can lead people to see things that are not really there.

Pareidolia is about what people expect to see, said Sophie Scott. She is a brain scientist at University College London. People really want to see faces. They really want to hear voices. The brain will let people do just that.
