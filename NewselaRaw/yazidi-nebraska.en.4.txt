LINCOLN, Neb. — The Yazidis are an ancient religious group in the Middle East. They are stuck on a mountaintop in Iraq. The situation is bad. They are running out of food and water.

The Yazidis fled fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turket through Syria to Egypt. The group has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

ISIL has taken over huge chunks of land in Iraq and the nearby country of Syria. Its fighters have declared the land to be their own country and made Islam the religion. People under their rule must obey their laws. ISIL fighters captured the Yazidi city of Sinjar. Tens of thousands of Yazidis escaped to Mount Sinjar.

## The Yazidis Are In Great Danger

Iraqi Yazidis could die in large numbers, President Barack Obama said. The United States is dropping water and food to Yazidis in danger of starving.

Hundreds of Yazidis live in Lincoln, Nebraska. It is the largest community of Yazidis in the United States. Yazidis here have seen videos and photos of relatives and children begging for help.

When they cook in Nebraska, they cry. They know their relatives in Iraq have nothing to eat. When they see their beds, they think of their family members trapped on the mountaintop. They must sleep on rocks.

Many Yazidis in Lincoln say they have stopped eating, sleeping and going to work. They stare at their phones and wait for news from northern Iraq.

Some Yazidis here were so sad that they could not get out of bed. A nurse, Sharifa Khalil, 26, said more than 20 people had been taken to the hospital. They were so upset they weren't drinking enough water. Some had fainted.

## Bad Things Are Happening

Terrible stories have come to them from Iraq. It is hard to know if the stories are true, but the Yazidis believe them.

Three Yazidi families gathered in the living room of a Lincoln apartment. The men used to work with the U.S. military.

Fares Baki is 29 years old and moved to the United States in December. Baki said his brother and his brother's four children have been trapped on Mount Sinjar. They do not have food or water.

Some emergency help groups have been sending food and water by helicopter. The food has not reached Baki's family. The brothers have kept in touch by phone, he said. But many Yazidis say their relatives' phones are running out of battery power.

## "Shocked And Frozen"

Faisal is 33 years old. He moved to the United States in 2012. He said one of his three sisters in Iraq was captured by ISIL. She called him with a cellphone she snuck into a jail under her clothes.

His sister told him ISIL fighters had separated the older women from the younger ones. They took the boys away.

"I'm just shocked and frozen — I can't even cry anymore," Faisal said.
