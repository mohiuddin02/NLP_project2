ISTANBUL â€” The violent battles that have been raging between police and anti-government protesters in Turkey since May 28 continued this week. On Tuesday, police officers fired tear gas at a group of about 10,000 people who had rallied in Istanbul's Taksim Square.

Three protesters and one police officer have been killed since the clashes began. The Turkish Medical Association believes that nearly 5,000 people have been injured.

The demonstrations are putting Turkey and its allies and neighbors on edge. The Turkish capital, Istanbul, is home to 13.9 million residents and is one of the largest cities in the world. It also provides a vital link between two continents, as one half of Istanbul sits in Europe while the other half lies in Asia.

## City On Two Continents

The city (and continents) are divided by the Bosphorus Strait. The waterway is one of the busiest on the planet, making Istanbul a major player in global trade, transportation and communication. Turkey is also a strong ally to the U.S. and supporter in the war on terror.

Turkey is larger than the state of Texas, and has borders with Greece in the west and Iran in the east. While Istanbul is a very modern and Westernized city, much of the rest of the country is less developed and more conservative.

Around 99 percent of Turks have a Muslim background. But since 1928 Turkey has been a secular country, where religion is officially separated from the running of government.

Some people feel that the current leader of the government, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has recently tried to impose religious laws on this secular society. Concern that religion is influencing politics is just one of the reasons for the continuing demonstrations in Istanbul.

## Pulling Down A Park For A Shopping Mall

The protests started as a demonstration against demolishing a park and building a shopping center in its place. Gezi Park is the last piece of green land left in the center of the huge city. The park is next door to the famous Taksim Square and has been a favorite place for many Turkish people for generations.

As one of the signs at the first rally said: "What if they tried to demolish Central Park in New York to build a mall? That's happening here."

When the environmental protest was violently evicted from the park by riot police with water cannons and tear gas, the movement mushroomed in size. The demonstrations are now against police brutality, Prime Minister Erdogan's conservative policies, and the way his government is trying to control the population.

The demonstrators are both young and old, and from all walks of life. Teachers, lawyers, office workers and students are all protesting together against their government.

## Violent Removal

Just after dawn on Tuesday morning, riot police once again used tear gas, water cannons and armored vehicles to forcibly clear demonstrators from Taksim Square. The protesters have now been camped out in the square for more than a week.

After the violence, government reports suggested there had been just a few injuries, while a doctors' association said that several hundred people were injured.

Many ambulances were seen at the scene. Videos released online showed protesters panicking and coughing as they inhaled the irritant gas, before helping those who needed to be carried after the police raid.

## Secret Police Starting A Fight?

The Taksim Square protests had been mostly peaceful and non-violent. But TV images from Tuesday showed people throwing Molotov cocktails at police. Protesters said on Twitter that those attacking the police had not been seen among the demonstrators up until that point. Other pictures appeared to show the firebomb throwers holding walkie-talkies. This fueled speculation that these mysterious people were government agents or undercover police sent in to deliberately provoke a fight, and make the protesters look bad.

Police also stormed Istanbul's central court after lawyers held an anti-Erdogan protest there. At least 44 demonstrating lawyers were taken away. The Turkish lawyers' association protested the arrests, arguing that its members had simply been demanding an investigation into alleged police brutality during stand-offs between police and protesters.

"Turkish police have fired their tear gas guns directly at people during the demonstrations of the last days. They have used it like a projectile weapon. That's why there are so many severe injuries," association president Metin Feyzioglu told reporters. He said the lawyers were simply trying to make prosecutors aware of this fact, but were arrested instead.

"There were terrible scenes," Feyzioglu added. The next day, thousands of lawyers wearing black robes left their courthouses to support their colleagues and protest their treatment.

Prime Minister Erdogan defended the latest use of police force against the Istanbul protests. In a speech to members of his party, he paid tribute to the police leadership and accused the demonstrators of widespread vandalism during the occupation of the square and park.

## "What Should We Have Done?"

Erdogan said he wouldn't just "end these protests," but also promised to "pursue" the demonstrators who he described as "provocateurs and terrorists." No one will escape, he also threatened.

"What should we have done?" the prime minister asked in the speech. "Kneeled down in front of these people and asked them to please remove their banners?"

Erdogan called the demonstrations a foreign-aided attempt to force Turkey economically to its knees and intimidate people who want to invest in his country. On Wednesday, another member of Erdogan's government said that Turkey might hold a referendum to decide on the future of Gezi Park.

The U.N. and U.S. government urged the Turkish authorities to respect protesters' right to freedom of assembly. "We are concerned by any attempts to punish individuals for exercising their right to free speech," U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon stressed the right to freedom of assembly and called for conversation between the opposing sides to resolve the protests.
