The United States is about to spend billions of dollars to build a top-secret warplane.

Two teams of airplane makers are competing to make the new bomber. The winner is expected to be chosen this spring.

Experts disagree over whether the bomber is necessary for the country's defense or a huge waste of money. It could wind up being one of the most expensive warplanes in U.S. history.

"You're talking about a $2 billion airplane by the time they build it," said Thomas Christie. He worked as a top analyst at the government's Department of Defense for more than 30 years. "It's a disaster waiting to happen."

Last month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the new bomber was of life and death importance. "I think the Long-Range Strike Bomber is absolutely essential," he said.

## Plane Would Put People To Work

For elected officials across the country, however, the bomber means one thing: jobs. They mainly want to know what their state will get out of the deal.

There are few places where the new bomber is more important than in Palmdale, California. The airplane makers have each told local officials that they would build many of the parts in the area.

The Palmdale area has built many of the nation's airplanes. Towns are still struggling to recover jobs they lost when the economy took a bad turn in 2008.

The two competing teams of airplane manufacturers are led by Northrop Grumman and Boeing Company. The project is secret. Neither one can talk about it, said Palmdale Mayor James Ledford. "But we can."

According to Ledford, Northrop said it would build most of the bomber parts in Palmdale. It would create about 1,500 jobs.

Lockheed Martin Corporation is working with Boeing. It would also work on the new warplane in Palmdale, Ledford said. That could bring 700 new jobs to the area.

"It would be the answer to all our prayers," said R. Rex Parris, mayor of neighboring Lancaster, California. The town says that 10.7 percent of people there are unemployed, more than the state average.

## Hiding From The Enemy

The Air Force will make the final decision over building the plane. Air Force officials say they need the bomber. It would fly so secretly that it could avoid the most advanced enemy radar. The warplane would eventually be able to carry nuclear weapons. Officials said they want to fly it with remote controls as a drone.

Other details are a closely guarded secret.

Military officials have promised to not spend more than $550 million per plane. The Defense Department included $1.2 billion for the bombers in this year's budget. The Air Force plans to order as many as 100 of the new planes as soon as late spring.

Boeing, Northrup and Lockheed have all previously won government contracts to build planes. The warplanes ended up costing far more than originally planned.

Northrop developed the first B-2 stealth bomber, a black boomerang-shaped plane. It cost so much to make that the government built just 21 of the 132 aircraft it had ordered. Each one cost more than $2 billion.

## It's Good Business

Todd Harrison is an expert at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. He thinks the new stealth bomber program would ultimately cost $90 billion. That comes to about $900 million for each plane.

A government office has repeatedly said the new bomber is not necessary. In 2013, it said the government should wait 10 years before building the plane. In that time, new technology would be invented to improve the design.

Lancaster Mayor Parris really wants the government to build the bomber. From his point of view, it would create jobs throughout the area, including at restaurants, stores and other companies.

"It would be so great," he said, "to see it all come back."
