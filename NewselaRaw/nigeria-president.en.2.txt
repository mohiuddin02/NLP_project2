KADUNA, Nigeria — It is a historic moment for Nigeria, Africa's richest and most heavily populated nation. No opposition candidate here has managed to defeat a current president during 16 years of democracy. Now it has happened: the opposing candidate Muhammadu Buhari has won Nigeria's presidency.

This will not be Buhari's first time as leader of Nigeria. He was once the country's dictator — its absolute ruler — until being overthrown in 1985.

Buhari, 72, will face major difficulties when he assumes office. The country's northeast is being attacked by a violent rebel group known as Boko Haram. Poverty is widespread, and many government officials are corrupt and will accept bribes in return for favors.

## A "New Nigeria"

President Goodluck Jonathan called his rival to congratulate him Tuesday night. His friendly call could be an important step toward limiting post-election violence. About 1,000 people were killed in disputes over the 2011 presidential contest.

For years, it appeared to many here that Jonathan's People's Democratic Party would rule Nigeria for the foreseeable future. A sense of hopelessness set in for Nigerians, particularly in the country's troubled north. For years Jonathan neglected the mounting Boko Haram uprising and did little to develop the country's poorest communities.

The election of a former dictator might not seem like good news for a young democratic country. However, Buhari seems to offer what many Nigerians have been pleading for. He is a retired general who has promised a large-scale campaign against Boko Haram. He also has a plan to end widespread corruption.

Buhari has run for president four times in the past 12 years. Before now, he had never come close. By the time he gave his victory speech in Abuja, the capital, commentators on Nigerian television channels were talking about a "new Nigeria."

People in this country of 170 million have waited anxiously since Saturday's vote for both the results and the public reaction to them. Supporters of each major party have threatened violence if their candidate loses. The military has been sent to areas of concern in preparation for unrest.

## Facing An Enormous Challenge

In the northern state of Kaduna, people celebrated in the streets, dancing, performing tricks on their motorcycles and screaming, "We need change." They listed what they hope will happen now that their party had finally won.

"The power supply will be constant," said Ibrahim Abu Bakar, 45.

"Boko Haram will be defeated," said Bello Mohammed, 30.

"Buhari will take care of unemployment," said Nurudeen Mukhtar, 27.

Buhari has lived in Kaduna for the better part of 30 years, since his military government was overthrown. His faded two-story home was dark Tuesday night, but a guard invited a journalist to walk around.

"Look at that old car — that's his only car," said Sergeant Garba Abdullahi, who had been posted at Buhari's gate by the Nigerian military. "He is a man of the people, not like the corrupt guys."

It will be an enormous challenge for Buhari to bring about rapid reform.

"Nigerians expect to see immediate change. They expect to see corruption end right away, but corruption is an institutional problem here. It is a way of life," said Idayat Hassan, director of Nigeria's Center for Democracy and Development.

## "A Military Man"

During his rule from 1984 to 1985, Buhari attempted to crack down on those he saw as guilty of corruption and other crimes. He set up military courts that sentenced hundreds of suspected criminals and allegedly crooked politicians to prison. Some viewed his actions as necessary, but many others considered them too harsh. He also limited the news media's freedom.

Buhari says he has changed in the years since he was dictator. He has traded his green military uniform for a traditional flowing robe. In a speech in London last month, he described himself as "a converted democrat who is ready to operate under democratic norms."

Buhari has been deeply critical of Jonathan's failure to defeat Boko Haram. The rebel group has grown steadily since 2009 and has killed at least 10,000 people. Buhari has played up his background as "a military man," saying it made him the best person to take on the rebels.

In the past two months, a military operation involving Niger, Cameroon and Chad has chased the rebels from many of their strongholds in the north. However, Buhari will now have to make sure the rebels are flushed from their rural hideouts.

"Boko Haram has been driven out of certain towns — but they haven't been defeated," said former U.S. Ambassador John Campbell.

Jonathan surprised many here when he accepted defeat without a fight. The election had been postponed for nearly two months, leading many to fear that Jonathan might resort to cheating to win reelection.

Before the polling, Jonathan announced in a radio broadcast that Nigerians should "graciously accept" the election outcome.

"My sense is that demonstrations will take place, but the level of violence won't be much," said Chom Bagu, an expert on political conflicts.
