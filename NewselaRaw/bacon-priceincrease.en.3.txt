LOS ANGELES â€” Like his father and grandfather before him, Lou DeRosa is a butcher.

His shop at the Los Angeles Farmers Market is selling more bacon than ever. The price has gone "crazy," DeRosa said.

"Prices go up every six months," DeRosa said. The prices are rising more quickly than other kinds of meat "because everyone is buying it," he said. His family has run Marconda's Meats butcher shop since 1941.

Bacon has become the country's most popular meat. Yet, a taste for bacon is becoming expensive. Since 2008, the price of bacon has risen more than three times faster than other goods. Bacon prices have gone up more than other types of meat, according to the government.

## The Drought Even Affected Bacon

The rising cost of bacon has several causes. California's three-year drought has made pig feed more expensive. Also, a new disease has killed about 7 million piglets since 2013. The nation's pork supply is down, said John Green. He is with the National Pork Board.

But mainly, he said, Americans are hungry for bacon.

In June, shoppers paid $6.11 on average for a pound of sliced bacon in grocery stores. That price is a record high, according to the government. Four years earlier, people paid $4.05 a pound on average.

At a grocery store, James McMenamin checked the price of bacon.

"It seems really expensive," McMenamin said, "but I still need that bacon fix."

Bacon prices are going up. Still, more people are buying it. In 2013, shoppers bought $4 billion worth of bacon. That amount set a record, according to Information Resources Inc. The company studies what people buy.

Bacon has a central place in America, said Ari Weinzweig. He is a bacon expert. He wrote "Zingerman's Guide to Better Bacon." People see it as a comfort food.

"It reminds us of childhood," he said.

## Chocolate Chip .. And Bacon?

Americans are adding bacon in unusual places. They put it in ice cream and sushi. They are also sprinkling bacon on chocolate chip cookies.

Bacon can also be found in Denny's maple bacon milkshake.

Since 2010, IHOP restaurants have added 23 dishes that include bacon. They have put bacon in "everything from bacon crepes to salads," said Marie Grimm. She is an IHOP vice president.

And another first: a bacon-and-cheddar-cheese waffle.

Grimm said that high bacon prices do have an effect on IHOP's business.

The high cost of bacon is making it harder for fast-food chains to make money. Bacon is in nearly half of the dishes at several fast-food restaurants.

## Paying More Should Equal More In Return

SpenDifference is a restaurant supply company. It found that 93 percent of restaurants plan to raise prices.

DeWayne Dove is a vice president of SpenDifference. Restaurants are already starting to charge customers more, he said.

Dove says customers are probably also getting less bacon.

Fast-food restaurants used to give diners three pieces of bacon. People now get two pieces for the same price, Dove said. Fast-food diners could soon be paying $6 for a bacon burger. They now pay almost $5.

Plenty of bacon lovers are willing to pay.

Jim Cascone said price does not matter when it comes to bacon. He is a butcher with Huntington Meats. The Los Angeles butcher shop sells 100 cases of bacon a week. In three years, Cascone has seen bacon sales go up 25 percent.

"No one ever questions the price," said Cascone. He charges about $7.99 a pound for applewood smoked bacon. The price is up from $4.99 four years ago. Cascone said that one of his customers just had a bacon party.

Josh Goldstein loves bacon. The 24-year-old says he eats half a pound of bacon every morning. Every Thanksgiving, he wraps his turkey in bacon. He has no plans to change, even if bacon prices go higher.

"It has definitely become more expensive, and I buy so much it does add up," Goldstein said. "But bacon is my medicine. It makes everything better."
