It was just a regular Friday morning in Chelyabinsk, Russia. Suddenly, a fireball raced across the sky. Minutes later, there was a huge explosion in the air. The force of the boom smashed windows. It blew the doors off buildings.

The blinding light and loud boom were caused by an asteroid. The rock was 50 feet wide. It entered the Earth's atmosphere at 40,000 miles per hour. It burned up in a flash before exploding 14 miles up in the air. Small parts of the asteroid have been found on the ground all around the region.

About 1,500 people were injured by the explosion. Most of the people were hurt by broken glass. Thousands of buildings were damaged.

## Russia's Surprise Guest

Scientists are worried that they did not know that the asteroid was coming. There was no way to warn people about the bright light or the big explosion. The incident was frightening. Yet if the rock had crashed into the Earth many more people would have been hurt.

Many people recorded videos of the meteor from their cars and offices. These dramatic videos have now been watched all around the world on the Internet.

## What To Do About A Huge Space Rock

Last week, politicians and scientists met to talk about dangerous asteroids. But the news from the meeting was not very hopeful.

Charles Bolden is the chief of NASA. He was asked what he could do about an asteroid that was heading toward Earth. "If it's coming in three weeks, pray," Bolden said.

NASA has found nearly all of the biggest asteroids that are floating in space near Earth. These rocks measure one kilometer or more through the middle. The experts are watching these huge rocks very closely. If one of these massive asteroids hits the planet, it could wipe out nearly every living plant and animal on Earth. This includes humans.

## The End Of The World

Scientist John Holdren said, "An asteroid of that size, or bigger, could end civilization."

Many experts believe that a huge rock crashed into Earth 66 million years ago. This changed the climate. Lots of scientists believe this killed off the dinosaurs.

Scientists are closely watching the big space rocks that could make humans extinct. But smaller asteroids could still cause huge damage if they crashed into our planet. These rocks are about 165 feet wide. They are nicknamed "city killers." One scientist estimated that there are 9,000 such asteroids that are not being tracked.

Bolden said that NASA has not gotten enough money from the government. He said the agency needs more funding to find the asteroids. Exploring space is very expensive. In recent years money has been in very short supply. The U.S. government has cut back on how much money it has given NASA.

Russia's asteroid experience gave NASA a chance to show why its work is important.

## How To Deflect Asteroids From Earth

Experts have studied ways to stop an asteroid. They could blow up the rock with explosives. It could be smashed with a heavy object. Rockets could fire lasers at it. Some experts think we could use the power of the sun to break it up. Other scientists have suggested attaching big weights to the asteroid. This would change its path.

All of these plans would require advanced warning. For this reason many groups of scientists are working on spotting the space rocks sooner. They are researching better telescopes and ways to track asteroids.

NASA may not have enough money. But there is still a lot of brainpower working hard to protecting Earth from asteroids. And it is not just in the United States. Experts in Russia are researching a new program to defend against space threats. It is expected to start by 2018.

When it comes to research, world cooperation matters. Asteroids do not care which country they strike. The planet is all in it together.
