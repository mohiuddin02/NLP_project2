WASHINGTON â€” For decades, Asian-Americans have lived mainly on the coasts of the United States. In recent years, thousands have moved to the South, remaking communities in the process.

Between 2000 and 2010, Asian-Americans were the fastest-growing ethnic group in the South. The Asian-American population there increased 69 percent during that period, according to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which advocates on behalf of the community.

The growth in the Asian-American population in the South has outpaced the increases in every other region. In the Midwest, the Asian-American population grew 47 percent, in the Northeast it grew 45 percent, and in the West it increased 36 percent. By comparison, the Latino population gained 57 percent in the South.

## Latino Population Growth Overtaken

State by state, the growth is even more striking. Some states saw their Asian-American populations nearly double between 2000 and 2010, and in Georgia and North Carolina the increases were more than 80 percent. The average growth among the 16 Southern states and the District of Columbia was 63 percent. Twelve states and the District saw increases of 50 percent or more.

The growth in certain metropolitan areas was even more dramatic, even if the Asian-American percentage of the overall population remains small.

In Atlanta, Asian-Americans make up just 5 percent of the population, while Latinos make up 10 percent. The city's population increased 24 percent between 2000 and 2010, but the Asian-American population soared 88 percent and the Latino population more than doubled.

The explosive growth presents several dilemmas for state and local governments. They now have to educate students who don't speak English as a first language and translate official documents to providing housing assistance to refugees. Compared with other parts of the country, some states in the South have little experience in hosting large immigrant communities.

## The South's Changing Political Face

The Asian-American newcomers, most of whom moved from liberal states on the coasts, also could change the political face of the conservative South.

In Virginia, for example, the number of Asian-Americans registered to vote increased 136 percent from 2004 to 2012. The number actually casting ballots skyrocketed 180 percent. In Georgia, registered Asian-American voters doubled, while turnout increased 168 percent.

The trend also extends to Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, who saw population growth of 66 percent in the South.

Arkansas saw an increase in Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders of 151 percent from 2000 to 2010, due in large part to arrivals of people from the Marshall Islands.

## Diverse Ethnic Groups And Trends

There are many reasons for the demographic trend, because there are so many different groups making the move. The Census Bureau tracks 23 different ethnic groups under the Asian-American umbrella, and 19 others are counted as part of the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders population, a separate group, according to the Census.

That variety makes pinpointing a specific explanation for the growth difficult. Marita Etcubanez of Asian Americans Advancing Justice says many of those moving to the South are chasing economic opportunity and a cheaper cost of living.

"People are willing to settle wherever opportunity is available to them," Etcubanez said.

The opportunities pursued can vary widely, though, Etcubanez and other experts said. For example, refugees from parts of Southeast Asia are likely to have very different backgrounds and qualifications than a highly educated professional from India.

C.N. Le is director of the Asian &amp; Asian American Studies Certificate Program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He mentioned prominent universities in North Carolina as a draw for more highly educated Asian-Americans that contributed to the state's 85 percent growth, the highest in the region.

## Language And Other Challenges

New populations can create problems for public officials, and language barriers are perhaps the most prominent example. One school district in Georgia has 111 different languages spoken nearby. Some cities in Georgia are encouraging Asian-American-owned businesses to have signs in English, so law enforcement will know where to go in an emergency.

An older Asian-American population is another challenge. Those tracking the trend say the number of elderly Asian-Americans in the region is increasing alongside the overall population. As the cheaper cost of living draws retirees, an increasing demand for elder care and health care can pose challenges.

How well each state is positioned to deal with these challenges and others will vary as well, in part, based on cultural and political realities and history of immigration. Some, like Tennessee, have long been a destination for refugees, and might be better positioned to respond to a changing population.

"Many of these states don't have as long of history of immigration," said Chris Kromm of the Institute for Southern Studies, a civil rights advocacy group. "A lot of them are catching up, and it takes a lot more to turn the ship."

## Courting Political Allegiances

Members of political parties are already trying to take advantage of the changes and meet the demands of a new and fast-growing population. Political allegiances of Asian-American communities could be up for grabs.

Asian-Americans, like most minority voting groups, currently trend Democratic. Those who study the community's politics believe Republicans may be able to chip away at the Democratic advantage.

There are already two high-profile Asian-American politicians in the South. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley are both Republicans who have downplayed their ethnicity.

Southern politicians need to pay attention to Asian-Americans in the future, said Janelle Wong, director of Asian American studies at the University of Maryland.

For the first time, the location of Asian-American communities will help them get political attention, she said. "That could change a lot."
