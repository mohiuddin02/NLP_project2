BALTIMORE — Real estate agents are using drones to sell homes. [Drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) are small aircraft that do not have pilots.

The agents use the machines to take pictures of houses and buildings.

Robert McArtor sells homes near Baltimore. He has a drone.

McArtor´s drone looks like a small helicopter. It carries a camera mounted on its belly. The drone flies around houses. It goes pretty high up.

It took many hours of practice for McArtor to learn how to fly the machine. But his clients have been really impressed with the pictures, he said.

He hopes more people will learn to use the drones to sell all kinds of places.

## Not So Fast, There Are Rules!

But the U.S. government does not allow people to use a drone to sell things.

The government office that controls U.S. airspace is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It has been working since 2008 on rules for drones. It expects to publish final regulations this year.

Groups interested in working with the planes are not sure about what to do right now.

One of these groups is the National Association of Realtors. The association represents real estate workers. It asked its members to stop using drones for now. It has also asked the FAA to come out with the final rules soon.

Less Dorr is the spokesman for the FAA. He said the agency spends most of its time answering questions about drones.

Dorr said the regulations will help protect people, houses and buildings. But the rules can't be too hard to follow because that would make it difficult for people to use the no-pilot planes.

## More Are On The Way

The FAA said that 7,500 drones may have a license to fly by 2018.

Other groups say the number of drones flying around the country will be much higher. Some say 160,000 drones will be sold every year by 2020.

For now, the number of drones used to sell homes is small. But it is growing.

MRIS is a company that puts together lists of thousands of houses and buildings that are being sold.

It found out that only a very small number of agents used drones to sell properties. But more agents are thinking about using them.

The drones could make buying and selling homes easier, said Andrew Strauch. He is a vice president at MRIS.

"We're visual people," he said.

## Get The Whole Picture

The drones are very helpful when people are selling large properties. Buyers like having a complete view of the area.

Ron Howard works for Re/Max Preferred. He paid a company that uses drones to take pictures of a large home he was selling in 2012.

The company is called Elevated Element and takes pictures and makes videos of houses and other properties. The price it charges for the service starts at $199.

Hiring a photographer and a plane is more expensive. It can cost about $350.

The service was cheap and allowed "closer images," Howard said. Most of the houses he is selling are in the city. For those homes he uses images found on Google.
