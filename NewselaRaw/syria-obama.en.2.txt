ST. PETERSBURG, Russia — U.S. President Barack Obama said the world's credibility "is on the line" when it comes to punishing Syrian President Bashar Assad for his government's supposed use of poison gas.

Can the world be believed when leaders say they will punish somebody for doing something wrong?

Obama said a year ago that Assad would be crossing a "red line" if he used poison gas against rebels trying to take his power away.

Speaking at a press conference Wednesday in Stockholm, Sweden, Obama said the "red line" is not his. He said the world's countries set that standard. Assad must be punished for that standard to mean anything, he said.

## Not Many Countries Support A Strike

"I didn't set a red line; the world set a red line," Obama said. "My credibility's not on the line. The international community's credibility is on the line. And America and Congress's credibility's on the line."

From Sweden, Obama heads to a global economic meeting in Russia. He will try to get support for a U.S. missile strike against Syria at the meeting.

It will not be easy. Not many countries support Obama's plan to fire missiles at Syria. At least not yet. Some are worried about getting into another war in the area without knowing all the facts, like what happened in the Iraq war.

The United Nations is still testing samples from Syria. It plans to say if poison gas was used, but not which side used it.

At the press conference, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt came out against the use of poison gas. But he also said Sweden wants United Nations involvement and a political resolution to the killing in Syria. A civil war has raged in the Middle Eastern country for two years.

"This small country will always say 'Let's put our hope into the United Nations, let us push on some more to get a better situation,'" he said.

## "The Moral Thing To Do"

Obama defended his push for a strike. He pointed out the death of children from exposure to poison gas.

"The moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing," Obama said. "I do have to ask people if in fact you're outraged by the slaughter of innocent people, what are you doing about it?"

Obama has chosen to act before a U.N. investigation is completed. But he said U.S. intelligence shows there's no doubt that the Assad government used poison gas.

"Keep in mind I'm somebody who opposed the war in Iraq, and I'm not interested in repeating mistakes about basing decisions on faulty intelligence," Obama said.

The press conference came hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States against military strikes in Syria without U.N. approval. He was speaking to The Associated Press.

Russia has routinely vetoed punishment against Syria in the United Nations. But Putin did not rule out supporting a U.N. resolution in favor of military strikes. But there must be proof that the Syrian government used poison gas, he said.

He made clear he had doubts, calling it "absolutely absurd" that the government would use chemical weapons at a time when it was closing in on the rebels.

## Obama And Putin To Talk Informally

In the interview, Putin insisted he and Obama could have constructive talks — even though he said he was disappointed Obama canceled a meeting with him in Moscow.

A White House official said that Putin and Obama would likely be able to talk informally during the summit.

Obama will hold formal meetings with the leaders of China, Japan and France.

Putin downplayed his frosty relationship Obama, which Russia analysts have said is among the worst in U.S.-Russian and U.S.-Soviet leader relationships.

"President Obama hasn't been elected by the American people in order to be pleasant to Russia," Putin told the AP. "And your humble servant hasn't been elected by the people of Russia to be pleasant to someone either."

Putin added, "We work, we argue about some issues. We are human. Sometimes one of us gets vexed. But I would like to repeat once again that global mutual interests form a good basis for finding a joint solution to our problems."
