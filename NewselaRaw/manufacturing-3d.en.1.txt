EAST HARTFORD, Conn. — For decades, aerospace manufacturers like Pratt & Whitney have fabricated engine parts by tooling, lathing, milling and forging.

Now, they're printing.

Unlike that laser printer at home, there is no toner, no paper and no "PC Load Letter" errors.

Instead of ink, these printers — called 3-D printers — use lasers to heat granules of plastic or metal to build up three-dimensional parts, layer by layer. The end product could be any solid design, however complex.

Aerospace manufacturers are extending the limits of this technology to make parts for their latest commercial engines. This process is letting manufacturers design components that would have been impossible to mill or forge in yesterday's aerospace factories, while saving money. In some cases, the process makes parts lighter.

## "Progress ... Even A Milestone"

And for 3-D printing the fact that the emerging technology has passed through the testing fires of a jet engine is a good sign.

Tom Maloney of the Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology, which aids manufacturers who want to use the technology, said, "It's definitely progress … even call it a milestone."

Pratt & Whitney put more than two dozen 3-D-printed components on its latest PurePower geared turbofan engine, said Thomas Prete, the company's head of engineering. More are expected.

Pratt's main competitor, GE Aviation, is using 3-D printing to make complex fuel nozzles for an engine. Prete said that Pratt's designers can now make a single part in one process that otherwise would have been a time-consuming combination of five or 10 pieces that needed to be attached and heat-treated. That improvement alone saves time and money.

But the main advantage, Prete said, is that engine designers can do things that would have been impossible. In the past, an engineer could design something that might have been too complicated to make.

With the new technology, it's just as easy to make something complex as it is to make something simple. It's like firing up the inkjet to print out a copy of "The Mona Lisa" compared to using it to print a solid color. It doesn't take more time or more ink to print out the one that is significantly more complex.

And a wide, practical view of the technology, to the military, is the ability to print replacement parts, supplies and perhaps even structures for military bases with just a machine and a supply of material. That ability could transform an aircraft carrier into a "floating factory" that could supply replacement parts to a broken tank or an aircraft.

## The Next Big Step

Pratt bought a fleet of 3-D printers in 1988 to design prototype engine parts.

The machines spat out plastic prototypes for testing and development and, once they were deemed to be of optimal design, engineers milled or forged a metal version. In the past four or five years, as technology has advanced, Pratt adopted metal 3-D printing prototyping. This speeds things up and saves money.

Pratt wouldn't reveal which specific parts were being printed because the information is proprietary. But Prete said that some of the 25 parts are simple, such as brackets, and others are more complicated components in the engine's air pathway, a high-temperature and constant-stress area of the engine.

Industrializing the technology to the point that it will withstand the jet engine environment has been quite the process, experts say. Materials and processes must be unimpeachable and consistent. Costs need to make sense economically, and output needs to keep up with traditional manufacturing methods.

For Pratt, 3-D printing parts at production speed is the next big step. The company is determining how many machines it needs, how they need to be arranged, and how to get to optimal output.

In November, GE Aviation acquired a Cincinnati-based 3-D printing firm. Months ago, GE announced that it would be 3-D printing the fuel nozzles on its commercial LEAP engine.

When the parts were manufactured traditionally, they were made of 18 parts fused together. Now they are made as one part and come out 18 percent lighter.

Additive manufacturing and subtractive manufacturing are the yin and yang of making things. Think of additive like building something with Lego blocks; you put small pieces together to make something larger.

Subtractive manufacturing, which includes milling and lathing, is more like sculpting — you start with a block or marble, and chip and shave away until a statue, or engine part, emerges.

## Supercomputing Power Helps

Much of manufacturing currently falls in this second category, but that's changing. In 2012, the 3-D printing industry expanded 28.6 percent to a $2.2 billion slice of the economy, according to an analysis released in May by Wohler Associates. By 2021, the firm expects the industry to be worth $10.1 billion.

Putting these components into jet engines is just what the advanced manufacturing industry has been waiting for: a serious proving ground that shows that mainstream manufacturers have figured out how to make the materials and the process work.

It's one thing to print a toy, and it's another thing altogether to manufacture a metal part that will hold up under thousands of degrees of temperature, constant stress and years of operation.

Experts say that the technology is finding a way into big industrial uses now because of research into metals and materials for 3-D printing, as well as explosive growth in supercomputing power.

With 3-D printing maturing to the point where critical parts can be made with the press of a button, the military is nearing its dream of using 3-D printers as a mobile factory.

Lt. Cmdr. Michael Llenza of the U.S. Navy wrote in a May article in the Armed Forces Journal that possibilities for 3-D printed products include, but are not limited to, vehicles parts, [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), ammunition, shelters, prosthetics, skin and bone grafts, and food. Yes, a 3-D-printed pork chop.
