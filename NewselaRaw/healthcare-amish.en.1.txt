GORDONVILLE, Pa. - Debate over U.S. health care reform has gripped the nation and led to a government shutdown, but it matters little in rural Pennsylvania's Amish country.

There is a very simple reason for this. Along with rejecting cars and many other modern technologies, Pennsylvania's Amish have effectively opted out of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.

A little-known provision of the law exempts these communities from the so-called individual mandate, which requires most Americans to purchase health insurance in some form. This exemption has its roots in a 1950s battle over Social Security.

But it is not the idea of health insurance the Amish reject. Their close-knit communities essentially insure themselves.

## Church Aid And Benefit Auctions

"We have our own health care," said a retired Amish carpenter. Like other Amish interviewed for this story, he asked that his name not be used because of a traditional dislike for bringing attention to oneself.

"They (hospitals) give you a bill," he said. "If you can't pay it, your church will."

The Amish system is a little more complicated than that. Some 280,000 people, mostly the descendants of 18th-century German immigrants, live in Amish communities scattered through the United States. The largest populations are found in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.

While practices vary by community, most Amish fund their health care through a system that merges church aid, benefit auctions and negotiated discounts with local hospitals. Typically, hospitals are promised quick cash payment in exchange for lower rates.

"The way they come together to pay for health care is amazing," said Jan Bergen, chief operating officer at Lancaster General Health. "Their sense of responsibility extends beyond themselves and to the community."

## "We Want To Pay Our Own Way"

The roots of the Amish exemption from Obamacare go back nearly 60 years, to a decision by Congress to extend the Social Security tax to the self-employed and to farmers. Many Amish at the time refused to pay the new taxes and the Internal Revenue Service moved to enforce the law, sometimes with terrible public relations consequences.

"There was an Amish guy who refused to pay Social Security. IRS agents confiscated his horses while he was out in the field plowing," said Donald Kraybill, author of "The Amish" and a professor at Elizabethtown College.

In 1965, Congress passed a law giving Amish religious orders the right to opt out of Social Security, Medicaid and a host of other government benefits.

"The basic religious reason driving their resistance is that, as a religious faith, the church community should take care of its own members," said Kraybill. "If there's a disaster like a tornado, fire or hospital bill, the community should come together for that."

The Obamacare exemption is an extension of the Social Security exemption.

"We don't want government paying for our things," said an Amish man from Kinzers, Pa. "We want to pay our own way." He said his community relies on two funds. Nearly every family contributes monthly to a hospital aid fund, while large bills are also paid with free-will offerings.

## Farm Work Keeps Amish Healthy

To help hospitals keep track, some Amish carry benefit cards, which identify them as members of a community but do not bear names or photographs.

"It simply says they're a participant," said Eric Buck, president of Preferred Health Care, which manages the Old Order Group coverage plan for Lancaster County Amish.

One factor that helps keep medical bills down is that farm work and other manual labor keep the Amish active for most of their lives. Thus they are less likely to develop diabetes and heart disease among other illnesses that plague the often-sedentary U.S. population, said Bergen, the hospital executive.

Amish children are more prone to recessive genetic disorders, however, the result of belonging to a small population with high rates of intermarriage.

For the largest bills, Amish communities often turn to benefit auctions, nicknamed "mud sales" because of the fields where they are held.

At a recent Saturday auction in Gordonville, young Amish men bid used buggies up to more than $4,000. Hand-made quilts sold for several hundred dollars each.

Most mud sales and auctions benefit specific institutions. The one in Gordonville helped pay bills for a volunteer ambulance company. But a series of five held across the state each year help fund the Clinic for Special Children, a world-class pediatric genetics clinic.

Many Amish at the auction said they had relied on hospital aid to pay their medical bills.

"It's not stressful," said an Amish man at the auction. "It's there when you need it."
