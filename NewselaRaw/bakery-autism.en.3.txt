EVANSTON, Ill. â€” Drew McDonough walks quickly past huge bags of brown sugar and tubs of chocolate frosting. He puts on his bakery clothes. Then he speed-walks toward his work table.

McDonough's boss at the bakery asked him about his weekend. He responded with short one-word answers. He barely looked her in the eye. That was fine with his boss, Jean Kroll. She owns the Sugar & Spice Extraordinary Sweet Treats bakery.

For the rest of his workday, the quiet, dark-haired 27-year-old moved quickly. He boxed cakes, stacked them on a hand cart and labeled them for shipment. When he finished, he carefully swept the floor.

## "It's Nice, But It's Also Smart"

McDonough has autism. Autism affects a person's social skills and ability to communicate. Many people with autism do not work. The fact that he has a job at the bakery is "probably a miracle," he said.

"It feels as happy as can be," McDonough added.

This past summer, McDonough and two other men with autism arrived at the bakery. They learned to measure sugar and package cakes. As they did, a student from Northwestern University carefully checked how much work they got done. The student wanted to figure out if it made good business sense to hire a worker with a disability like autism.

For Kroll, that was an important question.

Small businesses need their workers to be able to do the job, she said. They can't afford to hire an employee just to help him.

The story of how she offered jobs to the three men with autism is one of luck and goodwill. It was also, according to Kroll, a good business decision.

People always tell Kroll "That's such a nice thing to do." Kroll answers them, "Yes it is nice, but it's also a smart thing to do."

## Helping Those With Autism Have Dreams

Two years ago, Kroll's bakery moved near an organization called Have Dreams. The group helps people with autism.

Shortly after the move, Kroll heard that people with autism needed job training. She invited five men with autism to help her put together cookie boxes.

For a year and a half, they came every week.

There was a tall, blond-haired man named Zach, who loved to talk and ask questions. Michael was playful and made jokes. Jimmy could put labels on boxes as fast as anyone.

One day, someone at Have Dreams asked if Kroll might have other jobs for them.

Kroll's answer was a definite "No."

## Having A Job "Feels Fabulous"

After she went home that night, she was angry at herself for saying that. She and Have Dreams came up with a job training program at the bakery.

They hope it will be successful. If it is, other businesses could be convinced to hire people with disabilities.

On June 24, three men arrived at the bakery. By the end of the six weeks, they worked almost as quickly as a regular bakery worker. Kroll decided that she could start offering them jobs.

Now, McDonough spends his days among the huge kettles of buttery toffee.

Having a job, he said, "feels fabulous."

## Doing The Right Thing

After the workday ended, Kroll stood in the bakery. A pile of orders for cookies and cakes were in her hand. "It was a great day. A really nice, regular day," she said.

McDonough is a great worker. What's more, she said, he has helped her business get bigger. As he develops more skills, she said, he will earn raises "just like everyone else."

"This is a good business decision," she said. It just so happens, she added, that hiring people with autism is the right thing to do.
