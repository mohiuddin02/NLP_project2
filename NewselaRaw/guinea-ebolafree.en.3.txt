CONAKRY, Guinea — For two years, the West African country of Guinea has been hit hard by the terrible disease Ebola. The disease is caused by the Ebola virus. A virus is a kind of germ.

Ebola spreads from person to person. It causes high fevers and bleeding inside the body. About half the people who catch the disease die.

On Tuesday, Guinea finally got some good news. The country was declared free of Ebola. Doctors from around the world have been working hard to stop the virus from spreading. 

The Ebola outbreak was the deadliest ever recorded. It began in Guinea in December 2013. Then, it quickly spread to the neighboring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone. So far, the virus has killed more than 11,300 people.

## No New Cases In 21 Days

Now at last the outbreak seems to be under control. No new known cases have been reported anywhere in the world in at least 21 days. 

Sierra Leone was declared free of Ebola on Nov. 7. If Liberia has no new cases before Jan. 14, it too will be declared free of the disease. The outbreak could then be completely over everywhere.

However, experts warn there could still be new cases.

"We definitely cannot let our guard down," said Dr. Tom Frieden. "It's certainly possible we will have more cases" in the next few months, he said.

## Celebration Has Some Sadness, Too

On Tuesday, about 50 people who managed to beat the disease gathered to celebrate in the Guinean city of Conakry. With them were reporters and relatives of some who died of Ebola. The mood was happy, but there was also sadness.

"Guinea is a blessed country," said Ibrahima Sow, who beat the disease. Sow said he hopes no other terrible disease outbreak will strike the country. 

Mariam Camara had tears in her eyes. She said the country had lost some of its best to Ebola, including her mother and brother. The two were among the more than 2,500 people who died in Guinea.

"That cursed disease separated me from that which is most beautiful to me in my life," she said. "But it's over."

## Outbreak Lasted Longer In Guinea

Guinea will hold a big celebration Wednesday, hosted by President Alpha Conde. Later, popular West African musicians such as Youssou N'Dour and Tiken Jah Fakoly will perform at a concert in the capital.

An Ebola outbreak is considered over when a country gets through two incubation periods with no new cases. An incubation period is the time it takes for someone to become sick once they catch the virus. For Ebola, the incubation period lasts 21 days. 

Guinea had the fewest Ebola cases of the three countries. However, its bigger size allowed the outbreak to last longer. Also, many here fear doctors and nurses, who are thought to spread disease. Some sick people hid from doctors instead of getting treated, which may have made the disease spread more.

## Animals Could Still Carry Virus

Doctors warned there could still be animals carrying the Ebola virus. If so, the disease could still be passed on to humans.

"That's why it's so important these countries be ready" for any new cases, Frieden said.

Frieden said doctors from around the world are working on ways to stop the disease from returning. He said they are setting up new laboratories that can test for Ebola. Trained doctors and nurses within the three West African countries will help stop the disease from spreading again. They will make sure tests to spot the disease are given quickly.

"The world needs to be ready," Frieden said.

However, for now Guinea has good reason to celebrate. It has beaten back a terrible disease. If all goes well, the worst may now be over.
