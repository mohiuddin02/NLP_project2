MINNEAPOLIS â€” Last week, Minnesota school bus driver George Nathaniel was fired for leading kids on his bus in Christian prayers. He had been warned to stop, but kept on doing it anyhow. Nathaniel sees the firing as a violation of his freedom of speech.

Nathaniel, 49, is also a pastor. He leads two Minneapolis churches. He was in his second year as a school bus driver for Durham School Services. It's the bus company that employed him.

After someone from the school district complained about the prayer, Durham gave Nathaniel a warning, he said. It then assigned him bus routes at two different schools.

The warning didn't stop Nathaniel. "I let them know I am a pastor and I am going to pray," Nathaniel said.

## A Song And Then Prayer

Nathaniel continued to lead prayers on his new routes, so on Oct. 30 Durham fired him.

The Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that it's against the Constitution for public schools to lead students in prayer. Since then, this ruling has been expanded to include anyone working for a school.

Courts have said that school prayer goes against the First Amendment. This states that the government may not establish an official religion.

Nathaniel says he wasn't doing the children any harm. "To fire a bus driver for praying for the safety of the children" is not right, he said.

Durham spokeswoman Molly Hart said the company doesn't have its own rules about prayer. But the school district has the right to have a driver removed if it finds him or her wrong for the job.

Nathaniel prayed in the seven-minute ride to school after the last child got on board. "We start out with a song," he said. "Then each person will pray if they want to pray. If they don't want to pray they don't have to pray. Then I will pray and ask them if they want to join me in prayer. Just give them something constructive and positive to go to school with." He said he prayed on the route all last year as well.

## Right To Pray, But Not On School Bus

Lawyer Teresa Nelson said Nathaniel "has the right to pray on his own time." But he doesn't have the right to pray with "a captive audience of kids on a school bus." Doing that, she said, is forbidden by the First Amendment.

Lawyer Marshall Tanick agrees. Nathaniel has the right to express his views, he said, as long as they aren't forced upon others.

The problem, Tanick said, is that Nathaniel is a figure in a position of power over the students who ride his bus. What he did could be seen as forcing the students to pray.

But Tanick said it's confusing, and there is no clear answer.

Gayla Colin has been a bus driver in the district for 13 years. She says she sees her time on the bus with kids as part of the school day. Though she is a Christian, she would never think of praying on the bus. "That belongs at home," she said.

People living in the district come from all sorts of backgrounds, Colin said. Some bus routes are made up mostly of Muslim students.

## A Parent Concerned, Another Not

Sanaa Hersi, whose family is Muslim, has a child who rides a bus home from a school Nathaniel drives for. She said she would be concerned about prayer on the bus. "That would confuse the kids because we teach them to pray in the Islam way."

But Nikki Williams, whose three children also go to the same school, feels differently. "It wouldn't bother me at all," she said, if a bus driver prayed with students.

"I think if someone is praying, they can either be included in it or not," she said. "If they don't like it, they can just ignore it."

Nathaniel said he talked to parents as he saw them at bus stops. He let them know he was a pastor and asked if it would be OK for him to pray with the kids on the bus. "The parents I talked with, they were in agreement that I was doing fine."

Nathaniel said he had driven school buses in Wisconsin and Georgia before coming to Minnesota. On those routes, he had always prayed with the kids.

"We got to get Christians to be able to be Christians and not have to be closet Christians," he said. "You have something good, you are going to share it with somebody."
