Encyclopaedia Britannica is looking to regain its place as the king of reference libraries.

The 246-year-old company is moving to offer its entire online encyclopedia for free. It believes a free site will click with a new generation accustomed to looking for information online.

Jorge Cauz, Encyclopaedia Britannica's president, believes people would prefer to use Britannica over other online encyclopedias. "Whenever Britannica appears on search engines, we have a pretty amazing click-through rate," he said. A click-through rate is when someone clicks on an online link to see more pages on a website.

## Door To Door No More

Armies of door-to-door salesmen used to sell the expensive multivolume sets to families around the world. More than two years ago, the company stopped publishing its print edition. Britannica's online version has struggled to compete with Wikipedia. The other online encyclopedia offers articles on just about everything for free.

So far, Cauz has let the public view about half of Britannica's articles at no charge. He hopes this will increase the number of readers. Two years ago, only 20 percent of the articles were free, while the rest could only be seen by paying subscribers.

About 50,000 households pay $70 annually to see the entire encyclopedia online. Another 450,000 get it for free through partners such as telephone companies and Internet providers. The number of subscribers has remained the same, although fewer people pay for subscriptions, Cauz said. Meanwhile, the number of people reading the encyclopedia online has more than doubled. The company earns money from paid ads on its site.

Britannica is finding that what worked on paper doesn't necessarily succeed online, according to media expert Ken Doctor.

## Online Advertising Cash Potential

This year, Britannica websites will earn about $13 million from advertising. That's up 70 percent since 2010. The company owns Britannica.com, Merriam-Webster.com and more than 20 other websites.

Cauz said Britannica could potentially earn hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars from online advertising. "It doesn't mean that we are going to be able to do that overnight," he said.

Britannica.com is on track for 12 million visitors to its website in September. Two years ago, just 4.7 million people looked at the site, the company said. Many students are expected to visit the site in October to do their schoolwork. However, Britannica.com goes beyond homework help to get people to use it, offering photo galleries, quizzes and "listicles." The last combines lists with articles.

Doctor said that viewers have to look at many pages for the company to make money from advertising. The more people look at a site, the more a company can charge advertisers to place ads.

## The Printing Presses Stopped

Britannica was founded in Scotland nearly 250 years ago and has been based in Chicago since 1935. Sold door to door for generations, more than 100,000 encyclopedia sets were sold as recently as 1990. That year was the company's best ever, earning it $650 million.

Book sales fell when people began getting their information online. The company was sold in late 1995 to a businessman, who ended its door-to-door sales.

With the start of Wikipedia in 2001, the writing was on the wall for Encyclopaedia Britannica. Cauz, a native of Mexico City, took charge of the company in 2003 and began focusing on the $10 billion U.S. educational market. The company stopped publishing the printed version of the encyclopedia in 2012.

The educational business now earns 90 percent of the company's income and nearly all of its profit. It also produces Britannica School, ImageQuest and "Pathways: Science."

## Popularity Contest

The company's income is up nearly 10 percent this year, but Britannica.com is barely making enough money to cover its expenses, Cauz said. Its goal is to become more popular than Wikipedia.

Britannica is the underdog in that contest. Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia website written by volunteers, has nearly 4.6 million articles in English. Britannica has 106,000.

Where Britannica outclasses Wikipedia is through its editing process, Cauz said. Like Wikipedia, volunteers contribute to the database. The difference is that each Britannica article is approved by professionals who make sure it is accurate. With Wikipedia, anyone can write or change an article. Wikipedia entries are not always accurate.

People know, Cauz said, that knowledge and truth matter.

Britannica has added about 2,900 new articles this year and includes roughly 5,000 videos.

## Improving Search List Placing

On basic subjects, Britannica covers most of the same subjects as Wikipedia. Finding its articles, though, can be more difficult.

A Google search for Abraham Lincoln, for example, came up with nearly 3.5 million results, with a Wikipedia entry at the top of page 1. The Britannica entry was near the middle of page 2. A click on the Britannica link revealed a full, free article.

The Britannica page also featured video and other ads for everything from Home Depot to a Chicago law office. Wikipedia has no paid advertising.

Cauz hopes Britannica "becomes an anchor on the Web for people that are wanting to learn and know. It can be very, very profitable."
