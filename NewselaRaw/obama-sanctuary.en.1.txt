WASHINGTONâ€”President Barack Obama announced the creation of a marine sanctuary Tuesday that would close a large swath of the central Pacific to fishing and energy development. The sanctuary designation was part of a series of measures to protect parts of the world's oceans.

The plan would require federal agencies to come up with plans to deal with pollution, overfishing and acidification of ocean water. [Climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) is driving ocean waters to become more acidic.

"Rising levels of carbon dioxide are causing our oceans to acidify. Pollution endangers marine life. Overfishing threatens whole species," Obama said in statement to an international conference on ocean policy. The conference was hosted by the State Department in Washington.

"If we ignore these problems, if we drain our oceans of their resources, we won't just be squandering one of humanity's greatest treasures. We'll be cutting off one of the world's major sources of food and economic growth, including for the United States."

## Action Draws Quick Criticism

The announcement showed Obama's willingness to use his authority as president to take action in the face of Congressional opposition. It quickly drew criticism from congressional Republicans, who argue the administration overregulates natural resources industries. They also say the president has overreached his constitutional powers.

"This is yet another example of how an imperial president is intent on taking unilateral action, behind closed doors, to impose new regulations and layers of restrictive red-tape," said U.S. Rep. Doc Hastings, a Republican from Washington. Hastings is the House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee chairman. "Oceans, like our federal lands, are intended to be multiple-use and open for a wide range of economic activities," he said. This includes fishing, recreation, conservation and energy production, he said.

Among the plan's most ambitious and controversial steps would be the expansion of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument southwest of Hawaii. In January 2009, President George W. Bush designated nearly 87,000 square miles as a national monument. The existing monument is around Howland, Baker, and Jarvis Islands, Johnston, Wake, and Palmyra Atolls, and Kingman Reef. The islands are uninhabited, and the area is one the few untouched stretches of marine environment in the world. It is home to thousands of migratory birds, fish and mammals.

The Obama plan would extend the protected area from the current limit of 50 nautical miles around the islands to 200 miles. A nautical mile is a little longer than a regular mile. The protection would limit fishing and energy development over a far larger expanse of ocean. The proposal could more than double the area of ocean protected by the United States, environmental groups said.

Under federal law, the president can order these protections without congressional approval. The new marine sanctuary could be created this year after a public comment period.

Joshua S. Reichert is the executive vice president of the Pew Charitable Trusts. He said he expected the U.S. tuna industry to resist the expansion plan. But he said Pew estimates that about 1 percent to 3 percent of the U.S. annual tuna catch would be affected by the plan.

"The importance of these uninhabited islands is far greater than the value of the fish there," Reichert said. The proposed protection zone holds some of the world's "richest marine life and least disturbed areas. It's immensely valuable to science and home to vast numbers of ocean species." He added, "The importance of keeping these places intact (is far more important than) the short-term value of what can be extracted for commercial gain."

## Fighting Seafood Fraud

The president also established a task force of at least a dozen federal agencies, including the Pentagon and Justice Department. The group will develop recommendations to better combat seafood fraud and illegal fishing.

About one-fifth to one-third of seafood imported to the U.S. in 2011 was caught illegally, according to a recent study in the journal Marine Policy. Further, about one-third of seafood is mislabeled, according to a study last year by the environmental group Oceana, which analyzed more than 1,200 seafood samples bought in 21 states. The study found that fish sold as snapper was identified 87 percent of the time as another, usually cheaper fish, and tuna was misidentified 59 percent of the time.

"Because our seafood travels through an increasingly long, complex and non-transparent supply chain, there are numerous opportunities for seafood fraud to occur and illegally caught fish to enter the U.S. market," said Beth Lowell. She is the director of Oceana's Stop Seafood Fraud campaign. "By tracing our seafood from boat to plate, consumers will have more information about the fish they purchase."

The White House plan would also improve the monitoring of ocean acidification. The acidification is caused by the ever-greater amounts of carbon dioxide the oceans absorb. Atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased by about 40 percent since the preindustrial era, before about the 19th century. This is due to burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change, according to a report issued Tuesday by the White House Office of Science and Technology.

Oceans absorb about 25 percent of the carbon dioxide that humans generate. When the gas dissolves in seawater, some of it forms carbonic acid. Greater ocean acidity poses a threat to a range of marine life, including coral reefs and shellfish beds, like oyster hatcheries in the Pacific Northwest. Under the plan, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would get $9 million over three years to better monitor the local effect of ocean acidification. This, in turn, could help individual coastal communities.
