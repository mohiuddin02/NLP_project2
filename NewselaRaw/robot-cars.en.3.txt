Car accidents killed more than 34,000 people last year in the United States. More than 30,000 of those accidents were caused by a human mistake, not a flaw with the car.

The good news is those mistakes may become history.

U.S. drivers are about to meet robot cars. These vehicles use a computer to control some parts of its motion or operation. By the end of this year cars that steer themselves through bumper-to-bumper traffic will be for sale. Self-parking vehicles will follow.

And cars that don't need human drivers at all are less than 10 years away.

## Puzzling Questions

Inventors are working fast, and lawmakers need to catch up. Only three states - Nevada, California and Florida - allow testing of driverless cars on their roadways.

These states also started to write a new set of laws to address some of the questions about self-driving cars. Among those questions: do you need a driver's license to operate a self-driving car?

Who is responsible if a driverless car gets into an accident? The person who owns the car or the company that made the car? What if a self-driving car runs a stoplight? Who gets the ticket?

Can a person nap at the wheel if the car is driving itself? What about texting or drinking alcohol? Could hackers be able to take control of vehicles that run on computers?

## Controlling Self-Driving Cars

At a recent Senate meeting, lawmakers struggled to understand the risks involved with driverless cars.

They also thought about what rules might be needed nationwide. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has created a new group within the Office of Vehicle Safety Research to study robo-cars. It will deal with the question of security and hacking. The NHTSA is also researching how cars may one day communicate between themselves. It will study how drivers react and perform in different types of driverless vehicles.

The head of the NHTSA said that the new car technology is "breathtaking." However, safety is the most important thing, he added.

## Should People Be Allowed To Drive?

People who support self-driving technology say computers can drive better than humans. They say that's because people tend to make more mistakes than machines.

Richard Wallace's job is to study the future of cars and driving. He says the technology could greatly reduce crashes.

Some crash-prevention technologies already are widely available. For example, a tool that prevents a car from rolling over during an accident has to be in all new cars.

Other safety features in vehicles today are sensors that push on the brakes if a car is about to hit something. Wallace says that the next step is "traffic jam assist." This technology allows a driver to push a button to let the car find its way in slow-moving traffic by itself. Wallace says that some 2014 cars will have traffic jam assist.

He added that self-parking cars are expected in the next few years. Fully robot-driven cars will most likely not be available until 2020.

John D. Lee is an engineering professor at the University of Wisconsin. He told senators that the technology might make roads more safe â€“ but it could also make them more dangerous. Motorists will have more distractions than ever and cars will not be so simple to understand.

"Fifteen years from now, lawmakers probably will be debating whether people should even be allowed to drive," Lee said.
