CLAYTON, Mo. â€” Lawyers for Michael Brown's family on Thursday said the family supports Missouri Governor Jay Nixon's call for calm once the grand jury announces its decision. By the end of November it will decide whether to indict the Ferguson police officer who shot the teen. An indictment means the police officer will be put on trial.

The lawyers also said the governor's appeal should have been aimed at police as well.

Anthony D. Gray, a Brown family lawyer, repeated the governor's call against "looting and rioting."

Gray added: "Law enforcement should have been equally condemned by the governor for this conduct." He said that a "strong message of zero tolerance" should have been made toward everybody.

## Demonstrations Were Emotional

Brown, 18, was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. His death was followed by both peaceful demonstrations as well as looting and violence. Many fear that the earlier unrest is only a taste of what's to come if the grand jury investigating the case decides not to indict Wilson. The lawyers for Brown's family said they do not trust the grand jury. It is made up of average citizens, yet holds its hearings in secret.

Another lawyer for the Brown family, Benjamin Crump, said Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch had too much control over the grand jury. McCulloch is a lawyer for the St. Louis government.

"The grand jury will do whatever the prosecutor wants them to do," he said. "This has always been about what evidence he presents and how he presents it."

## Learning From The August Protests

Crump told reporters he wanted to thank police "in advance" for "not having a repeat of the horrific encounters that took place in August." He said that police sometimes went too far. They violated the rights of peaceful protesters and the media, he said.

Crump said Nixon's job as governor is to ensure laws are enforced equally. Gray said police need to use "reasonable" actions when dealing with demonstrators.

"History is clear," Gray said. Demonstrators who were "simply exercising their First Amendment rights" became "victims of assault rifles being pointed in their face, being manhandled, being tear-gassed, hit by rubber bullets, falsely arrested." These actions came before the demonstrators acted "uncivilized," he said.

Crump and Gray spoke less than an hour after Dr. Michael Baden entered the courthouse to testify before the grand jury. Baden is a nationally known medical expert. He examined Brown's body for his family.

Crump criticized the grand jury's secrecy. He insisted that Wilson should have been charged by prosecutors long ago in the "shooting of an unarmed teenager."

## "Remain Vigilant Yet Peaceful"

Brown's parents were in Switzerland early in the week to talk to the United Nations. They did not attend the Thursday news conference in Clayton.

Gray said that the parents wanted Brown's supporters "to remain vigilant yet peaceful, calm and dignified."

But soon, Gray and Crump turned their attention to Nixon.

On Tuesday, Nixon talked about how police are preparing for what might come after the grand jury's decision. His office and law enforcement want to keep residents and businesses safe while allowing protesters to exercise their rights after the grand jury's decision is announced, he said.

Nixon said he had yet to call up the Missouri National Guard. Still, the guard was "available if we determine it is necessary," he said.

Nixon was joined by Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief.

Belmar said the possibility of lives lost as a result of civil unrest keeps him up at night. It was remarkable, he said, that no one died, or was seriously injured, during the height of the protests over Brown's death in August.

Protesters repeatedly have asked Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case. They say McCulloch is too close to the St. Louis police department. The governor has refused their request.
