DUBLIN, Ireland â€” Gay couples in Ireland began planning their weddings on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Irish people voted to change the constitution to allow gay couples to get married. The support for gay marriage was surprisingly strong. More than 6 out of 10 Irish people voted for it. Gay marriage is when two men or two women marry each other.

In Dublin, thousands of people celebrated the results until dawn.

The Irish Justice Department said that it would write a new marriage law very soon. The law will let gay couples get married in civil ceremonies. In a civil wedding ceremony, a couple is married by an official, instead of by a priest or a minister. The law will also make sure that gay couples do not have to get married in a church. The Catholic Church does not allow gay marriage. More than 8 out of every 10 Irish people are Catholic.

## No More Court Battles

Deputy Prime Minister Joan Burton said gay marriage will probably become law by early July. Right now, Irish law requires at least a three-month wait for civil marriages. Because of that, the first gay weddings cannot happen until the fall.

For Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan, their Irish wedding day has nearly come. Since 2003, the couple have fought to get the Irish government to recognize their Canadian marriage.

Zappone is from Seattle. She and Gilligan, who is Irish, got married in Vancouver, Canada, 12 years ago. The two women moved to Ireland 30 years ago. Zappone said that for so long, she has had to insist to people: "Well, we ARE married. I'm a married woman!"

"We are now entering a new Ireland," Gilligan said.

## Waving Rainbow-Colored Flags

On Saturday, Zappone and Gilligan thrilled a crowd waving rainbow-colored flags as the gay marriage vote results came in at Dublin Castle. Suddenly, Zappone broke off from a live TV interview. She stared directly into the camera and asked Gilligan to marry her all over again.

"I said yes to Katherine 12 years ago at our marriage in Canada," Gilligan shouted to the large crowd. "And now we are bringing the 'yes' back home to Ireland, our country of Ireland! Yes, yes, yes!"

People in Ireland "now felt so much freer, and proud," Zappone said. She became Ireland's first female gay lawmaker in 2011. She is a senator.

Gilligan said there are few moments in life when a person is surrounded by so much joy. "These are rare moments," she said.

## Important To Be Recognized

She and Zappone met in 1981 while taking a class at Boston College in Massachusetts.

"I fell in love with Katherine, and I went for it. I simply adored her, and I wanted to be with her forever and ever, and here we are!" Gilligan said.

After they moved to Ireland, they tried to get the Irish government to accept their marriage. In 2006, the Irish High Court ruled that marriage was between a man and a woman.

Several years ago, Gilligan was in the hospital. She is in her late 60s. Zappone had problems getting to see Gilligan, because the hospital did not recognize her as a wife or other family member. Zappone could have lied, but wanted to tell the truth. "I am married to her, and you have to recognize that," she told the hospital.

The hospital workers let her stay. After Zappone had spent five weeks at Gilligan's bedside, a doctor wrote them a long note. He said he wished he had the kind of relationship they had.

## The Big Day Is In Sight

Ireland's constitution eventually will say that two men or two women can get married. First, lawmakers must pass the gay marriage law. Experts say the law will probably be approved easily, since all sides support it. Then Irish President Michael D. Higgins will sign the law and change the constitution.

Zappone said that probably she and Gilligan will have to wait until the end of the year to get married. "Then we'll head toward the big day," she said.
