DAKAR, Senegal - President Barack Obama came to West Africa to deliver messages about democracy and development. Senegal's message to him was simpler: Welcome home.

The greeting was plastered on signs and T-shirts wherever Obama went Thursday during the start of a three-country trip to Africa.

Obama was born and raised in Hawaii. But his father was born and is buried in Kenya. Today, Senegal treated Obama like he was one of their own.

Lampposts were covered with signs reading "Welcome home, Mr. President." Obama's face appeared everywhere. Crowds danced and waved.

## Sharing A Dark History

Obama shook hands and posed for pictures. But he also acknowledged that Senegal and the United States share a dark history of slavery.

The president and his family visited a small slave house on Goree Island. The island is off the coast of Dakar, the nation's capital.

Men, women and children were traded, weighed and shackled there before being sent across the Atlantic to the Americas.

The president stared thoughtfully out the "door of no return." This was the exit for those boarding slave ships. He spent about half an hour in the two-story salmon-colored house that is filled with dark holding cells.

"Obviously, for an African-American — and an African-American president — to be able to visit this site, I think, gives me even greater motivation" to defend human rights, Obama said.

The visit reminded him that we have to be watchful about those rights, he said.

Other U.S. presidents and their families have toured Goree Island. But the Obamas were the first to make the visit knowing that some of their ancestors had experienced such cruelty.

## Descendants Of Slaves

Obama's mother is believed to have had at least one slave among her ancestors.  First Lady Michelle Obama's great-great-grandfather was freed from a South Carolina plantation.The first lady, her mother and Obama's daughter Malia accompanied Obama.

Information about the first family's ancestors usually comes from outside researchers.  The Obamas seldom say anything about this information. But the president described the visit as a meaningful experience.

He said it was especially powerful for his family "to be able to come here and to fully appreciate" how big the slave trade was. And to get a close look at what happened to slaves before they were put on ships to the Americas.

Michelle Obama did not comment on the family's private tour of Goree Island.

The slave house is a frequent stop for celebrities and world leaders. They go there because they want to recognize the horrors of the international slave trade. The walls of the small, crowded gift shop are covered with faded images of visitors. Those include former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and former South African President Nelson Mandela.

Historians have argued about whether the slave house at Goree Island was actually a major slave trading post. Some historians say the dusty island was mainly a place for ships to stop.  The slave house, built in 1776 by the Dutch, may have mostly been a merchant's home, they say.

## An Important Symbol

Still, the house is an important symbol. For a dollar, Goree Island tour guides tell stories about slaves to visitors. They describe the moment Africans may have passed through the door for the last time before, as one put it, "bye-bye Africa."

Eloi Coly, who led the president's tour, said the weight of that moment hits visitors of all races.

"It is impossible not to feel — it is a question of being a human being," Coly said. "It is very difficult for everybody. No matter the position of who is visiting the slave house."

Earlier Thursday, Obama praised the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings the day before on same-sex marriages. Senegalese President Macky Sall did not join him in celebrating gay rights. Sall said Senegal is tolerant but that the issue requires greater review.
