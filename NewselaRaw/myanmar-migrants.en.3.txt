JAKARTA, Indonesia â€” In recent months, thousands of migrants have been abandoned at sea by their Southeast Asian smugglers. Hundreds have reached land over the past two days. However, about 6,000 remain trapped at sea in crowded, wooden boats. Their food and clean water are running low, so some could be in real danger.

One vessel that reached Indonesian waters early Monday was stopped by the Indonesian navy. The people on board were given food, water and directions to Malaysia. A navy officer said the fishing vessel was in good condition and the migrants looked fine, but cramped.

Fears are growing that boats will start washing to shore with dead bodies on them. The United Nations, the U.S. government and the governments of several other countries have held emergency meetings to discuss the crisis. However, there are still no official plans to search for vessels in the busy waters of the Malacca Strait.

Most of the migrants are Bangladeshis and Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar.

One of the concerns is what to do with the Rohingya if a rescue is launched.

About 1.3 million Rohingya live in Myanmar. They are Muslims in a country that is mostly Buddhist and are widely treated unfairly. The Rohingya are denied citizenship, even though their families have been in Myanmar for generations. Their ancestors originally came from Bangladesh.

## Conditions Are Hard For Rohingya Muslims

In the last three years, 280 Rohingya have been killed and 140,000 others have been forced from their homes. Many now live in crowded camps where little schooling is available and health care is poor. Jobs are very hard to find for all Rohingya in Myanmar.

Such conditions have led many desperate Rohingya to leave Myanmar by boat, in search of a better life.

Other countries have not been eager to accept them, however. The countries worry that opening their doors to a few would result in an unstoppable flow of poor, uneducated migrants.

"These are people in desperate straits," said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch.

Robertson called on governments to come together to help those still stranded at sea. Some have been at sea for two months or longer. "Time is not on their side," he said.

## Many Refugees Try To Reach Malaysia

Chris Lewa has been monitoring boat departures and arrivals for more than 10 years. She estimates that more than 100,000 men, women and children have boarded ships since mid-2012. Most are trying to reach Malaysia.

Recent crackdowns on migrant smuggling networks have made things much harder for those who are now at sea. Smugglers who would have helped migrants get into other countries have gone into hiding. Their absence has made it impossible for migrants to leave their boats.

Lewa believes up to 7,000 migrants are still on boats in the Malacca Strait and nearby waters.
