Edward Avila launched his first business startup a few years ago. He had already worked in California's Silicon Valley technology industry for years. But as he went to events to meet people, something disturbed him.

Hundreds of people were trying to start businesses. But, "I felt like I was the only Latino in the room," he said.

He's not far off: Less than 1 percent of venture-backed startups have a Latino co-founder, according to a company that follows the startup business. Venture capital is the early money from investors that can get a new business going.

The lack of Latino startup founders is especially bad to see in the center of the technology industry. One-quarter of Silicon Valley's population is Hispanic.

## Google And J-Lo Are Helping Hands

The experience led him to start another another business. It will help new Latino technology businesses get off the ground. His business is known as an "incubator."

The incubator is ready to debut. "Class" begins this week for the first seven startups. But it already has some big name supporters of its own. Google and singer and actress Jennifer Lopez are helping out.

The incubator is called Manos Accelerator. The venture takes its name from the Spanish word for hands. Avila and his co-founders say the name reflects the Latino work ethic. Avila's mother came to the valley from Costa Rica. Then she worked at a factory where food was canned.

Latino tech leaders praised the move. They also cautioned it will face tough sledding.

"I think it's going to take another generation, maybe two," for Latinos to get away from thinking like people who just came to the country, said Hector Ruiz. He used to run computer chip giant AMD. Ruiz said Latino parents tend to urge their children to land steady jobs. They do not want them to risk starting their own businesses.

## Low Latino Numbers In Sciences

Ruiz also pointed to the low numbers of Latinos who study science or business in college. Some do not even finish high school.

Just 50 percent of Latino students in California public schools rate proficient or above in math, state figures show. That compares with 71 percent of whites and 85 percent of Asians.

Richard Leza helped start a group to help Latinos make business connections 12 years ago. The group has struggled. You need connections to start a business, he said. "The problem is, Hispanics are not in big venture firms or large corporations like Google and Yahoo."

One of the co-founders of Manos is Sylvia Flores. She worked 10 years ago with Vicente Fox on a venture that helps Mexican tech companies do business in Silicon Valley. Fox was president of Mexico at the time.

Flores is a former IBM engineer. She brought in the third member of the founding team, David Lopez. He is a longtime computer technician whose daughter happens to be J-Lo. Flores built the website for a restaurant David and Jennifer Lopez once owned in Pasadena, Calif.

## Pitching Their Ideas To The Stars

The 12-week Manos program will include a trip to Los Angeles for the entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas to Latino stars including Mario Lopez and Eva Longoria. [Entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) are people who take the risk of starting a business.

Startups chosen for more established incubators like Y Combinator get money for the businesses. The businesses at Manos won't. But Avila hopes to raise money to invest in future participants.

Most of the founders in the first batch of startups live outside the San Francisco Bay Area. So Avila has hooked them up with housing. At his mom's place.

Entrepreneurs in the program will give up a 4 percent stake in their companies. They will get coaches from Stanford, Apple and WalmartLabs, among others. It all leads up to a "demo day" at Google in November. The entrepreneurs will strut their stuff for people who could invest in their companies.

Avila said Manos received 75 submissions after the program was announced in July. About a third came from Latin America.

"Everybody's talking about finding that next Mark Zuckerberg or that next Larry Page," Avila said. They are the founders of Facebook and Google. "I'm hoping the next person they'll be talking about will be an Eric Florez. Why not?"
