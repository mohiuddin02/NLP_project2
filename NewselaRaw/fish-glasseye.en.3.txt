SEATTLE â€” At the Vancouver Aquarium, veterinarians work hard to keep the fish healthy.

Some rockfish at the aquarium were having eye problems. Rockfish usually live deep in the ocean, under very high pressure. Living in an aquarium is not natural for them.

One rockfish had to have an eye removed. The fish was living fine with just one eye, but then other fish started to attack it.

The other fish may have seen the one-eyed rockfish as weaker.

"Fish were picking at it. Its fins were tattered. It was really getting banged up," said Dr. Martin Haulena. She is the top veterinarian at the Vancouver Aquarium.

The rockfish began to avoid its tank-mates and hide in nooks and crannies in the tank, Haulena said.

## Let's Help The Fish

Concerned aquarium veterinarians came up with a plan: give the fish a glass eye. Dr. Lesanna Lahner is a veterinarian at the Seattle Aquarium. She is an expert in the operation to put in glass eyes.

The operation on the rockfish took about 20 minutes. Lahner worked with Dr. Haulena. First, the fish was given anesthesia, so it would not feel pain. The doctors kept the fish wet while Lahner popped the prosthetic eye into place.

Then, Lahner helped Haulena attach the eye to the fish's bones using fishing line.

Lahner said that after it healed, the rockfish seemed to be back to its old self.

"It's now out in the open and behaving like a normal fish," she said.

## 100-Year-Old Fish!

Rockfish can live more than 100 years in the wild. That's why it is so important to make sure they are healthy and happy in aquariums.

Fake eyes for fish are not new, Lahner pointed out.

Two doctors at North Carolina State University came up with the idea. The doctors worked with koi fish. Koi are the large orange and white fish often seen in Japanese-style ponds.

Koi are valued for their beauty. Collectors might pay thousands of dollars for a single fish. A koi with one eye is not so valuable, but a glass eye can make it beautiful again.

Lahner took the surgery used on koi and adapted it. She began working with fish that lived in cold water. She had to find a new kind of glue. She needed a new way to hold the glass eye in place. For that, she used fishing line and metal clips.

"It's still a work in progress," she said. It is not perfect.

In the past, aquariums did not go to much trouble for one-eyed fish. They were often put to sleep because they were thought to be ugly, Haulena said.

"It's no longer a good idea to think of animals as disposable, and just go out and get another one," he said.
