WASHINGTON, D.C. — Some cities and states want bicyclists to keep their attention on the road and off their smartphones. At the same time that cities are trying to become friendlier for bicycles, more people are using electronic devices to communicate and navigate. Officials are worried about bicyclists who chat, text or listen to music on smartphones. They fear cyclists are creating danger for themselves and other people using the sidewalks and roadways.

"If they want to share the road, they have to share the responsibility as well," says Massachusetts State Representative Steven Howitt. He introduced a bill that would make it illegal for bicyclists to wear headphones. Howitt is a member of the Republican Party.

Howitt says drivers cannot wear headphones in the state, and it should be the same for bicyclists. He says, "In this age of electronics and constantly being entertained, I see bicyclists with headphones on, particularly in the city (of Boston). A biker could be cutting across an intersection, and an ambulance is coming through and he's not hearing it if he's playing music very loud."

## Bicycle Groups Want More Evidence

People who support bicyclists say there is no need for new laws or fines. Common sense should be enough, they say. They also say there is no evidence that headphones and smartphone use have caused death or serious injury.

Peter Wilborn is founder of Bike Law, a network of lawyers that focuses on cycling. He says,"There's a huge difference between distracted driving that kills someone and distracted biking that doesn't. I don't think we need laws specifically for this."

Ken McLeod is with a group called the League of American Bicyclists, and says his group supports allowing bikers to choose whether to wear headphones. McLeod says he is unaware of any research about headphones and cyclist safety. His group is not likely to support laws that ban headphones.

McLeod's group feels differently about texting, though. He says his group promotes keeping both hands on the handlebars, and if cyclists are getting distracted, a law against texting would be fine.

## Some Riders Use Phones For Training

McLeod warned that there could be problems with how cities or states create and enforce the biking laws. For example, many cyclists mount smartphones on their handlebars and use them to train. The devices can track everything from speed to revolutions per minute.

McLeod also worries that cyclists using smartphones or headphones are more likely to attract police attention. They are more visible than drivers. He says, "If they're going to be doing more enforcement of distracted biking than distracted driving, that's not the answer."

Most states do not include cyclists in cellphone or texting laws. California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia do. The American Automobile Association says Pennsylvania defines bicycles as vehicles, and people driving vehicles cannot use headsets in that state.

Delaware does not allow cyclists to wear earplugs or headsets that cover both ears. Maryland does not either, except when cyclists are on bike paths. Rhode Island fines offenders and takes it a step further. It does not even allow bikers or drivers to wear listening devices on one ear.

## Few States Consider New Laws

Jeffrey Dinowitz, an assemblyman from New York state, says he has tried for years to get a bill passed that would prohibit cyclists from using hand-held cellphones or texting. New York already bans drivers from using them, and Dinowitz says, "I've seen people bicycling and talking on their cellphones at the same time. I've seen people texting. That's crazy." Dinowitz is from the Democratic Party.

Most states have not addressed distracted biking, and in the small number of states that have, the attempts were not very successful.

California state lawmakers passed a bill in 2011 that would have included bicyclists in the state's hands-free, no-texting law. It was vetoed by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown. The bill included things that were not related to bicycle riders.

Douglas Shinkle is a federal transportation policy expert. He says distracted biking bills have also failed in Oregon, New York and Virginia. Shinkle says he has heard from lawmakers concerned about distracted biking, but the problem is still new. Traffic safety researchers are not sure how much it occurs and to what degree it increases risk.

## Chicago Cyclists Face Fines

Several cities, such as Chicago, Illinois, have distracted cycling ordinances. An ordinance is a law passed at a local level. Chicago forbids cyclists from using cellphones without a hands-free device. Cyclists pay a higher fine if they are involved in an accident.

Last year, the city of Flagstaff, Arizona, banned texting while biking or driving. In January, Austin, Texas, did the same.

New York City is considering a bill that would allow police to ticket cyclists who talk or text on a hand-held phone. First-time violators could avoid a fine by taking a biking safety course, unless they injured someone or damaged property. Those ticketed more than once in 18 months would face additional penalties.

Democratic City Councilman Mark Treyger sponsored the bill, and says he focused on the problem after he saw a cyclist swerve into oncoming traffic and almost cause an accident. The cyclist was texting. Treyger says, "If we're serious, everyone — motorists, bikers and pedestrians — has to do their part."
