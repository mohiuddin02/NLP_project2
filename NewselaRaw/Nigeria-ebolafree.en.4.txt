JOHANNESBURG â€” Nigeria has stopped the deadly disease Ebola in the country.

On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Nigeria free of Ebola. Since it began in Nigeria in July, 19 people in the West African country came down with Ebola. Seven of them died. In other West African countries, thousands have gotten infected by the virus. About seven out of 10 people with Ebola died.

Nigerian leaders were determined to end the outbreak quickly. They did everything they could to bring it under control. Doctors were moved from other tasks and sent to care for people with Ebola.

Nigeria's military helped trace everybody who came into contact with Ebola patients. They were then checked for signs of the disease. The government also sent thousands of text messages to teach people how to prevent Ebola.

## "To Bring It Under Control"

The WHO praised Nigeria for its "world-class" disease detective work.

If Nigeria can beat Ebola, other countries can do it, said Dr. Margaret Chan. She is the director general of the WHO.

The outbreak came at a bad time. Nigeria's doctors and nurses were on strike. A strike is a protest when workers stop working. Dr. Doyin Oduyebo was part of Nigeria's effort to stop Ebola. He said doctors feared the disease would race out of control.

"We were afraid because we knew the (disease) was raging in other West African countries," Oduyebo said. "So we decided to give it everything to bring it under control."

The crisis began July 23 with a Liberian American named Patrick Sawyer. He was extremely sick when he left Liberia. He threw up on the airplane. Then he passed out in the Nigerian airport.

## Telling People About Ebola

At the hospital, Dr. Morris Ibeawuchi examined Sawyer. Sawyer did not tell him that he had collapsed at the airport. He also did not say his sister recently died of Ebola.

Sawyer died five days after arriving in Lagos.

Ibeawuchi also became sick. "There was a night I thought my existence on this earth had ended," said Ibeawuchi, who survived.

As news spread, some people doubted the government would be able to stop Ebola. They said the government could not find a group of kidnapped schoolgirls. The girls were kidnapped in April by a group called Boko Haram that is fighting the government.

The government began educating the public. "Everybody in Lagos became aware that there was something called Ebola," said Oduyebo. People were told how to prevent Ebola from spreading.

In late August, Nigerian health workers called off their strike.

## Key To Stopping Ebola

Two actions were the key to stopping Ebola. Nigeria tracked down almost everyone who came near an Ebola patient. Then they were checked to make sure they had not developed Ebola.

The United States and other countries gave thermometers to Nigeria. The thermometers took the temperatures of people coming into the country. Ebola can be spread only when people develop certain signs. One of the signs is a fever. Two Nigerian billionaires donated more than $1 million. Oil and cellphone companies also gave money.

And maybe Nigeria was lucky. Nobody on the airplane with Sawyer got Ebola. After arriving, Sawyer went to a big hospital in Lagos. If he had gone to a small health care center in the country, Ebola might have spread more quickly.

The government had its own reason to stop Ebola. Officials did not want to be blamed for not doing enough.

President Goodluck Jonathan's name was lucky after all.
