WASHINGTON — A U.S. Army judge sentenced Pfc. Bradley Manning to 35 years in a military prison Wednesday, Aug. 21. The same judge had convicted Manning of the largest leak of secret U.S. documents ever.

Manning is 25. So the former intelligence analyst could eventually walk out of prison as a free man. He had faced a sentence long enough to leave him there for life.

The judge who sentenced Manning was Col. Denise Lind.

Lind had found Manning guilty for the theft of an estimated 700,000 documents. He was convicted of 20 charges, including spying. The items ranged from diplomatic cables and intelligence assessments to a video of a U.S. Apache helicopter attack.

## Manning Faced Longer Prison Terms

Lind did find him not guilty of aiding the enemy. That charge would have meant life in prison. He never would have been released.

Still, Manning could have been sentenced to 90 years. Prosecutors had asked for a 60-year sentence.

"There may not be a soldier in the history of the United States Army who" ignored the judgment of the officers above him and the president's orders, said Army Capt. Joseph Morrow. He was one of the prosecutors.

Defense lawyer David Coombs asked for sentence that could let Manning "have a life" when he left prison. He said that Manning "believed that this information could make a difference." But Manning also "believed that the information couldn't be used to harm the United States," Coombs said.

Manning gave the material to WikiLeaks. The website publishes government and corporate secrets. The secrets come from the United States and other countries. Manning and Coombs had argued the leaks were well-intentioned. They said the leaks were also the actions of a troubled young man who was under considerable pressure. Manning was struggling to adjust in a poorly managed Army unit, they said.

Manning can ask for release after serving one-third of his sentence.

## Wanted To Help, Not Hurt People

Manning apologized during a sentencing hearing. He said he thought he would help, not hurt people. The court-martial was held at Fort Meade in Maryland.

Manning had agreed to plead guilty to certain charges that had carried a possible sentence of 20 years. But prosecutors charged him with more crimes, including spying.

His sentence will be shortened by more than 1,100 days for his pre-trial confinement. Another 112 days will be subtracted to compensate for the severe treatment he received while held at a Marine Corps brig. Good behavior in prison could further cut time from his sentence.

Lind heard from witnesses in both closed and open court sessions. Military and diplomatic witnesses emphasized the damage done by Manning's actions and by WikiLeaks releasing the documents.

When the information got out, some foreign partners were concerned if the United States could still be trusted to keep secrets, said retired Brig. Gen. Robert Carr.

## Defense Focused On Troubled Upbringing

State Department officials testified about the results of having 250,000 department documents being made public. A military official said the enemy also changed the way it made some bombs based on the leaks.

Defense witnesses focused on Manning's troubled upbringing. He suffered from anxiety even before enlisting. Manning was prescribed the anti-anxiety drug Lexapro. Manning received mental health counseling for angry outbursts when he was in the Army, a defense witness said.

"I understand that I must pay a price for my decisions and actions," Manning told Lind on Aug. 15. "Once I pay that price, I hope to one day live in the manner I haven't been able to in the past. I want to be a better person — to go to college, to get a degree — and to have a meaningful relationship with my sister's family and my family."
