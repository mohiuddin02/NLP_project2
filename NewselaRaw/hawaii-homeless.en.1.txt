HONOLULU, Hawaii â€” Hawaii Governor David Ige has declared a state of emergency to deal with the state's homelessness crisis. His declaration came just days after city and state officials cleared one of the nation's largest tent encampments.

The move will help Hawaii to speed up the process of building a homeless shelter for families. The state is considering four possible sites, Ige said at a news conference.

"We are making sure that we have options for those who are homeless to move into an emergency shelter, and the biggest shortage in the system is shelter space for families," Ige said. The emergency proclamation will allow the state to provide stand- up shelters for families quickly, he added.

## Highest Homeless Percentage In The Nation

Hawaii saw a 23 percent increase in its unsheltered homeless population between 2014 and 2015, and a 46 percent increase in the number of unsheltered families, Scott Morishige, the state's homelessness coordinator, said.

With 7,260 homeless people at the latest count, Hawaii has the highest homeless rate per capita in the United States. Although Hawaii has a lower population than larger states such as California or Texas, a higher percentage of its residents are homeless.

The state has identified $1.3 million to expand services to homeless individuals and families, Morishige said. In addition to a new shelter, the money also would go to the state's Housing First program. That program provides homes and services to chronically homeless individuals without requiring them to get sober or treat mental illness first. Programs that help families pay deposits and rent would also be funded.

## Families Are A Priority

The state envisions its new transitional shelter would house about 15 families at a time, Morishige said. Two of the sites under consideration are in Kakaako, the neighborhood where the large homeless encampment was cleared. The others are in Liliha and near Sand Island.

The recent clearing of the Kakaako homeless encampment could be used as a model in other parts of Hawaii, Ige said. The state coordinated efforts with service providers, and moved more than half of the 300 residents, including 25 families, into shelters and permanent housing, the governor said.

"They definitely are off the streets and in a better situation where we are in a position to provide them services that will help us move them permanently out of the state of homelessness," Ige said.

## Repurposing Shipping Containers

Meanwhile, crews were installing converted shipping containers for Honolulu's latest homeless shelter on a gravel lot on Sand Island. The rooms in the first units were designed for couples and have 73 square feet of space.

"If they're living in tents now, the individual units are going to be just as large or larger," said Chris Sadayasu, who works for the Honolulu Office of Strategic Development.

The rooms, which were made from new shipping containers, each have a window and a screen door for ventilation. The structures are insulated, and the roofs have reflective coating. An awning will provide shade for relaxing outside, said Russ Wozniak, an architect and engineer from Group 70, an architecture firm. The coating and insulation keep the units about 30 degrees cooler than normal temperatures, Wozniak said.

"It's kind of as comfortable as you can get without mechanical air conditioning," Wozniak said.

A trailer on-site holds five bathrooms that each have a toilet and shower. A separate portable toilet and shower are accessible to the disabled.

When completed in December, the shelter in an industrial area of Honolulu will temporarily house up to 87 clients at a time.
