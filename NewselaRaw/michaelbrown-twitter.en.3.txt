ATLANTA —  Last weekend, Michael Brown, 18, was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, after a possible struggle. His death has sparked riots in Ferguson. Some in the news media used a photo of him from his Twitter account that made him seem threatening.

Now some on social media are fighting back against how they say mainstream media have represented Brown.

They argue that a majority of his photos show a different side, like broad smiles, hearty laughs and the tenderness of high school graduation photos. He was set to begin college on Monday.

## The Hashtag Heard Around The Country

Few hashtags have generated as much buzz as "#iftheygunnedmedown." It has been trending around Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Alexis Nwaiwu, a 19-year-old at Georgia State University, decided to post to it.

It wasn't Michael Brown's photo that inspired her. Rather, it was that the news placed the photo of Brown below one of James Holmes, the Colorado theater shooter. That was what angered her.

Someone posted the photo of Brown in his red Nike tank top flashing a peace sign. The headline read: "Police: Michael Brown Struggled With Officer Before Shooting."

On top of that was a photo of Holmes, wearing a tie in what looks like a class picture. The headline: "Theater Shooting Suspect Was Brilliant Science Student."

"I just thought it was interesting how they portrayed someone who is Caucasian as a brilliant scholar — who was a mass murderer," Nwaiwu said. "Michael Brown is shown as a thug because he was throwing up a peace sign."

Nwaiwu posted a picture of herself laughing at a party flashing two peace signs. Next to it is a smiling image of Nwaiwu in her high school graduation robe.

"The one at the party with a peace sign portrays my generation," she said. "But don't get it confused. I still graduated with honors from high school. I am in college. I am a cheerleader and I make good grades. But the media will always show one side of you."

## Campaign "Forces People To Think"

Brown's death comes nearly 2 1/2 years after the shooting of Trayvon Martin. More recent events that fueled the Michael Brown protests: the videotaped death of Eric Garner at the hands of New York City police, and the second-degree murder conviction against Theodore Wafer. Wafer shot Renisha McBride, 19, after she knocked on his door after crashing her car.

"The assumption is that black males are predators," said David Wall Rice, a professor at Morehouse College. "You can ask what Michael Brown was doing wrong, instead of what was the person with the gun doing wrong?"

Al Tompkins is a teacher at the Poynter Institute, a school for journalism in Florida. He posted on the school's website that the hashtag campaign forces people to think how images are viewed.

"No single image can define an individual," Tompkins said. "A booking photo could be a single image of a person at the worst moment of his or her life. A wedding photo could be that same person at the best moment of his or her life. Both are extremes."

Since the hashtag campaign started, "#iftheygunnedmedown" has been used on Twitter more than 158,000 times, according to The New York Times. Many of those posted similar photos with similar stories.

## What Happens After The Hashtag?

Eric Deggans, a television critic for National Public Radio, said the use of social media, particularly among African-Americans, has given people a voice.

"With social media, we get to tell our story," Deggan said. "We can put up a blog post or Tweet that reflects our attitude and it reaches millions of people."

Tarshia Stanley, head of the Spelman College English Department, said that she agrees that the hashtag campaign has been positive. However, she worries about that it won't lead to further action.

"We have to, as a community, think about these issues of safety and violence toward young black men," Stanley said. She said there needs to be real discussions with law enforcement so things more killings don't happen. "We have to figure out how we move beyond the hashtag."
