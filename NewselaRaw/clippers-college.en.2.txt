LOS ANGELES — Spencer Hawes has spent much more time playing professional basketball than he spent playing college ball at the University of Washington. He was a star player at the school for only one season. Then, he was picked to play professionally for a National Basketball Association (NBA) team. Hawes took the offer and dropped out of school.

Hawes now plays forward-center for the Los Angeles Clippers. He was in college so briefly he did not even choose a major. He later discovered that the classes he took were not much use when it came to his basketball career.

His studies did not turn out "to be that helpful later on in life," he said.

Still, there is something that makes him want to go back and get his college degree: He promised his mother he would do it.

## Not A Lot Of Free Time

Hawes is not unusual for the Clippers. Eleven players on the team do not have a college degree, and each said they planned to get one.

It would be easy for NBA players to feel like they do not need a college degree — after all, they already have millions of dollars in the bank.

Plus, they rarely have a day off during the playing season, which can last eight months.

"It's just so hard to do it," point guard Austin Rivers said of going back to college. "You're so busy during the season," he said. "When you finally get time off, it's like, do you want to go to school or actually spend time with your family?"

## His Dad Did It

Rivers spent only one year in college before before becoming a professional basketball player. He still has many classes to complete before he can earn a college degree.

Rivers said he would prefer to take courses in the summer, even though it will take him a long time to finish that way.

Rivers believes the degree is worth all the extra hard work. It could lead to a job in TV sports broadcasting and later coaching after he stops playing ball, he said.

Rivers is inspired by the example of his father, Doc, who was also a professional basketball player. During summer breaks early in his own NBA career, Doc Rivers went back to college and managed to get his degree. He went on to become a sports broadcaster and now coaches the Clippers.

"I went back my first two years in the NBA," Doc Rivers said. "Everyone told me, including my professors, 'If you didn't go back right away, you're probably not going back,' so I went back."

## Some Guys Made Promises

Point guard Nate Robinson needs to finish one more year of coursework to get his college degree. He is majoring in drama and hopes his studies will help him develop as an actor. Robinson has already co-starred in the "Uncle Drew" Pepsi commercials, alongside Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Some might wonder why any of the Clippers would even bother going back to school. After all, they are all already extremely wealthy. For example, Clippers point guard Chris Paul has made around $116 million during his 10 NBA seasons. On top of that, he has earned a lot of extra money from starring in a series of TV ads.

"A wise man once told me, 'If you've got money, you don't need a degree,'" joked center DeAndre Jordan. He was drafted by the Clippers after just one year of college.

Jordan then turned serious. He said he would like to finish college because getting a degree is what his grandmother has always wanted him to do.

Chris Paul said he is determined to get a degree and will be taking classes in the coming months.

Paul said he promised his mother he would go back to college and earn a degree. "I'm going to get it," he added.
