PHILADELPHIA — Christopher Gray couldn't even afford college application fees, let alone tuition. His single mother was out of work, and there were two siblings to think about, then ages 2 and 3.

But with a passion for [entrepreneurship](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) — that is, for helping and creating businesses — the Birmingham, Ala., student dreamed of attending college. He hoped to go to school in the Northeast, so that he could be close to New York City and other major business centers.

So the burden was on Gray. "I had to deal with it myself," recalled Gray, now 21 and about to enter his junior year at Drexel University in Philadelphia.

Because he didn't have a computer at home, Gray holed up in the local library for three months. There he searched out and applied for more than 70 college scholarships. Gray, an A–B student in high school who had started his own company, had astounding success.

## An App Called Scholly
He received 34 scholarships worth $1.3 million — enough to pay for years of school, plus cover his living expenses with some left over to invest.

Now, Gray — since nicknamed "the Million Dollar Scholar" — has found a way to help other teens get scholarship money. He and two associates have developed a mobile-phone app called Scholly — short for "scholarships" — for both the iPhone and Android.

The app has been available for only about a month, but several thousand downloads have sold. Gray and his colleagues decided to keep the price at 99 cents because they are more interested in helping students than in making money.

All the money earned at this point is going back into the company, said Nick Pirollo, 23, one of Gray's partners. He is a computer and electrical engineering major from New Jersey who graduated this month. He updates the app and manages the website Myscholly.com.

As a high school student in Birmingham, Gray distinguished himself. He graduated with an A average while leading the local Bible club and running his company, Genesis. Gray's company, which helped students find ways to volunteer, was non-profit -- that is, it wasn't created to make money, but simply as a public service.

Gray wanted to apply to Harvard and other top schools, but could not afford the application fees.

## Scholarship Search Pays Off Big

His guidance counselor suggested he apply for six scholarships. He got all of them, but knew he needed more. He looked at hundreds of Web sites, checking scholarship requirements. Many scholarships had very specific qualifications that he didn't meet: "It was frustrating." But many looked for excellent grades combined with leadership and community service. Gray had all three.

"I had 600 volunteer hours," he said. "And because I started a nonprofit, that made me stand out."

Gray's biggest prize was the Gates Millennium Scholarship, which covers tuition and room and board for all four years of college, plus graduate school. A $20,000 scholarship from Coca-Cola followed, and by good luck put him in touch with Bryson Alef. Alef, who will soon be a senior at Amherst College, is his other partner on the Scholly app. Gray also received a $20,000 Horatio Alger Scholarship and the $10,000 Axa Achievement Scholarship.

Smaller awards came from Wal-Mart and Lowe's. And they just kept coming.

"My mom was elated. I did a little jumping around," Gray said.

## Making For Quicker Searches

Gray, an entrepreneurship major at Drexel, has used the money for tuition, room and board, supplies at the Apple store, travel for interviews, clothing, and other needs.

Gray has appeared at national conferences and in the media, including _U.S. News &amp; World Report_. As a result, hundreds of students and parents have emailed and called for advice. Working with Mayor Michael Nutter's office on education, he has also advised students at Philadelphia public high schools.

"That's what inspired me to make the app," he said. "It was taking hours of my day trying to help. It just became too much." Gray has uploaded 500 scholarships on the app and continues to add more.

Gray, who has two more years at Drexel, wants to make it easier for his siblings than it was for him. "I'm trying to save up to put them in a better environment," he said, aiming to get them into a private school by fifth grade.

As for Gray's career plans, his goal is to have his own business by the time he graduates. Thinking like a true entrepreneur, he hopes "not to have to get a job when I graduate."
