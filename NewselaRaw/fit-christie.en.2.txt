HACKENSACK, N.J. — William Howard Taft was the heaviest U.S. president in history. He grew so tired of being ridiculed about his weight that he told his physician to put him on a diet. "No real gentleman," he declared, "weighs more than 300 pounds."

Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, was once about 200 pounds overweight. Then, 21 months ago, the governor had an operation known as Lap-Band surgery. A small band with a balloon inside was inserted into his body around the upper part of his stomach to limit what he could eat. Since then, he appears to have taken off at least half those extra pounds. Many see that weight loss as essential if the New Jersey Republican plans to run for president in 2016.

Christie's office declined to say exactly how much weight he has lost, nor would his staff discuss his diet or workouts. Christie has said that only his physician and his wife know how much he weighs.

## Surgery As A Last Resort

Dr. Jaime Ponce has never treated Christie, but said that photos suggest the governor is doing very well. "He's lost 100 pounds, if not a little bit more," he estimated.

Christie underwent Lap-Band surgery in February 2013. The operation is often a last-ditch effort after years of dieting.

While he still has a significant amount to lose, the change in the governor's body is quite visible. His face is much thinner and his clothes, which used to appear tight, sometimes hang on him a bit. His recent appearances have led to talk about the new, slimmer Christie, furthering speculation about running for president. Supporters often shout words of encouragement, like "Looking good, governor."

In a CBS interview last month, Christie was asked if he felt as good as he looked. "Not yet, but I hope to," he said. "I feel much, much better than I used to feel, but the fact is I still have some work to do in that area, too, and so I've just got to keep working at it."

## The Public's Perceptions

In a nation obsessed with weight, a presidential candidate who is hefty would draw attention.

"All presidents and presidential candidates in the TV age have been conscious of appearances and have to be," said political expert Larry J. Sabato. "There's a pretty good chance we'll never elect a William Howard Taft again."

Heavier political figures can face a serious obstacle: the public may believe they are not fit enough for the job.

Former White House physician Connie Mariano is a Christie fan and said last year she would like the governor to run for president. However, she said she worried that he would wind up having a heart attack or stroke and "dying in office." Christie, noting that she was not his personal physician, said, "She should shut up."

## Regular Exercise And Regular Adjustments

At his heaviest weight two years ago when Superstorm Sandy ravaged the state, Christie spent weeks visiting sites damaged by the storm. His actions helped boost his popularity dramatically. However, Christie's weight still affected the way people viewed him.

Candidates need to persuade voters that they are able to serve.

"They need to look like the part they are running for," political expert Patsy Cisneros said. "If people don't see that person looks like that position — governor, president, senator from that state — then who are they?"

Christie might have as much as 100 more pounds to lose, experts said. Success varies with Lap-Band surgery. The people who achieve the best results follow a strict program. They have regular adjustments made to the band around their stomach, they limit meals to just a few ounces and they exercise regularly.

According to Dr. Stefanie Vaimakis, who has not treated Christie, someone who makes "a real effort" can lose weight steadily following Lap-Band surgery. She added that it appears as if Christie has been following through.

Even a 10 percent drop in body weight can yield benefits, Vaimakis said. Obesity — being extremely overweight — is linked to more than 40 diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis and cancer.

## Just Some Lettuce

Christie has said he works out with a personal trainer four times a week. However, he rarely talks about his meals.

After confirming last year that he had the surgery, he noted that he ordered a steak one night. He said he was full after eating just a third of it.

Christie will not let the press watch him eat. On his recent trip to Mexico, when it came time for a taco lunch, reporters and photographers were shooed away once his food arrived.

At a September fundraiser in honor of Christie's birthday, former presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he had ordered a Jersey boy's favorites for Christie: lasagna, ravioli, the works. "I bought all this food and put it out in front of the table and Chris sat there and picked at a couple of pieces of lettuce," Romney said.
