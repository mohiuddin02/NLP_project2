When she was 4, Doris Pilkington Garimara was taken from her home in Australia by force and sent to a lonely settlement. There, she grew up believing that her mother abandoned her.

Years passed before she learned the full story. It would not only answer painful questions about her past but help Australians understand one of the ugliest chapters of their own history.

Pilkington Garimara and her mother belonged to "the stolen generations." These are the estimated 100,000 children of mixed aboriginal and white parents who were stolen from their homes by the Australian government. The aboriginals are the original people of Australia. Similar to Native American tribes in the U.S., the aboriginals were there long before white people settled the Australian continent.

The white Australian government thought that aboriginals were not as good as them. So they separated the lighter-skinned aboriginal children from their darker-skinned family members and raised them as white.

## "Deny My Own People"

Aboriginal children were taken from their parents through most of the last century. This ended only in the 1970s. But for years after, the children kept it hidden. This was in part because they accepted what the government told them, that aboriginal people were dirty and evil.

"I actually (hated) my own traditional culture because we were taught to," Pilkington Garimara once said. "I was taught to deny my own people."

But Pilkington Garimara eventually came to accept her people. In 1996, she wrote the story of her own mother's escape from a government camp and 1,000-mile walk home. The book is called "Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence."

Pilkington Garimara died of cancer April 10 in Perth, Australia. She was believed to have been 76. Before she died, she worked for many years as a nurse, and later studied journalism.

When she died, she left behind four children, 31 grandchildren and 80 great-grandchildren, said her daughter, Bernadine Pilkington.

"She helped Australians understand and come to terms with our previously hidden history," said filmmaker Phillip Noyce. In 2002, Noyce made a movie based on Pilkington Garimara's book. In part because of the movie, the Australian government formally apologized to the aboriginal community in 2008.

## Mother Escaped From Camp

In 1931, the government took Pilkington Garimara's mother, Molly, her mother's sister, Daisy, and a cousin from their home. The girls were sent to the Moore River Settlement 1,000 miles away.

At the camp there were bars on the windows, locks on the doors and buckets for toilets. Anyone who tried to run away was beaten.

After one night, the three girls escaped. Followed by trackers, they headed toward a fence built to protect farmland from rabbits. This "rabbit-proof fence" ran the length of the Australian continent.

They greeted this fence, Pilkington Garimara wrote, "like a long-lost friend ... a beacon that would lead them out of the rugged wilderness across a strange country to their homeland." Following the fence, after nine weeks, Molly and Daisy found their way home. Their cousin had turned herself in.

Molly married and had two children. She named her older girl Nugi Garimara, who was born in 1937, and later renamed her Doris. But because the government did not record aboriginal births, her exact birth date is unknown.

The year of her birth, a government official, A.O. Neville, said the government had the power to take "to take any child from its mother at any stage of its life." He wanted his country to "eventually forget that there ever were any aborigines in Australia."

## Doris Taken Away

In 1941, Neville ordered agents to grab Doris and her sister and send them to the Moore River Settlement.

At Moore River, Doris was beaten for speaking her native Mardudjara language. When she was 12 she was sent to a farm where she was made to hate her aboriginal roots.

Pilkington Garimara grew up thinking, "my mother didn't want me and gave me away." But she gradually learned the truth.

The movie version of "Rabbit-Proof Fence" made Pilkington Garimara famous.

In 2002, she helped lead a national effort to create peace and forgiveness between aboriginal and white Australians. The effort is is called Journey of Healing.

Pilkington Garimara had taken her own healing journey many years earlier. When she was in her mid-20s, she traveled back to Jigalong, her hometown, to find her mother.

"I asked her, 'Why did you give me away?'" Pilkington Garimara recalled. "She just broke down and said, 'I never did, the government came and took you away.' She had no rights as a mother or an aboriginal woman."
