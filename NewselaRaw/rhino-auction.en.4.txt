HOUSTON, Texas â€” A Texas club has big plans to save the endangered black rhino.

The Dallas Safari Club wants to sell a permit to kill a rhino. The permit comes from the African country of Namibia. The sale will raise more than $1 million, the club says.

Some animal support groups are bashing the idea.

"More than ridiculous," said Wayne Pacelle. He is the president of the Humane Society of the United States. "You're going to help an endangered animal by killing an endangered member of that population?"

## Only 4,000 Black Rhinos Left

In October, the safari club said it would sell the rhino hunting permit. It will go to whomever pays the most at the auction. The Namibian government offers only five rhino hunting permits each year. Hunters need a permit to kill a rhino. Money from the sale will be spent to protect the [endangered animal](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species), the club says.

"This is advanced, state-of-the-art wildlife" protection and management,  said John J. Jackson III. He is a member of the safari club. He is also a wildlife lawyer. The sale "is not something the (regular person) understands, but they should," Jackson said.

He said the club's plan is the best way to save the rhino. He called the hunt "a hero in the hunting community."

Only about 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild. There were 70,000 in the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 of the rhinos are in Namibia, said the safari club. A safari is a trip to hunt or watch animals in the wild.

Hunters mainly kill rhinos for the animals' horns. The only way to get the horn is to kill the animal. So it is against the law to own a rhino horn. But rhino horns are very valuable. They are carved into pieces of art. The horns are also used as medicine, mainly in Asia.

The safari club sale will take place in January.

## An Old Rhino To Be Hunted

A committee will choose the rhino that will be hunted, Jackson said. The Namibian government has to approve the choice. The rhino will an be older male. It will be too old to father rhino calves. It will likely be a troublemaker that is killing other rhinos, he said.

Killing an older, dangerous rhino will help, Jackson said. It will allow more rhino calves to be born.

All the money from the permit sale will go to the Namibian government to save rhinos, he said.

Ben Carter said the money will be important in the fight to protect the rhino. Carter is the safari club president.

Jeffrey Flocken strongly disagrees. Flocken is the head of an animal protection group.

Flocken says the club is just trying to get people excited about killing one of the last rhinos on Earth. He called the sale "totally irresponsible."

## "Sends A Mixed Message"

Rick Barongi, vice president of a group to save the rhino, said the hunt was legal. But it "sends a mixed message." Barongi also runs the Houston Zoo.

If an American kills the rhino, the hunter may not be able to bring home the trophy. Only the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can allow the dead rhino to be brought to the United States. It will have to decide if the animal was killed as part of a program to protect the rhinos.

The U.S. granted a permit for another black rhino trophy earlier this year. That animal was killed in Namibia in 2009.

Pacelle said the Humane Society would work to stop the permit.

The Namibian government did not answer an email by The Associated Press.

Barongi said the sale could be the best plan if the money was used to save hundreds of rhinos.

"Because the alternative is you can lose them all," he said.
