ROZSYPNE, Ukraine â€” On Thursday, a Malaysia Airlines jetliner was shot down over Ukraine. On Friday, world leaders called for a stop to the fighting in eastern Ukraine. The area is near the Russian border. Fighting has been going on for months there.

The Ukrainian government is fighting rebels. The pro-Russia rebels are trying to separate from Ukraine. The rebels are from eastern Ukraine. Many there consider themselves to be Russian and speak Russian. Ukraine accuses Russia of supporting these rebels. Russia, Ukraine and the rebels all denied shooting the plane down. Russia also denies backing the rebels.

The rebels began fighting after Russia took Crimea from Ukraine in March. Crimea has many Russians. The takeover led to the fighting now in eastern Ukraine.

World leaders demanded that investigators be allowed to reach the crash scene. Ukrainian search teams were still looking through the area where the plane crashed.

## U.S. Says Missile Shot Down Plane

The attack Thursday afternoon killed all 298 people in the plane. The victims came from nearly a dozen nations. Among the dead were vacationers, students and a large group of scientists.

President Barack Obama called for an immediate cease-fire. He also asked for an investigation. "The eyes of the world are on eastern Ukraine, and we are going to make sure that the truth is out," Obama said.

U.S. officials said a missile brought down the plane. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was traveling from the Netherlands to Malaysia. The U.S. said the missile was likely fired from a rebel area near the Russian border.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said both sides in the fight should put down their weapons. Then they should hold peace talks. Putin blamed Ukraine for the crash. He said Ukraine's government was responsible for the fighting in its country. However, he didn't accuse Ukraine of shooting the plane down. Putin also didn't say whether Russia gave the rebels the missile.

## Ukraine Shows Video Of Missile Launcher

The Ukrainian government released a video supposedly showing a truck carrying a Buk missile launcher. It claimed it was used to fire on the plane. One of its four missiles appeared to be missing. Ukraine said the footage was filmed by police Friday. The truck was heading toward the Russian border.

There was no way to prove the video was real.

Reaching the crash scene remained dangerous. Rebels control the road leading to it.

A group of European officials were allowed to visit to the crash scene Friday afternoon.

Rebel leader Aleksandr Borodai said he hopes the experts will be able to create a picture of what happened.

Yet earlier Friday, a member of Borodai's group said eight recording devices had been recovered. It was not clear what he meant. Planes usually have two recording tools. One is for recording flight information and the other for recording the pilot and co-pilot.

The crash scene was spread out over fields between two villages. Both are in eastern Ukraine. They are called Rozsypne and Hrabove.

## Bodies In Sunflower Fields

Rozsypne lies 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Russian border. In sunflower fields nearby, men searched for remains. Many bodies were found.

Smashed cell phones, watches and burnt passports were among the wreckage.

Large chunks of the plane were scattered over one field. The cockpit and one turbine lay a kilometer (a half-mile) apart. The tail landed 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.

Rebels had bragged about shooting down two Ukrainian military jets Wednesday.

Ukraine claims that Russia could be behind the attack. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that was not the case.

A Malaysian air official said Friday that the airline took an internationally approved route. Claims had been made that the airline was trying to save fuel and money by taking a more direct flight path across Ukraine. He denied that.

Flight officials in several countries had already warned airlines not to fly over parts of Ukraine. Within hours of the crash Thursday, several airlines announced they were avoiding parts of Ukrainian airspace.
