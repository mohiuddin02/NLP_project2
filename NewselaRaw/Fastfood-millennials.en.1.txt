Most consumers will tell you they prefer fresh, tasty, healthy food over the greasy, assembly line fare of fast-food restaurants. Millennials, though, may be the first generation to back that up with their wallets.

Fast-food owners say they are getting increasing pressure from the millennial generation to boost the quality of their menus. The millennials are generally defined as 18- to 34-year-olds. At stake is more than $1 trillion in spending by the group.

Consumer Reports recently asked readers to judge fast-food chains on quality, value and healthy options. Older chains, like Burger King, Krystal and Church's Chicken, ranked near the bottom.

The magazine noted that despite higher prices, fast-casual restaurants were gaining in popularity. This category offers counter service, but is considered more healthy than fast food and includes restaurants like Chipotle Mexican Grill and Moe's Southwest Grill.

More and more, quality matters more to millennials than the convenience of fast food. "Millennials have a renewed fascination with food," said David Farmer. He is vice president for product strategy and development for Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A. "They grew up on food television and are more knowledgeable about ingredients. And social media has put a lot of attention on quality and customization."

## Millennials Have Economic Power

Esther Yi, 25, counts herself in that group. Yi, a business affairs coordinator at Georgia State University, is a foodie who thinks that millennials are more knowledgeable about food. This awareness makes them more interested in new dishes and good service. They also have a greater expectation that food be "fresh" and come from nearby farms, if possible.

Because they are Internet savvy, millennials frequently post dinner pictures or restaurant reviews online.

There are many millennials, so they have economic power.  But working in fast food's favor is that they don't have that much money. Each generation used to do better than the last, but millennials aren't doing as well as their parents. Their lack of money may be partly responsible for fact that more more moderately priced sit-down chains such as Olive Garden, Red Lobster and Ruby Tuesday are losing customers, experts said.

But fast-food companies are also struggling with that age group. They must offer a menu that has to entice the most customers, but the more items they add to menus, the more crowded and confused their menus become.

## Surveys Say One Thing; Meal Orders, Another

As with all trends, there are exceptions. Millennials, like all customers, will demand healthy choices in surveys. When they walk into a fast-food restaurant, though, they buy the traditional meals, hamburgers and fried chicken, that are the core of fast-food menus, said J.M. Owens, president of the Greater Atlanta McDonald's Operators Association.

"All of us want to do a better job on what we put in our bodies," he said. "(In reality) having salads on the menu gives us the psychological permission to come to McDonald's and buy a burger and milkshake."

In a sense, that might be why Krystal scored so low on the Consumer Reports survey, said Doug Pendergast, the company's president. Krystal has salads on the menu, but sales of salads make up only one-tenth of 1 percent of the total, he said.

"In our research, we have seen a trend where the average customer has asked for more healthful options," he said. "However, what people say in a survey and what they purchase in an actual restaurant are two different things. About 60 percent of all customers buy at least one Krystal hamburger with their order." Still, Pendergast and fast-food industry leaders said they are taking notes. Millennials have certain things in common.

They like food they can share and they are more willing to experiment with different types of food. They also love snacking and seek out chains with a strong reputation for social responsibility. Chelsea Phillips, 22, said she knows the big fast-food chains have salads, but she prefers getting them from Moe's or Panera Bread because she thinks their ingredients are healthier.

"Moe's has free-range (chicken) and that's important to me because I focus on healthy eating," she said. "It's a choice for me. I can't digest what they have at fast-food restaurants because the grease makes me sick."

## Order, Post Online, Eat

Millennials' heavy use of technology has led to an explosion of phone apps that allow them to post online about what they eat. The trick for fast-food companies is letting their customers know they have low-calorie options.

But Lisa Gearhart thinks millennials are more interested in flavor than in tasteless dishes that are good for them.

"Millennials are also very health conscious, but not health obsessed," Gearhart said. She studies the generation for the Jacksonville, Florida, public relations firm St. John &amp; Partners,  "For them, dining out is as much a social experience as much as it is about fueling up."

Social media sites, like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, allow restaurants to get real-time feedback on how products are received. "There is a desire for freshness and customization," said Stephanie Gamble, vice president of Zaxby's.

Atlanta's Wing Zone runs a yearly Facebook competition where the company asks fans what flavors it should develop next for chicken wings, said founder and Chief Executive Officer Matt Friedman.

Millennials also want their food cooked to order. Friedman said that means fast-food restaurants will have to be willing to prepare food the way customers want.

McDonald's Owens said despite all the time being spent to understand what they want, millennials want the same thing everyone wants: "good food that you feel good eating on a regular basis."
