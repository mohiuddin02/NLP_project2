### PRO: Don't let Prohibition history repeat itself

LAS VEGAS — Prohibition doesn't work. We've tried it before. As our history books show, the Volstead Act, which prohibited the sale of alcohol in the 1920s, closed the doors of legal, regulated businesses. In their place, it opened a Pandora's box with unintended consequences.

These consequences — criminal activity, illegal manufacturing and distribution, and more — took years and significant resources to fully combat. All for the act to later be repealed.

Let's not let history repeat itself. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is woven into American history, having existed in some form since our nation's establishment.

Let's rely on common-sense safeguards and consumer protections. Let's extend well-established and effective gaming regulations to the newest form, online gaming.

## Unregulated Online Gambling's Growth

Blindly assuming a ban would end American's interest and participation in online gaming sets up local, state and federal law enforcement with tremendous expenses. And it would turn millions of average American citizens into criminals.

The black market exists already. Today's unregulated gambling websites are in clear violation of state and federal law and face no regulatory controls or tax obligations.

Estimates show growth in unregulated online gaming is explosive: an estimated 1 million Americans or more spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming sites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to participate in the newest form of gaming — online.

The U.S. should profit from online gambling, not vilify or ignore it. Moreover, the billions of dollars this new form of gaming technology generates could help cover costs associated with regulation and legal enforcement.

Modern technologies associated with online gaming exist to protect consumers — including minors, problem gamblers and others. Safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow for online gaming within its state borders. The technologies, while not perfect, will continue to improve.

Moreover, when properly implemented, the tax revenue generated through online gaming can cover the necessary expenses to ensure consumer protections for Americans. Money left over can support local communities' budget shortfalls to pay for essential public services such as education.

As with previous versions of draft legislation, states and casino operators should have the option of whether they support online gaming at all. For those that do, many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.

## Where Would A Ban End?

It's no secret that many state and local governments are woefully in need of new revenue streams. Online gaming holds the potential to assist with these budgetary shortfalls.

State lotteries are a perfect example of using entertainment to help subsidize the needs of state and local governments. A large number of states have kept up with 21st-century technologies by offering online lotteries. Wide-sweeping federal prohibition might endanger lotteries as well.

The slippery slope of a proposed ban doesn't stop at the state level. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was recently warned that popular sports fantasy leagues could be banned by this legislation as well.

It wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming were brought under scrutiny through federal prohibition, too. Facebook and other social media host games that might be investigated.

America is well known for its [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur). Innovators like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents and policymakers.

Let not federal government hinder innovation. Set up the rules so Americans can innovate —and play — on a level playing field with the rest of the world.

Pretending that innovation and the Internet doesn't or shouldn't exist is pointless. America should instead look back to both our historical mistakes and our historical innovations for inspiration on how to best navigate the challenges and opportunities associated with Internet gaming today.

### CON: Its effects would hurt families and society

WASHINGTON — Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos are newly licensed to operate online gambling sites. It's good news for them: After seven straight years of sinking profits, the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada predicts that if physical casinos continue to see profits shrink at the same rate as this year, their online gambling will have to double to make up for lost revenue.

It's no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey are jumping into online gambling. Both states rely on the money gambling brings in to pay for services — like education — for their residents.

The expansion of internet gambling was made possible by the Department of Justice's (DOJ) 2011 decision gutting the Wire Act. The act had previously banned internet gambling. But, the DOJ concluded that only online sports betting needed to be banned.

Be careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.

## Problem Gambling Could Rise

In 1999, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) recommended a moratorium on gambling expansion. And it asked for a complete ban of Internet gambling. It said more research needed to be done on its harms and benefits. Unfortunately this research has not happened. And online gambling advocates are petitioning Congress to approve regulations that would help them spread online gambling nationwide and give them the functions of a legalized market — most important among these, the illusion that online gambling is somehow safe.

Online gambling will increase gambling's availability. But where there is an increase in availability there's also a documented increase in occurrences of problem gambling. These lead to the accompanying social harms of bankruptcy, divorce, prison sentences, suicide.

Advocates for online gambling say problem gamblers make up only a small percentage of overall players. But, the numbers don't take into account ripple effects. Studies estimate that a problem gambler will affect an average of five to 10 other people.

Even recovering problem gamblers may not be able to undo the damage done. Gamblers can ruin their finances and relationships, particularly their marriages.

The NGISC reported receiving "abundant testimony and evidence that compulsive gambling introduces a greatly heightened level of stress and tension into marriages and families, often culminating in divorce and other manifestations of familial disharmony." It also found that "respondents representing 2 million adults identified a spouse's gambling as a significant factor in a prior divorce."

The total costs to society are immense. The increase in crime, financial hardship, lost work and family break-up have consequences for our society. They have led Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols to estimate the cost of gambling to outweigh its benefits by 3-to-1.

## Online Gambling More Dangerous

Internet gambling is particularly worrisome. Evidence overwhelmingly shows that compulsive gambling is three to four times more common among online gamblers than non-Internet gamblers.

Online gambling is fundamentally more dangerous than other forms of gambling. The 24/7 ease of access, speed of the game, solitary nature of play and ability to play multiple games at once make it so. It's also possible to lose more money than you have on hand.

Online gambling vendors claim they will be able to screen out minors, ensure a player's identity and validate that players are physically located where they say they are.

However, the FBI has countered this claim. In a 2009 letter to the Financial Services Committee it stated, "While the (online gambling) vendors may claim that they can validate age and location, they are more than likely relying on credit card information and geo-location to gather this information. Both can be spoofed."

Legalizing online gambling may seem like an attractive solution to a state's budget woes. Evidence, however, suggests the contrary. Gambling disproportionately impacts the poor. It diverts money away from local businesses and displaces existing sales tax revenue while fueling societal ills.

Both sides of this debate agree a state-by-state patchwork of online gambling regimes will not work. Congress needs to act in the interest of families and communities. It should update the Wire Act to ensure enforcement of federal law prohibiting Internet gambling.
