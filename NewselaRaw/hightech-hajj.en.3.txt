Every year, millions of the faithful travel to both sites. They go to visit sites important to the founding of Islam, and from the life of its prophet Muhammad. Journeys like theirs, known as the hajj, have been happening for centuries.

This year, 2 million Muslims will arrive in Saudi Arabia. Technological changes will make their Hajj experience safer and more comfortable than ever before.

## To Selfie Or Not

Some Muslim clerics are not happy about one change, however. Smartphones are now allowed at the holy places, for use in case of emergencies — but they are being used for other purposes too. Young pilgrims have begun snapping photos of themselves. They are photographing themselves kissing the Grand Mosque's black stone or taking selfies with other sacred sites in the background.

Many religious scholars condemn such tourist-like behavior.

Islamic Studies teacher Zahra Mohammad declared that taking a selfie and posting it online was wrong. Hajj, he said, is supposed to be free of "boasting or showing off."

Scholar Sheik Abdul Razzaq al-Badr agreed.

"It is as though the only purpose of this trip is to take pictures and not worship. And when they return home they say: 'Come look at me, this is me on Arafat, this is me in Muzdalifah!'" he said.

## Planning Ahead For Safety And Heat

Still, Saudi engineers and planners are being cheered for introducing new safety features. In the past, the annual hajj has seen serious problems. Among these have been deadly stampedes and numerous cases of heat stroke.

Crowding during the hajj can be extreme. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims attempt to walk around the mosques' interiors at the same time. Extremely hot weather is often a problem as well. Pilgrims pray outdoors, uncovered, in temperatures that can go above 120 degrees.

To help deal with the large crowds, a courtyard at Mecca's Grand Mosque has been modified. The mosque is now capable of handling 130,000 pilgrims per hour.

At the Masjid al-Nabawi mosque in Medina, 250 giant upside-down "umbrellas" have been installed over the courtyard. They serve to shade pilgrims from the sweltering afternoon sun. In an outdoor area of the mosque, sliding domes have also been installed. When necessary, they can be used to provide protection from the sun.

The kingdom will also use 60,000 guards to protect this year's hajj. Agents will use face-recognition software to spot possible troublemakers and will monitor 1,700 video cameras.

## Special Health Checks

Saudi health officials have also installed two medical screening points at Jidda airport. They will be used to check arriving African pilgrims for the Ebola virus. The goal is to prevent the disease's spread to the crowded hajj sites.

Also for the first time this year, 300 Indian pilgrims will be provided with free cellphones. These are loaded with a new app that can translate Arabic and help users navigate the vast sites. The app will be made available to other countries next year.

People receiving the new cellphones should probably avoid one thing, though — using them to take selfies.
