SAN ISIDRO, El Salvador — Somewhere trapped in the earth below Francisco Pineda's feet is an estimated 1.4 million ounces of gold. Pineda wants it to remain there.

He doesn't want an Australian mining company to extract the precious metal.

"What will happen with the water? To separate the gold and silver, they'll use cyanide. This will either filter into the water table or go into the river," said Pineda, who is an internationally recognized environmental activist.

The mine is located near the source of the Lempa River, the nation's most important waterway.

## Whose Decision Is It?

There are many in El Salvador who share Pineda's views. They say their densely populated nation cannot absorb the environmental damage that would result from mining.

Yet the choice is not theirs — just as it is not up to the Salvadoran government, which opposes the mining.

In fact, the fate of the El Dorado gold mine will not be resolved anywhere near this tiny Central American country. Rather, it is being weighed by a three-judge tribunal, or court, based in Washington, D.C.

The little-known court is formally called the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Last month, it heard eight days of arguments over whether an Australian company, OceanaGold, is entitled to proceed with the El Dorado project despite the opposition of El Salvador's government. Sometime early in 2015, the tribunal will issue its ruling.

The unusual case is a sign of how international business laws are allowing corporations to act against foreign governments that limit their future profits. Critics say such laws are giving courts power over entire countries and their leaders.

## Suspicions And Conflict

The lawsuit brought by OceanaGold could put El Salvador in a no-win situation: Either allow OceanaGold to mine or pay the company the $301 million it says it would have earned from the gold.

"For us, it is very tough that three judges will be deciding this case. They've never been here. They've never asked us what we want. It is really ugly that someone is deciding our future without asking our opinion," Pineda said.

Suspicions run deep over the project, which has led to violence. Four mining opponents were killed between 2009 and 2011, and their cases have yet to be resolved.

The Australian company now at the center of the conflict is a latecomer. Late last year, it bought a Canadian company, Pacific Rim, which had explored El Dorado for gold.

## Protecting The Environment

OceanaGold, which operates on three continents, says it can meet the strictest environmental standards.

A modern mining operation can recycle a large portion of the water it uses, OceanaGold spokeswoman Andrea Atell said. "Safe, quality water and modern mining" can coexist, she says.

OceanaGold claims that El Salvador imposed an "illegal and unjustified ban" on metal mining in 2008. It called the ban a "gross misuse of authority" that ignored an earlier Salvadoran law passed in 1999. Under the earlier law the first company, Pacific Rim, had spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration.

The exploration conducted by Pacific Rim doubled estimates of how much gold remains unmined at El Dorado.

## Cyanide Fears Are A Factor

Pacific Rim entered El Salvador in 2002. At that time, a pro-business president was in office and anti-mining sentiment had not yet surged. The company's lawyers told the tribunal that activists opposed to the mine had undertaken a campaign of lies designed to turn the people of El Salvador against the company. For example, they said, activists claimed the company would use 2 tons of cyanide daily and that the pollution would make women unable to bear children.

Among those testifying was former Pacific Rim spokeswoman Cristina Elizabeth Garcia Cabezas, who argued that people are unnecessarily frightened about the use of cyanide in mining.

"They do not understand that cyanide is delivered in a solid form, or that it quickly breaks down in the environment," she said.

The current president of El Salvador and the two before him have all enforced a ban on mining. The anti-mining cause also has gained the support of the Roman Catholic Church and influential global activist groups, such as Oxfam.

President Salvador Sanchez Ceren flatly rejects mining. "Everyone says that El Salvador has a wealth underground, having golden valleys and basins of silver," he said. "But what does it mean if we allow it to be removed? It will destroy our lives."

## Many Say Jobs Make The Mining OK

It doesn't take much effort, however, to find people in the small city of San Isidro who would like the jobs that come with a working mine.

"Let them come here and invest," said Gilberto Vasquez Ramos, a city council member. "Yes, it might damage the environment a little bit, but the government can regulate this — if they do damage, they'll have to pay the fine."

Luis A. Parada, a lawyer for El Salvador's government, said Pacific Rim had never obtained a mining license and had not fully followed Salvadoran mining law.

The big question, Parada said, is whether a foreign company should have to follow the laws of the country in which it is operating. Is it really fair, he asked, for a country to have to change or bend its laws to satisfy a foreign company?

If OceanaGold were to win, he added, it would set a very bad example and would encourage "other companies to force other countries to get what they want."
