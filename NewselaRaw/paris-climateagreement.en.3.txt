LE BOURGET, France — Nearly 200 nations have just agreed to work together to fight global warming. The new deal was signed in Paris on Saturday and is known as the "Paris agreement." It calls on the world to first cut and then end greenhouse gas pollution.

Greenhouse gases come mostly from the burning of oil, coal and gas. We burn these fuels to produce the energy used to run cars and power factories. 

Once released, greenhouse gases become trapped in the upper atmosphere. They store heat, which leads to a steady rise in global temperatures. Scientists call this rise in temperature climate change or global warming.

## Warming Could Make Sea Levels Rise

Global warming creates all sorts of problems for the planet. Among the most serious is a rise in sea levels. The rise is caused by the melting of polar ice caps. As water levels rise, coastlines and small island nations are threatened. 

If unchecked, global warming may also lead to serious worldwide droughts. Many people could be left without enough water. It could become much harder to grow enough food to feed the world.

Trees, soil and oceans all absorb a certain amount of greenhouse gases. The aim of the Paris agreement is to limit greenhouse gases to the level that can be absorbed. The goal is to reach that level between 2050 and 2100.

On Saturday, loud clapping broke out after the agreement was signed. Some people cried and others hugged.

## "A Victory For All Of The Planet"

"It's a victory for all of the planet and for future generations," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. The agreement will prevent the worst results of climate change "from ever happening," he added.

Brazilian official Izabella Teixeira also hailed the agreement. "Today, we've proven that it's possible for every country to come together," she said.

"History will remember this day," United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said. "The Paris agreement on climate change is a monumental success for the planet."

President Barack Obama said the climate agreement offers "the best chance to save the one planet we have."

The agreement says countries must make sure global temperatures rise by less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. It says countries will try to limit the rise even more, to 2.7 degrees. In recent history, the world has already warmed by about 1.8 degrees.

Scientist Ben Strauss said limiting warming to 2.7 degrees instead of 3.6 degrees would make a huge difference. It could cut in half the number of people who will lose their homes to rising sea levels. The homes of as many as 140 million people could be saved.

## Many Wonder If Deal Will Work

Not everyone is happy with the new agreement, though. They question whether it will really work. 

To achieve the agreement's goal, countries will have to completely change how people get energy. Many wonder how many countries will make the tough changes necessary. Under the agreement, countries that do not meet their goals will not be punished.

Many feel the new agreement is too weak to save the planet. Thousands of protesters demonstrated across Paris, calling for tougher climate action.

Kumi Naidoo works for the group Greenpeace. The agreement is a good start but is not enough, he said.

"Today the human race has joined in a common cause, but it's what happens after" that really matters, he said. "This deal alone won't dig us out of the hole we're in." 

The agreement is an important breakthrough, though. Never before have so many countries pledged to work together to cut greenhouse gases.

French President Francois Hollande said France is ready to cut even more than is required by the agreement. He challenged all nations to do more.

"The 12th of December, 2015, will remain a great date for the planet," Hollande declared.
