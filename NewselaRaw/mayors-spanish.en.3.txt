MEXICO CITY â€” The mayor of Los Angeles made a trip to Mexico on March 2.

Eric Garcetti wasn't the first LA mayor to make an official visit to the Mexican capital. He wasn't even the first to visit and speak Spanish.

Like past mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Garcetti speaks Spanish. But it's a kind of Spanish that might be called Funky American Business Spanish.

Villaraigosa and Garcetti have Latino roots. But both had to learn much of their Spanish in school or on the job. They speak a little Spanish, but it's far from perfect. Both have approached their lack of skill with good humor. During a 2009 visit to Mexico City, Villaraigosa referred to himself jokingly as "el pochito." "Pocho" is slang for an Americanized Mexican who may not speak Spanish well.

## Mayor's Mexican Roots

On Tuesday, Garcetti referred to his language skills as "good community meeting Spanish." Garcetti's grandfather on his father's side was born in Mexico.

The Mexican media was just as eager as LA voters to chat him up. They were fascinated by the new LA mayor with Mexican roots and an Italian name.

"Yesterday I think I did 15 individual interviews" in Spanish, Garcetti said. "At the end of the day, your head kind of hurts. But the next day, you're speaking it again, and it hurts a little less."

At a news conference Monday, the mayor was able to answer questions in Spanish. He talked about the two cities' shared challenges and his mixed Jewish-Latino background. His answers were also full of the kinds of little mistakes that his 11th-grade Spanish teacher would have marked in red pen.

At one point, he appeared to have invented a word: "agrecimiento," to mean "acuerdo," or "agreement." Moments later, he stuck the English word "between" in the middle of a Spanish sentence. Later, making a reference to the "social fabric," Garcetti said what sounded like the "fabrica social" (in Spanish, "el tejido social"), which could be translated as "the social factory."

## Speaking, In Spanish, Of Trade

If Garcetti had been speaking French on a diplomatic mission to Paris, he might have been yelled at for his errors, some say jokingly. But Mexicans tend not to be such purists. They have also built up years of tolerance for visitors from El Norte mangling their mother tongue.

"There's no gotcha involved here," Gil Cedillo, an LA City Councilman who is traveling with the mayor on the four-day trip, said in an interview Tuesday.

Cedillo's parents, like many Latino parents at the time, saw the widespread prejudice against Spanish speakers. They decided it best that their son join the English speakers.

"I know I'm limited," he said. "I know my grammar is not correct. But I know people here appreciate the effort."

Garcetti used Spanish often during last year's mayoral race. He emphasized his Mexican background even as some well-known local Latino leaders rallied behind the other candidate. At least one of them questioned Garcetti's Latino roots. The tactic probably helped him carry most of the heavily Latino neighborhoods on LA's Eastside in the May election.

Building favor with Mexico on the business front also makes good sense. Many goods from Mexico are sold in LA. Trade between Los Angeles and the Mexican capital alone was $2.2 billion in 2010. The largest number of foreign tourists to LA are also from Mexico.
