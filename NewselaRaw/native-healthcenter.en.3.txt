DALLAS, Texas â€” The Urban Inter-Tribal Center of Texas is a medical center in Dallas. Its patients are mostly American Indians. However, if you didn't know better, you might think the center was a shoe store. There are orange boxes of Nike sneakers along the wall.

The Nike shoes are designed for the patients of the health clinic. They are made to keep patients healthy. They also look different than normal Nikes. The sneakers are made out of beige fabric that feels like leather. There is a pattern on the fabric that represents the North Star.

These sneakers are one way the clinic serves its patients. It is creative with how it helps the local people. The clinic gives the shoes out to patients who have diabetes. These sneakers are designed to prevent foot surgery, which is a common problem for people with diabetics.

## More Than Just Medical Care

The center has many different programs to help American Indian patients. It provides basic medical, dental and pharmacy services. Patients who visit are members of local Indian tribes. If the center didn't exist, these patients would have to travel hours to receive health care from other facilities.

American Indians often face unique health challenges. Their problems are different from other Americans. That is one of the reasons the clinic is important, says the center's leader, Dr. Rodney Stapp.

## Living On Reservations Led To Problems

According to Stapp, the federal government is partly at fault. The government forced American Indians to live together on reservations. These are special areas of land. People had to move away from their homes and start over on the reservations. Their lives changed a great deal. Before they moved, many American Indians hunted for their food. On the reservations, they were forced to become farmers. This changed how the people got their food, what they ate and their physical activity.

Many American Indians felt trapped. There were problems with mental health, alcohol and smoking.

## Special Nikes Designed For American Indian Feet

Stapp decided to become a doctor to help American Indians.

He is a podiatrist, a doctor who specializes in feet, and Stapp helped develop the diabetic shoes. He worked with Nike to create the sneakers. He said the shoes are also designed to prevent foot ulcers. Foot ulcers are another health problem that diabetic patients often get. Stapp said the shoes are made to fit American Indian feet, which are extra wide at the heel.

Patsy Smith is a patient who knows the value of the clinic's services. Smith is 62 and lives in a local neighborhood in Dallas. She has been visiting the clinic for the last 45 years.

Going to the clinic, she said, feels like "going back home."

## Clinic Aims To Build Community

The clinic offers more than health care. It also hosts job-training workshops to help patients find work. There is a community garden to grow traditional vegetables. Most importantly, it is a place for American Indians in Dallas County to come and meet each other. About 30,000 American Indians live in the area.

While the clinic provides many things, it does have limited resources. One patient had to wait months to get a tooth removed. Stapp says he is trying his best. The center works hard so American Indian culture can survive and its people can thrive.

"We just want people to have the opportunity to do something with their lives," Stapp says.
