Mike Huckabee, the folksy former Arkansas governor, preacher and television host, has entered the 2016 presidential race.

A favorite of social conservative and evangelical Christian voters, Huckabee, 59, has a base of loyal supporters from his prior White House run. Still, he faces a cast of potential rivals that is larger and stronger than in 2008. He has remained in the public eye and in voters' living rooms through a Fox News show, but he has been out of office for more than eight years.

Huckabee, who announced his presidential bid in his boyhood home of Hope, Arkansas, is the sixth GOP candidate to officially enter the race. On Monday, Dr. Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina announced long-shot plans to seek the White House. They joined three Republican senators who previously declared their candidacies â€” Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida.

## The Ghosts of 2008

Chief among the obstacles Huckabee faces are rivals who appeal to the same voters responsible for Huckabee's first-place finish in Iowa in the 2008 Republican primary. These rivals also are proven fundraisers, a skill Huckabee lacked in that campaign, when he raised just $16 million.

"In 2007 and 2008, people gave him a pass for not being able to raise a lot of money because no one knew who he was. Now everyone knows who he is," said Bob Vander Plaats, who served as Huckabee's Iowa co-chairman in 2008 and is currently not sure whom he will support. "Can he back that up with the finances to run a top-tier campaign?"

Huckabee was not regarded as a serious White House candidate in 2008 until his surprise come-from-behind win over former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in Iowa. His success against the much better-funded Romney was in part due to the lack of serious competition. Other candidates included Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, who decided in the end not to run, and actor and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson, who did not get enough support.

## Kicking The Tires

The potential GOP field for 2016 of nearly two dozen candidates includes several who align with religious conservatives, notably Cruz and Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin.

Others interested in the White House and popular with evangelicals include former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. Paul is also courting religious voters.

"People, just by nature, are kind of drawn to the new car smell,"  said Vander Plaats. He is the president of Family Leader, an Iowa-based Christian conservative group. "So people are going to want to take a test drive, kick the tires, and sit inside all the new cars, look at all the new candidates and see if that's the direction they want to go,"

Vander Plaats said that Huckabee's hope will be to "persevere, stay the course," and hope that his followers return to vote for him.

A poll released Monday, however, shows that just over half of registered Republican voters said they could see themselves casting a ballot for the former governor. Rubio, Walker and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush received far more support by Republicans in the study.

## Devoted Supporters

Huckabee's campaign sees Iowa and South Carolina as key to winning the Republican nomination. Both states are dominated by evangelical voters and hold two of the first nominating contests in the nation. Immediately after announcing his presidential bid, Huckabee planned to travel to these states.

Huckabee's greatest strength is his skill on the campaign stump. His roots as a Baptist preacher are on display while he is campaigning.

Among Huckabee's core supporters, the devotion remains.

"It's kind of like first love," said Craig Robinson, founder of the Iowa Republican website. "They're not the type of people who are trying to be wooed by some other campaign. They held out hope he would run in 2012. They're the kind of people who never even shopped the field because Mike Huckabee is their guy."

## Compare And Contrast

Huckabee connected with working-class voters by pointing to his poor upbringing well before this was popular with Republican candidates. He was the first male in his father's line to graduate from high school. He was also one generation removed on his mother's side from dirt floors and outhouses.

Country versus country club was a constant contrast Huckabee made against Romney, and one he will likely make against Bush, who is expected to run. Both Bush and Romney come from wealthy, politically connected families.

Huckabee was called insufficiently conservative because he has strayed from the Republican Party position. He was criticized for supporting some tax increases when he was governor. He supported the closure of the military prison in Guantanamo Bay for detaining Islamic extremists suspected of making war on the United States. He changed his mind on supporting immigration and the Cuban embargo, the ban against trading with Cuba,

All of that is likely to be exploited by his rivals.

"The field is so strong this time, it's going to be extremely difficult for Huckabee," said Sam Clovis. He a political science professor at Morningside College in Iowa and an influential conservative former radio host in the state. "I don't know what his ceiling is, but it's not nearly as high as it was."
