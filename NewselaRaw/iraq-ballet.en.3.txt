BAGHDAD — Ann Khalid did not feel well. Still, she insisted on dancing a brief scene from the "Swan Lake" ballet with her classmates. The 12-year-old wants to have a career of dancing and teaching ballet.

Her dream is not easy in Iraq, a country ripped apart by years by conflict.

"My school and my church are the two things I love the most in Baghdad," Khalid said with pride.

If she has a shot at her dream, it's because of the Baghdad School of Music and Ballet.

The school has survived many years of trouble. The Iraqi capital once was a Middle East center of culture, but has not been for years. Violence is now a part of daily life and strict religious ideas control how people must behave in public. Still, the school has carved out a tiny place for creativity.

## School Once Thrived

"Where else in Iraq can you walk into a school and listen to a small boy playing Antonio Vivaldi on his violin?" boasts Ahmed Salim Ghani. He is the school principal and an expert musician.

Another rare thing: The school isn't split up by boys and girls like almost all Iraqi schools. Male and female students take classes together from kindergarten to high school.

Ghani remembers Baghdad's golden age — the 1960s through to the 1980s — when the city's rich people supported art and culture. At the same time, the government had plenty of money from selling oil and gave some to the arts. The school, which started in 1968, thrived.

Black-and-white video of a 1977 school production of "The Nutcracker" shows a high level of dancing, with the children wearing professional-level costumes. In class photos from the time, the schoolgirls and female teachers wear miniskirts. The boys wear blazers and bow ties.

Things went bad for Baghdad and the school after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The United Nations punished the country and oil couldn't easily be sold. Money was running low for the country and the school.

## Invasion And Chaos

The city plunged deeper into chaos after 2003, when the U.S. and other countries invaded Iraq. People stole from the school days after Saddam Hussein was removed as president, and the school was was partially burned later.

Strict religion rose and the ideas of religious leaders affected people's lives. Ballet was considered immoral and anti-Islamic, and even music was criticized.

The school removed its large street sign to escape attention. Children hid their musical instruments when out in public or left them at school.

Daily bombings, assassinations and kidnappings forced parents to keep their children at home. The school's best Iraqi ballet and music teachers fled. During the worst times in the mid-2000s, the number of students plunged to an all-time low of 100 to 120, said Ghani.

The city has become safer, but bombings continue.

"We hope it is just a phase that will eventually go away," said Salam Arab. His 16-year-old son Maysara is one of the school's best male dancers. "It's a rare school in the Arab world, and it is very important that it continues to carry out its mission."

The religious ideas throughout Baghdad's society have a powerful effect as well.

## "Everyone Says It Is Haram"

The school now has around 500 students. But many parents pull their daughters out of ballet when they are 12 or 13. They object on religious grounds to the girls being lifted and held by boys their age while performing, says Zeina Akram Fayzy, a 40-year-old ballet instructor.

"Years of our hard work go to waste," said Fayzy, who graduated from the school.

Leezan Salam, who graduated this year, said that when she started ballet at the school, there were around 30 girls with her. By the time she reached the 10th grade, "we were only three."

Khalid, the 12-year-old, says the moral questions surrounding dance don't dent her enthusiasm.

"Everyone says it is haram (religiously prohibited) and disgraceful. But my parents are happy for me to dance," she said.

Dance can be a problem for boys, too.

Maysara said he doesn't tell people he dances. "Those in my neighborhood who have found out often mock me," he said.
