A week ago, a French paper was attacked by two gunmen after it printed cartoons of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. Twelve people were shot and killed, including four cartoonists.

On Wednesday, the paper, Charlie Hebdo, will print its first issue since the attack. On the cover is a cartoon of Muhammad. He is crying and holding a sign that says, "Je suis Charlie" — "I am Charlie." The headline reads, "All is forgiven."

Over the years, Charlie Hebdo has published cartoons that have offended Muslims, Christians and Jews. Many of its cartoons show Muhammad in a very negative way. Muslims do not show the prophet in drawings. They feel it is disrespectful and hurtful.

After the attack, many people in France wore signs that said "Je suis Charlie" to stand with the slain cartoonists. The signs also showed support for freedom of speech, the right to express thoughts and opinions.

## Cartoonist's Cover Drawing

On Tuesday, staff members from Charlie Hebdo held an emotional meeting. They explained why they decided to put Mohammad on the cover again.

Gerard Biard, the editor in chief of Charlie Hebdo, said the new issue was put together "with pain and with joy." Three million copies will be published in many languages. Usually, it prints 60,000 copies per week.

Cartoonist Renald Luzier, known as Luz, described how he came up with the cover drawing.

"I said to myself, we must do a drawing that above all makes us laugh," said Luzier, who has worked at Charlie Hebdo for 20 years.

Luzier said he chose Muhammad as the subject because "he is a character that got our offices burned." This was not the first time Charlie Hebdo was attacked. In 2011, its office was bombed.

Luzier drew Muhammad crying on the cover, he said. Then, he said, he cried himself.

## "It Was Our Front Page"

"This was not the front page the world wanted us to draw, it was our front page. This is not the front page that the terrorists want us to draw — there are no terrorists in it, just a man who cries," Luzier said.

"This Muhammad is so much nicer" than the Muhammad of extremists, Biard said,   holding the cover in the air. "He's sympathetic. Look at him, he's crying!"

During the meeting, Luzier repeatedly grew upset and rubbed tears from his eyes.

French police are investigating last week's attack. The two gunmen were killed by police on Friday. Luzier along with the rest of the paper's staff have been working this week in offices at a newspaper called Liberacion.

The day of the attack, Jan. 7, was Luzier's birthday. He was running late and did not get to the Charlie Hebdo office until after the attack was over.

## "Yes I Am Charlie"

Luzier admitted that the latest cover showing Muhammad may upset people. "There are risks" to publishing another cover with Muhammad, said Luzier, who promised to keep drawing.

"We can't remain silent," he said.

"We trust people's intelligence, their sense of humor," he said. "People who committed this attack are just people who lack humor."

"Yes I am Charlie," Luzier said. "But I am also a cop. I am Jewish. I am Muslim. And I am atheist," which is a person who does not believe in God. Luzier was talking about two police officers who were killed during Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo.

The next day, a policewoman was killed by a different gunman. On Friday, the same gunman killed four Jewish people in an attack on a kosher grocery store. The gunman was killed by police. That was also the day the gunmen who had attacked Charlie Hebdo were killed by police.

Luzier said he has had a difficult time following the attack. Many of his co-workers at Charlie Hebdo are still struggling with what happened, he said. Luzier added that he hopes they return to work soon.

If Charlie Hebdo and other papers grow stronger, Luzier said, "we have really won."
