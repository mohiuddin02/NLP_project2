CAIRO â€” Two years ago, Mohammed Morsi was the president of Egypt. Now he might be put to death by Egyptian courts.

Morsi was accused of breaking out of prison before he became president. The court said he then plotted to take over the Egyptian government.

Morsi became president in 2012. He was was elected after people started demonstrating for democracy.

In 2011, thousands of Egyptians started protesting. They were upset at the government of President Hosni Mubarak. Many felt Mubarak's government was cruel. Protesters were also tired of how much control the army had over the country.

Many of those who protested Mubarak were religious Muslims. They wanted Islam to be a bigger part of Egyptian life. Morsi belongs to a group called the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a religious and political group.

During the 2011 revolt, Morsi was arrested and put in jail, but he escaped. Morsi had many people who supported him.

## Morsi Became President In A Fair Election

In 2012, Egypt had an election for president. It was fair and everyone could vote. It was the first time Egypt had completely fair and open elections. Morsi won enough votes to become the president of Egypt.

When Morsi became president, it seemed like a huge victory to many. The army's control of the government seemed to have finally ended.

However, Morsi turned out to be not very good at running the country.

In June 2013 huge crowds went into the streets. They demanded that Morsi step down. Army leader Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi then ordered Morsi's arrest.

El-Sissi quickly became the country's president. Since then, he has been harsh on the Muslim Brotherhood and others who do not agree with him.

Morsi was not the only person sentenced to death on Saturday. More than 100 others were, too. All of them were accused of plotting to seize control of the Egyptian government.

## Court Also Decides Some People Told Secrets

Sixteen more people were ordered to be put to death for a different reason. They were accused of giving state secrets to the Middle Eastern nation of Iran while Morsi was in power.

"Today will be remembered as one of the darkest days" in Egypt's history, said Amr Darrag. During Morsi's presidency Darrag served in the government. He left Egypt after Morsi was removed from office.

Saturday's judgment was based on "lies," Darrag said.

Egyptian courts have sentenced hundreds of people to death over the last several months. Experts say the rulings have not been fair at all. Tens of thousands of other people have been put in jail.

On Saturday the court said Morsi had plotted with groups from outside Egypt. Their plan was to put the Muslim Brotherhood in power, the court said.

No reporters were allowed in court on Saturday. For that reason, it is not known what proof the court had to say that Morsi committed the crimes.

Morsi arrived smiling. He was wearing a blue prison uniform.

Morsi and the other prisoners did not remain quiet in court. They chanted against the army as the court told them what their punishments were.
