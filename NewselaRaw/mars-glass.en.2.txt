Scientists have identified deposits of an unusual material known as "impact glass" on Mars. On Earth this same material has been shown to preserve evidence of ancient life that was trapped inside it. Therefore, impact glass on Mars could provide important information about how well Mars may have been able to support life and if anything used to live on the planet. Brown University's Kevin Cannon and John Mustard reported the glass discovery. They located the impact glass with the help of a NASA Mars orbiter.

When an asteroid or comet crashes into a planet's surface, the immense energy of the crash can melt rock and soil. If this liquid rock cools quickly enough, it hardens into impact glass, instead of becoming another substance. This impact glass is different from the glass we find in daily life. It is dark brown, almost black, and only partly transparent. It may look like freshly cooled lava from a volcano, Cannon says. However, lava and impact glass are formed differently.

## Creating Mars Rocks On Earth

Asteroids and comets routinely slam into planets throughout the solar system. Therefore, scientists have long suspected that impact glass exists on other planets. The new study supports this idea.

Until now, it has been impossible to be sure that impact glass existed on Mars. Scientists identify different types of rocks on the Martian surface by picking out the unique light, or spectral "fingerprints," these materials leave in sunlight reflected off the planet. Impact glass has a weak spectral signal. Materials you cannot see through, such as rocks, are called opaque. They absorb a lot of sunlight. Opaque materials give off a stronger signal that hides any impact glass mixed in with rocks on the planet.

Cannon solved this problem. He made his own artificial Martian impact glass. He combined powders to create a mix that was similar to rocks on Mars. He then melted his mixture in an oven and allowed it to harden into fake impact glass.

Then Cannon and Mustard, a professor in Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown, measured the spectral signal of this imitation impact glass. After doing this, they knew precisely what to look for on Mars.

## How To Find That Proof Of Life

Their search turned up a bunch of previously undetected glass deposits in craters across the Martian surface. "It wasn't completely surprising," Cannon said. "We thought that it should be there, and it's really nice to" prove that.

The study was the first clear finding of impact glass on Mars.

The detection of the impact glass on Mars is especially exciting. Studies of similar glass on Earth have shown it can preserve traces of life that existed both before something hit the planet and after.

Last year, a team of geologists led by Peter Schultz of Brown reported finding plant leaves in the impact glass of an Argentinian crater. According to Schultz, impact glass might similarly capture and preserve bits of tiny life on Mars. This suggestion caused Cannon and Mustard to conduct their search. "There is no proof that there ever was life on Mars," says planetary scientist Kieren Howard of the City University of New York. If Mars was once inhabited, however, the bits of life inside impact glass might help scientists figure out what its environment was like long ago, he said.

Impact glass is not only good for giving a snapshot of life where the planet was hit. The glass can hold tiny life-forms that move in after the dust has settled.

## Much To Understand Of Mars Atmosphere

Tiny life-forms called chemolithoautotrophs can tunnel into the glass and live. "These guys were thought to be some of the earliest types of life on Earth," said Haley Sapers of Western University in Ontario, Canada. The life-forms also might be on other planets, Sapers said. The chemolithoautotrophs "basically eat rocks," she said.

Some of these microbes, or tiny life forms, create acid. The acid allows them to dissolve the glass and consume nourishment, or nutrients, found in the glass. As the glass dissolves, the microbes burrow deeper, forming tiny tunnels. No actual chemolithoautotrophs have ever been sighted wriggling through impact glass on Earth, Sapers says. Still, there is strong evidence that they lived in the impact glass of a 15-million-year-old crater in Germany.

So, if these tiny tunnels were found in the Martian glass, could that be evidence that the Red Planet was — or perhaps still is — home to alien life? Such tunnels would certainly create suspicion of at least past life. According to Cannon, however, "There's no reason to think there's any living life on Mars today." Besides, Sapers says that detecting tunnels in the glass would require returning samples to Earth. Doing this would surely kill anything still alive in the glass.

Still, the glass may contain gases from the time of the meteorite's collision. Understanding the development of the Martian atmosphere over time is important information for figuring out how its surface might have supported life at one time.
