His dad told him to "Google it."

So Shubham did. He soon learned about Braille. The blind use Braille to read and write. Braille is paper with raised dots on it. Blind people read the dots with their fingers.

Braille needs special printers. The printers cost thousands of dollars. Shubham was surprised to learn that.

So he invented a cheaper printer. Using Lego pieces, he made a Braille printer for his school science fair.

## It's Good To Be Curious

Shubham is just 13 years old. Already he has his own company. He calls it Braigo Labs. It is trying to be the first company to make cheap Braille printers.

"It was curiosity," Shubham explained. "I'm always thinking up something. If you think it can be done, then it can probably be done."

Shubham was invited to the White House to show his printer. He has won many awards. On Tuesday, Intel Corporation said it will give money to Braigo to help build the printers. Intel is one of the largest makers of computer chips. The money will let Shubham hire workers to make his printer. Then he can think more about school.

## People Will Be Able To Read More

Groups for the blind want a printer that does not cost a lot of money. It could help more blind people read books and news. It could also help them learn to read Braille. Right now, only one out of 10 blind people in the United States can read Braille.

"There is absolutely a need," said Gary Mudd. He is with the American Printing House for the Blind. "Being blind is sometimes very expensive."

Braille printers start at about $2,000. They cost $10,000 for schools and businesses. Braigo plans to sell its printer for about $350.

## He Has Learned A Lot

The big question is will enough people buy them? Few blind people read Braille. Also, paper Braille may not be needed much longer. Braille can be read on phones.

Even if the printers do not sell, Shubham has had a great experience.

For a while, Shubham's mom worried he was wasting his time.

"He would keep building and breaking things," Malini Banerjee said. She would tell him to give up and go to bed.

Now she tells every mom, "Believe in your child."
