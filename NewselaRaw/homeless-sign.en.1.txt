CHICAGO Ill. — Among the tall towers and tourists crowding the popular streets of Chicago are members of an often overlooked population — homeless men and women with signs begging for change.

Many of these signs seem like they were hastily scribbled. But over the past few months, many of them have been replaced by an art student in Chicago who hoped that beautiful lettering would allow the signs to stand out in the busy streets of Chicago.

"My hope was that the Chicago project would create some awareness around the homeless," said Ian Todd, the artist responsible for the signs. "And also that people would be more inclined to talk when they walk by, and more willing to give."

Todd, 23, said he was overwhelmed by the number of homeless people in Chicago when he moved to the city from California.

"It was a bit shocking seeing all the homelessness," Todd said. He was taking a class on expressive type and scripts when he first starting noticing the homeless population. After seeing someone holding a cardboard sign, Todd thought a well-designed sign could really grab people's attention.

## Each Takes Hours To Complete

Todd first approached homeless people in April to ask whether or not they wanted new signs. Some refused, but others agreed and Todd got to work. He finished about 20 signs in two months. According to Todd, the complexity of the lettering meant one sign could take anywhere from 5 to 10 hours to complete.

All of the signs Todd made were photographed and put on his website, "The Urban Type Experiment." The signs tell many stories of struggle, from a single father trying to support three children to a woman offering work so she can afford a bus ticket home. Todd kept in touch with many of the people for whom he made signs. Some of them said the signs helped, while others said they did not.

Mike Droney, 54, was holding one of Todd's signs on Michigan Avenue on a recent sunny afternoon. The aging piece of cardboard read: "I lost my leg for my country. Please help, you will be blessed."

Droney, who has been homeless for six years, said he lost his leg fighting in Somalia. He sits in front of a Starbucks most days asking for money. Droney said he often gets compliments about the sign, but it is hard to tell whether the lettering is really doing much.

Ulysses White, 54, also has one of Todd's signs and said it has resulted in more charity. White said he served two tours in Iraq, and his sign makes mention of his service before saying: "Anything is appreciated. Thank you for your generosity."

White got his customized piece of cardboard after being introduced to Todd by one of his homeless friends who already had a sign.

"The new sign has helped," White said. "He made signs for a whole bunch of people along Michigan Avenue."

## Not The First Project Of Its Kind

Todd's project is not the first of its kind. In 2011, the Chicago Tribune newspaper did a piece on a man named Christopher Devine who was printing and laminating signs for the homeless. Devine's signs were much simpler than Todd's. They were printed on white paper in bold Helvetica font with text saying "Homeless" or "Please Help."

Devine, 32, has seen Todd's artwork on the street and was very happy to see another project whose goal was making the homeless population more visible to others.

Todd's signs are "eye-catching," Devine said. "The important part of both projects is that the signs are different aesthetically than your typical homeless sign."

Devine admits there were a few people who were against his own project, but he was never bothered by them. "The point is, yesterday they weren't talking about homelessness, and today they are," he said.

## Homelessness In Chicago Is Getting Worse

Ed Shurna is the executive director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. He said that while the new signs may have helped some people in the homeless community, Chicago's homeless problem requires organized, specific action. "It's getting worse," Shurna said.

Shurna said Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner has new plans that would mostly likely reduce care services for poor people and make the homeless problem in Illinois worse.

"If the cuts being proposed at the state level continue, you are going to see shelters closing," Shurna said. Even now, the current shelters Chicago has are not sufficient for the number of homeless men and women in the city.

## California Could Be Next

Todd, who graduated from the Chicago design school in May, recently moved to Los Angeles to begin an internship at an advertising company. He told his homeless friends before he left that he would no longer be able to make signs for them. While he said his new job keeps him very busy, he didn't rule out making signs for California's homeless.

"Homelessness is definitely here," Todd said. "I wouldn't mind getting something started."
