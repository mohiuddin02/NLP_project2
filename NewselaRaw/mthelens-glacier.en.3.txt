SEATTLE â€” In 1980, Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington state erupted.

Thirty-five years later, it is the setting for the world's newest glacier.

Crater Glacier is special because it is growing at a time when most glaciers are shrinking.

"It's cascading down into this valley now," Ray Yurkewycz said. He pointed out a piece of ice flowing into the steep ravine. Yurkewycz is with Mount St. Helens Institute. The group teaches people about the mountain. "It's only been in the last two years that it started doing that."

Yurkewycz led a small group of hikers up the mountain late last month. They were treated to a rare, close-up view of the glacier. The only way to really see the glacier is to go on the hike, which costs $195 per person. Critics say that is too expensive. They want people to be able to go where they want throughout the entire 110,000-acre Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.

## Funky Things Happen Up There

The volcano's north side is where it erupted. The U.S. Forest Service does not let most people up there. The rugged upper slopes are dangerous. Also, the area is an open-air laboratory for scientists studying the volcano and glacier.

Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Cascades Volcano Observatory have been visiting the area since the early 1980s.

They have recorded the unique conditions that formed the glacier.

"Nothing about this glacier is typical," USGS scientist Steve Schilling said.

## The Perfect Snow Spot

Before the volcano erupted, Mount St. Helens was shaped like a cone. It was surrounded by a dozen small glaciers. Most were destroyed during the eruption. The mountain's north side collapsed, unleashing the biggest landslide ever recorded.

A blast wiped out everything for miles around. It destroyed 230 square miles of forest. When the dust and ash settled, a horseshoe-shaped shell of a mountain was left.

That shell provided a perfect nest for a baby glacier.

The shell faces north. This helps shield snow from the sun. A thick layer of volcanic rock on the floor blocks the volcanic heat from below. A lava dome formed where snow could pile up.

By 1988, it held a layer of snow more than 200 feet thick.

But things really got weird in 2004.

That is when the volcano came back to life. It spit steam and oozed thick lava for several years.

## "It's Pretty Exciting"

Now, the glacier is creeping farther down the valley. A stream of melted water springs from the base of the glacier. It waters trees and flowers down below.

USGS geologist Dave Sherrod said the ice is about 650 feet thick in places. Measured in a straight line, the glacier is 1.25 miles long.

The surface is covered with volcanic rock. Only a few bits of blue ice can be seen. In fact, Schilling thinks nearly a third of the glacier is made of rock.

"It's pretty exciting," Sherrod said.

Poison gas occasionally drifts from the lava dome. The interior of the glacier is full of caves. Last year, a group of expert cave mappers got permission to explore them.

They went in through a funnel-shaped mouth they called the Godzilla Hole, said Jared Smith. He is the lead guide for the Mount St. Helens Institute.

"It's probably 80 or 90 feet straight down," Smith said. Inside, they found a steamy wonderland of ice and tunnels.

"It's just totally beautiful."
