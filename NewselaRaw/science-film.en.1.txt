When Tom Cruise starred as a hotshot Navy flyboy in the 1986 hit, "Top Gun," what seemed like an entire nation got up to follow him. Military recruitment booths popped up in movie theaters. Recruiters were eager to attract young Americans who'd just seen Cruise's character, Maverick, tell his female instructor Charlie about the inverted dive he'd done at four Gs against a MiG-28.

## Hollywood-Military Partnership

To say "Top Gun" was a blessing for recruitment would be an understatement. That year, the Navy signed up 16,000 more people than it did the entire year before, according to Richard Parker, a writer for Proceedings, the U.S. Naval Institute's monthly magazine. Other estimates suggest that among naval aviators alone, there was a 500 percent increase in registrations.

"Top Gun" didn't just leave a lasting impression on thousands of would-be sailors and airmen; for Hollywood, the swashbuckling film marked an important moment for military-entertainment collaboration. The military and Hollywood have worked together since at least the 1920s, but the release of "Top Gun" led the mutually beneficial relationship to new heights.

## Now It's NASA's Turn

Now the film industry is rediscovering another supporter of the arts — one whose mission is less about fighting for country than it is about fighting for knowledge. Enter NASA, whose fictional adventures in outer space are the subject of Ridley Scott's gripping new survival drama, "The Martian."

Raking in more than $100 million its opening weekend around the world, the film starring Matt Damon as an astronaut stranded on the Red Planet taps into a deepening public interest for all things space-related. Part of this has to do with some of the exciting things happening in private spaceflight. But when it comes to studying the stars, NASA is still tops. It knows this. And it is using every tool in its media arsenal to take advantage of its time in the spotlight.

With "The Martian," NASA has the same opportunity defense officials had in the 1980s. Only now it has additional social-media superpowers including Twitter and Facebook. NASA is highlighting everything from the real-world technologies depicted in "The Martian" to explaining the science behind Martian dust storms to calling on young women to take after the fictional Ares III mission commander, Melissa Lewis. It hopes to turn moviegoers into the nation's next generation of scientists, technologists and the other tough-as-nails eggheads celebrated in the film.

Prior to the movie's release, NASA even made a major announcement about the discovery of liquid water on Mars. Some believed the news was simply too conveniently timed to be a coincidence.

## "The Martian" Is Friendly

Never mind that "The Martian" begins with what is essentially a colossal embarrassment for NASA: events cause Ares III crew member Mark Watney to be left for dead on Mars. Watney's struggle to survive and NASA's feverish attempts to rescue him turn what would otherwise be an agency disgrace into a massive success for science and humanity.

The story of "The Martian," adapted from the novel by Andy Weir, is unquestionably friendly to NASA. Even if it were not, a NASA spokesperson told the Guardian newsaper, the agency does not make a habit of altering scripts.

That's a break from the long and controversial history of what some critics have called the military-entertainment complex. This close association between the armed forces and Hollywood more or less made the Defense Department a gatekeeper for action movies. After "Top Gun," the newspaper columnist David Sirota explains, the Pentagon shrewdly began using its cooperation to its advantage against filmmakers. If your script did not portray the troops favorably, you could forget about getting access to the ships, tanks and bases that served as your props and sets.

## Rockets With No Political Baggage

"The result is an entertainment culture rigged to produce relatively few antiwar movies and dozens of blockbusters that glorify the military," Sirota wrote.

The tension in that relationship grew increasingly evident over the last decade. Americans — faced with the painful costs of two unpopular U.S.-led conflicts — struggled to understand the gap between war as it often appeared in theaters, and what was happening in actual theaters of war.

NASA's involvement in Hollywood carries little of this political baggage. It primarily consults on scientific accuracy. Its primary mission is education. And, notably, it does not have any military hardware to dangle in front of filmmakers. Indeed, what "The Martian" has to say about international politics might baffle military types: A key plot point involves an unlikely but inspiring bit of international cooperation with a U.S. "frenemy."

## Helping Make "The Martian"

In producing "The Martian," filmmakers were treated to a behind-the-scenes tour of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. They got interviews with real NASA scientists and astronauts who answered hundreds of questions about the way ion engines and artificial gravity really work. Against the backdrop of the military-entertainment complex, all this makes the prospect of a deeper relationship between NASA and the film industry seem relatively non-threatening.

The agency isn't a stranger to the film industry, of course: It has played a part in such movies as "Armageddon," "Men In Black III" and the Transformers series. But none of those films did much to inspire young people to go into science, technology, math or engineering. Tech experts say the so-called STEM fields must be cultivated if the United States expects to remain a global leader.

"The Martian" is different. For the first time since "Apollo 13," moviegoers are getting to see a scientific government agency as a leading character — a hero, even. It lays the groundwork for a science-entertainment complex at a scale we've never seen. Three decades after Cruise's Maverick buzzed the tower against orders, NASA is finally catching up to the Pentagon.
