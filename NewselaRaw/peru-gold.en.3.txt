WASHINGTON — The head of a Texas art museum is retiring from his job, but before he goes, he wants one last chance to dazzle the public. It looks like he struck gold.

Richard Huff has run the Irving Arts Center for 20 years. He will step down in August. His final exhibit will be "Peruvian Gold." It will display 100 historical items from the South American country of Peru. The items include masks and headdresses used for ceremonies, pottery and jewelry. Most important of all is "El Tocado," which means "the headdress" in Spanish. The large ceremonial headdress is about 1,000 years old and made of gold.

The headdress "is one of the great treasures of Peru," said Kathryn Keane of National Geographic, the group that organized the exhibit.

National Geographic has a long history with Peru. The group organizes and pays for research around the world.

## Stories Behind The Art

In Peru, the group has paid for more than 180 archaeological digs. On the digs, scientists search for historical items that have been buried underground for hundreds of years. National Geographic also tries to tell the stories behind the objects.

"Archaeology is the key which gives us the understanding of all these objects," said National Geographic archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert.

The Irving Arts Center hopes to explain these objects to a new generation. More than 8,000 middle school and high school students are signed up to view the exhibit for free.

In 1911, explorer Hiram Bingham III discovered Machu Picchu, an ancient Incan city high in the Andes mountains of Peru. National Geographic was there to witness his discovery.

## Gold Was Central

Machu Picchu is a highlight of the Inca Empire, which ruled Peru from the 1200s to the late 1500s. When most people think of Peru, they think of the Incas. Still, there were other important cultures that existed as well.

"Peruvian Gold" highlights a culture that came before the Incas — the Sican culture.The Sicans lived on Peru's northern coast from 750 to 1375.

Gold was central to the Sicans. Visitors to the exhibit can "walk into the pages of National Geographic" and experience Sican culture for themselves.

## Hispanic Fine Art

Huff chose the gold exhibit because he wants people to learn about Hispanic fine art. People may think Hispanic art is just about crafts and handiwork. Most don't know that there's a tradition of fine art that's equal to European art, he said.

Irving has about 230,000 people. More than 40 percent of the people there are Latinos who have Hispanic roots. Huff wanted to bring the community something that would be meaningful to them.

"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity," he said, "and I just couldn't pass it up."

Before coming to Texas, "Peruvian Gold" spent five months at the National Geographic Museum in Washington, where it was highly popular.

"It was a blockbuster for sure," said Kathryn Keane of National Geographic.
