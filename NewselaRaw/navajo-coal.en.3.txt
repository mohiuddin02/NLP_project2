FRUITLAND, N.M. â€” Cynthia Dixon lives on the Navajo Reservation in New Mexico. From her bedroom window, she can see black smoke from a coal mine. Down the road, a giant power plant spews yellow smoke into the sky.

Many days, she finds black dust coating the inside of her trailer home. Farmers say fruit and vegetables are drying up because of the bad air from the mine and the power plant. Fewer eagles and jack rabbits live here now.

In the last two years, Dixon suspects the air has killed 38 of her 56 sheep, but it's not just her animals who are suffering. Old people often find it hard to breathe, she says.

## Worried About The Smokestacks

Four Corners is one of the oldest coal-burning power plants in the United States. It is owned by Arizona Public Service, the state's biggest electric company and operated on land rented from the Navajo. Near Four Corners is another coal plant called San Juan Generating Station.

Together, Four Corners and San Juan are the country's two largest power plant emitters of a gas called nitrogen oxide. A large amount of nitrogen oxide in the air can affect breathing, according to a government study.

The power plants rumble around the clock to light homes in cities far away.

Nobody knows whether the power plants are making people sick. But some Navajos blame Four Corners for the fact that many people here suffer from asthma and other illnesses.

## Coal Helps Pay The Bills

Tribal activists want Navajo money spent on power from wind and the sun, not coal-burning plants. But Navajo leaders insist the tribe needs Four Corners because money from the plant helps the tribe pay its bills.

In the last few years, Four Corners has improved its air quality. In 2010, the government ordered a cleanup. This year, Arizona Public Service closed three of the plant's five smoke stacks. It is updating the remaining two. Officials say this will cut the amount of nitrogen oxide that is released by one third.

But activists, who are pushing for change, want more. They say there has never been a study that directly examines the health effects of the gas Four Corners emits.

Tribal leaders often ask people to call tribal offices if they have concerns about air quality. Windy days are the worst.

Dixon, age 59, wants to leave. "But where can I go?" she asks.

## It's Hard To Breathe

Tribal member Sarah White is 65 years old and has asthma. She is convinced that pollution from the plant is ruining her health: "I can just imagine what I'm breathing in."

White said the reservation was once known for its star-filled night skies. Now, she says it is known for air pollution.

This year, the government released a report saying improvements were being made at Four Corners. The report estimated that the chance of getting cancer near the plant is one in a million.

Navajo leaders insist the plant and coal mine are important. They provide 800 jobs in an area where often only half the people can find work, the leaders say.

Stephen Etsitty is a Navajo leader. He said he understands people's concerns. "I tell people their issues are real," he said. He said Four Corners affects the community's health, but there are other concerns too.

Such as plant salaries of more than $55,000 a year. On the reservation, that is a good salary. "That's tough to give up," Etsitty says.
