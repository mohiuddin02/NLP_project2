KHOGNOO KHAN, Mongolia — Altai Davaa and her brother, Tsagaana, live deep in a desolate, rocky canyon, about 10 miles from the nearest paved road and even farther from any power line. They sleep in a traditional Mongolian yurt, cook over a wood-fire stove, burn animal dung for fuel and use an outhouse. Every morning, she milks her cows.

When the sun begins to set, however, Tsagaana plugs in his solar satellite dish and TV, and starts channel surfing. He gets more than 60 stations, offering everything from "Breaking Bad" to Hollywood blockbusters.

"But mostly, I like Mongolian programs," he says. "They're easier to understand."

On that front, he is hardly starved for choice. Despite having just 3 million inhabitants scattered over an expanse about four times the size of California, Mongolia has 138 homegrown television stations — 80 percent of them founded in the last 10 years.

They air everything from wrestling tournaments to news and political talk shows, real estate showcases, home-shopping programs, the Miss World Mongolia pageant and even the Mongolian Academy Awards.

"It's just crazy," says Bayarmagnai Puntsag, co-founder of Mongolia's National Press Club.

## Rising Through The Ranks

Mongolia was once a communist country with tight government controls over its media, but in 1990 the country became a democracy. Since then it has become a lively outpost of media choice sandwiched between autocratic Russia and China, where authorities keep a tight rein on the press. In addition to its wide range of television stations, Mongolia also has 111 newspapers, 90 magazines and 72 radio stations. The country's smorgasbord of options is stunning given that 25 years ago, viewers could see only the government-run Mongolian National Broadcaster and a Russian station.

Over the past several years Mongolia has shot up the World Press Freedom Index. Compiled by the group Reporters Without Borders, the index considers both the level of media independence and the number of available media choices. Mongolia has risen from being Number 100 on the list in 2012, to being Number 54 this year, putting it just five spots behind the United States.

However, that impressive ranking masks deep problems, particularly in television, the most influential medium. At the root of those problems is the fact that many of the stations are bankrolled and controlled by politicians and business people, who use them primarily to promote their interests and to attack their rivals.

## "Lots Of Problems Hiding"

The large number of channels and the small population mean there is hardly enough advertising money to go around. Because most stations are not bringing in much money, many cannot afford to pay for their programming. For years many stations have pirated content from Hollywood and elsewhere, quickly dubbing the hottest films and TV shows into Mongolian and sending them out in prime time.

In addition, journalists' training is poor, pay is low, and bribery is widespread. Many stations accept payments to broadcast stories, or take protection money to keep critical reports off-air.

"If you look at our laws, and our number of outlets, you'd think, oh, we have great media freedom," says Naranjargal Khaskhuu, a former journalist and head of Globe International, a democracy watchdog group in Mongolia. "But if you look into it, we have lots of problems hiding."

## TV Stations As Political Status Symbol

After decades of strict limits on expression, Bayarmagnai says, the widespread urge to begin publishing and broadcasting was only natural. "Suddenly, we had freedom of speech. That's very appealing to Mongolians — we like to express our thoughts and opinions."

However, politicians quickly became involved in the press, and vice versa. Mongolia's current president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, was founder of the country's first independent newspaper, Democracy, and was its first editor in chief. He also was involved in establishing Eagle TV, the first private TV station, in 1994. Prime Minister Chimed Saikhanbileg, meanwhile, is a former television host whose catchphrase, "Don't change the channel!" still rings in the ears of many Mongolians.

Oyundari Tsagaan, the general director of Mongolian National Public Radio and TV, says politicians want direct megaphones to reach the masses. They are reluctant to give up their stations even if they do not know how to make them professional or profitable.

"I know one of my political friends who owns a TV station … He said, 'I don't know how many people watch my TV — I have no idea. But all of my PR advisers told me I have to have some media network, that's why I'm having these stations.'"

Oyundari is no outsider to politics herself, though she insists the media is her primary interest. She began her career as a reporter for the Mongolian National Broadcaster, but in recent years she has served as secretary-general of the Democratic Party. "It's difficult for professionals to go up in the field without getting involved in politics," she said.

## Bribery, Piracy And More

The public, government-supported broadcasting network is headquartered in Ulan Bator, the capital.

Since becoming its director, Oyundari says, she has put her foot down on airing pirated programs and has tried to get journalists to stop accepting payoffs. Change is hard, however, particularly when money is tighter than it once was. Mongolia's economy has slowed in recent years, and as a result the government has cut funding for public broadcasting.

Bribery is "a habit for some people," Oyundari says. "We can't really control everybody."

Unless the number of stations shrinks, bribery, piracy and other problems are likely to persist, experts say.

"I think the government is content to keep the number of outlets high," says Ben Moyle, the former director of Mongolia's Channel One. "Politicians are the winners when journalism is poor."
