WASHINGTON, D.C. — A few more eggs a week may not be so bad for you, but watch out for that sugary drink.

The U.S. government has released new dietary guidelines. They give suggestions on what Americans should eat. The government comes out with new guidelines every five years.

Some guidelines have changed. Experts used to think dietary cholesterol was unhealthy. It is found in food like eggs. Now research is not so certain that cholesterol is related to heart disease. The science is more complicated than what researchers thought before.

## New Advice: Added Sugars Are Bad For You

There is also new advice about sugar. Experts say that sugar added to food is not good for you. This is different from the sugar that occurs naturally in foods like fruit and milk. The guidelines say added sugar should be about one-tenth of your daily calories. That fraction is about 200 calories a day, or the amount in one large sugary drink. Added sugars are considered to be empty calories, which have no nutritional value.  

A group of doctors and nutrition experts came up with advice about what the guidelines should say. They urged people to eat food that is good for the environment. They said Americans should eat less red meat. Some research studies have found that raising cows for red meat leads to environmental problems because the cows give off methane gas, which contributes to air problems.

Some people were not happy with this advice. People in the meat business and some lawmakers fought against it. The advice was dropped. It was not included in the guidelines. The government still says red meats are part of a healthy eating pattern. 

## Main Message Hasn't Changed Much

The guidelines are intended to prevent Americans from being overweight and getting disease. The guidelines influence many other things, such as the way food is described on packages to school lunches to the doctor's advice.

The main message of the guidelines has not changed much over the years. Eat your fruits and vegetables. Eat whole grains and seafood, too. Do not eat too much sugar, fat or salt.

This year, the government has a new message. It wants people to figure out what type of healthy eating style works for them because every person is different. The government still wants people to follow its main suggestions, but it also encourages small changes. 

"Small changes can add up to big differences," said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. He runs the Agriculture Department, the government agency responsible for food guidelines. The Department came up with the guidelines along with the Department of Health and Human Services, the government agency responsible for protecting the health of Americans. 

## Time To Cut Back On Salt

Americans also need to eat less salt. The Centers for Disease for Disease Control and Prevention is a government agency that monitors the nation's health. It found that 90 percent of people eat too much salt. The average person eats 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day, and the government guidelines say everyone should lower that amount to 2,300, or about a teaspoon.

In the old 2010 government guideline, it recommended that people with heart problems should take in 1,500 milligrams. This year's guidelines does not include that number though. Still, they say that those with heart problems could benefit with a salt reduction.

## Guidelines Based On Science

The writing of this year's guidelines led to some disagreements in government. Some Republicans thought President Barack Obama had gone too far in telling people what to eat. Republicans often disagree with Obama, who is a Democrat.

In the end, the two sides agreed that the guidelines would be based on science. They also agreed that the guidelines would only discuss nutritional and dietary information, not the environment.
