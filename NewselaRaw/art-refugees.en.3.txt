DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Inside the gallery, artworks by Syrian artists were drawing auction bids from collectors. Outside on the street, the artists traded the latest gossip from Syria. Periodically, they checked their smartphones for news from the civil war in that country.

Such is the divided life of these Syrian artists, who are now based here in Dubai. Brought to the Gulf state by their gallery, they are able to continue their work in safety. At the same time, they remain deeply connected to Syria. They are all influenced by the bloodshed they left behind.

There are now more than 2 million Syrian refugees. And their number is growing. During the past two years, they have fanned out across the region. Some live in tent camps in Jordan. Others are trying to build new lives in cities such as Beirut and Istanbul.

The auction in Dubai's art district this past Monday is part of a small but forward-looking effort. Syria's civil war has already claimed more than 100,000 lives. With no end in sight, the goal is to save part of the country's artistic community.

## Drawing Attention To War's Horrors

"It's a tragedy what is happening there now. But it would be an even bigger tragedy if all this art and culture that Syria has so much of would be lost," said gallery owner Hisham Samawi. His Ayyam Gallery moved from Syria to Dubai in late 2011.

"For us,'" he added, "the artists are part of our family. We had to do it. It was for us and for them."

Step by step over nearly two years, the gallery moved 15 artists and their families to Dubai.

Tammam Azzam is one of those artists. Azzam is one of the rising stars in Syria's revolution-inspired art world. Originally a painter, he has shifted to prints and multimedia work. His goal is to draw attention to the horrors of the conflict.

One piece, "Freedom Graffiti," places Gustav Klimt's beautiful painting "The Kiss" over a shattered and bullet-scarred apartment wall. The image quickly became an Internet sensation. It established the 33-year-old Azzam as one of the artistic voices of the civil war.

Another piece done since his arrival in Dubai is "Syrian Olympics." This digital print features stick-figure stencils in the shape of Olympic event logos. Shooters aim like snipers at the runners.

A signed copy sold for $12,000 at the auction, which more than 300 people attended. A copy of "Freedom Graffiti" brought in $6,000.

## Protest Art Movement Of Middle East

"I have to do something for the people there," said Azzam, who added that he wanted to tell people around the world what is happening in his country. "People dying every day, every minute, and nobody can stop that."

Azzam struggles with the frustrating feeling that "art doesn't make sense" in the middle of a war.

But conflict has always given birth to creativity. Consider, for example, 18th-century political cartoons commenting on the American and French revolutions. Or works inspired by the 1930s Spanish Civil War, such as Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso)'s powerful painting "Guernica." And now there is the Web-driven protest art of Middle East uprisings.

Artwork hit the Internet following the disputed 2009 re-election in Iran of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. During the latest election this June, Iran's art community rallied around the imaginary candidacy of comic book heroine "Zahra."

Since 2011, dozens of high-profile exhibitions have showcased the work of Arab Spring artists. Among those featured was Egyptian Ahmed Basiony. He was killed during anti-government protests in the final days of Hosni Mubarak's rule.

In Turkey this summer, anti-government protesters imitated Erdem Gunduz's "Standing Man." As fighting raged around Istanbul's Taksim Square, they stood motionless.

## Hoping To Get Other Artists Out

"The artists are paramount, so we had to get them out," said gallery owner Samawi. "There was no question about it. It wasn't like: We'll go find other artists. These are our artists. We believe in them and believe they have a voice."

According to Samawi, there are plans to try to bring other Syrian artists out of the country. But the efforts have become more complicated. Fighting has gotten worse and the threat of U.S.–led military action has led to an increasing lockdown in Damascus.

"It's a good thing we started when we did," said Samawi. "It becomes more and more difficult as every month passes."

The artist Azzam said friends are watching his abandoned studio in Damascus.

"But who knows if it will be there when I return," he said. "And who knows when I can return."
