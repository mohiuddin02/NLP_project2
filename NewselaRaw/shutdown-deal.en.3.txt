WASHINGTON â€” Congress voted o Wednesday to end a 16-day partial government shutdown and increase the amount of money the Treasury can borrow.

The agreement came one day before the United States was expected to reach the current $16.7 trillion debt limit. After that, the Treasury could no longer borrow money to pay the country's bills.

The Senate approved the legislation in a bipartisan 81-18 vote. The House also approved it and it was sent for President Barack Obama's signature.

"We fought the good fight. We just didn't win," said House Speaker John Boehner. The legislation includes nothing for Republicans who wanted to get rid of or shrink the health care law known as Obamacare.

## "Cloud Of Uncertainty" Lifted

The Treasury will be able borrow normally through Feb. 7 or perhaps a month longer. It would also pay for the government through Jan. 15. More than 2 million federal workers will be paid under the agreement.

The nation "came to the brink of disaster" before the agreement was reached, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said.

The measure had support from the White House and most if not all Democrats in Congress. Some Republicans, fearful of how a default would hurt the country's business, also supported the bill.

"We'll begin reopening our government immediately," Obama said after the Senate vote. "We can begin to lift this cloud of uncertainty from our businesses and the American people."

Lawmakers who sided with the tea party triggered the shutdown that began on Oct. 1. They opposed Wednesday's deal.

Sen. Ted Cruz said the measure was "a terrible deal." He criticized fellow Republicans for lining up behind it.

## Republican Party Split

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell negotiated the deal with Reid. He emphasized that it preserved a round of spending cuts negotiated two years ago with Obama and Democrats.

The shutdown and brush with default have sent Republicans' public approval plummeting, polls showed. The party has been badly split nationally. The split exists in McConnell's home state of Kentucky, too.

"When the stakes are highest Mitch McConnell can always be counted on to sell out conservatives," said Matt Bevin. He is challenging McConnell in a 2014 election primary.

The Club for Growth favors limited government. It urged lawmakers to vote against the congressional measure.

The bill does not significantly change Obamacare or other government programs that cost "trillions," the group said. "If this bill passes, Congress will kick the can down the road, yet again," the group added.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out in favor of the bill. The Chamber represents business interests and usually supports Republicans.

The bill will let the Treasury borrow again. It also had funding for the government to reopen. That was about it.

House and Senate negotiators will meet this fall. They will see if progress is possible on a deal to reduce the amount the government owes.

Other issues fell away in a final deal.

The struggle has occupied essentially all of Congress' time for the past three weeks.

## Tea Party Allies Come Up Empty

The shutdown began on Oct. 1. It came after Cruz and his tea party allies in the House demanded money  be pulled from the health care law. That was their condition for providing essential government money.

Obama and Reid refused. Then they refused again and again as Boehner gradually scaled back Republican demands.

Initially, about 800,000 government workers were sent home. That soon fell to about 350,000 after Congress agreed to let Pentagon employees return to work. There were many hassles. But the mail was delivered. Medicare continued to pay doctors who treated seniors and there was no interruption in Social Security benefits.

Still, national parks were closed. Also, government research scientists were sent home and Food and Drug Administration inspectors only worked occassionally.

Republican polls sank. Still, Boehner refused to let the House vote on legislation to reopen the entire government. He insisted on reopening only parts. The White House and Reid rejected that approach.

European officials, Cabinet members and bankers in this country warned that failure to raise the debt limit invited an economic disaster. It would be far worse than the near-meltdown of 2008, they said.
