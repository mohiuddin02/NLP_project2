When a young person gets hit on the head and suffers a concussion, some doctors recommend a "cocoon" for the child — being holed up in a dark room for days.

That could mean five days in a dark, quiet room with no superhero movies, loud music, bright lights or smartphones.

A new study, however, has found that this strict treatment is not necessary. Researchers at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee performed a randomized controlled trial — they compared the results of treating injured teens in two different ways.

They found that the most effective treatment is allowing the injured teen just one to two days of quiet time until his or her symptoms are gone. Then, the teen can slowly start returning to normal levels of activity, little by little.

"Recommending strict rest for adolescents immediately after concussion offered no added benefit," said the study, published in the journal Pediatrics. "We also found that adolescents' symptom reporting may be influenced by restricting activity." The doctors think that worries over missing schoolwork and being kept away from friends led to those kids reporting more symptoms.

## Strict Rest May Not Be Best

The Children's Hospital of Wisconsin researchers studied 88 adolescents — ages 11 to 22  — who had suffered mild trauma to the head. Forty-five of the teens were told to rest for 24 to 48 hours and then slowly return to their normal routine. Forty-three teens were more restricted: for five days they were not allowed to do much of anything or go to school.

Common sense might tell you that five days in a quiet room would be good treatment for these injured adolescents, but that is not what the study found.

"We were startled at the half-way point of the study that (the strict rest) was not making a difference," said Dr. Danny G. Thomas of the Children's Hospital.

"(We were) more startled when kids who were resting longer began complaining of more symptoms," Thomas said.

## Symptoms Take Time To Fade

Getting rest is helpful after a concussion, but there has been little research on just how much rest is ideal. Experts do know that too much physical or mental activity too soon after a concussion can slow recovery. The symptoms of a concussion fade slowly — more like a light dimming than a light being switched off, Thomas said.

Concussions result from brain trauma — often a hard blow to the head during sports or other activities. A concussion causes certain chemicals to enter and leave the neurons in the brain. This drains the neurons of energy, leaving them depleted. The neurons cannot function normally until their energy levels are restored.

The symptoms of a concussion can include problems with balance, mood, anxiety, and cognition — learning and understanding. Other symptoms of concussions are vision problems, migraine headaches, nausea and neck problems. Different types of concussions have different effects, and different people will have different symptoms.

"I thought the study was well done and methodologically sound," said Dr. Micky Collins, director of the Sports Medicine Concussion Program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). "More research like this is needed."

Collins said research at the UPMC has identified six types of concussions, each requiring a unique treatment plan customized for the patient by a concussion specialist.

One thing is clear from the study and UPMC research: "Never restrict the adolescent to a dark room," Dr. Collins said. "You'll never hear us say, 'Sit in a dark room and get better.'"

## Treatment Is Individual

Kevin M. Kelly, a neurologist and director of concussion services at Allegheny General Hospital, said the study was a good one. The researchers collected so much data, that it was almost "heroic," he said.

The lesson to be learned from the study is that it is not correct to think that one treatment can fit all patients, Kelly said. He also recommended "individualized treatment and relative brain rest" for most children.

Kelly said that a bigger study is necessary — perhaps one organized by the National Institutes of Health that could see many different institutions working together to develop specific guidelines to determine the best treatments for different types of concussions.
