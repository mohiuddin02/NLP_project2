WASHINGTON â€” There is a battle flag on government property in South Carolina. It is a Confederate flag.

Last week, nine African-Americans were killed by a gunman at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. The gunman supported the Confederate flag.

Lawmakers are now asking questions about what should be done with the flag. It has a lot of history behind it.

The Confederates fought the Union during the Civil War to keep African-Americans as slaves. That side lost the war in 1865.

James Clyburn is an African-American lawmaker in the national government. He is from South Carolina and says the flag needs to be removed. The flag is part of the history of racism in America, he said. Flying the flag will make racism continue, he thinks.

## Flag Can Bring Painful Memories

Tim Scott is also an African-American lawmaker from South Carolina. He said the flag is part of the history of the state. Still, he said it also is a reminder of the pain African-Americans have experienced.

In 2000, the flag was taken off the top of the main government building. It is still on government land near there.

People who are running for president disagree on what to do.

Mitt Romney ran for president in 2012. He wrote online that the flag should be taken down. He said the flag stands for hate. It should be removed to honor the men and women who were killed, he said.

Some say South Carolina needs to decide as a state.

Rick Santorum is running for president in 2016. He doesn't think that the national government or people running for president should be able to decide what happens. South Carolina needs to decide for itself, he said.

The governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, says that the time is not right to decide what to do with the flag. Out of respect, he said, "we should allow the families of the loved ones to bury their dead" first.

Others said the flag should come down.

John Kasich is the governor of Ohio and is also planning to run for president. He said it is up to the people of South Carolina to decide. If he were a citizen of South Carolina, he said he would support taking it down.

## Some States Already Took Down That Flag

Other states have already taken down Confederate flags.

In 2001, Confederate flags were removed from the Florida state government building. The governor at the time, Jeb Bush, is now running for president. He said it was the right thing to do. The flags are now in a museum. Bush said people can still learn about the flag's history in the museum. It would not be right to fly the flag as a symbol of the state today, Bush said.

Carly Fiorina is running for president. She said the Confederate flag is a symbol that makes many people upset. Still, she does not think that her own opinion is important.

She said the important thing is what the people of South Carolina choose to do next.
