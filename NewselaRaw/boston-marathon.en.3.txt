BOSTON — Nearly 36,000 runners hit the streets on Monday under heavy police protection. For many, the city's first marathon since last year's deadly bombing sent a powerful message: Boston bounces back.

An American won the men's race for the first time since 1983, adding more cheer to the day.

The 2014 marathon allowed runners who were unable to finish last year's race a chance to get to the finish line.

"I showed up, I'm back, and I am going to finish what I didn't finish last year," said Mary Cunningham, 50. Cunningham had been stopped a mile short of the finish line by the explosions on April 15, 2013.

The two homemade bombs that went off near the end of the 26.2-mile course killed three people and wounded more than 260. They turned the Boston marathon from a joyous athletic event into a nightmare of bloodied victims, smoke and broken glass.

## Staying "Boston Strong"

This year, police were spread out in large numbers along the route. Helicopters circled above and bomb-sniffing dogs checked trash cans.

A total of 35,755 athletes were registered to run the marathon, the second-largest number in its history. Many of those runners came to show support for the city and its most famous sporting event. "Boston Strong" — the unofficial rallying phrase adopted after the terrorist attack — was everywhere.

"I think I'm going to start crying at the starting line," said Katie O'Donnell, a doctor at Children's Hospital. O'Donnell was stopped less than a mile from the end last year. "I'm not sure I'll stop until I cross the finish line."

There was a moment of silence at the finish line at 2:49 p.m., the time the bombs went off. It was followed by some of the loudest cheers of the day.

Joe Ebert was cheering on his son-in-law near the spot in downtown Boston where the bombs went off. He was there last year, too.

"Just wanted to let them know that they can't beat us down. I think it makes us all stronger when something like that happens," he said.

Jeff Bauman was one of the onlookers at the finish line. Bauman lost his legs in the bombing. It was the first time he had returned to the area since the attack.

## Memories Of Last Year

"It feels great" to be back, he said. "I feel very safe."

Sabrina Dello Russo, 38, was running her first marathon for a good friend. That friend, Roseann Sdoia, lost her right leg in the bombing.

"Every run I do, she is in the back of my head, and she will be keeping me going today," Dello Russo said.

According to Gov. Deval Patrick, no threats had been made against the race or the city. Still, onlookers at the 118th running of the world's oldest annual marathon had to go through tight checkpoints before being allowed near the starting and finish lines.

Police along the route examined backpacks, particularly outside subway station exits. And more than 100 cameras were installed along the course.

Runner Scott Weisberg, 44, said he had trouble sleeping the night before.

"I can't stop worrying about it happening again. I know the chances are slim to none, but I can't help having a nervous pit in my stomach," Weisberg said.

In the end, the marathon went off without a hitch.

## Winning Racers

Kenya's Rita Jeptoo won the women's race. She ran a course-record 2 hours, 18 minutes, 57 seconds. Jeptoo won last year as well, but was unable to enjoy her victory.

"It was very difficult to be happy. People were injured and children died," she had said of last year's marathon. "If I'm going to win again, I hope I can be happier and to show people, like I was supposed to last year."

American Meb Keflizighi won the men's title in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 37 seconds.

Keflizighi had the names of last year's victims written in black marker on the corners of his race bib.

On Twitter, President Barack Obama praised Keflizighi and Shalane Flanagan, the top American finisher among the women. He congratulated the two "for making America proud!"

"All of today's runners showed the world the meaning of #BostonStrong," Obama wrote.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, is awaiting trial in the attack. He and his older brother are accused of the bombing. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died in a shootout with police days after the bombings.
