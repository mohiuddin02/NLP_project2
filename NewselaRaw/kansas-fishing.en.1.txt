CLARK STATE FISHING LAKE, Kan. â€” Driving up the relatively gentle K-94, a road that wanders 150 miles west of Wichita, the only thing you can say is "Oh my gosh!" About 30 miles southwest of Greensburg, the road rises a bit, opening to views of Bluff Creek Valley. Many Kansans call it the prettiest public fishing hole in Kansas.

For hundreds of feet, the prairie falls off at angles so steep that even the area's local mule deer, known for their ability to cross landscapes, would find much of it impossible to reach. The highway uses sharp turns to ease vehicles into a valley studded with tall cottonwoods and feathery willows.

Across the valley stretches 300 acres of crystal clear water. You can see a fishing lure 4 feet below the surface, as well as the fish attached to it.

"These fish are so fat, their mouths always look small," Joey Yeager said as he unhooked a brick of a bass Tuesday afternoon. "I don't think I've ever seen a skinny bass in this lake."

Lowell Aberson, a Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism's fisheries biologist for the lake, said its bass-fishing future may be looking better than it has in decades.

## Lake Has Benefited Many People

The lake was made in the 1930s. The federal Civilian Conservation Corps made it to give jobs to unemployed men during the Great Depression, a period when many people lost jobs and the economy was poor. Often with little more than mules and shovels, they labored at places like Clark County to construct public areas. Pay was barely more than meals and a tent. The men moved the thousands of tons of dirt and rock needed to construct the lake's dam, which is still holding well, 80 years later.

Aberson said the lake was at its lowest during the drought-stricken summer of 2013, a time when all boat ramps were well out of the water and the lake was 7 feet low. That changed one summer night, when more than 7 inches of rain fell.

"There's so much habitat, like flooded little cottonwoods and willows, that will make pretty good nursery structure for young fish," he said. "I expect we're going to continue to have some tremendous year classes coming on. Not only of bass, but also of crappie and bluegill, for the next several coming years."

The lake also has good populations of white bass, walleye and catfish.

## Reeling Them In!

Yeager, a 31-year-old angler, or fisherman, from Cimarron, makes the 90-minute drive mostly for largemouths.

"It's gotten to where I kind of expect to catch a 5-pounder every time I come," he said as he launched his boat, with Aberson along for the ride. The men headed to a cove on the lake's western shoreline.

The first bass of the day, a chunky fish weighing nearly 2 pounds, hit a 3-inch plastic bait. When Yeager and Aberson started flipping plastic lizards and crawdads into flooded vegetation, things began to happen. Yeager soon jerked several bass aboard of about a pound each. Aberson set the hook hard on a fish by an old beaver den and took his time pulling a 3-pound fish into the boat.

"When Clark gets really going good, it seems like that size is about average," Yeager said.

## The Lake Is Welcoming

Yeager did most of his fishing that afternoon amid Clark's many coves and bays. Clark has two boat ramps on both sides of the steep-sided lake. Fishermen like Yeager know they can usually find a spot out of the wind that provides a good location for casting. Aberson said the steep valley, and many coves, well-suits those who cannot handle white caps.

"It sure fishes like a lot more than 300 acres," Yeager said, referring to the many coves where fishermen can find privacy. Tuesday afternoon there were six boats on the lake, though both anglers said there are more boats out on most weekends.

Yeager found plenty of room to cast his fishing line and the 15 to 20 bass he caught were brought aboard. Some of the bass weighed up to 4 pounds. Yeager didn't break the coveted 5-pound mark, or get a strike where he lost a fish of a solid 8 pounds last year.

## "It's Just Good To Be Out Here"

The lake has its rules. Swimming, skiing and pleasure boating are not allowed. Campsites are primitive and you won't find a supply store.

Though the fishing at Clark left him a bit disappointed that day, Clark, itself, never lets him down.

In between casts he stopped to watch a kingfisher fly across the water. He saw an obviously pregnant whitetail doe at the back of a cove. He gazed often at the hills and high bluffs that rise well above the lake. He pointed toward several stems poking through the lake's surface and said by early summer they will be holding platter-sized lily pads, each with a pink blossom.

"They'll be gorgeous. The entire lake is gorgeous," he said. "This is the kind of lake where it's just good to be out here. It's all just good for me when I'm here."
