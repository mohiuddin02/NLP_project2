President Barack Obama would like that amount to be higher. But such a federal minimum-wage increase will not happen anytime soon, many believe.

Instead, people who want to raise the national minimum wage are focusing on proposals at the state level this Election Day. They hope an unlikely group of states vote for an increase on Nov. 4.

The states are Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. They are four solidly "red" states that typically vote Republican. Their voters often oppose the president's plans.

Some supporters hope that winning in four Republican states will change the national debate on the minimum wage.

"It becomes a lot harder for members of Congress who might not support these kinds of things to continually say 'no' when it comes up in Washington," said Josh Levin. He is a vice president at the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. The group leans toward the Democratic side of issues and focuses on state ballot measures.

## One State's "Livable" Wage Is Not Another's

The minimum wage has gained a lot of attention this year.

Earlier this month, fast-food workers across the country skipped work on purpose. They did this to show people they want a $15-per-hour "livable" wage. Such pay would be more than double the current national lowest allowed pay of $7.25. The Seattle City Council passed a $15 hourly rate in June. Some people are pushing for that figure elsewhere in Washington state.

The ballot measures in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota would bring about much smaller increases. But that doesn't bother Steve Copley, chairman of the Give Arkansas a Raise Now coalition.

"Every penny that somebody who is working hard can get helps," Copley said.

People working to get a higher minimum wage must be realistic about what increases they push for at the polls, said Peggy Shorey. She is director of state government relations at the AFL-CIO. The labor group's state organizations support the ballot proposals.

"Arkansas is not the same as Seattle," she said.

The current minimum wage in Arkansas is $6.25 per hour. It is one of three states whose minimum wage is lower than the federal minimum wage. Only Georgia and Wyoming are lower, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

## The Cost Of Living Keeps Going Up

Last year, about 91,000 workers earned the federal minimum wage or less in the four states with November ballot proposals, according to the government. However, thousands more would be affected as the state wage floors rose gradually.

All four state proposals would begin wage increases on Jan. 1. But there are differences in how the states would link the minimum wage to increases in the cost of living. The cost of living is a measure of the expenses for basic necessities like food, clothes and housing.

In Alaska, the minimum wage would be tied to increases in the Anchorage Consumer Price Index. South Dakota would raise the minimum wage based on changes to a national measure of the cost of living called the CPI. The CPI samples the cost of everyday things like haircuts, stamps, pet food, shirts and medicine. It measures them month after month to see how they change over time.

Tying annual increases to CPI changes is something people argue about. Opponents in South Dakota say it is one of their biggest concerns of the ballot proposal there.

Ten states have minimum wages legally tied to CPI, according to the Department of Labor. Others are scheduled to follow in upcoming years.

Copley said such a measure would not have passed in Arkansas.

Instead, the minimum hourly rates would top off at $8.50 per hour in 2017 in Arkansas. It would stop at $9 per hour in 2016 in Nebraska.

## The Wage Battle Will Continue

It might be a tough battle for people who are against raising the minimum wage.

"Our polls would indicate we have a lot of work to do to educate people on some of our concerns," said Michael Held. He works for the South Dakota Farm Bureau, which opposes that state's proposal to increase the minimum wage.

A poll in Arkansas was taken in April. It found that more than three of every four voters surveyed supported their state's ballot proposal to raise pay for low-wage workers.

Jay Barth is a political science professor at Hendrix College who worked on the poll. He had an idea of why the results came out as they did. Arkansas is less conservative than other Southern states, he said.

Five Southern states — South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama — have no state minimum wage at all. They use the federal rate.

Shorey, with the AFL-CIO, said she thought wins in November could help families. If the measures pass, they could also change the national discussion on the minimum- wage debate.

If Republican states pass minimum-wage increases, it shows that the issue does not have to split the two parties, she said.
