Scientists already knew that being obese — which means extremely overweight — poses serious health risks. Now, researchers have identified another problem: being obese makes teens much less likely to finish high school.

A new study from Sweden finds that obese teens are far less likely to graduate from high school than their slimmer peers. The gap in the graduation rate was startling: only 56 percent of the obese students finished all 12 years of schooling. By comparison, 76 percent of their slimmer classmates did.

"The differences are much larger than we predicted," the study authors said.

## Opting Out Of High School

The research team examined people who had been treated for childhood obesity. They selected 1,061 adults who were at least 20 years old, making them old enough to have finished upper secondary school, the Swedish version of high school. People were not included if they had an intellectual disability.

The researchers also chose a group of non-obese people for comparison. They randomly selected 7,780 people who were similar to the obesity patients in terms of age, gender and location. Then, they checked to see how far those in each group had gotten in their schooling.

Almost everyone in both groups finished secondary school, what is junior high in Sweden. However, the two groups then went in different directions quickly.

About 24 percent of the obese teens did not enroll in upper secondary school. These high school years are optional in Sweden, but most teens do attend. Only 12 percent of teens in the non-obese comparison group chose not to enroll in high school.

The drop-out rate was also higher for obese students. Nearly 19 percent of the people in this group started high school but did not finish, compared with 12 percent of those in the comparison group.

## Now We Know, So Let's Help

The end result was that just 56 percent of the obese group graduated from upper secondary school. By comparison, the non-obese group had a 76 percent graduation rate.

The differences between the groups did not seem to depend on factors such as ethnicity, where they lived or how much money their family made.

The researchers looked for other factors that might explain the lower graduation rate among obese teens. They found that in both groups, women were more likely than men to finish high school.

The study's authors said they hoped their findings would lead to "an action plan." Something must be done to help obese teens at risk of dropping out, they said.
