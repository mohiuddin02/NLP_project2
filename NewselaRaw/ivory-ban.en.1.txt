WASHINGTON — The United States is cracking down on the sale and purchase of ivory in hopes of curbing a surge in illegal poaching. The growth of such hunting is threatening to wipe out elephants and other species in Africa.

The ivory ban is a key part of a new, national strategy for combating wildlife trafficking, unveiled on Tuesday by the White House. It comes seven months after President Barack Obama issued a call to action during a visit to Tanzania. The U.S. will also seek to strengthen global enforcement and international cooperation to fight the trade.

Wildlife trafficking, which involves the illegal transfer of animals and animal parts, is estimated to make about $10 billion per year.

"We're seeing record-high demand for wildlife products," said Grant Harris, who works for the White House's National Security Council. Harris said this is because of a recent explosion in the ivory trade and wildlife trafficking.

## African Animals In Grave Danger

Wildlife advocates are worried that without forceful global action, elephants and rhinos face [extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). Once numbering in the millions, Africa's elephant population has dwindled to 500,000 or less, said Dan Ashe, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. About 35,000 — or nearly 10 percent of the remaining population — are being slaughtered each year.

The illegal industry doesn't just pose a risk to endangered animals. Because wildlife trafficking is often carried out by well-armed groups in regions with weak laws and borders, U.S. officials say it poses a global security threat. The U.S. is seeking to combat growing extremism and violence in parts of Africa.

The crackdown uses laws on conservation and endangered species that have been around for years. There has been a ban on importing ivory for several decades. But these laws have not been strictly enforced, meaning that once the ivory is in the U.S., domestic sales are not really controlled.

That means someone who placed an ivory chess set for sale on eBay, for example, faced little risk of being investigated by law enforcement. This is even if they lacked proof that the item was legal. Some ivory items are allowed by law, such as if they are antiques — items more than 100 years old.

Ashe said that the legal trade provides a "smoke screen" for the illegal ivory sales. He said it also makes it more difficult for police to find the banned goods, as well as catch and prosecute the criminals.

## Cutting Down Demand

Under the new rules, if someone is caught trying to sell ivory items, the government will seize them unless sellers can provide proof that they are legal. Sales across state lines will be banned except for antiques. Sales within states will also be stopped unless sellers can show they were brought into the U.S. before the ban.

The export of ivory out of the U.S. will also be banned, with very few exceptions. "For consumers, the general message going forward is buyer beware," Ashe said.

Officials are confident that the crackdown will mean almost a complete ban on ivory sales. The U.S. wants to set a strict example and spur other countries to take similar steps. They hope this will drive down global demand for wildlife products and put traffickers out of business.

Late last year, U.S. officials destroyed more than six tons of seized ivory tusks, carvings and jewelry. Last week, France followed suit by crushing more than three tons of illegal ivory. Other nations including Gabon and China have also taken similar steps.

U.S. demand for wildlife products is surpassed only by China. There the market price for ivory is more than $1,000 a pound and has increased significantly, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

## Targeting Trafficking Rings

Carter Roberts, the group's president, said that Obama and Congress have sent a very strong message to the rest of the world. This is that the U.S. will no longer allow the "massive and senseless slaughter of wildlife or the colossal criminal profits that it generates."

Still, the government won't seek to prosecute individuals, such as those who try to sell ivory they inherited from their parents. Instead, it will target organized trafficking rings that profit from the illegal trade.

Last year, the government launched a sting dubbed "Operation Crash." This went after an international smuggling ring trafficking in endangered black rhino horns. Fourteen people have been arrested during this nationwide investigation so far and seven have been convicted.

While unveiling the plans, the Obama administration called on Congress to pass more laws to crack down on the trafficking. Congressman Ed Royce said he would review Obama's plan to ensure it is "robust, aggressive and effective." And Senator Dianne Feinstein wants to be able to use laws used in drug cases in wildlife trafficking.

The Safari Club International Foundation represents trophy hunters. This group criticized Obama's plans for not looking at the relationships with African nations. Joe Hosmer, the group's president, said government actions can undermine on-the-ground conservation projects, which he argued are already working well.

Hosmer said that the people and the businesses in the African countries are the most important in making sure that wildlife populations are safe.
