On Thursday, two police officers were shot in Ferguson, Missouri. The city has been troubled since the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown last summer.

Brown was killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in August. Angry protesters took to the streets following his death. Protesters said there was no reason to kill Brown, since he was unarmed. They also claimed Wilson targeted Brown just because the 18-year-old was black. Wilson is white.

More demonstrations occurred after it was announced that Wilson would not be charged with murder. Officer Wilson claimed he shot Brown after the young man tried to grab his gun.

Officer Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing, but the Ferguson Police Department was not. The U.S. Justice Department said the Ferguson police have a pattern of unfairly treating blacks.

## Two Officers Hospitalized

On Wednesday, it was announced that Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson would leave his job. Protesters quickly gathered to celebrate. They also demanded that Mayor James Knowles III step down as well.

Thursday's shooting happened outside the Ferguson Police Department. It took place as a demonstration was winding down across the street.

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the two officers were hospitalized after the shooting.

"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot â€” just because they were police officers," Belmar told reporters.

A 41-year-old officer was shot in the shoulder and a 32-year-old officer was shot in the face, he said.

Both were seriously injured but remained conscious, the chief said.

## "From Behind Us"

Just before the shooting, a group of officers was standing directly in front of the police station. Suddenly, shots were fired from somewhere to the northwest.

"I don't know who did the shooting," Belmar said. Whoever fired the shots, aimed "directly at my police officers," he said.

Some who have protested Brown's killing said they were saddened by Thursday's shooting. "My heart goes out to the officers injured tonight," said Antonio French, a protest leader.

Several witnesses said that the shots came from a hill beyond where protesters had gathered.

Just before the shooting, about 50 protesters were in the parking lot of a tire store. Police were gathered in the parking lot of the police station across the street. Suddenly, several shots were fired, said witness Heather De Mian. "It came from behind us," she said.

## "Standing Around Talking"

"You couldn't even see where it was coming from," said journalist Bradley Rayford. "The bullets went right past my head." Rayford added that he did see a flash coming from somewhere up the hill.

"We all ducked down" and the police took cover, Rayford said.

Protester Tony Rice said about three shots were fired.

"It was the first time I'd heard a bullet whiz and pass my head," Rice said. He said he didn't see who fired the shots. "They were way up the hill" and hidden in the dark, he said.

Mike Kinman, a priest, had just arrived at the protest five minutes before the shots were fired.

Demonstrators were "standing around talking" in the parking lot when four or five quick shots were fired. Protesters and officers ducked for cover, he said.

He said "the shots definitely came up from behind us, up the street. It definitely did not come from the protesters."
