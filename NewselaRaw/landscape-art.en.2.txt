WASHINGTON â€” This October, tourists have an extra reason to visit the National Mall.

The National Mall is the stretch of parks, museums and memorials that extend from the Lincoln Memorial to the U.S. Capitol building. It is sometimes known as "the nation's front lawn" for its green, open spaces and position next to some of the country's most important government buildings.

On a 6-acre section of the Mall, a new public art project has just been completed. At ground level, all that visitors viewing the artwork can see are swirls of alternating lines of dirt and sand with a few patches of gravel. From above, however, visitors can see that it is actually the face of a young man.

The artwork, which the artist calls a "facescape," will be open to the public from Saturday until Oct. 31. It is called "E Pluribus Unum" and is the work of Cuban-American artist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada.

The title is taken from one of the nation's best-known mottoes. In English, the Latin phrase means "Out of many, one." The motto refers to the fact that the American states are separate, but they combine to form a single country. It also suggests that U.S. citizens, in spite of their many differences, are unified as Americans.

## Combining Into One

The artwork is a tribute to the diversity of the youth of America. To create the face, Rodriguez-Gerada photographed 30 men of all races, ages 18 to 25. He then combined their faces, taking elements from each and mixing them into a single image. The face represents all 30 men and the American people in general.

"It's one of hundreds of millions of faces that America has," he said. "They're all us."

Rodriguez-Gerada created the face at an angle with one eye peering out. The effect is that no matter what angle visitors see the face from, the eye will always appear to be watching them.

"It took me a month and a half to get it right," said Rodriguez-Gerada. "It's always looking at you."

Once he knew how he wanted the face to look, the next step was building it. He figured out the exact placements of 10,000 wooden pegs. The pegs marked the lines of the face. Picture a huge connect-the-dots drawing, with 10,000 dots spread out across 6 acres with 8 miles of string connecting them.

Next, 2,500 tons of sand and 800 tons of topsoil were added. These gave the face its color and shading. All the materials were donated by companies.

## Park Service Supports The Art

The project was dreamed up by Kim Sajet. She is in charge of one of the museums in the National Mall. She came up with the idea earlier this year and asked the Park Service for permission. "When they said yes, we said, 'Really?'" she recalled. She was surprised that such a bold project would be allowed in one of the nation's most famous locations.

In some ways, however, the National Mall is the perfect setting for the "facescape." "This is a beautiful piece of art not just for what it looks like, but what it stands for," Sajet said, referring to the artwork's theme of American unity.

Even though it took months of hard work to create "E Pluribus Unum," the "facescape" will only be on display for one month. After that time, it will be covered over with grass.

This fact does not bother the artist, though. Rodriguez-Gerada designs many art pieces that are only meant to last for short periods of time. His National Mall "facescape" is not only an image, but also an experience. Visitors walk around it and notice how it seems to change from different angles. Like any experience, it doesn't last forever.

For Rodriguez-Gerada, this is part of the artwork's meaning. "I want to talk about living in the moment," he explained.
