WICHITA, Kan. â€” Athletes with special needs just scored a big win in Wichita, Kansas. They scored varsity letters.

These colorful, letter-shaped patches are awards just like ribbons and trophies. They are given to talented athletes in high schools across the country. Athletes usually show them off by sewing them onto "letter jackets" and "letter sweaters."

Up until now, varsity letters have never been awarded to students with special needs. Thanks to a recent school board vote, Wichita athletes with special needs will now receive varsity letters when they accomplish challenging athletic goals of their own.

## Letter Jacket Debate

The new idea of giving varsity letters to athletes with special needs started with Michael Kelley, a student at Wichita East High School.

Michael's mom, Jolinda Kelley, bought him a letter jacket. Jolinda Kelley said someone who worked at Michael's school told him he could not wear his letter jacket because of his disability. Officials from Michael's school district say that did not happen, but the discussion still became national news.

Then the varsity-letter rule was made. It is just one part of a six-page plan created by the Tri-County Athletic League. The league offers competitive sports for students with special needs. Tri-County's athletes come from 11 different high schools in Wichita.

The Wichita school board recently voted to OK using the league's guidelines in the city's high school athletics departments.

## Fair For All Athletes

Bryan Wilson helps run the Tri-County league. Wilson says the school board's vote means that the every high school in Wichita will now use the league's plan to make things fair for athletes with special needs. Now, athletes who play on Tri-County teams will have the opportunity to earn varsity letters, even as early as this school year.

To earn a letter, athletes with special needs must play a sport for two seasons or longer. They have to attend at least 70 percent of their practices and games. They must also keep their grades up and show good sportsmanship.

At the Wichita school board meeting, Michael Kelley sat in the audience with his family. They wore black T-shirts that said "#GiveThemLetters." Many people had been using that hashtag to talk about the issue on social media.

Jolinda Kelley said that even though she appreciated everyone's support, she does not think "give" is actually the right word to use. She made it clear that she does not want Michael's school to "give" him a letter just because he wants one. She says Michael and other athletes with special needs deserve varsity letters. They work hard, take on challenges and show teamwork, too.

"I'm asking for you to give them the letters that they've earned," Jolinda Kelley said.

## A Chance For The Kids To Shine

Every member of the school board agreed that Wichita schools should award varsity letters to athletes like Michael. They all voted to use the Tri-County Athletic League's guidelines for athletes with special needs.

After hearing the results of the vote, Jolinda Kelley said that she was thankful that the school board had heard her message. She was also disappointed that resolving the issue had to come down to a vote.

Jolinda Kelley's partner, Tonda McGrath, agreed. She said that if the school had responded to their concerns quickly and respectfully, there would have been no need for a vote.

Marty Rothwell, an official with a local social services agency, also spoke out about the results of the vote. Rothwell thanked the school board for supporting the Tri-County league's efforts to give students with disabilities a way to practice, compete and represent their schools.

"We could not find another school district that does this," he said. "So we are here today to thank you, because without this league, we wouldn't have a letter issue.

"When we ask the parents, they all say the same thing: This is our kids' chance to shine, and it's all because of Unified School District 259 and your dedication to all students."
