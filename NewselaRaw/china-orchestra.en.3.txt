BEIJING — A strange mix of merry American minstrels were about to go on stage. But while they were called the American Hollywood Film Orchestra, they were far from California.

The musicians, who are in a large group called an orchestra, have been traveling around China. This was their latest stop. They were in a famous concert hall in Beijing called the National Center for the Performing Arts.

They've been traveling the country by bus, train and plane. They'd been to more than 12 cities from late December to mid-January. At each stop, they offer up crowd-pleasing tunes from movies like "Titanic," "Dances With Wolves," "The Incredibles" and "The Godfather."

To save money, the group doesn't lug around large instruments. Instead, promoters in each town provide the drums and other instruments. But sometimes there are problems, almost straight out of a Hollywood comedy.

## Instrumental Problem Solved

On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cello players opened the cases of the instruments they were borrowing. They found one of them too damaged to play, its bridge was broken. Nearby, percussionist Chris Nolan had his own problems and was furious.

"Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!" he exclaimed. He pointed at the pitted and sagging drum heads. Stagehands with walkie-talkies, an interpreter and the promoter buzzed around the stage, trying to figure out what to do.

But as they say in Hollywood, the show must go on. And so it did. Nolan got his new drum heads 20 minutes before the curtain went up for the show of famous movie songs, "Classic Oscar: The American Hollywood Film Orchestra New Year's Audio-Visual Concert."

At 7:30 p.m., conductor Jason Altieri got on stage. He raised his arm and launched the group into song, including some that tried to connect with the Chinese crowds. The group performed music from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," a popular Chinese movie. And they gave a "Mission: Impossible" and "Star Wars" twist to the Chinese film "The Red Detachment of Women."

The orchestra has long, hard days that begin when they wake up at 5:30 a.m. They don't eat dinner until 11 p.m. Travel, practice, and concerts are in between. Their busy days show how popular they are.

Some performers just graduated college. Others are older, like Jack Cobos. He's a retired carpet salesman who's turning 71 during this tour. They're hardly famous. But in smaller cities, they have been surrounded by crowds eager to take dozens of pictures after their shows.

## Playing Concert Halls Under Construction

Sometimes, the concert halls are freezing cold or they're still under construction. Jason Heidelberg, a cellist from Cleveland, said this year they arrived in a town called Haiyang. "The floor was still not done — they just put red carpet over it," he said.

John Bryant, a trumpeter, knows what it's like. He has toured with the group twice. He said that in 2009 the group's plane was grounded by a snowstorm in another area called Shenyang. The musicians had to ride on an overly crowded train and made it to their next concert, in Xian, 90 minutes late. "Playing after like 18 hours of travel was crazy," he said. They didn't even have time to change, he said, "we just went straight to the concert in our traveling clothes."

Another time, Bryant said he was was stunned to find people smoking. He's a trumpeter, after all, and it's tough to play in a room full of smoke.

Most of the performers say they're not touring for the money but to have the opportunity to see a bit of China. They enjoy the companionship of their fellow musicians. And they have a chance to connect with audiences who speak a different language and live in a different land.

Conductor Altieri recalled being in an area of China called Ningbo. The group stumbled across a music school where an old man was teaching children the erhu, a traditional Chinese two-stringed instrument. The Americans watched for half an hour. The kids staged an unplanned concert. Later, the Americans found a group of people performing karaoke in a park, and joined in.

"All the karaoke people ended up buying tickets to our show. They even came backstage and gave us flowers," Altieri said. "That's what I love about doing this — making music and sharing it." He said they build friendships with people that go beyond the differences in their languages.
