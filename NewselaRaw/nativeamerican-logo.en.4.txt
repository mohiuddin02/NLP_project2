Many call the picture insulting to Native Americans. Calls to change the logo have been growing. So far, though, the team has refused to budge.

The town of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, shares something in common with the Washington Redskins. It has also used a picture of a Native American on its logo for a long time. The picture appears all over: on the town's official letters, business cards, vehicles and website.

Now the town is thinking of dropping that picture.

However, this time local [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American) are against the switch.

## Not All Logos Are The Same

The Ramapough Lenape Nation is the closest tribe to the town. Dwaine Perry is a Ramapough chief. He said there is a big difference between the Franklin Lakes logo and the Redskins logo.

The first "represents the native people" with dignity. Meanwhile, the Redskins logo is insulting and cartoonish. Perry thinks the town should continue to include a picture of a Native American in its official logo.

Very few people in Franklin Lakes are Native American. Still, the region has deep Native American roots.

The town government asked students at Indian Hills High School to come up with possible new logos. Two winning designs were picked. The town then posted an online survey. The survey asked people to choose between the two designs.

One logo shows a scene of Franklin Lake. The other also shows Franklin Lake, but adds the face of a Native American in the foreground.

Nine hundred people responded to the survey. Three-fourths of them picked the logo without the Native American.

People were also allowed to comment on the logo change. Most of the 200 comments focused on the same question: Would including a picture of a Native American be insulting — or just true to history?

## The Town Has Native American Roots

Some Native Americans expressed their opinion on the matter.

"We're tired of people trying to decide what would" upset us, said Autumn Wind Scott. Scott is a Ramapough official.

Artist Barbara Lawshe designed the current logo back in the late 1960s. When she found out that Franklin Lakes might change its logo, she first thought: "That's fine. Give mine a rest after all these years."

However, when she learned that the Native American figure could be dropped, she changed her mind. "That's ridiculous," she said. "History is history. You can't change it."

The town's government has not decided when — or if — it will change the logo.

The history of Franklin Lakes has deep Native American roots. Native Americans were in the area well before Europeans arrived. They lived along the Ramapo River in Franklin Cove and fished in Franklin Lake.

Among those Native Americans, land and water were not owned. They were shared. When European settlers arrived, they set out to buy the land. The Indians believed the European goods were gifts, instead of a way of paying for their land.

## Remembering Local History

Lawshe said she looked at history books when she created the current logo. "They needed something that would represent the history of the town," she recalled.

Jackie Bunker-Lohrenz is one of the town's librarians. She said she is impressed by Lawshe's design. She likes how it reminds people that Native Americans have shaped the history of Franklin Lakes.

"Not everybody includes that history," Bunker-Lohrenz said.

And that's something Perry doesn't want the people of Franklin Lakes to forget.

If not for the Native Americans who "settled this area," he said, things would have been very different. Franklin Lakes would not have become a town.
