LOS ANGELES â€” Scientists worry that a strong earthquake off the coast of California could do major damage to the West Coast.

Earthquakes on land can cause a lot of damage. But earthquakes in the ocean have their own dangers. These earthquakes can cause a tsunami, a huge wave that rushes into coastal cities.

The Cascadia fault line, 700 miles off the coast of Northern California, could produce a tsunami that would heavily damage the West Coast, scientists say.

A giant tsunami along the West Coast would wash away towns, destroy U.S. Highway 101 and cause $70 billion in damage. The wave could destroy bridges, knock down power lines, and cut communication systems like phones or Internet.

It's possible that people would only have 15 minutes to escape. As many as 10,000 people could die.

## Early Warning System

Officials in California, Oregon and Washington are now making plans to prepare for an earthquake and tsunami. They hope to learn lessons from a 2011 disaster in Japan. A 9.0 earthquake there created a huge tsunami that flooded coastal areas.

That tsunami took people by surprise. It killed more than 10,000 and left more than 300,000 homeless. It also damaged a nuclear power plant. A meltdown at the plant spread dangerous radiation in the area.

Researchers on the West Coast hope to save lives by quickly spotting a tsunami and warning local citizens. They hope that new tsunami detectors deep under the ocean can provide early warnings.

Predicting a tsunami's strength is important to saving lives. Japanese scientists did not realize how big their tsunami was. Local people were not prepared, and many lost their lives.

It's very important to have correct information, said Vasily Titov, head of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Center for Tsunami Research.

## Escape To High Ground

To escape a tsunami, people must get to high ground such as a hill or mountain. But in flat areas, there is nowhere to go. Safety officials must build high ground.

One idea is buildings with roofs that can protect people from a tsunami. One of these at a school in Washington will protect 1,000 people with a high wall.

Officials have also discussed building man-made hills. Each hill could hold as many as 800 people.

California is famous for the San Andreas fault. This fault runs through the heart of the state. It produced the famously scary 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The 1906 quake killed more than 3,000 people.

Scientists now think that the Cascadia fault is more dangerous than they thought.

The Cascadia fault is made up of three tectonic plates that are pushing against each other. The most powerful earthquakes in the last 10 years in California were caused by Cascadia.

Scientists had believed that the Cascadia fault could only produce a 7.5 earthquake. But they now believe that it could create an enormous 9.0 quake.

## Like A Rubber Band

The Cascadia fault is dangerous for two reasons. First, it is very long.

Second, it is an area where two huge tectonic plates are being pushed under the even-larger North American plate. The smaller plates push under little by little, dragging the North American plate down with them.

But the North American plate is old and strong, and it won't be pulled down forever.

Once every couple hundred years, the North American plate snaps back upward like a rubber band, creating a strong earthquake.

On March 16, a small earthquake caused by the Cascadia fault erupted 50 miles off the coast, causing light shaking. No injuries or damages were reported.

The West Coast was spared this time, but scientists still wonder when "The Big One" will hit.

"It could be today. It could be 100 years from now," U.S. Geological Survey seismologist David Oppenheimer said.
