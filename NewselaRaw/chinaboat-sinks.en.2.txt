The Eastern Star capsized on the Yangtze River Monday night with 458 people aboard. At least 15 people were brought to safety during the rescue effort, including three pulled from the overturned boat Tuesday. At least five people died in the tragedy, the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency reported.

The boat was carrying mostly elderly tourists from Nanjing to the southwestern city of Chongqing.

Divers rescued a 65-year-old woman and, later, two men who had been trapped, Chinese television station CCTV reported. It said more people had been found and were being rescued, but did not say whether they were still inside the overturned hull.

## Rescuers Try To Find Survivors Inside

CCTV video showed rescuers in orange life vests climbing on the hull. One of them lay down on the boat, tapped it with a hammer, listened for a response, and then gestured downward.

"We will do everything we can to rescue everyone trapped in there, no matter they're still alive or not," said Chen Shoumin. He is the military region commander of the Hubei province, where the boat overturned.

The survivors included the ship's captain and chief engineer, both taken into police custody for questioning, CCTV said.

The captain and the chief engineer have said the four-level boat sank quickly after being caught in what they described as a cyclone. A Chinese newspaper said the ship sank within two minutes. The river was 50 feet deep in that area.

## Passengers Had Little Warning

Zhang, who is a tour guide, said in an interview from his hospital bed that the ship tilted and he grabbed a life jacket with just moments to spare. Bottles went rolling off tables, he said, and then suddenly the boat turned all the way over.

Zhang, who cannot swim, said he drifted in the river all night and reached the shore as dawn approached.

"The raindrops hitting my face felt like hailstones," Zhang said.

Some survivors swam ashore. Others were rescued more than 12 hours after the accident when search teams heard people yelling for help.

Thirteen navy divers were on the scene of the rescue and 170 more were joining them, Chen said. In total, more than 50 boats and 3,000 people were involved in the search.

A 65-year-old woman was rescued by divers, who brought extra breathing equipment into the boat and taught her how to use it.

That woman "had a very strong will and learned very fast," Chen said. "After 20 minutes she surfaced to the water and was rescued."

## Fast Currents Make Rescue Difficult

The overturned ship had drifted almost 2 miles downstream before coming to rest close to shore. Fast currents made the rescue difficult.

The fact that the ship drifted downstream was a good sign for rescuers. It meant that the overturned boat had enough air trapped inside to stay afloat. Also, possibly there was enough air inside for survivors to breathe, said Park Chi-mo. He is a professor of naval architecture and ocean engineering at South Korea's Ulsan University.

CCTV said the vessel had been carrying 406 Chinese passengers, five travel agency employees and a crew of 47. Most of the passengers were 50 to 80 years old.

## Families Demand To See List Of Names

In Shanghai, where many of the passengers started their journey, relatives angrily asked whether the captain had done enough to make sure the passengers were safe. Huang Yan wept as she told a reporter that she believes that her husband and his elderly father were on board. She said she couldn't be sure because she hadn't seen the passenger list.

"Why did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?" Huang shouted. "We want the government to release the name list to see who was on the boat."

Among the passengers was a group of about a dozen people who had retired from a Shanghai bus company, said a woman. Her sister and brother-in-law and their 6-year-old granddaughter were part of the group.

The Eastern Star was 251 feet long and 36 feet wide, and carried a maximum of 534 people. It is owned by the Chongqing Eastern Shipping Corporation, which could not be reached for comment.

The Yangtze is the world's third-longest river and sometimes floods during the summer rainy season.

CCTV reported that 6 inches of rain had fallen in the region in the past 24 hours. Local media reported that winds had reached 80 miles an hour during the accident.
