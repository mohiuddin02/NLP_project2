But when you read her poems, you can still hear her rich, deep voice caressing every syllable:

_Come you death, in haste, do come,_  
_My shroud of black be weaving,_  
_Quiet my heart, be deathly quiet,_  
_My true love is leaving._

"She was an extraordinary, charismatic person," Edwin Wilson said years ago. Wilson is a former head of academics at Wake Forest University where Angelou taught. "She had a way of bringing an audience very much to within her grasp."

After Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, he asked her to read a poem when he was sworn in. It was the first poem at an inauguration in 32 years.

She called it "On the Pulse of the Morning," and in it she spoke of hope for the country's future. She also reminded listeners of two despairs from the past: the Trail of Tears and slavery.

_History, despite its wrenching pain_  
_Cannot be unlived, but if freed_  
_With courage, need not be lived again._

## "Sing Their Songs"

Angelou was born Marguerite Johnson in 1928 in St. Louis. She was raised by her grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas, "swollen-belly poor," she described it. At 16, she had her only child, a son. She married and divorced at least two times, but would never say how many.

She was a poet, dancer, actress, songwriter, civil rights activist, streetcar conductor, Creole cook, cocktail waitress, filmmaker and script writer. She toured Europe and Africa in the 1950s as an entertainer. It was then that she started using the name Maya Angelou.

In 1969, she emerged as an author. Her first book, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," was a huge success. In it, she described being raped at age 7 by her mother's boyfriend.

"I had to make a decision that I would tell a truth which might liberate me, and might liberate others," Angelou said in 1994. "I have a file in my office filled with letters from women and men, mostly women, who read 'Caged Bird' and somehow felt liberated enough to tell their mothers."

The book gave these women the strength "to confront their fathers or their uncles or their brothers, as grown women and to say, 'This was cruel, what you did to me.'"

She dedicated the book to her son, and "all the strong black birds of promise who defy the odds and gods and sing their songs."

## Dictionary, Thesaurus And Bible

For six years after the rape, Angelou said, she rarely spoke. When she did it was only to her brother. That experience led to her becoming a writer.

In 2002, she said that while she wasn't speaking back then she "read everything." And she memorized. "I memorized 60 sonnets. And I memorized Paul Laurence Dunbar, James Welden Johnson, Countee Cullen and Edgar Allan Poe. I loved Poe so much I called him 'Eap' to myself."

Early in her writing career, she began renting hotel rooms where she would write. She would take a yellow pad, a dictionary, a thesaurus, a Bible and a bottle of sherry.

In Winston-Salem, North Carolina, she had a hotel which she used. She told this story about it. "People call or come by and say, 'Is this the place where Maya Angelou is?'" The employees keep her identity secret by saying "Maya who?"

Angelou moved to Winston-Salem in 1981 after being given a lifetime position as a professor of American Studies at Wake Forest.

## "What Are You Looking At Me For?"

In December 2001 she partnered with Hallmark Cards on a line of greeting cards. It landed Angelou at the center of controversy.

"I think it's preposterous," said Billy Collins. He was the official poet of the U.S., the nation's poet laureate, back then. "It lowers the understanding of what poetry actually can do."

Angelou said she saw it as a literary challenge: to simplify an inspiration into two sentences. "I have not reduced my value or respect for words or love of the language," she said. "I'm having a ball. It was exactly what I needed after 'A Song Flung Up to Heaven.'"

"A Song Flung Up to Heaven" was the sixth and final volume of her autobiography. Published in 2002, it included memories of motherhood, as well as the assassinations in the 1960s of her friends Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

The last sentence of that volume is the same as the first sentence of the first:

"What are you looking at me for?" she wrote. "I didn't come to stay."
