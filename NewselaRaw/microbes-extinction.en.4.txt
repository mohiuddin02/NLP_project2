LOS ANGELES â€” About 252 million years ago, before there were even dinosaurs, most of the living things on Earth died. Scientists called this event the end-Permian extinction. It has long been a mystery what caused it.

Now they have an idea. A new study blames tiny microbes on the bottom of the ocean.

Microbes are small living things that can only be seen through a microscope. The microbes in the new study are so small, about 1 billion of them could fit in a thimble-full of ocean dirt. But they were almost responsible for killing off all the life on our planet, the scientists suggest.

The end-Permian extinction lasted 20,000 years. Scientists say that nearly nine-tenths of all life on Earth was destroyed.

Gregory Fournier is a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He said the end-Permian extinction was worse than what killed the dinosaurs. "Things were very close to being over for good," he said.

## Rise In CO2 A Clue

Scientists have struggled to understand exactly what caused the extinction. There was a quick jump in CO2 levels at the time. That would have caused the oceans to become more acidic. The Earth would have become hotter. Most forms of life would not have been able to live. But what actually caused the CO2 levels to rise has remained a mystery.

Some scientists thought an asteroid could be to blame. Others say it was volcanoes. Still others blame coal fires.

Now, researchers from MIT and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have named a new and unlikely suspect. They blame a tiny microbe that puts out methane gas. It is known as Methanosarcina.

MIT scientist Dan Rothman was looking at how carbon levels grew during this time. He found the first clue that microbes could have been involved. What he saw was not a straight line. It was a quick upward curve.

A sudden fire in a coal field in Siberia would not have created CO2 that way, he said. What he saw looked like the work of microbes.

It was the first time anyone had suggested microbes might be involved with the end-Permian extinction. But microbes have been accused of changing the chemistry of our planet at other times. For example, microbes are responsible for creating the first oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.

## Rise In Nickel Another Clue

"What they do" is very important, Rothman said of microbes. "And if they do better or worse, things change."

To figure out which microbe might have been responsible, Rothman took his research to Fournier. Fournier had written a paper about Methanosarcina in 2008. The paper showed that sometime in the last 400 million years, Methanosarcina got a new gene. The new gene allowed it to make methane more easily than ever before.

Fournier worked to figure exactly when the gene change happened. He found it most likely occurred about 250 million years ago.

The scientists cannot say for certain that the microbe and the methane it produced caused the end-Permian extinction. Still, they do have something else to support their idea. Methanosarcina needs nickel to make methane.

Much of the volcanoes at the time were in Siberia. Some of the world's largest supplies of nickel are there. Furthermore, the scientists found an increase in nickel in dirt from that time.

Rothman agrees that what the scientists are saying is unusual. "But it does bring together many observations, and ties a lot of stuff together," Rothman said. "That doesn't make it right." But it is enough to do more tests to try to solve this mystery, he said.
