WASHINGTON â€” Free lunches are coming to thousands of students all around the country this fall. A government program could bring free lunch to all 50 states.

The [lunch program](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school lunch) comes from a law called the Community Eligibility Provision. This was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. It was part of a larger set of school food rules. The law lets districts with free or reduced-price lunches offer the meals to every student at the school. There is no cost to them. No paperwork has to be filled out. It does not matter how much money their parents make.

Originally, school districts had until the end of June to decide whether to join the free lunch program. Then the government moved the deadline into August. It wanted to give districts more time to decide. They also took a long time to release the list of schools that are able to join.

Nobody knows for sure how many new school districts will sign up this year. But many education officials are making their decisions now. In most states, hundreds of schools are newly able to join.

## So Far, It Is Working Well

In areas with the program, people really like it. People say it is a help to the low-income school lunch program. The program provided 21.5 million free or reduced-price meals in schools last year.

"Everyone's got a great meal that they can get at no charge," said Madeleine Levin. She works with the Food Research and Action Center.

Under the new program, the government pays for only a part of the new schools that are joining. The states are left to pay the rest. As a result, not all school districts are expected to join.

Some schools have 4 out of 10 students who can get a free lunch. These schools can now use the new program. There are more than 28,000 schools like this nationwide.

Some schools have nearly all students already receiving free lunches. For them, there will be little change. That is because the school is already being paid back for nearly all lunches served.

It's different if only 4 out of 10 students can join. Then, the school will have to make up the difference.

## Each School Is A Different Case

All elementary and middle schools in Fort Wayne, Indiana, will get free lunches. But high schools there will have to wait. High schools use the free lunch program much less. The district was not sure having them join would make sense.

Some schools in Fort Wayne gave every student free meals. Other schools had almost all of their students in the program. At that point, it is easier to let everyone eat for free.

High schools have always used the free and reduced-price lunch program less. There is more shame about participating, officials and experts say. In some cases, families' situations might improve as children grow. Parents can work. They do not have to pay the high cost of babysitters.

St. Paul, Minnesota, is one district that is moving slowly. Jean Ronnei is in charge of schools there. She said the district is doing a "test drive." They are starting the program at one high school, one middle school and a few elementary schools.

Starting with just a few schools helps them, she said. It gives them "a chance to see more about what the impact will be," she said.
