MIAMI, Fla. — On Monday, Jeb Bush announced that he is running for president.

Bush is the son of President George H.W. Bush and the younger brother of President George W. Bush. Neither man was in the audience on Monday. Still, Jeb joked about his two famous family members.

Jeb said he met his first president the day he was born. He met the second president the day he came home from the hospital.

Bush soon turned serious. The presidency has to be earned, he said. It cannot just be passed down from one family member to another.

"Not a one of us deserves the job," the onetime Florida governor said.

"It's nobody's turn," Bush went on. "It's everybody's test, and it's wide open — exactly as a contest for president should be."

## Family Ties May Not Help Him Win

Jeb Bush's family ties may help him win in 2016. They could also make things harder for him. Voters may turn against him if they think he feels he should be president just because he is from the Bush family.

On Monday, Bush tried to suggest that he is a new kind of Republican. He believes he thinks more like young people do even though he is 62 years old.

The Republican Party is more traditional than the country's other main political group, the Democrats. Most Republicans do not want society to change. They want things to remain much as they always have been, or to go back to what they once were. The average Republican voter is white and older.

Such voters are becoming less common because the country is becoming more diverse. There are more people from different racial groups besides white. Many people think that to keep doing well, the Republicans must attract new kinds of voters.

Jeb Bush thinks he may be the Republican to do just that. On Monday, Latin music played outside the college gym where his announcement was made. Both English and Spanish were used during the event.

## He Says Being A Governor Was Good Practice

During his speech Bush spoke about his record as governor. He pointed to what he said were his many successes. Bush suggested that his time as governor had prepared him to serve as president. Most of the other people running for president do not have that kind of experience, he said.

Bush has been getting ready to run for president for months. Monday's announcement just made his run official.

So far, he has not been doing as well as expected.

Many people thought Bush would be the clear front-runner by now. Instead, he has failed to get ahead of the many other Republicans who are running.

The Republicans must first run against each other in the primaries. The winner of that contest will face a Democrat in the general election. Right now, Hillary Rodham Clinton is the most likely to win the Democratic primary.

Bush last ran for office more than 12 years ago. He now sometimes seems out of practice. For example, he did not do too well answering a question about whether he supported the unpopular war his brother started in Iraq. Bush finally said he would not have supported the war if he knew then what he knows now.

Bush is a bit different from the Republican Party overall. The party has become much more attached to traditional ideas. Many Republicans may see him as not traditional enough.

On Monday, Bush said he is sure he can win the presidency. He said he will bring the Republican Party to his way of thinking, not the other way around.
