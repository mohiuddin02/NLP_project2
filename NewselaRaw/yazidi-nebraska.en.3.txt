LINCOLN, Neb. — When the Yazidis in Nebraska cook, they cry. They know their relatives in the Middle East have nothing to eat. When they see their beds, they think of their families trapped on a mountaintop. They have nothing to sleep on there but rocks.

Many members of the Yazidi community in Lincoln, Nebraska, say they have stopped eating, sleeping and going to work. Surrounded by Nebraska's cornfields, they stare at their phones and wait for news from northern Iraq.

The Yazidis are an ancient group of people from the Middle East.

In Iraq, Yazidis could die in large numbers, President Barack Obama said last week. He announced the United States would drop water and food to Yazidis in danger of starving. The Yazidis, who are not Islamic, fled the Islamic State (ISIL), a group of fighters who want to take over Iraq.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

ISIL fighters have taken control of big chunks of land in Iraq and neighboring Syria. They have declared their own country. They have made Islam the religion. People there must obey their religious laws. Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled the city of Sinjar, the center of the Yazidi community, when ISIL fighters captured it. The Yazidis took shelter on Mount Sinjar.

## Their Families Are Hungry

Some Yazidis in Nebraska were so sad that they could not get out of bed. Others have felt like they wanted to die. Sharifa Khalil, 26, a nurse, said more than 20 people had been taken to the hospital. They had been so upset they weren't drinking enough water, and some fainted.

Hakima Antar, 26, sat on the floor of a crowded apartment where Yazidis had gathered. She was weeping quietly and clutching a napkin. Antar said her sister and her five children have been trapped on Mount Sinjar.

"I feel guilty when I see food or when I eat," she said through an interpreter. "I look at the food and I can't even eat, because they are hungry over there."

Hundreds of Yazidis live in Lincoln. It is thought to be the largest community of Yazidis in the United States. Yazidis here have been flooded with videos and photos of relatives and children begging for help. Horror stories have come to them from Iraq. They have heard that Yazidi women were taken to be slaves.

Although the stories from Iraq cannot be confirmed, Yazidis in Nebraska believe them.

## Many Stories Of Terrible Conditions

Three Yazidis gathered in the living room of a Lincoln apartment. They used to help the American military by translating what the Iraqis said for them.

Fares Baki is 29 and moved to the United States from Iraq in December. Baki said his brother and his brother's four children have been trapped on Mount Sinjar without food or water.

Emergency aid groups have tried dropping food from helicopters. The food has not reached Baki's family. The brothers have kept in touch by phone, he said, but many Yazidis say their relatives' phones are dying.

Faisal is 33 years old. He used to help the military speak with local people in Iraq. He moved to the United States in 2012. Faisal said one of his three sisters in Iraq was captured by ISIL last week. She was able to call him with a cellphone she snuck into a jail under her clothes.

His sister told him ISIL fighters had separated the older women from the younger women. They took the boys away.

"I'm just shocked and frozen — I can't even cry anymore," Faisal said.
