CORVALLIS, Ore. — Thin alpacas with big eyes look out from the large-animal hospital at Oregon State University.

These animals, related to camels, have had a hard life. According to police, they were starving to death.

There are 15 that need special care, and 160 more that are well enough to live in fields owned by the university.

Last week, Shari Bond and Jackie Glover drove down to begin finding homes for the 175 extremely skinny alpacas that were rescued by police.

## Making Money On Alpacas

Bond and Glover founded the nonprofit organization Cross Creek Alpaca Rescue four years ago. This is the biggest job ever for their group.

"Look, you can see her backbone," says Bond, pointing to a skinny alpaca.

Even after a month of normal feeding, this alpaca is still so thin that her spine is showing. In a healthy animal, the spine wouldn't show.

But it's better than in late December, when police were called to rescue the starving animals.

At that time "you could see ribs and hip bones," Bond said.

Alpacas are a common sight in the countryside of the Pacific Northwest.

Washington state has 20,000 registered alpacas. Oregon has 16,000. In the U.S., only Ohio has more, with 28,000.

The first alpacas arrived in the U.S. from the Peruvian mountains in the mid-1980s. The animals were valued for their shiny, hypoallergenic fur.

People could make money selling the fur, but also by breeding and selling valuable animals. A female could sell for $70,000, a male for about $30,000.

A TV commercial made by the alpaca industry showed an older couple having coffee and happily watching their herd of alpacas.

The wife says, "I step out the front door and I'm at work. … It's a wonderful business."

But one agricultural economics expert wonders if the prices for alpacas have climbed too high too quickly.

## In Over Their Heads

The alpaca industry says that is not the case.

Chris Sturgeon, president of the Pacific Northwest Alpaca Association, says the owners of the starving alpacas had good intentions, but got in over their heads.

Sturgeon and his wife, Elise, are therapists who also own an alpaca ranch. They say the market for alpacas is strong. One male alpaca on their farm is worth $350,000, they say.

In December, when police arrived at the ranch owned by Jocelyn and Robert Silver, they found 16 dead alpacas and 20 more that died later. Tests showed that many of them had starved to death.

Each of the Silvers has been charged in court with animal neglect. They have pleaded not guilty.

In a phone interview, Robert Silver, 73, says he has receipts to show the animals had been fed hay.

Silver says he and his wife got into the alpaca business after she went to a livestock show and fell in love with them.

He says they began in 2005 to 2006, and eventually spent $320,000 for about 50 animals, which averages out to $6,400 per alpaca.

Building a barn, paying for food, and other expenses pushed the Silvers' total cost to $750,000.

"It was our life's savings," Silver says.

He said they hoped their female alpacas would give birth to babies, which they could sell for a profit.

"We never were able to sell any," Silver says.

## Adopting The Alpacas

By last year, they had to sell females for $1,000 each. They were losing a lot of money.

Now, Silver is warning others that it is not very easy to make money in the alpaca business.

You must be rich already, and really love alpacas, he says.

Bond, of the alpaca rescue organization, first heard about the starving animals, called the police, then asked Oregon State veterinarians for help.

Saving the alpacas has not been cheap. The police have spent $16,000, though donations have helped with the costs. The Oregon State veterinarians are working for free. They say helping the animals is a valuable experience for vet students.

Today, Bond and Glover are at the hospital, deciding which alpacas can be taken to new homes.

There are 300 people who want to adopt the alpacas. Today, four have arrived with their trailers.

One of them is Jo Sowards, 71, of Goldendale, Wash.

She and her husband, Glen, retired there on 35 acres and breed racing dogs. They also rescue dogs that need homes.

She takes home four adult female alpacas, one a mom with a baby, and one that is pregnant.

"I'm doing what you call community service. These are dumb animals that needed help," Sowards says.
