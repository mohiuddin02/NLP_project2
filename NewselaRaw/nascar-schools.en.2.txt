WASHINGTON — It takes a lot of math and physics to get a race car to go around the track.

NASCAR wants to help kids learn the science behind races like the Daytona 500. Recently, the stock car racing organization announced that it will promote STEM subjects inside classrooms and out. STEM is short for science, technology, engineering and math.

The NASCAR Acceleration Nation project focuses on the laws of motion, or what it calls the three D's of speed — downforce, drafting and drag. Downforce is the downward thrust created by a car. Drafting is when two or more cars move faster when they are lined up. Drag is the force of resistance. Race cars have to push through a lot of air, which slows them down.

## The Fun Side Of Math, Science

NASCAR hopes to show kids the fun side of engineering and math through the project, Brent Dewar, NASCAR's chief operating officer, said. It also wants to encourage fans to view NASCAR in a new way.

"A lot of people see cars racing and they love the sport for the sporting element of cars winning, and racing and passing," Dewar said. "Behind all of that is pure science. It's the horsepower, and it's drag and it's aerodynamics."

Carl Edwards was a substitute teacher in Columbia, Missouri, long before he got behind the wheel of a race car. Edwards is known for his back-flip off cars after winning races. As a sub, it was tough for him to keep students' attention. He hopes that bringing race cars into science class will spark interest in the subject.

Edwards said that with every lap around the race track, science is involved. Drivers must track the likelihood of crashing at different parts of the race. They must figure out the amount of fuel used by the engine at different speeds. Although Edwards still uses the science and math he learned in school, he wishes he had learned even more.

"You can take any part of the car and talk about how it was engineered and why it's designed the way it is," he said. "There's a physics or a math or a science lesson in any of that."

## Race-Day Interactive Games

As part of the project, NASCAR has partnered with educational publisher Scholastic Corporation. They will develop fact sheets and quizzes mainly for middle school teachers focused on aerodynamics, the study of how air affects a moving object. One question asks why do race cars in a drafting formation — lined up behind each other — go faster?

The answer is that the air acts like a vacuum. It sucks the trailing cars forward. Leading cars also get a boost. The trailing cars push high-pressure air over the leading cars' spoilers. Those are the wings at the back of a car that helps keep it from flying into the air.

NASCAR will mail more than 7,400 kits to teachers. Teachers can also go online to download the material and view demonstrations. There will also be a website for fans with math and other games, plus an interactive area that children and teens can visit on race days.

NASCAR's effort is part of a larger push in both business and government to promote STEM education. Some people are concerned that the United States is falling behind in these areas. There are expected to be a lot of new jobs in STEM fields in the future.
