Sol Messinger was just 7 when he stood with his father at the rail of the ship St. Louis and stared into the darkness. Now nearly eight decades later, Messinger still recalls the lights of Miami glittering off the bow. They were so near to him and the more than 900 fellow Jewish refugees on board, yet beyond their reach.

Today, "I look out into the ocean and I get this queasy feeling," says Messinger, whose family escaped Europe for the United States three years after American officials turned away the ocean liner in 1939. More than one-quarter of the Jews on board the ship were later killed in the Holocaust.

Now 83, Messinger is a doctor in Buffalo, New York. "The Jews did not pose any threat to the U.S." he said. "It's really unforgivable."

On Nov. 13, the Islamic State group killed 130 people in Paris, France. Since then a backlash against the U.S. admitting Syrian refugees has fueled a bitter debate. The Islamic State is an extremist group attempting to set up its own country governed by its version of Islamic law. It has also been called ISIS. The group's fighters have captured parts of Syria and Iraq.

Now the spotlight is once again back on the St. Louis and other decisions made by U.S. officials before and during World War II.

## Similarities Cannot Be Ignored, Historians Say

There are differences between now and then. But there are disturbing similarities between today and then that make that history worth recalling, scholars say.

"No historical parallel is perfect, obviously," says Allan Lichtman, co-author of "FDR and the Jews" and a professor of history at American University.

During World War II, the U.S. put strict limits on refugees fleeing Europe. These limits were influenced by anti-Semitism, prejudice against the Jewish people. Some were also worried that the Nazis "would plant agents, spies and saboteurs among the Jewish refugees and that they would pressure the Jews, particularly those whose families were still in Germany, to act as agents on behalf of" Germany, Lichtman said.

"Those arguments are chillingly similar to the arguments being made against the admission of the Syrian refugees," who are mainly Muslim.

Lichtman isn't alone in making the comparison.

On Monday, professor Peter Shulman of Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, used Twitter to post results from a 1938 public opinion poll. It showed that Americans overwhelmingly rejected admission of German Jews in the years leading up to the outbreak of war.

One of his tweets about the poll has been relayed 4,600 times.

## We Have Made This Mistake Before, Lawmaker Says

"When we sent Jews back to Germany and when we sent Japanese to internment camps, we regretted it and we will regret this as well," said Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois. This week, 47 House Democrats and 242 Republicans voted for a bill to put new security limits on a plan by President Barack Obama to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year.

On Wednesday, New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio criticized a number of Republican governors for opposing admission of Syrian refugees. He also mentioned the 1938 poll. A total of 67 percent of Americans said the U.S. should try to keep German and Austrian refugees out of the country, and 61 percent opposed allowing 10,000 German Jewish children to enter.

"We are not going to make that mistake in our time, and voices of intolerance and voices of division are not going to cause us to do something that is against our values," DeBlasio said.

## Critics Blast Comparison Between Then, Now

The comparison has been rejected by some critics.

Ian Tuttle called it nonsense in the conservative magazine National Review. "The first and most obvious difference: There was no international conspiracy of German Jews in the 1930s attempting to carry out daily attacks on civilians on several continents," he wrote.

Tuttle's comments continue a long pattern in U.S. politics of labeling refugees as a threat, whether fleeing the Nazis, Hungarian Revolution or the Vietnam War, said Kelly Greenhill, a professor of political science at Tufts University.

In the years since World War II, the U.S. has taken more in more refugees than any other country.

But of the 784,000 refugees resettled in America since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York, just three have been arrested on charges of planning terrorist activities, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a group that studies the movement of people worldwide. Only one of those, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, spoke of targeting the U.S. itself, although he had no specific plans, the institute said.

After both Cuban and American officials turned away the St. Louis, Messinger's family found a temporary refuge in Belgium. He sees some similarities between that experience and the one endured by those fleeing Syria, but it's not the same, he says.

## No One On Boat Was A Threat, WWII Refugee Says

Jews fled Europe because of discrimination and mistreatment based on their religion, he said. Just six weeks after his family entered the U.S. in 1942 all the remaining Jews in their village were sent to a concentration camp.

But the danger Syrians face is less because of their religion and more because their home country is a war zone, where thousands have been killed, Messinger said. What's more, unlike fears that terrorists may sneak into the country with the Syrians, nobody aboard the St. Louis posed a potential threat.

Robert Krakow's SS St. Louis Legacy Project has documented the history of the voyage and successfully pushed for an apology from the U.S. government for turning the ship away. He said he sees more similarities than differences between the Jewish and Muslim refugees.

"Ultimately, it's all grounded in the human condition. It's grounded in human need and suffering, and here's a case where we can do something," he said.
