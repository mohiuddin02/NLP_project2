Pope Benedict XVI stunned the world on Monday when he announced he is stepping down, saying he is too weak and tired to fulfill his duties. His was the first resignation by a leader of the Roman Catholic Church in almost 600 years.

Benedict, who turns 86 years old this spring, gave his resignation to a group of cardinals. Now, all eyes will turn to the church's headquarters at the Vatican in Rome, where the cardinals will gather to choose a new spiritual leader for the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.

## Popes Don't Retire

Benedict's resignation came as a shock because popes are elected for life. They are expected to serve until their dying breath. The last pope to resign was Gregory XII who quit in 1415 to help end a power struggle within the church.

The [pope](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) is important because no other single person represents so many religious believers. The Roman Catholic Church says that the pope speaks for God and that he should have the final word in all religious matters.

## A Mixed Legacy

The Catholic Church has faced many controversies during Benedict's time as pope, including a worldwide child-abuse scandal involving priests. Benedict apologized to the victims and created new policies to prevent future abuse. Some critics said he did not go far enough in addressing the crisis.

Benedict himself has been the object of controversy for making comments that angered Muslims and Jews. But Benedict's admirers say he should be remembered as a brilliant scholar who wrote powerful essays about the church's mission to help the poor.

Speaking in Latin, Pope Benedict told the cardinals, who are the highest-ranking priests in the church, that he no longer had the "strength of mind and body" to govern the church in "today's world." Benedict is known for his strict, traditional views. He opposes many of the changes taking place in society, such as gay marriage.

## Standing In The Shadow

Pope Benedict was elected in 2005 after the death of Pope John Paul II, who served even as he suffered from the agonizing symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

The New York Times described Benedict as shy and bookish compared with John Paul, who was comfortable greeting entire stadiums full of devoted Catholics. The Times pointed out that souvenir shops in Rome still sell more postcards of Pope John Paul II than of Pope Benedict XVI. John Paul is on track to be named a saint by the Vatican.

## A Young Believer

Benedict was born Joseph Ratzinger to a policeman and a cook in Germany in 1927. At age 12, he entered the seminary, a training school for priests, but the outbreak of World War II interrupted his studies. He was required to join the youth arm of the Nazi party and was later drafted into the German army. He spent a short time in a prisoner of war camp and was released when the conflict ended. After the war, he returned to seminary and became a priest in 1951. It wasn't until he was elected Pope that he took the name Benedict.

Some called Benedict "God's Rottweiler," referring to the German breed of guard dog known for its fearsome determination. He earned this nickname for his strict refusal to compromise on modern issues such as allowing priests to marry, or allowing women priests.

## Who Will Be Pope?

Vatican watchers say the next pontiff will probably share many of the same opinions as Pope Benedict. That's because more than half of the cardinals who will vote for the new pope were appointed by Benedict himself.

But even if he thinks just like Benedict, the next pontiff may not look like him. Most of the growth in the Catholic population is coming from Africa and Latin America. Many believers say it is time for a non-European pope.

Two African cardinals – one from Ghana, the other from Nigeria – are considered to be top contenders for the papal throne. A Canadian cardinal is also seen as a front-runner.

## A Secret Vote

Choosing a new pope is a process called a "conclave," which is shrouded in secrecy and ancient traditions. All cardinals under the age of 80 can participate in the conclave, which is held in Rome. They are confined to the Vatican and forbidden contact with the outside world.

The voting process takes place in the stately Sistine Chapel. A candidate must receive at least two-thirds of the votes. The cardinals write their choices on paper ballots, which are burned in a stove after each round of voting. If black smoke appears from the chimney of the chapel, it means that they could not agree. They must keep voting until a winner is chosen, even if it takes a month or longer. When white smoke emerges from the chimney, it signals an agreement has been reached. The next pope is named.

Vatican experts say the new pontiff should be in place in time for Easter on March 31.
