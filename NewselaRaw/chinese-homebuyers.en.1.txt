LOS ANGELES — Alisha Chen first got into real estate 10 years ago. At the time, she didn't expect to become involved in a global housing market that is now transforming parts of California.

Then came the U.S. housing crash and a flood of Chinese money. Today she is part of a growing cottage industry among real estate agents, bankers and attorneys. They all specialize in helping wealthy Chinese buy a little patch of Southern California.

The job requires being part shrewd property scout and part cultural ambassador. It means being able to read the different tastes of buyers from Hong Kong versus those from mainland China. It means having to explain the differences between the cities of Irvine and Tustin to people who have never set foot in the United States.

## A Long Process In Many Ways

Chen sets aside a few hours just to explain the home-buying process to her clients. Many of Chen's clients own businesses and are successful in their native land — but that doesn't mean they understand how real estate sales work in the United States.

"In Taiwan you can still buy property on a napkin — here it's a book full of paperwork and timelines," she said. "There's a lot of education I have to do."

Then there's the matter of moving money from China to the United States.

China bars its citizens from transferring more than $50,000 a year out of the country. Many would-be buyers sidestep this rule by lining up friends to wire $50,000 apiece to an account in Hong Kong, where it can then be moved to a U.S. bank.

Others move the cash through businesses that have operations in both countries, or through some other third party.

For realtors, all this might mean not asking too many questions about how a million dollars is getting here.

For Chen, it leads to a lot of Skype calls in the middle of the night and a lot of missed sleep.

"Eleven p.m. to 2 a.m. — that's the best time to talk with my clients," she said.

## One Property Leads To Another, And Another

Chen — an Irvine real estate agent who was born in Taiwan — saw an opportunity about five years ago. The housing market in Southern California was flat on its back, but wealthy Chinese were looking to invest overseas. She started asking her local clients — many Chinese-American immigrants themselves — if they knew anyone back home who might be interested in buying a house here.

At first, overseas Chinese buyers were a little cautious and worried, she recalled. "They'd say, 'OK, I'll buy one property as an investment.' Six months later they were amazed at how much they were getting back, they'd call and say, 'I want to buy more.'"

Today, the trans-Pacific trade in Southern California real estate is big business. Chinese citizens bought $22 billion worth of homes in the United States in the 12 months that ended in March, according to estimates by the National Association of Realtors. And with its direct flights to China and large Asian communities, the Greater Los Angeles Area is their favorite destination.

Some are planning to emigrate and are buying homes for themselves; others are buying homes for rental income, or for their children to live in while they attend college. Neighborhoods throughout Southern California are being transformed as a result.

## Cruising The Neighborhood

It all begins with a process that's a little more complicated than what happens with your typical home sale.

While U.S. buyers are familiar with local neighborhoods and can explore the streets to get a feel for a place, a client from Shanghai or Shenzhen is limited to Internet searches and maybe a quick shopping trip. Many of Chen's investor clients buy homes sight unseen. As a result, she spends a lot of time talking buyers through the ins and outs of neighborhoods.

"They know Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Irvine," she said. "They say, 'Where's Tustin? Where's Lake Forest?' I tell them they're right next to Irvine."

Chen now employs eight people — who, combined, speak eight languages — to buy and manage properties. She has offices in Irvine, Chino and Taiwan. When she hears grumbling about Chinese money pricing out American home buyers, she notes that it helped revive the housing market, and that all those home sales keep people working at banks and title companies and contractors.

"This has created a lot of jobs," she said.

## How Long Can It Last?

However, even she is starting to wonder how much longer the flow of cash from across the Pacific will last. The Chinese government keeps making noise about clamping down on currency leaving the country. The U.S. government is talking about taxes on foreign investors, which could make buying here a little less attractive. Buyers are starting to get a bit spooked, and in any case, there are only so many of these deals she can do.

All that has Chen wondering what trend might come next, and fearing that home prices will soon begin to drop.

"I think I'm not going to be putting as much energy into this," she said. If home prices do begin to drop, her sales commissions will shrink, but, of course, there could be an upside for those with less cash.

"I think the next few years are going to be a good time for first-time buyers," she said.
