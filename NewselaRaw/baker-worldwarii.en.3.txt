INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev. â€” Baking helped save Ernie Feld's life.

Feld, a 90-year-old baker with a sweet, grandfatherly sense of humor, owns a tiny bakery called Ernie's International Pastries. He has been cooking up treats there for years.

When he was a young man, he was a prisoner in a German Nazi camp. The Nazis took control of much of Europe during World War II and killed millions of Jews.

More than 30 of Feld's family members died. His mother, Sara, was among them. Because they liked his food, though, the Nazis did not kill Feld. Instead, they made him work in the kitchen.

"Baking saved my life," Feld said. "If I wasn't a baker, I'd probably be dead."

## An Appetite For Life

Feld was born in 1925 in Czechoslovakia, a small country next to Germany that later was broken into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. His father died in an accident when he was young, and his mother supported their family by running a restaurant. Feld grew up watching her bake. Soon, he followed in her footsteps.

"When I was 14, I was always licking this and licking that," he remembered. "Mother would say, 'Are you eating again? I'm going to send you to baker's school.'"

He worked as a baker for the next three years. Then war broke out, and in 1942, Nazi soldiers began rounding up Jews. They were sent to camps, where millions were forced to work, or killed.

Feld was just 17 years old. He was sent by train to Hungary where he began work as a cook at a farm camp. Then a Nazi leader, who was looking for someone to cook for German officers at an airport the Nazis were building, heard he was a baker.

"He asked me, 'What can you cook?'" Feld remembered.

Feld was chosen for the job. He wrote up a list of the things he would need. The Nazis sent him into the city to shop, but made him wear a yellow armband to mark him as a Jew. The Nazis also sent a guard with him to make sure he couldn't escape.

## Baked Cannoli Like An Italian

Feld kept cooking for the German officers. They liked his food. His poppy-seed strudels were especially popular. The Nazis said Feld baked cannoli, an Italian dessert, like an Italian.

Feld asked for other Jewish prisoners to be allowed to work in the kitchen as well. This would keep them from having to do more difficult and dangerous jobs for the Nazis. He remembers how they stood around a huge table, rolling out their dough, feeling lucky to be alive.

By 1945, the war had turned against the Germans and they were on the run. Feld escaped and was saved by Russian troops. When he made it back home, he learned that his mother and younger brother, Alex, had been killed. Cousins, aunts and uncles had died, too.

## Triumphant Tale Of The Strudels

Feld eventually made his way to the San Francisco area, where he kept baking.

Now, at age 90, he is slowing down. He sits at a table near the glass case of treats as his wife, Marika, does the baking. Since breaking his leg in a fall five months ago, he often uses a walker and wheelchair.

Marika has taken over the baking, but the treats are the same ones that Feld has been making his whole life.

"I used to give her instructions," he said. "Now she orders me around."

As Feld opened a box of old pictures, Marika whispered something to him in Hungarian.

"She wants me to say that those Nazis are probably dead, but Ernie is still making his poppy-seed strudels," Feld translated, smiling.
