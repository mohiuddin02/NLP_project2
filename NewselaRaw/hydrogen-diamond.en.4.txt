Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. Elements are the basic building blocks of matter. On Earth, hydrogen is a gas. Scientists are now trying to make it a solid. They think it will look like a shiny, gray metal.

The scientists described their experiment in Nature. It is a magazine for scientists.

Stars are made almost entirely out of hydrogen. All living things are made out of hydrogen. Water is also made out of hydrogen. It is extremely lightweight.

## At Normal Temperatures, Hydrogen Remains A Gas On Earth

Some other things are known about hydrogen. It can become a liquid at extremely cold temperatures. Liquid hydrogen is used as rocket fuel. At high temperatures, it becomes a gas called plasma. It is also the simplest atom in the universe.

On Earth, hydrogen remains a gas. It never becomes a solid. That is not the case with other planets such as Jupiter. The planet is a gas giant. It contains huge amounts of hydrogen. It is under very high pressure and temperature. Hydrogen is a gas in Jupiter's atmosphere and a liquid and solid inside the planet.

Hydrogen helps us understand the stars and planets.

## Making Solid Hydrogen A Tough Task

In 1935, scientists thought they knew how to make solid hydrogen. They would have to use extreme pressure. The temperature, though, would have to be warm.

It was more difficult than scientists thought, said Philip Dalladay-Simpson. He is a scientist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He studies how materials behave under high pressure, high temperature and high strain. Dalladay-Smith is one of the scientists doing theÂ experiment.

The scientists had an idea about making solid hydrogen. They crushed hydrogen between diamonds. They are the same kind of diamonds used in diamond rings. The tips of the diamonds were polished to a very fine point. The points were about as wide as a human hair. The scientists kept the temperature at 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Yet, they put much pressure on the hydrogen. The pressure was greater than at the center of the earth.

## Next Time, Scientists Will Raise The Pressure

The hydrogen changed in important ways. Scientists think they made the first stage of solid hydrogen.

Next time, they will raise the pressure even more. Dalladay-Simpson said that should not be too hard.

Dalladay-Simpson said solid hydrogen could change technology. It could make electronics work better.
