SEATTLE â€” Curtis Morrison was homeless, had legal trouble and needed medicine after moving to Seattle from the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana.

The Chief Seattle Club helped him make the adjustment from living on the reservation to life in a big city. He's sober now and says the club helped him find a home and get medicine.

"Other places didn't know what I was talking about, and nothing would happen," said Morrison, who's 45. "It was hard, but I have opportunities and a new beginning."

Others like Morrison also go to the club's Urban Indian Legal Clinic for help.

## An Overlooked Community In Seattle

The service gives free advice and and legal help to [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american). It's available to all Native Americans, no matter their income or if they are members of the club.

Seattle has one of the highest populations of city Indians in the country, and the clinic provides a much-needed service for a community that's often overlooked, organizers say.

"It's about providing everyone that comes through the experience of understanding and knowing their rights," said Olive Lefferson, clinic coordinator and member of the Blackfoot Indian Tribe.

About seven of 10 Native Americans live in city areas such as Seattle, or 2.8 million people, according government figures. More than 1 million American Indians and Alaska Natives moved to metropolitan areas in the past 30 years.

Nearly 40,000 people in the Seattle area say they are American Indian or Alaska Native, according to the government. A quarter are poor, compared with one in 10 in the general population. They are also unemployed and homeless more often than other people in the general population.

## Far From Home And Family

Lefferson said the troubles of Native Americans can be worse in city areas, far from their families and tribes. Those who have lived in both worlds say city poverty is different from reservation poverty. That's because they don't have the support system that's common on reservations.

Twice a month, American Indians and Alaska Natives can come to the Chief Seattle Club and get help from lawyers. About half the cases are related to Native issues. Common ones are inheritance problems or trouble crossing over from the reservation.

When it's a criminal case, the clinic can send clients to a criminal attorney.

The lawyers come from different backgrounds but have one thing in common:  They have knowledge of Indian law and the Indian experience.

"For them to come to a safe place, with someone who has worked with Natives, is important," Lefferson said. "Otherwise, they might think someone won't understand them."

## An Issue Of Trust

The idea began at the end of 2006, according to Lael Echo-Hawk, who was president of the Northwest Indian Bar Association. The group wanted to help a population that keeps to itself and doesn't trust other mainstream opportunities. The Chief Seattle Club was a logical place, said Echo-Hawk, a Pawnee.

"As urban Indians, we know where to go and we know who the staff are," said Echo-Hawk, a Seattle lawyer. "Let's face it, if you have to meet with a lawyer, you are in a situation you don't want to be in, and it's uncomfortable. We wanted to help people solve problems."

Ralph Forquera said he sees Native clients with long legal records at the Seattle Indian Health Board. That often comes from poverty. Their crimes didn't happen because they chose a life of crime, said Forquera, who comes from the Juaneno Band of California Mission Indians. It could be petty theft or public drunkeness instead.

A city area also lacks the support base common on a reservation. Growing up on the Fond du Lac Reservation of Northern Minnesota, Dunlap never knew his family was poor. Lefferson's family didn't have running water on the Blackfoot Reservation, but everyone was poor.

"In reservation poverty, you always had an auntie to feed you," Dunlap said. "Urban poverty for Natives is different."

## Helping With Social Services

Along with isolation, the move to the city can shock a Native person who has lived before in an area where health care and education may be easier to reach. In the reservations, the government provides those services as agreed in treaties, said Chris Stearns. He is a Navajo lawyer who specializes in Indian law. In Seattle, those services are harder to find.

"When you come to the cities or urban areas, they're not there," said Stearns.

The legal clinic was one of the first in the nation, Echo-Hawk said. The clinic is self-sustaining and has been able to continue without as much involvement from other groups.

Dunlap said the Chief Seattle Club and the clinic are an example to follow.

"There's no other place like this in Indian Country," Dunlap said.

As Dunlap and Lefferson spoke at the club, a member with a beaded necklace and long gray hair walked in. Dunlap asked him how he slept the night before.

He said he slept good, but his back hurt. His bed had been a concrete sidewalk.
