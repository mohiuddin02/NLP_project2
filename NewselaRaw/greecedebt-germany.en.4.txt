LONDON â€” The country of Greece has borrowed a lot of money from many countries. Now it has to pay those countries back.

A new report says Greece should get help with the money it has to pay. This money is called debt. The report says that the other countries should forgive Greece's debt. The report says Greece should pay back only some of the money.

Germany has loaned Greece more money than any other country. It does not want to forgive Greece's debt.

## When Greece Helped Germany

That is odd because Germany knows it would help Greece. After World War II, Germany got help with its debt.

Who helped Germany then? Greece.

In 1953, Greece and about 20 other countries that won the war forgave much of Germany's debt.

They brought down the amount of money Germany owed. They gave Germany more time to pay them back.

Germany was able to pay when it had money. Other countries bought things from Germany. This way, Germany had money to pay them back.

Germany recovered. Now it is a rich country.

## Will Greece Get The Same Help?

It has been different for Greece. Greece has had to pay even though it has not had money. Its economy is weak.

Greece borrowed money from other countries. Now those countries cannot agree what to do about Greece's debts. Countries want all the money that was borrowed.

But now there are signs of change. On Sunday, there will be a meeting of European countries. They will try to decide how to help Greece. Maybe Greece will get the same help Germany got in 1953.
