CHICAGO â€” After dropping for many years, piano sales are coming back. Bob Frazier believes this and, even when people told him it was a crazy move, he opened a second piano store.

Many people told him the piano business was dying. Youngsters are not interested in pianos anymore, houses are too small for pianos, and electronic keyboards are taking over, they said. Frazier wanted to prove them wrong.

Frazierias the upbeat sales manager of Heavenly Pianos in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He and the owners have expanded to the nearby town of Winnetka.

Nearly a year later, the new store is running smoothly. The piano business is picking up,  Frazier said. Many families know the value and benefits of music, so the piano will survive and thrive, he said.

## Piano Sales A Barometer Of Improving Home Sales

Sales of pianos are growing as the economy gets better and more people buy homes. The economy measures the level of wealth and number of jobs a country has. Sales went up as the economy improved last year, after falling three years in a row.

Piano sales go up when home sales go up, said Larry Morton. He is president of Hal Leonard, a publisher of sheet music. People buy pianos like they buy other furniture, he said. It is part of the experience of having a house.

Piano sales dropped to their lowest ever during the recession that began in 2008. In a recession, businesses lose money and people lose homes and jobs, leading to unemployment. Sales are not back to where they were before, but sales people and those who tune pianos are hopeful.

## Online Sales Changing Piano Market

Piano sales are not dying, just changing, said Dennis Saphir. He is the former owner of Kurt Saphir Pianos, but he recently switched to selling online.

Saphir said there are too many used and digital pianos for sale. That cuts into sales of traditional, or acoustic, pianos. Websites like Craigslist and eBay have made buying used pianos cheap and easy.

Saphir closed his last showroom in April and switched to selling pianos online. The family business started in Vienna, Austria, in the early 1800s. He tried to keep it going after the recession started in 2008, but had to close his five showrooms.

The website of New Kurt Saphir Pianos says it takes the worry out of buying a used piano. Saphir checks out, tunes and repairs pianos, and even lists pianos other people are selling. Customers can shop for pianos from the comfort of home. There are now 22 pianos for sale on the site.

## Piano Still Popular

Saphir thinks people are still interested in music. Parents are still signing up their children for lessons, and adults still buy sheet music to play. Businesses have to figure out a place for the piano in people's homes, he said. Today's parents want their children to learn music, but they don't really want to buy a new piano, he said.

Holly Kennedy said more of her students want to learn piano than any other instrument. She has been a music teacher in Chicago for 16 years. Her students' ages run from 4 to 60. Kennedy said there is more interest in the piano, especially among adults. Many people played piano as children. Now that they have time and money, they want to take it up as a hobby, she said.

## Business Has Bounced Back

Thomas Zoells fell in love with the piano as a child growing up in Switzerland. He has never grown out of it. He is known as one of Chicago's biggest piano fans. Zoells opened his shop, PianoForte, and began selling expensive pianos in 2004. He struggled for years to make money.

The store opened with only four pianos and a desk. Today, it has three floors dedicated to the piano. Business has been steady and bounced back in the last three months.

He has faith that people will keep falling in love with the piano.

"There's a lot of reasons to be negative," Zoells said. "But we do this because we think we can somehow turn the ship around. I think we already are."
