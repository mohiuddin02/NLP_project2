AUSTIN, Texas â€“ For some Hispanic students, getting a college degree can be hard. States are looking at ways to better help them.

Manuel Ramirez is an example of how difficult it can be.

His parents brought him to the United States illegally from Mexico when he was 8 years old. They worked cleaning houses and did odd jobs. The family made just enough money to live on. When he was older, they could not afford to pay $10,000 for him to study at the University of Texas at Austin.

Instead, Ramirez worked a lot of jobs to earn extra money. He colored hair at a spa and built fences at a ranch.

Last year, Ramirez earned a college degree. He now organizes workers to help them get better pay and working conditions.

He is also fighting against a proposed law. The bill would make it more expensive for immigrants without legal papers to go to college. Texas residents are able to pay lower costs to go to college in the state. If the bill becomes a law, the illegal immigrants would not be allowed to pay the lower cost.

"It's not even about immigration. Just make higher education affordable so all the people can get an education," Ramirez said. "If Texas is going to be competitive, it has to produce great minds and give them a job."

## Hispanic Population Is Growing

Hispanics are the only group whose percentage of the U.S. population is growing. However, in Texas and 24 other states, whites are at least twice as likely as Hispanics to have college degrees. States are beginning to see that difference as a serious problem.

More new jobs are being created for workers with college degrees. There are fewer jobs for high school graduates, let alone for high school dropouts.

"It's not just the Southwest. It's increasingly true across the country," said Steve Murdock. He is a professor at Rice University. Murdock has been arguing for decades that Texas and other states must do a better job of educating minorities, especially Hispanics. Otherwise, he said, employers will go overseas to find educated workers.

Republican Governor Greg Abbott talked about the issue this month. "If Texas is to remain the leader at creating jobs we must become the leader at educating our children," Abbott said.

## Businesses See Need, Establish New Programs

Two months ago, the Texas Association of Business rented a sign. It criticized low graduation rates at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Almost half of the students at the school are Hispanic.

Meanwhile, two companies saw they needed college-educated workers to replace people who were retiring. The companies were aircraft makers Lockheed Martin and Boeing. They helped create a program for local high school students. The program helps students work toward getting college degrees.

Teri Albrecht works with students at the University of Texas at Austin. She said applying for college can be especially tough for immigrant students. Many immigrants find out, for the first time, that they were not brought to the country legally.

"Their parents were protecting them, not telling them the full story," Albrecht said.

## Getting A College Degree Is Tough, But Possible

But even Hispanics who were born in the United States can have a hard time earning college degrees. They have not had the chance to get a good education, Murdock said.

Many Hispanic college students born in the United States have money problems. They need advice and help from people who are doing well in school, said Michael Soto. He is a professor at Trinity University in San Antonio who grew up near the Mexican border. He has degrees from Stanford and Harvard universities.

Soto said there are a number of proven programs for students from needy backgrounds.

"We know what works," Soto said.
