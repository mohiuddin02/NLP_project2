WASHINGTON — There was a famous march on Washington for civil rights 50 years ago this week. Tens of thousands of people from across the United States gathered in the nation's capital on Aug. 24 to remember that march. But they also said that there is more work to do to make the country fair for all.

The group assembled under blue skies around the base of the Lincoln Memorial. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech there 50 years ago. On Saturday, speaker after speaker said everyone needs to work to make sure that people of all races are treated equally and get along.

Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., was the only speaker from the 1963 march. He fired up Saturday's crowd. He pushed them to fight against a Supreme Court decision last June. The decision struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Passing that act was an important civil rights victory in the 1960s.

"I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala.," he told the crowd, referring to the 1965 "Bloody Sunday" march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. Protesters were brutally beaten back then on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. "I got arrested 40 times during the '60s, beaten and left bloodied and unconscious. But I'm not tired. I am ready to fight and continue to fight, and you must fight."

## T-Shirts And Protest Signs

Attorney General Eric Holder echoed his views. He said Saturday's event was "about far more than reflecting on our past."

The "struggle must, and will, go on in the cause of our quest for justice" until every American can exercise their right to vote, he said. It must continue until "all are treated equally and fairly in the eyes of the law."

The people around the Lincoln Memorial were celebrating. But they were also thinking about the past, and the future.

Many young people and adults wore T-shirts or buttons. Some carried signs protesting the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Martin's mother was cheered loudly when she appeared.

Emma Daniels, 70, wore a cap with buttons from the 1963 march. Daniels pointed to where she and other members of her Georgia church stood 50 years ago.

## Coming Together Peacefully

"I wanted my children to have the same feeling that I had — change," said Daniels. She said there has been a lot of change. "We're going forward, it's slow, but we're moving forward."

Daniels said she noticed a different atmosphere on Saturday than in the 1963 march. She said she remembers there being an air of concern then. Many of the 250,000 people who were there that day had traveled through the South. Whites and blacks were separate in the South back then. The people who had gone to the rally feared being stopped by police officers who did not like them.

"This is so much more relaxed than when we came up — like a family reunion," she said. Melanie Marshall, Daniels' daughter, said Saturday's event gave her a greater appreciation for the right to assemble.

"In Egypt, people are fighting and killing each other in the street," she said. "We're lucky to be able to come together like this, in a peaceful way."

## Obama Speech On Aug. 28

Darryl Simmons, 21, made the bus journey to Washington with fellow students from South Carolina's Claflin University. He said he "just wanted to relive history."

He said, "We're not exactly dealing with what happened 50 years ago, but there's stuff going on and we're here for justice." Simmons is president of Claflin's Young Democrats.

Wednesday is the March on Washington's official anniversary. Another large crowd is expected at the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28. President Barack Obama will speak at the spot where King made history.

Obama is the nation's first African-American president. He is expected to discuss the progress and problems the nation has faced in following King's dream. In [his speech](http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf), King said he dreamed that his children "will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."
