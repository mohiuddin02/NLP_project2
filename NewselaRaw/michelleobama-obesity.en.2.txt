WASHINGTON â€” More than three years ago Michelle Obama launched an anti-obesity campaign. She promised to tackle advertising for snacks, soft drinks, sugary cereals and fast food aimed at children. The foods have been blamed for making many American kids overweight, or even obese.

Since Obama launched "Let's Move!" in February 2010, White House officials have insisted that working with the food business is the only way to end childhood [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) in a generation. That is the first lady's goal.

She bluntly told executives "to step it up" to improve the foods they advertise for children, and to limit the amount of ads for less healthy foods.

And she promoted a set of guidelines that were drawn up for food companies to follow, if they wanted to. But when food and television fought those guidelines in 2011, the first lady went silent. The guidelines were then blocked in Congress.
## Eat Healthy, Exercise More Campaign

Nutrition supporters do not agree about how to control the food and beverage companies in what they sell to children. The companies spend about $1.8 billion each year selling their products to kids. Some of the foods and drinks contribute to obesity, experts say.

Obama has favored persuasion. She has praised companies that joined her campaign to encourage children to eat healthier food and exercise more. And she has avoided fights that could pit her against the companies.

Administration officials say she has had some notable successes. But some who see themselves as Obama's allies in the fight against obesity disagree. They believe her desire to create partnerships with industry kept her quiet when her voice would have counted most.

"The White House got cold feet," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. He supported the guidelines.

Food companies did support putting calorie information on restaurant menus. And the first lady rallied support for a 2010 law that expanded the [free school lunch program](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch). The law also set nutritional standards for food sold in schools.

But many public health advocates believe a more forceful approach is needed to limit the advertising of less healthy food. 
## TV Ads Influence Children

Obama has worked through the Partnership for a Healthier America. The organization was set up to get pledges from food providers to fight childhood obesity. Companies have agreed to improve children's menus and cut calories.

But it has received only a few pledges to change the way companies advertise food. As she stepped up her campaign, the first lady rged companies to limit advertising to kids.

A report by the Institute of Medicine found in 2005 that television advertising influenced children to look for unhealthy foods.

"This is one of the easiest areas where we could take action and have a very powerful effect," said Dale Kunkel. He studies the effect of advertising on children.

Congress approved a measure in 2009 to set up a group to write voluntary nutrition standards for products advertised to children. The White House monitored the group's progress. So did the food industry.

General Mills Chief Executive Kendall Powell met with White House officials. In a letter in September 2010, he argued that no evidence linked obesity to advertising by the food companies. General Mills sells cereals like Cheerios, Trix and Franken Berry.

Powell suggested the group should "be put on hold" while food companies improved the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative. That is the advertising standards plan the industry set up in 2006.
## Fight Over Guidelines For Ads

Still, the group released its guidelines in April 2011. Foods advertised to children should have minimal levels of sugar, salt and fat, and make a "meaningful contribution" to diets by containing nutrients. The group said its standards should apply to all ads aimed at children 17 and younger.

Public health supporters such as the American Academy of Pediatrics praised the guidelines. But food makers and television companies fought them.

A July 2011 meeting at the White House included Powell and top executives from Nestle, Kellogg, Disney, Time Warner and the Nickelodeon network. The companies all supported the first lady's anti-obesity initiative. But they opposed the group's guidelines.

Two days later, top food makers rolled out a tougher version of their own effort. The companies pledged to limit the levels of sugar, salt and fat in products targeted at children.

The industry program does not do everything that the group proposed. It does not limit sponsorships of after-school events or on product packages. And it applies only to foods advertised on programs for which at least 35 percent of the viewers are children under 12.
## Cartoon Character Popsicle

Half the food and drink ads seen by children in 2011 were not covered by the pledge because they aired on shows, such as "Family Guy," that are seen by both children and adults, a Yale study said.

Obama promoted Nickelodeon's "Worldwide Day of Play" in September 2011 by attending an event hosted by the network.

The Popsicle company paid Nickelodeon to the SpongeBob SquarePants name and image. It sells frozen pops in the shape of the cartoon character. Nickelodeon aired a quarter of the food ads viewed by children ages 2 to 11 in 2011, according to a study.

Four Democratic senators recently asked that Nickelodeon set stricter nutrition standards for the products it advertises, but the network declined the request.
