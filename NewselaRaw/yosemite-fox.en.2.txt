The incredibly rare Sierra Nevada red fox was recently spotted in Yosemite National Park. The sightings are the first in nearly 100 years.

The red fox is one of 14 animals protected by California. It was seen on motion-sensitive cameras on Dec. 13 and Jan. 4. The cameras begin recording only when they detect movement. Park officials are still trying to determine whether the cameras took pictures of the same fox or different ones.

"The chance of running into them is very unusual," park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said.

## Hunting Them Is Off Limits

California's Sierra Nevada red fox is one of the most endangered animals in North America. Fewer than 50 of them even exist. It is against the law to hunt or trap them.

The last time a red fox was seen at Yosemite was in 1915, Cobb said.

The shy creatures avoid humans. They burrow in soil and logs at an elevation of 6,000 feet, according to the park's website.

Little is known about the reddish-orange colored foxes because they are so rarely seen.

In 1990, video of a Sierra Nevada red fox were taken in the Lassen National Forest. The forest is in California, north of Yosemite.

Wildlife scientists were determined to photograph the fox again and placed cameras in Tioga Pass, just east of Yosemite. A red fox had been seen at the Tioga Pass years earlier. A pass is the high point of a route through a mountain range.

Then, in August 2010, a Sierra Nevada red fox was finally videotaped. It was seen at the Sonora Pass, north of Yosemite. The fox was taped biting on a bag containing chicken scraps.

University of California scientists discovered saliva on the bag. They studied the spit and determined that it came from a Sierra Nevada red fox.

## Fox Hair Snares

Two years ago, Cobb and her husband spotted one of the foxes at the Sonora Pass.

"They are extremely cute little animals," she said. "When you see them, they are pretty majestic."

Researchers will continue using video cameras to look for the Sierra Nevada red fox. Hair snare stations have also been set up near the cameras. Hair snares are traps that catch animal hair. If the scientists find hair from a red fox, they will study it to learn more about the fox and determine whether it is related to the fox at the Sonora Pass.

The Yosemite sighting, Cobb said, is a good sign.

Yosemite is huge and wild. The park's remote areas might give the fox protection to "make a comeback," Cobb said.
