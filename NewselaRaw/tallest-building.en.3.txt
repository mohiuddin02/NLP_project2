A group of building experts gave it that honor on Tuesday. It beat out a building in Chicago called the Willis Tower.

The Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat made the decision. It had to decide how to measure the building. The tower in New York has a cone on top called a spire. The spire does not have glass around it like the rest of the building, and some people say it is just decoration.

They say it is not part of the building. So the experts had to decide if the spire counted in the building's overall height.

The building is 1,776 feet high with the spire. The spire makes it taller than the Willis Tower, which used to be called the Sears Tower. At 1,451 feet, the Chicago building had been the country's tallest building since it was completed in 1974.

## A Patriotic Height

The height also means something special. The United States became a country in 1776 and the new World Trade Center is 1,776 feet tall. It takes the place of the old World Trade Center. The twin towers were destroyed in a terror attack in 2001.

The people who designed the new building wanted to send a message with the height. The message was about patriotism and getting back up again. They wanted to show that New York wasn't afraid to build an even bigger building where the old buildings fell.

The Council on Tall Buildings was founded in 1969. Its job is decide when a tall building counts as a skyscraper. Designers have become more creative in how antennae and other equipment on top of new skyscrapers are built.

So the council has had to decide whether the equipment should count toward a building's overall height.

## "Something Special"

That was the case with the new building in lower Manhattan. The building is called One World Trade Center. It replaced the towers destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The old towers stood at 1,368 feet. Questions about the new building's height were raised last year, after the architects changed the design. They removed material that was to have enclosed the 408-foot spire sticking out from the top.

"It seemed to have sort of been stripped down to the skeleton," said Daniel Safarik. He is part of the council.

Art Bell is an architect. He said height matters when you make a building. People want to be able to look down and see a lot of the world.

"There's something special about being high up," he said.
