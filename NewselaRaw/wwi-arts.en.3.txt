NEW YORK â€” In the summer of 1914, American writer Henry James knew that something had been lost forever.

World War I was just two weeks old at the time. James was living in London. He wrote to a friend that he was "sick beyond cure" to have lived to see the war. Through the years, he wrote, he thought he had seen the worst become impossible but the war changed that.

"It seems to me to undo everything, everything that was ours, in the most horrible retroactive way," he wrote.

James died in 1916, two years before the end of the war. The wreckage of World War I was worse than even James could have imagined. Millions were dead and things people had believed for centuries no longer seemed true.

## Art Despaired Of War Itself

Long wars destroy the worlds in which they begin. World War I, which began 100 years ago this month, destroyed it completely and terribly.

Among writers, World War I changed both the stories they told and how they told them. Artists were inspired. They produced great paintings, music and movies.

In the 19th century, people believed in progress through technology, said Jan Schall, an art historian. World War I turned this upside down.

"You had mass death through mass technological warfare," he said. Cannons and machine guns were brutally efficient and deadly in trench warfare.

World War I was also different because of the art it inspired. The art despaired of war itself. Both winners and losers despaired too. Before World War I, writers often treated war as a way for men to prove themselves. This dated back to ancient Greece. World War I changed that.

Wars today are justified on the grounds of self-defense or human rights. Today, nobody argues "that war itself is a splendid achievement or the true calling of men," wrote essayist Adam Kirsch.

## The Dream Destroyed

Writers on both sides of the Atlantic at first cheered on the battle. Carl Sandburg's "Four Brothers" hailed the "Ballplayers, lumberjacks, ironworkers, ready in khaki / A million, ten million, singing, 'I am ready.'"

The war destroyed the dream.

American painter John Singer Sargent spent time at the front. His 20-foot-long painting "Gassed" shows blinded soldiers marching. A gas attack had burned their eyes.

T.S. Eliot's "The Hollow Men" sketches a ravaged scenery:

_In this valley of dying stars_

_In this hollow valley_

_This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms_

_In this last of meeting places_

_We grope together_

_And avoid speech_

_Gathered on this beach of the tumid river_  
Soldiers returned injured, traumatized and bewildered. Writer Gertrude Stein called these soldiers a "lost generation."

Ernest Hemingway's short story "Soldier's Home" tells of a man named Krebs. He returns from the war and finds that no one in his community wants to hear what really happened over there.

"Krebs found that to be listened to at all he had to lie and after he had done this twice he, too, had a reaction against the war and against talking about it," Hemingway wrote. "A distaste for everything that had happened to him in the war set in because of the lies he had told."

## Modernist Artists Inspired By War

The war proved that everything was fleeting, said Doran Cart, a curator of the National World War I Museum in Kansas City. "The art world reflected it," he said.

The modernist artists, for example, questioned whether a book needed a beginning, middle and end, or whether a song needed a melody.

"The war itself was so modern and changed how people saw their communities and saw each other," said Cart.

Oddly enough, one of the war's most famous pictures was not a protest. It was a call to service.

In 1917, the U.S. government asked artist James Montgomery Flagg to make a poster that would make young people want to join the Army. He drew a red-cheeked man with a starred top hat and white goatee. The face was based in part on Flagg himself.

He added a simple tagline: "I Want YOU For U.S. Army." The line was shortened in popular memory to "UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU."
