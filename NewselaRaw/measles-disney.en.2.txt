SANTA ANA, Calif. — As an outbreak of measles spreads in California, health officials in the state ordered about two dozen students at one high school to stay home until they could prove they have been vaccinated against the disease.

The current spread of measles is the worst outbreak in California in 15 years, health officials said. There are now more than 70 patients across California, six other states, and Mexico. It all started at Disneyland, in Orange County.

At Huntington Beach High School in Southern California, one student came back from winter break with the disease. To prevent its spread, the two dozen or so students were kept at home. Public health officials said they would take the same action at other schools if measles turn up.

## Measles Spreads Like Wildfire

Measles causes a rash that first appears on the head and then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms include fever, red eyes and a runny nose. Spread by coughing and sneezing, measles can be contagious four days before the rash appears and four days after.

There is a vaccine — a shot — that prevents measles for the majority of people who get it. Most young people get two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and polio.

Orange County health authorities explained that students who are not immunized — students who never got the shot — are at risk to get measles, and to spread it.

"If there is a case in the school and their child is not immunized, they will be removed from the school for 21 days," said Dr. Eric Handler, the Orange County public health officer. "From an epidemiological standpoint, in order to prevent spread of the disease, this is a necessary measure."

Epidemiologists study public health and how diseases spread. The measles vaccine is highly effective and safe, experts say. Still, some parents choose not to give their children that shot, and others, because of personal beliefs.

## "The Vaccine Is Safe"

In Orange County, California, for example, there are some wealthy communities where a higher-than-average number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their kids.

This is a serious problem when 8 percent or more of a group of people are not vaccinated, experts say.

Statewide, only 3.1 percent of kindergartners are unvaccinated. In some Southern California communities, though, the number is much higher.

At S. A. Moffett Elementary, 10 percent were not vaccinated as of 2013. At Huntington Seacliff Elementary, it was 11 percent. Both schools are in the Huntington Beach City School District in Orange County.

Since 2002, more and more kindergartners in California have been starting school without the usual vaccinations. Some parents are suspicious of the shots, worrying that they cause autism. Many scientific reports have conclusively shown that they do not.

"The vaccine is safe," Handler said. "We can prevent this disease if people get vaccinated."

## One Sick Person Can Lead To Dozens

It has been decades since schoolchildren were kept home from school because of disease and vaccination worries. Some public health experts say it is time to do that again.

Measles is very infectious: it spreads through the droplets from a sneeze or cough. One sick person walking through a group of unvaccinated people can infect a dozen or more of them.

"If the rate of unimmunized is as high as it seems to be, you're going to get more cases, and then you're going to get more spread from those," said Dr. James Cherry, a UCLA pediatric infectious diseases researcher.

The measles vaccine has been around since 1963 in the United States. Still, there were major outbreaks of the disease nationwide in 1976-77 and 1989-91.

In 1977, about 50,000 students in Los Angeles County were told to stay home from school. These students either had to get the shot, or prove they had gotten it before. Within days, most returned to school, and the number of measles cases dropped quickly.

Today, facing a measles outbreak, some parents are reconsidering their decision to not vaccinate their children.

## Vaccine Concerns

One mother, at Mariners Park in Newport Beach, said she chose what shots to give to her 2 1/2-year-old daughter. Instead of following official recommendations, she took the advice of "The Vaccine Book" by Dr. Robert Sears, which skips or delays some shots.

"I didn't want to flood her system with a bunch of chemicals all at once. I wanted to be informed and not trust what medical professionals said," said the mother, Stephanie, who asked that her last name not be used.

The outbreak worries her, though, and she said she is going to get her daughter vaccinated next month. "It was a hard decision," she said.

Some parents who vaccinated their children are concerned by the risk caused by unvaccinated children.

"It scares me," Julie Angus said while walking her preschooler Mia, 4, and first-grader Gabriel, 6, home from school.

"They're making a decision for their child that affects other children. I personally feel that if that's your choice you should home-school your child," Angus said.

## It Could Spread Internationally

The current measles outbreak began at Disneyland a week before Christmas, public health officials said. The theme park attracts visitors from all over the world, including places in Europe and Asia where measles is still a serious problem.

Since then, the disease has continued to spread.

Five of the diagnosed measles patients were Disneyland employees. Two of those have been vaccinated, health officials said. Investigators are still looking into whether the other workers were vaccinated.
