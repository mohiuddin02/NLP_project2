WASHINGTON â€” U.S. passports allow Americans to travel to other countries. They list a person's place of birth.

Say you were born in Paris. Then you moved to the United States. Your U.S. passport would list your country of birth as France.

It is not as simple for Americans born in Jerusalem, however. The problem is that Israelis and Palestinians argue over Jerusalem.

Israel controls the city now. It says the city should always be part of Israel. Palestinians do not yet have their own country, but they want one. They say East Jerusalem should belong to them.

In 2002 a new passport law was passed. Lawmakers in Congress in Washington, D.C., were the ones to make the law. It declared that Americans born in Jerusalem would be able to list their birthplace as Israel.

On Monday, the Supreme Court struck that law down. The Supreme Court is the top court in the United States.

The Supreme Court has nine judges. The court ruled 6-3 to strike down the law. It said that Congress went too far when it passed the law in 2002.

The law went against the White House's position on Jerusalem. The White House does not want Americans born in Jerusalem to list Israel as their birthplace.

## President Has Power Over Passports, Court Says

The U.S. government does not recognize any country's control over Jerusalem. It wants to wait until Israelis and Palestinians settle their disagreement.

Justice Anthony Kennedy is one of the Supreme Court judges. He voted to strike down the law. He said that the president is the only person with the power to recognize other countries. Recognizing a country means accepting that country's right to own an area of land.

The president's power covers passports as well, Kennedy argued. It includes the right to decide what a passport says.

The United States "must speak with one voice" when it comes to recognition, Kennedy wrote. "That voice must be the president's."

Monday's ruling ends a 12-year-old court case. The case was started by Menachem Zivotofsky and his parents. Menachem is an American who was born in Jerusalem 12 years ago. His parents wanted Menachem's passport to say he was born in Israel.

Three of the judges disagreed with the court's ruling. Justice Antonin Scalia said that both Congress and the president should share the power of recognition. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito also disagreed with the ruling.

Roberts said the court's ruling sets a very bad example. The court has taken a dangerous step, Roberts wrote. It is allowing the president to overrule an act of Congress.

## Israelis, Palestinians Argue Over Who Controls City

Israelis and Palestinians have argued over Jerusalem for years. Israel has controlled the entire city since it took East Jerusalem in a war in 1967. It has said that a united Jerusalem will be the country's capital forever. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of the new country they hope to form.

Congress and the White House have also argued over Jerusalem for years.

The White House does not recognize Israel's control over all of Jerusalem. It believes the United States should wait until Israelis and Palestinians settle their differences. Congress has often sided with Israel, however. For years, it has tried to get U.S. presidents to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

In 2002, Congress approved the passport law. For the first time, Americans born in Jerusalem were allowed to list Israel as their place of birth. The law has not been used since then, however.

President George W. Bush approved the 2002 law. However, at the time he said that the U.S. position on Jerusalem "has not changed." Obama has said the same thing.
