DUBLIN â€” Ireland and the U.K. are firing the first shots in Europe's latest war on tobacco, but the battle may ultimately end up being fought in court by lawyers.

Last week, Ireland became the first country in Europe to pass a law forcing cigarette manufacturers to use plain packaging. Now, cigarettes sold in Ireland will come in olive green packets dominated by images of damaged lungs. They'll no longer feature the large brand logos that make them so recognizable, and appealing, to young people.

As the U.K. races to follow Ireland's lead, four of the world's biggest tobacco companies are preparing to take legal action. The lawsuit on the horizon may decide the fate of cigarette packaging across the entire European Union. Its timing is less than ideal for the $780 billion tobacco industry. Cigarette companies are already struggling with falling smoking rates in the U.S. and Europe.

"I have a message for the tobacco industry," said James Reilly, the Irish government minister behind the new law. "They come to pursue us, but they must understand we will win, and we will pursue them for all our costs. They may have billions behind them, but we have the truth and the people on our side."

## Bigger WARNINGS

Within two years, cigarette boxes in Ireland will be standardized, with the health warning doubled to 65 percent of the surface area. Ireland is following the example of Australia, the first country in the world to make such a move.

Since 2012, Australia has kept tobacco companies from using brand logos, colors or promotional text on their packaging. The move is being challenged at the World Trade Organization, the group that decides trade rules between countries. Yet the threat of a court battle didn't stopped Ireland from pursuing its similar law.

Likewise, the U.K. is still plowing ahead. Lawmakers in the lower chamber of Parliament, the House of Commons, have already backed a plain tobacco packaging law and the U.K.'s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, will vote on the proposed law on Monday.

Tobacco companies said they would challenge the U.K. law, which is scheduled to come into effect next year.

"I'd expect a long, hard-fought legal battle ahead," said Foster Corwith. He helps oversee about $36 billion in investments at Causeway Capital LLC in Los Angeles, including shares of stock in British American Tobacco Plc.

P.J. Carroll, Ireland's oldest tobacco firm, said it considers the legislation illegal in that the Irish government would effectively be taking property from companies without compensation. Japan Tobacco Inc. calls the new standards unlawful and unjustified, complaining that there is no "evidence to suggest (they) will result in public health benefits." Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco Group Plc. are also preparing to take legal action.

## "The Biggest Single Threat"

Ireland has a history of setting the tone on tobacco regulation. In 2004, the nation banned smoking in bars and restaurants, a move widely followed in Europe and the U.S. According to Bloomberg data, the number of Irish adults who smoke has dropped to about 23 percent, though that's still above the global rate of 20 percent.

"Plain packaging is the biggest single threat to the cigarette industry," said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea. He says that taking away a producer's ability to set its brand apart from the competition severely reduces pricing power.

It isn't just tobacco companies that are worried by the new rules.

John Cridland is the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, which represents U.K. employers. Cridland says he has concerns about the policy's impact on the U.K.'s global reputation for protecting intellectual property. "Customers identify with brands, so companies are understandably uneasy at the prospect of a key part of their identity being undermined," he says.

Should the courts decide plain packaging is unjustified, the government may have to pay the cigarette makers for any losses.

With support from people across Ireland, the possibility of losing a court battle is a risk that the Irish government is willing to take.
