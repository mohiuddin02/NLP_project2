GLEN ELLYN, Ill. â€” Daniela Polencheck was just a toddler when her life changed.

Two-year-old Daniela was walking with her older siblings in Colombia, the South American country where she grew up. She let go of her sister's hand and darted into the street. A drunk driver hit her, never slowing down or stopping the car. After the accident, Daniela lost the use of her hips and legs.

Now 15, Daniela is in her first year of high school at Glenbard West near Chicago, Illinois. She said the experience has given her strength in her new country.

"I could feel sorry for myself for the rest of my life," Daniela said. "Or I could accept being in a wheelchair and try to make the best of it."

## They Overcame Tough Times

Daniela told her story as part of a class project in her English as a learned language class. The class teaches English to students from other countries.

This fall, the teens wrote stories about the toughest moments they have faced in life. They put their stories together into a big book they called the "Book of Challenges."

The students dedicated the book to the library at Hadley Junior High School, which several of them had attended. Recently, they returned to share their stories with students there from different countries.

Bruno Borges, 15, liked sharing his story with the younger students. "It was fun to tell the kids that everyone has to pass through obstacles," he said.

The 13 students in Daniela's class are from many countries. They include India, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Myanmar, Brazil, Guatemala and Colombia.

## Many Stories To Share

The idea for the project started after the students read "A Long Walk to Water" by Linda Sue Park. The story is about an 11-year-old child from Sudan in Africa. The child has to leave home and travel around Africa finding safe places to live. Some students told their own stories of being in refugee camps. A refugee camp is where some people live temporarily when their homes or villages become unsafe.

"I wanted them to feel empowered," said teacher Sarah Hoisington, who is in charge of the project. Hoisington wants her students to see that the skills they have learned to overcome hardship are important. These skills do not just help them in school, but will help them for the rest of their lives.

## "You Need To Be Confident"

Noushin Ajmeri is from India. Her family moved to the United States two years ago. She said she had to adjust to how differently American girls behaved.

"I felt embarrassed that the girls wore shorts in the summer, and talked and hug boys," said Noushin, 14. She said that in India girls do not often talk to boys or speak up much. It was a big shock for Noushin. "But after two or three months, I started to speak English and I got used to it. I don't think their way is wrong. It's your choice to do what you want," she said.

Bruno has moved to a new country twice. He is originally from Sao Paulo, Brazil. He and his family moved to Sweden when he was 7. They returned to Brazil for several years and then moved to the United States this summer. "Here, at least I knew a little English," Bruno said about the move to the United States. "You need to be confident and you need to expect the best of yourself."

His advice for moving to a new country is to be social and talk to a lot of people. Even though that can be hard, he said he has made lots of new friends in America.
