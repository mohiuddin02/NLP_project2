WASHINGTON â€” The winners of upcoming U.S. Senate races could depend as much on where some candidates live as on how they vote.

Residency controversies are following Senate candidates in several key states: Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana and New Hampshire. Some of the candidates list Washington, D.C., not the states that elect them, as their home addresses. Others moved into their states only recently, prompting criticism that they're just using the states as a way to get into the Senate. The outcome of the residency issue could determine whether Republicans or Democrats control the Senate.

This comes at a time when it's particularly toxic for a politician to look and sound too much like a Washington politician. Just about 14 percent of voters have a favorable view of Congress. In contrast, roughly 70 percent of voters think the country is on the wrong track.

Sarah Binder is an expert on Congress and legislative politics at the Brookings Institute, a Washington think tank and research institute. The charge that lawmakers have lost touch with the concerns of people in their districts rings true for many voters, she said.

"Voters don't like to be forgotten, and challengers are eager to find ways to put incumbents on the defensive," she said. An incumbent politician is the current office holder.

## Where Do You Call Home?

Already this year, the out-of-touch charge helped topple House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, who seemed more interested in Washington than in his district. He lost a primary election this year to a little-known opponent, professor David Brat. Two years ago, a similar controversy helped end the 36-year Senate career of Republican Richard Lugar from Indiana.

Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas faces re-election this year. He has struggled to answer questions about where he calls home. He told a radio interviewer he returns to Kansas whenever someone decides to run against him for his Senate seat.

The senator does not own a home in Kansas. He was registered to vote at the home of a person in his district, where, Roberts said, he paid rent.

The issue surfaced again last week during a debate. "I suspect, senator, I've been to Dodge City more times this year than you have," said challenger Greg Orman, who is running as an independent candidate. He said he'd been to Roberts' hometown four times recently. Roberts interrupted that he'd been there seven times recently.

Similar controversies have surfaced elsewhere.

## Alaska

Dan Sullivan, the Republican former state attorney general who's challenging Democratic Senator Mark Begich, moved to the state 17 years ago. Sullivan went to Washington in 2002 to work for the National Security Council, but kept his home in Alaska and returned to the state in 2009.

"Dan's a Marine whose service to his country has taken him throughout the world," said campaign spokesman Mike Anderson. For Begich to attack him "for his service is not only wrong, but it's a direct affront to the servicemen and women who also call Alaska home," Anderson said.

## Arkansas

Republican Representative Tom Cotton, who's in a neck-and-neck race for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor, doesn't own property in the state. He does point out that he is a sixth-generation Arkansan and lives in a home his father owns. Cotton filmed a television ad in front of that house, where he pledges, "I'll stay connected to my roots."

Pryor features his father, David Pryor, a former governor and senator, in an ad to show his ties to the state.

## Louisiana

Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu is in a close re-election fight. She is facing criticism for maintaining a luxurious home in Washington. She lists the Washington address as her home on her statement of candidacy filed Aug. 11 with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

Republicans tried to get her off the ballot, saying she didn't fulfill residency requirements, which say a candidate has to live in the state he or she wants to represent. But a Louisiana judge dismissed this last week. Landrieu said she still lived in Louisiana. She, her siblings and their mother jointly own the family home in New Orleans where she grew up.

## Mississippi

In his statement of candidacy with the FEC, Republican Senator Thad Cochran listed his address as 218-A Maryland Ave. in Washington. In February, in a new filing, he listed his address as Oxford, Mississippi, where he owns a home.

Republican primary challenger Chris McDaniel based his campaign on Cochran being too much at home in Washington. McDaniel promised that, if elected, he would return to the state frequently. Cochran fought back by citing the projects he'd obtained for the state during his four decades in Congress. Cochran won.

## New Hampshire

Scott Brown represented Massachusetts in the Senate from 2010 until 2013. Now he's running for the Senate in neighboring New Hampshire.

Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who is running against Brown in New Hampshire, is reminding voters of his recent switch. "This is my home. This is where my kids grew up," she has said. "My goal has been to serve the people of New Hampshire, not to serve myself."

## Kansas

Back in Kansas, Roberts spent a total of 97 days from July 2011 to August 2013 in the state, according to his Senate records.

Clay Barker, the Kansas Republican Party executive director, said this shouldn't be an issue for voters. "If you send a guy to Washington, D.C., to work for you there, do you want him always back in Kansas watching TV?" Barker said. "His workplace is D.C."

The controversy lingers. "I think the residency will haunt him all the way up through Election Day," said Bob Beatty, a professor of political science at Washburn University in Topeka. "It's just like a ghost that won't go away."
