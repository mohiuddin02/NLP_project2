Electric eels can use their zapping power in surprising and sophisticated ways. A new study finds that when dealing with large or struggling prey, these eels bend their bodies into a horseshoe-like shape. Doing that more than doubles the voltage they deliver to their almost-meal.

The discovery was made by biologist Kenneth Catania. His findings shed new light on the abilities of these remarkable hunters.

"Even an animal that's been studied for centuries may be doing amazing things that we were unaware of," said Catania.

Catania has been studying these eels for a while. Earlier, he discovered they can "remote control" their prey: The animals send out a jolt of electricity that forces hidden fish to twitch and thus reveal their location.

## Eels Reposition Stunned Prey

Once the eels shock their prey, they reposition it in the water so they can swallow it head-first. In that brief moment, the fish has its only chance to swim off and avoid becoming an eel meal. Of course, it can do that only if it is able to withstand the electric attack.

During his research, Catania started to notice something odd: Many of the eels would curl up their bodies when zapping a meal, bringing their head toward their tail with the fish in between. Then they would release the fish to reposition it before gobbling it down.

Catania observed that younger, smaller eels with less shocking power curled up frequently during their electric attacks. More massive, adult eels almost never bothered to do so. The only time they did was when they were trying to subdue particularly difficult prey, such as a large crayfish. Such prey took the eel extra time to properly reposition before they could begin swallowing.

## Curled Body Strengthens Power

The eels' electricity-producing organ has both a positive and a negative end, just like a magnet. The positive end is at the head and the negative end is in the tail. Perhaps by curling their bodies the eels were bringing the opposing ends of that organ closer together to concentrate the stunning power, Catania thought.

Such a strengthening effect can be seen with a curved horseshoe magnet. The magnetic field is stronger in a horseshoe magnet than in a straight bar magnet because the positive and negative poles are close together. The two ends work together to produce a stronger magnetic force than one end alone could.

## Scientist's Hunch Confirmed

Catania decided to design an experiment to find out if his hunch was correct. He took a brain-dead fish equipped with electricity-conducting electrodes and put it near an eel as bait. Then, he measured the voltage applied when the eel attacked. Sure enough, the fish received more than double the voltage when the eel curled its body, bringing the opposite ends of its electricity-generating organ together.

After curling its body, the eel would batter the prey's body with a series of shocks until the fish reached exhaustion. In effect the animal was paralyzed temporarily, making it safe for the eel to release and reposition it.

Catania still wants to explore one basic and perplexing question: How does the eel avoid shocking itself?

Scientists have not yet figured out how eels can "protect their nervous system and their own brain and their own muscles" from being damaged by electricity, Catania said. "It's pretty much an open question."
