RIO DE JANEIRO — The 2016 Summer Olympics will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Recently, Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, visited the site of what will become Olympic Park. She promised that the games would be a great success — or, as she put it, "the Olympics of all Olympics."

The president said the Olympics would benefit from Brazil's experience organizing the World Cup soccer tournament. The final match of the Cup took place in Rio in July 2014. Brazil's handling of the Cup drew praise from hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists.

However, memories of what happened in Rio during the buildup to the Cup terrify some Brazilians. The most anxious are those who live in poor communities known as favelas, which dot many of Rio's hillsides.

## Overlooked Human Cost

The World Cup went more smoothly than expected — but not for favela residents.

Many live in the path of planned building projects connected to the two mega-sporting events. For them, the result has been forced evictions from their homes or, for those who remain, the decay of their community.

Favela do Metro is located just 300 yards from the Maracana soccer stadium, which will host Olympic games. It reflects the sometimes overlooked human cost of playing host to huge sporting events.

In Favela do Metro, rats roam freely and mounds of garbage and old furniture pile up. Fragments of walls and floors that were violently ripped out of homes remain scattered about.

Brazilian officials started evicting Favela do Metro residents by force during the lead-up to the World Cup. Homes in the decades-old favela were torn down. Officials claimed that the area needed to be massively upgraded in preparation for the World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.

## Massively Upgraded? Or Bombed?

Then midway through the process, the tearing down of houses stopped and the community was left to decay.

Rusty, metal wires now stick out of 6-foot-high piles of rubble. Sofa cushions, tires and old clothes litter a neighborhood that looks like it has been bombed. Residents no longer even have running water — a dramatic contrast to the lush, heavily watered playing field at the nearby Maracana stadium.

Side-by-side homes are in varying states of disrepair. Laundry hangs outside one, while one next to it has a shattered top floor but people still living on the lower level, and a third home has been destroyed.

A desperate cry for help is scrawled on a wall: "We are not animals to be discarded in this way."

Favela do Metro isn't the only poor community to suffer.

## Protests And Suspicions

Recently, residents of Vila Uniao took to the streets in protest. Homes in their favela had been knocked down to allow for the construction of a new rapid bus system.

The community of Vila Autodromo lies within the planned Olympic Park. It too has protested over forced evictions.

What happened in Favela do Metro, though, stands out for its harshness.

One result of the way in which Favela do Metro has been neglected is that many newcomers have moved in, despite the terrible conditions. Some are drug dealers.

Favela do Metro's abandonment has raised suspicions. Some believe it is part of a larger Brazil government plan to clear out the poor before real estate developers move in.

"The city takes any chance there is to remove people," said Theresa Williamson, who runs an organization assisting favelas. The city's goal is to "create opportunities for real estate construction."

## City Officials Upbeat

Rio de Janeiro city officials offer a more positive picture of events in Favela do Metro.

A city spokeswoman called what has happened there "resettlements," adding that residents consented and had plenty of notice. Many were moved to public housing, while others who gave up their homes received money from the city, she said.

However, both residents here and other witnesses deny those claims.

The evictions, which started in 2010, and continued through this year, were violent and involved police, they say. "Most families did not know until the day, and were forced onto a bus," said Williamson, who has been following the process.

## "We Are Prisoners"

The city said the evictions were necessary because a large parking lot needed to be built near Maracana before the World Cup. However, no new parking lot was ever built in the area.

Relocated families were sent across town, to an area at least two hours away by bus. Those who resisted eviction were moved to nearby public housing.

Since then, conditions have been getting worse for those who remain in Favela do Metro. Barbara Cabral Souza, 38, says that city officials have yet to offer her a way out.

The shops and jobs that were once here are gone. There is no police presence, and drug dealers have become her neighbors.

"We are prisoners inside our own city," she said.
