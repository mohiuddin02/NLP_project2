CHICAGO — Last year, bullies pushed and called 11-year-old Ronan Schuelke names in the school lunchroom.

Now Ronan is starring in a music video that teaches respect. The video is a take-off on a popular Katy Perry song.

His classmates at Stratford Middle School in Bloomingdale, Ill., will watch the video. Then Ronan and other student leaders will reward students who try to stop bullying or encourage kindness. Students will get prizes for telling a classmate to stop picking on someone or for sitting with a new student at lunch. The awards are called "Stallion Medallions" after the school's mascot. They can be traded for things like school supplies or play tickets.

"I think this is something the kids will pick up … and maybe try it," Ronan said of the idea.

## Learning How To Stop Bullying

Stratford's plan shows how seriously many schools now take bullying.

In the past, schools didn't deal effectively with bullying. Now, dozens of school districts across Illinois have anti-bullying programs. Equally important, though, is teaching students to respect each other. The change came about because of state laws and a new understanding of bullying.

Encouraging students to respect each other works better than saying "Don't be a bully," said Brian Meyer. He works for the state's Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports network. The center gives Illinois schools information about how to prevent bullying.

Under the program, schools know that any student may bully others and be bullied themselves.  Students help point out problems at their schools. All teachers and students are trained in a program called "Stop, Walk and Talk." They learn exactly what they should say and do to stop bullying.

Many educators and researchers like the program. They say it reduces bullying. Others worry that rewarding good behavior with prizes sends the wrong message. Kindness to others should be its own reward, they say. Also, it doesn't work in the long run. As soon as the reward ends, the good behavior may stop, they say.

## Schoolwide Programs Work Best, Studies Show

About 20 to 30 of every 100 school children are either bullies or bullied.

Twenty years ago, bullying was considered rare. Few parents asked schools to protect their children against mean students. After violence was linked to bullying, parents got involved, said Dorothy Espelage. She studies bullying at the University of Illinois.

Now, 49 states require schools to have anti-bullying programs, Espelage said.

Schoolwide programs work best, studies show. Many principals have turned to the PBIS for help. The network is funded by the U.S. Department of Education.

When PBIS began 15 years ago, it focused on students with special needs or severe behavior problems. Educators then realized that all students must be involved in anti-bullying programs. By 2011, more than 250 school leaders in Illinois attended a meeting to prevent bullying.

## Drop In Bullying Thanks To Program

All eight schools in the Bloomingdale district have an anti-bullying plan. It includes Expect Respect clubs, rewards for kindness and Ronan's video, said Julie Augustyn. She works for the district.

There is no easy way to stop bullying, said Catherine Bradshaw. She works at the Johns Hopkins Center for the Prevention of Youth Violence. But some programs look promising, she said. At schools in Maryland using PBIS, behavior problems dropped by a third, Bradshaw found. The study also showed a big drop in bullying within two years.

"There aren't any quick, easy solutions that are going to happen after one hour or an afternoon," she said.

Chintan Dave, an eighth-grader at Stratford, had an immediate goal when he joined the school's Expect Respect Club. Two years ago he switched to a different bus after he was mocked for his Indian accent. When school started this year, he wore his neon-orange "Expect Respect" T-shirt with high hopes.

"I don't want anyone to go through what I went through," he said.
