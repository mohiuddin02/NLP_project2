BEKAA, Lebanon â€” Snow covers the Bekaa Valley. People from the Lebanese capital of Beirut came to the mountains with sleds and toboggans for some holiday fun. They piled souvenir snow onto their vehicles for the drive home. But there was nothing merry about the weekend blizzard for the Syrians living in unofficial camps.

Um Mahmoud shares a tent with a dozen other Syrians in the valley. She is one of the many people who fled the civil war. Syrian rebels are fighting troops loyal to Syria's president.

A chain of people with buckets had to haul 14 pails of mud and slush from her tent.

"It was like a sea here yesterday," Um Mahmoud, a mother of 10, said with an easy smile Sunday. She and other women were showing visitors the inside of their mud-floor tent. It was damp and messy after the storm. "How can we cook in such a mess?" she said. She pulled back a curtain to show a bare kitchen stocked with only a little food. Sometime rats attacked the kitchen.

## A Hard Winter Ahead

The sun was shining Sunday in the Bekaa. Mountain tops were covered with snow. But the views were of little relief to displaced Syrians. Many of them were clearing out the snow, slush and mud that had made an already difficult life even harder.

The next storm cannot be far off. Another muddy mess will come with it.

Tiny Lebanon is now home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, officials say. About 1 in 5 people living in the country is a Syrian.

Aid groups have praised Lebanon for letting so many Syrians come to the country. But Lebanon has no established refugee camps. Syria's other neighbors like Turkey, Jordan and Iraq do. Refugee camps are not allowed in Lebanon.

A generation ago, there were Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. But those camps helped lead to a civil war there. Now, Lebanese officials are cautious of any settlements that might turn into permanent communities. Leadership in Lebanon is carefully split among different groups. Refugees could shift the balance and give one group more power over the others.

The Syrian war is entering its third winter. Many refugees in Lebanon cannot afford apartments or don't have relatives to host them. Those people face a bleak future. Many camps have sprung up to provide for basic needs. The camps are not permanent. They also are not reliable. Aid arrives irregularly, refugees say. Many tents have heating stoves, but fuel has been in short supply.

"It has been freezing cold here and fuel was like gold," said Ahmad Awadh. Awadh lives in a another Bekaa-area camp.

Awadh's site is slightly better than the abandoned factory grounds that host Um Mahmoud and others. The camp has 39 tents with concrete floors and blue plastic sheeting. The plastic provides some protection from the rain and snow.

## "People Are Laughing At Us"

About 500 people live in the camp. A majority of the tents appear to have both portable heaters and stoves and some have electricity. Charities provided the stoves and heaters. Still, people complain that aid only comes occasionally. Also, enrolling children in schools is next to impossible, and finding a job is only a dream.

As the sun shone, people cleared the mess from the storm out of their tents. They hung their wet clothes to dry and gathered firewood. For many this is not their first winter away from home. Their situation is difficult, they say, but not life-threatening. Their thoughts remain with loved ones back in Syria. People there face daily explosions and clashes. They are cut off from regular supplies of food, fuel and water.

"We watch the news, and we hope something will happen, but in truth we have no confidence," said Um Ammar, a mother. "People are laughing at us." Like others interviewed, she preferred to just use a nickname for security reasons.

She has been told that desperate residents are burning school desks and clothing for heat outside of Damascus, Syria's capital. The situation is terrible. Yet Syrians here seem to want to go back as soon as possible.

Many ask foreign visitors about the chances for peace. Will there be negotiations at the United Nations next month, they ask. They are keen for any sign of progress in the war.

Given the terrible situation in Syria, many figured they were lucky to be in Lebanon.

"We cannot complain too much," said Um Mahmoud. "After all, we escaped from death."
