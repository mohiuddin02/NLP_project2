WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama's health care law has survived the Supreme Court, a battle for the White House and rounds of budget standoffs. Now the American people get to see it in action.

Health insurance markets open Tuesday around the country. A fight over the health care law could result in a government shutdown. But it won't stop the main pieces of Obamacare from going live as scheduled, problems and all. The biggest growth of society's safety net since Medicare will be in the hands of consumers, and most of their concerns don't revolve around political beliefs and policy details.

People want to know if they can afford the monthly bill and if the coverage will be solid. They want to find the bureaucratic pitfalls and see if new federal and state websites will really make shopping for health insurance easier. Full answers may take months.

Expect the rollout to get off to a slow start. There will be some bumps.

## Problems Expected To Pop Up

People who can't get health insurance through work can start shopping right away for private coverage where the cost is partially paid by the government. Or they can wait to sign up as late as Dec. 15 and still get coverage by Jan. 1. Many will probably want to see how it goes for others before they jump in.

Problems are likely to pop up in the new online insurance markets. Over the weekend, several states were still struggling to get plan information to show up accurately on their websites. The federal government already announced delays for small business and Spanish-language signups. A long government shutdown could slow needed technology fixes.

Consumers also could run into problems getting their right amount of money from the government to help pay for the insurance. People with complicated tax returns and extended families living under the same roof could find they need personal assistance to work out the issues. Referrals to state Medicaid programs might go smoothly in some states. They might not go so well in others.

At the start, "it is going to be very clear that everything can't be done on a computer," said Christine Ferguson. She runs Rhode Island's marketplace. "But by Day 60 to 120, and the year after that, it's going to get a lot more user friendly and effective."

Eventually, at least half the nation's nearly 50 million uninsured people are expected to get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Many will get insurance through private plans sold in the new markets. Those plans will be paid for in part, or subsidized, by the government.

Others will be covered by an expanded version of Medicaid in states accepting it for low-income uninsured adults. Immigrants in the country illegally will be the largest group remaining uninsured.

## Some Confused About The New Law

People who do have access to employer-based plans will also see changes. Starting Jan. 1, virtually all Americans will have a legal obligation to carry health insurance or face fines. But employees who lose their jobs, people starting their own businesses and people in between school and work will have an easier time getting coverage.

Also as of Jan. 1, you will be able to get health insurance even if you already have a medical problem.

A partial government shutdown will not stop what is known as Obamacare. The program was designed so that major parts are shielded from annual budget battles. Republicans have objected to increasing the federal government's role in health care.

Polls show opponents of the law outnumber supporters. Nonetheless, a survey released over the weekend found 56 percent of Americans do not approve of cutting off funding to expand coverage for the uninsured. Congressional Republicans are pressing to do just that.

The poll also found that people are confused about what the law means for them. Nearly three-fourths of the uninsured were unaware of the new insurance markets opening to serve them.

Under the law, people below the poverty line can only get the new coverage through expanded Medicaid. And the Supreme Court gave states the right to opt out. The poverty line is $11,490 in pay for one person and $23,550 for a family of four.

## New Markets To Sell Private Insurance

The other arm of Obamacare is new markets selling private insurance in which some of the cost is paid for by the government. It is mainly geared to uninsured people in the middle class. The administration is hoping to sign up 7 million the first year. Young, healthy adults are prime customers. They'll help offset the cost of caring for sicker people sure to sign up once insurers can no longer reject them.

Kevin Maass of Fairfax, Va., has been uninsured for more than a year, since he turned 26 and could no longer stay on his parents' insurance. He's been waiting tables while looking for a job in law enforcement.

"Not having health insurance has made me a little bit more cautious," said Maass. "I like to snowboard, but it's given me second thoughts. Heaven forbid I should break my wrist or my arm."

Maass thinks he might be able to afford $100 to $200 a month for insurance. Early indications are that he'll find plenty of options. However, plans with the lowest premiums will make him pay a lot more if he gets sick or has an accident.

Nonetheless, Maass says he's definitely planning to check out the health insurance market. "My parents have been pushing for me to get health insurance," he said. "I might as well at least get something rather than pay (a fine) to not have anything."
