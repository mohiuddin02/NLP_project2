KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Jake Betts tugged the reins of a horse named Leroy and rode up a ridge.

A cowboy, Betts wore Levi's jeans wrapped with leather chaps and cowboy boots with spurs. Rope coiled off the side of his saddle. In the distance, nearly 1,100 cows, or cattle, were to be herded on a recent day.

That time of year, late July, is called shipping season around these parts. Cows are rounded up and shipped to a feedlot where they are fattened to be turned into food.

Meet the modern-day cowboys and cowgirls. Betts and 10 others who saddled up began this roundup at the first break of light.

The cows are scattered across a vast, beautiful landscape. For the last four months, the animals have munched on a thick carpet of native bluestem grasses.

## Horses Only, Please

These cowboys and cowgirls keep to the Old West tradition. The cattle are herded by men, women and children on horseback, not the pickup trucks that many ranchers favor nowadays.

"For 50 years — since about 1890, actually — we've been talking about the disappearing cowboy," said James F. Hoy. He is the director of Emporia State University's Center for Great Plains Studies, who writes books on Kansas history.

"But if you get off the interstate (highway) a ways, cowboys are still out there," Hoy said. "They don't carry a pistol anymore in their holster. Now, it's a cellphone."

A cellphone and complicated computerized records help Cliff Cole manage the ranching operations here. A half-dozen caretakers live on 80,000 acres, which is about 125 square miles.  The land is owned by businessman Bill Haw, who also owns all 40,000 head of cattle with a partner.

## Ranching Has Seen Some Changes

The July roundup is mainly a family affair. Three generations of the Nelson family have been herding on horseback for many years.

Holton Nelson, 15, has been helping drive cattle since he was 4 years old.

Older brother Nate has taken college courses on raising farm animals and the business of raising and growing food. "But what we're doing now," said Nate, 25, "you're not going to learn out of a book."

The Nelsons have seen plenty of changes in the raising, feeding and shipping of beef cattle. But the roundup can't, as most of these cowboys see it, be carried out any other way.

By cowboys, that is. They wear long sleeves even in the heat, pointed boots rather than sneakers or work shoes, and their jeans are always blue.

When not herding, the cowboys care for the animals and fix fences.

Few get rich doing it.

Many of those who show for the roundup aren't getting paid. They're neighbors and relatives willing to help out.

Still, there are big rewards.

They work in areas so remote that few human eyes ever view them.

## The Cows Know The Language

Jade Cole, 16, rose at 3:30 a.m. to meet her uncle Cliff Cole, who manages the ranch.

Other cowboys arrived for the roundup, their pickups hauling trailers carrying horses.

Somewhere out in the hills are thousands of head of year-old beef cattle. The animals have no idea they soon will be herded into 18-wheeler trucks.

Dawn reveals the cattle scattered across the Flint Hills landscape. The riders take their places, and their horses start moving at an easy trot.

"Hyah! Hep, hep! Tsssh!"

Each cowboy has his own command to get the wandering cattle to join the parade, and all of the cattle obey.

"That's their herd mentality," says Nate Nelson. "You get into their little bubbles of safety and they'll start moving, following each other."

A cow all by itself is a slow target for predators, so they've learned there is safety in numbers and move as one.

"Epp! Epp!" shrieks Ryan Gasche, directing traffic. "Ryan's a yelper," Betts says.

## A Busy Morning And The Sun Is Barely Up

At 7 a.m. the horses pick up the pace. After a mile-long march, the herd flows shoulder-to-shoulder to the top of a hill. They break into a jog, as if the pens by the side of a road are just where these cows desire to be.

Gene Ernest backs his cattle truck to the far end of a pen. "Heah! Yah, yah!" More than 70 cows go up the truck ramp and pound into the trailer.

The truckers will drive the cows 50 miles to a feedlot, then head back for more.

"I'm 51 and been doing this since I was 18," Ernest says. "It's the (friendship) I like. That keeps everything going."

At the feedlot, the cattle will eat their fill and go from 620 pounds to 1,200 pounds in about 30 weeks.

Then it's on to the slaughterhouse.

## They're Most Comfortable With Cattle

These cowboys and cowgirls like what they do, though they don't like talking about it very much with outsiders.

Especially not to city folk whose understanding of the beef business is limited to the eating part.

"We don't like to go to town more than we have to," said Cliff Cole. He hates to say it this way, he says, but they don't really want to be around people.

Some of the workers of the Flint Hills ranches boast that they understand cows better than people.

"You have to get them to know who you are," said Shane Nelson.

Silly cows. If they knew the cowboys better, they'd know that Shane loves to eat steak.
