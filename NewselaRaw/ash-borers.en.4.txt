A tiny insect from China is expected to kill nearly all ash trees in the eastern United States. The bug is known as the emerald ash borer. It is glittery green and about half an inch long.

Now, there is more bad news: The borer may have found a new tree to munch on.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that the borer had attacked the white fringe tree. The fringe tree is in the same family as the ash. It is also related to forsythia and lilac.

Experts don't quite know what to make of the announcement. Still, they are worried.

## How Hungry Are They?

Tom Tiddens is in charge of plant care at the Chicago Botanic Garden. "This is bringing up more questions than answers," he said.

The Botanic Garden has 42 beautiful fringe trees of its own. Tiddens is worried about them.

Will the borer kill fringe trees, as it does ashes? Or will it just damage them?

Maybe the insect was merely taste-testing a close relative of the ash. After all, there are very few ash trees left alive in Ohio. That's where the borers were spotted on a fringe tree.

The discovery was made by a college science professor on a walk. He passed a fringe tree and decided to examine it. Bingo! There the bugs were.

Perhaps the bugs were just sampling the fringe tree, Tiddens said. Maybe they were trying the tree only because they couldn't find any ashes.

## They Like Tasty Bark

There could also be a much scarier explanation. Perhaps the borer is changing. Soon there may not be any more ash trees. It could be changing so it can live off trees other than the ash.

Borers are now arriving in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Officials in both places are watchful, but not yet alarmed. The fringe tree is not common in either state, fortunately.

New Jersey bug expert Paul Kurtz said he is not too worried. He said there are only a few fringe trees in the state.

Forsythias or lilacs would not be likely targets, he said. They do not have enough bark to meet the insect's needs. Neither "has enough meat on the bones, so to speak," Kurtz said.

## Bug Experts Keeping An Eye Open

The Ohio discovery has made people take another look at the borer, Kurtz said. Scientists had thought the borer was only interested in ashes. Only time will tell if the insect has changed its ways.

Don Eggen is a Pennsylvania bug expert. He too is not that worried yet. So far in his state the borer problem is just something "to keep a lookout for."

The emerald ash borer has been chomping its way south and east from Detroit. The bug was first spotted there in 2002. It probably arrived on a boat. Scientists believe it was riding along on some wooden containers.

The borer lays its eggs on the bark of ashes. It cuts off the flow of chemicals and minerals the tree needs. Eventually, the tree dies.

Dead or dying trees are very dangerous. They can hurt people or property when they fall. Taking down so many dead ash trees has been very expensive.
