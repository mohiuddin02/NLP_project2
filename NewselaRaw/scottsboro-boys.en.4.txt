FAIRHOPE, Ala. â€“ During the Great Depression, there were hardly any jobs in the United States and many people were broke. Young people throughout the South snuck onto trains looking for work. In 1931, nine black teenagers, a few white boys and two white girls got on a train to Memphis.

A fight started and the outnumbered white boys jumped off the train. They went to the police. In Paint Rock, Ala., officers boarded the train. They arrested every black male, ranging from 13 to 19 years old. They also found the two white girls. The girls said they had been attacked by the black boys.

The boys had not committed the crime. But a jury said they did. All but the youngest was sentenced to die. The teenagers became known as the Scottsboro Boys. It was an ugly chapter in Alabama history.

The boys got legal help to fight their charges. One of the women who accused the boys admitted her story was not true. But the damage had been done. They boys' reputations were ruined. Some went into hiding. Eventually they all died.

## What She Read Changed Her Life

One person who couldn't forget the boys was a Scottsboro woman named Sheila Washington.

In the mid-1970s Washington was 17. She found a package under her parents' bed. It was a pillowcase, which held something rolled in layers of plastic. She unwrapped it, and a book tumbled out.

It was a book about the nine boys who were black, like her. What she read changed her life.

The trials of the nine Scottsboro Boys took just two days. The jury was all-white. The defense lawyer didn't know Alabama law. All but the youngest teen was sentenced to die. The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court made two historic decisions: that jury members cannot be excluded because of their skin color, and that people on trial have the right to a decent lawyer.

Sheila Washington's father caught her while she was reading the book.  He snatched it from her hands. She heard fear in his voice. "You don't need to know about that," he said. "Just keep quiet about this now."

## Opens A Museum About The Case

In 1978, Washington's brother died in Kilby Prison. That was the same prison where the Scottsboro Boys had been held. Guards had killed him, she said, after he had killed a white man in a fight.

Washington began work on a project on the Scottsboro Boys. It was a museum. People in town expressed outrage. "They said I was disgracing the good name of Scottsboro," she said.

After almost 20 years of work she opened the museum. Visitors there could learn about the case.

The Scottsboro Boys case was an important moment in history. It changed the way U.S. courts work in two very meaningful ways. The case also helped start the civil rights movement.

The nine have been dead for a long time. But Sheila Washington felt they still deserved to have their names cleared. She went to the group of Alabama officials who give pardons. It is called the parole board. But she was told there was no process for pardoning dead people.

## Asks A State Senator To Help

So she went to state Sen. Arthur Orr, a white Republican.

Orr was moved by Washington's plea. "Alabama is such a different place now," he said Thursday. "This felt like a chance to do something."

He drew up a new law. It would let dead people be pardoned if they were treated unfairly because of the color of their skin. Alabama lawmakers approved the law.

On Thursday, Alabama officials pardoned the men. The pardon happened because of the work of one woman who wouldn't give up. The pardon means the men had their names cleared of the crime.

"I believe the boys can rest now," Washington said.
