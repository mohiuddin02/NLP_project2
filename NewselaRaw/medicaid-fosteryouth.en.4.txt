Rainbow Sky Buck moved to the state of Utah this summer. Then she got an ear infection and went to the doctor.

Buck thought the government would pay her doctor. She was wrong.

Buck used to live in California. She did not live with her real mother and father. Instead she lived with foster parents. She did not have much money.

## Government Helps Foster Kids

The government paid her doctors. The government pays for medicine for some kids. It pays if they live with foster parents or if they do not have much money. The government program that pays for them is called Medicaid. When they turn 26, the government stops paying.

Now Buck lives in Utah. She had to pay the doctor herself. She used all of the money she had in the bank. "Luckily, I got my antibiotics and I am OK now," she said. "But what is going to happen next time?"

Some states do not want to pay the doctor for people like Buck. They do not want to pay because she moved states. Lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are trying to change this. They are trying to make a new law. Under the law, the government would pay Buck's doctor until she is 26 years old. It would pay even if she moved to a new state.

Fatima Morales works with a group called Children Now. The group helps children. Fatima wants young people to know what might happen if they move. She wants them to know that the government might not pay if they go to the doctor.

Lezlie Martinez is 19 years old. She is hoping to move from the state of California to the state of Colorado. Her boyfriend lives in Colorado. Martinez is looking for work because she needs money for herself and for her son. He is 2 years old.

Martinez is sick. She is worried that the government will not pay her doctor. "It is really stressing me out," she said.
