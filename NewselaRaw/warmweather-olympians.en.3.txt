SOCHI, Russia â€” The sunny West African nation of Togo found skier Mathilde Amivi Petitjean online.

Petitjean, age 19, grew up in the mountains of the French Alps. But her mother is from Togo, and that's good enough for the Togolese Olympic Committee. She is skiing for Togo's first Winter Olympics team in the mountains of Russia.

Alessia Afi Dipol is another member of Team Togo whose feet have barely touched Togo soil. Dipol, age 18, is an Italian who has skied for India.

But to Togo Olympic Committee Vice President Kelani Bayor, "These are true blue Togolese." They don't live in Togo, Kelani said. But they have roots there.

## Searching Far And Wide

Togo is one of seven warm-weather countries participating in the Winter Games for the first time. The others are Dominica, East Timor, Malta, Paraguay, Tonga and Zimbabwe. They all marched in the parade of nations at the Sochi's opening ceremony Friday.

These countries lack mountains, snow or knowledge of winter sports. So, they had to search far and wide to put together teams.

The Dominica cross-country ski team, for example, comes from New York. Gary and Angelica di Silvestri are a husband and wife in their 40s. They volunteered in the tiny Caribbean nation. In return, they were made citizens, which lets them ski for Dominica.

Some of the new Olympians were born in the country they represent. But they didn't stay there long. Paraguayan slopestyle skier Julia Marino was born in Paraguay. She was adopted by an American family and moved to the United States when she was less than a year old.

Marino lives in Boulder, Colo. Until last year, she skied for the United States. She has visited Paraguay just once. "I'm going to spend a bit more time down there," she said Tuesday. Paraguay has "a great national Olympic Committee and I can learn more about my country."

## Hungry For Olympic Glory

Zimbabwe alpine skier Luke Henri Steyn was born in Harare. Harare is the capital of the African country of Zimbabwe. But his family moved to Switzerland, where he started skiing at age 2. He has taken a year off his studies at the University of Colorado to focus on the Sochi Games.

The nations in warm climates aren't the only ones with athletes from other countries. South Korean speed skater Ahn Hyun-soo is competing in Sochi for Russia. He now calls himself Viktor Ahn. He switch his allegiance after South Korea didn't send him to the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada.

Foreign Policy magazine's website recently called these Olympians "carpetbaggers." Carpetbaggers were Northerners who moved to the South after the American Civil War for their own gain. "Even as the Games embrace the (speech) of national pride, opportunism knows no borders," said the magazine.

Athletes must be citizens of the country they represent. But some countries are making it easy for athletes to become citizens, said Janice Forsythe. She directs the International Centre for Olympic Studies at Western University in Canada.

Countries are hungry for Olympic glory. Sending a team to the Olympics makes them feel more important, she said. "In Canada, we move elite athletes to the front of the immigration line, speeding up their immigration papers in time for the Olympics."

Switching countries has become the new normal for some athletes.

## Togo's Winter Sports Plan

Togo discovered Petitjean online. The nation's sports committee contacted her after she posted a comment on Facebook about Gervacio Madja. He is a cross country skier who was born in Togo and raised in Germany.

"We first got in touch with (Petitjean) in May 2013," said Hyacinthe Edorh. He is head of the Togolese team at the Sochi Games. "With Mathilde we are certain she will surprise everyone because she is only 19 years old. And she is capable of competing for the next 10 to 15 years."

Togo's Olympics team is part of a plan to make the tropical country a winter sport powerhouse.

"We would like to be present in all competitions in the Winter Games. And (we) want to carry out our project all over Africa," Hyacinthe said.

But for now, Team Togo has enough work to do in its own country.

"Some people in Togo don't know what slalom is," Kelani said. Slalom is a ski course in a zig-zag pattern marked by flags. "I will explain to them."
