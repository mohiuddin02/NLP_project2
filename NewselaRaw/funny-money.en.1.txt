The next time you receive some cash, inspect it carefully. Fake bills are circulating in the U.S. economy and you don't want to get stuck holding funny money.

Authorities report that criminals are learning to use new technology to counterfeit, or copy, bills that can fool most people.

## Counterfeiter Caught

In November, federal agents arrested a Georgia man accused of printing more than $1 million in phony $50 bills. Investigators say Heath J. Kellogg and his five accomplices sold the fake money for real currency, or used it to purchase expensive items that they would later return for cash.

The Treasury Department is responsible for printing the U.S. money supply. The Treasury tries to make it as hard as possible to copy our currency. For example, the $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills all include watermark portraits. A watermark is an image that can be seen in the paper when you hold it up to the light.

Authorities say Kellogg put paper through a printer to give it a yellowish tint. He then printed the front side of the money on one piece of paper. On a separate sheet of paper, he printed the back of the bill. Next, he flipped the paper over and printed a watermark. He sprayed glue to stick the sheets of paper together. By doing this, he was able to recreate the watermark.

## Stopped By The Secret Service

The forgery was good, but not good enough to fool Secret Service investigators. Yes, the same agency that provides bodyguards for the president and his family also has another important duty: protecting the nation's money from counterfeiters.

In fact, the Secret Service began almost 150 years ago, after the Civil War, when counterfeiting was so common that almost one third of the money in circulation was phony.

## Genuine Money Markers

The Treasury Department includes many complicated details in its bills to combat counterfeiting. Today's bills look very different from those made decades ago. For example, new bills have color-shifting ink, which turns from copper to green when you tilt them.

But technology is also helping the counterfeiters. High-quality scanners, printers and toner ink make it easier to copy money. The Internet also provides information and tips about counterfeiting.

According to investigators, that's how a man from Rhode Island, who was arrested in November, learned how to use a chemical soap to rub off the number five on $5 bills. He then reprinted them as $100s.

The Secret Service told The New York Times newspaper it recovered about $81 million in counterfeit money last year. It arrested almost 2,500 people for counterfeiting. Not all of the fake bills are made in the United States. Some of come from overseas, especially from the South American country of Peru. The $20 bill is most commonly counterfeited, followed by the $100.

Counterfeiting money is a serious crime and those who are found guilty of doing it face a penalty of up to 20 years in prison. Counterfeiting hurts innocent people because the government does not replace your money if you receive a fake bill.

## Know Your Money

Don't be a victim of counterfeiting. The Secret Service and the Treasury Department recommend that you learn about the security designs on our currency such as the watermarks and color-shifting ink.

Examine the green serial numbers to spot a fake. They should be evenly spaced. Counterfeit bills often have serial numbers that are irregularly spaced.

Look at the person pictured on the bill such as Abraham Lincoln on the $5 or Andrew Jackson on the $20. Does the portrait appear lifelike? If so, it is real. On counterfeit bills, the portrait looks flat and lifeless.

Examine the bill closely for extra-fine red and blue fibers that are part of the paper. Counterfeiters may try to draw them using colored pens.

Sometimes you don't even have to look at a bill to know that it is phony. Just feel it. Fake bills are often slippery. Real money feels a bit like cloth.

Only one company is allowed to make the paper that the Treasury uses to print money. The papermaking process is secret. An armored tractor-trailer truck ships the paper from the mill to the Treasury's printers. It is illegal to reproduce the paper, even if you don't print anything on it.

Think twice before you accept any $500, $1,000, $5,000 or $10,000 bills. The Treasury stopped printing them in 1945.

## Looking Ahead

Nowadays, we use cash less and less when we have to pay for things. Credit and debit cards are becoming more popular for everyday purchases. But the Secret Service is still as busy as ever. It is also responsible for investigating credit card fraud and other types of electronic crimes involving money.

Staying one step ahead of the counterfeit artists will take a fresh generation of agents and investigators. If you want to work for the Secret Service, the agency recommends you get a four-year college degree, stay in good physical shape and be a law-abiding citizen.
