CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple is investing heavily in sapphire. The technology company isn't putting its money into the precious gem, but instead into a man-made version that is nearly scratch-proof, as well as sensitive to the touch.

The ever-secretive company has been mum on its plans. However, Apple has been patenting numerous inventions that use synthetic — or man-made — sapphire crystals. Recently, Apple signed a $578 million deal with a manufacturer to grow a man-made version of the mineral at a massive Mesa, Arizona, factory. The facility will eventually pump out more sapphire than the rest of the world combined, said Eric Virey. He is an analyst at research company Yole Développement.

## Hopes For A Fancy IPhone Upgrade

The deal has triggered speculation that iPhones will soon receive a luxurious upgrade. Sapphire is one of the hardest minerals in the world after diamond. By using the man-made sapphire, Apple could give consumers a much tougher screen. Experts say sapphire is not only harder than glass but also more sensitive to the touch. The material will perhaps help Apple as it tries to get into new industries such as online payments, gaming and medicine.

"It opens up a lot of doors for Apple," said Matt Margolis. He is an analyst at PTT Research.

Current models of the iPhone already contain touches of sapphire. The material shields the camera lens and the fingerprint scanner. With an increased supply, analysts predict Apple will use sapphire to make screens for the next version of the iPhone and perhaps for a wearable device like a smartwatch. Apple is expected to announce the next generation iPhone in a week. Apple and GT Advanced Technologies, the sapphire manufacturer it is working with, refused to talk about the deal.

## A Tougher Screen Is Attractive

It's a big investment, even for wealthy Apple. Sapphire is far more expensive than the glass it now uses. The smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and manufacturers have to take chances to set themselves apart from the pack, Virey said.

The display, Virey said, remains one of the major opportunities to stand out.

When searching for materials for smartphone screens, manufacturers' key concerns are hardness and transparency. Sapphire, which is clear in its pure form, is a top choice, said Andrew Hsu. He is director at Synaptics, which develops touch-screens.

"Other than the fact that it's expensive, it's pretty much a better material than glass," he said.

A screen made of sapphire would likely be tougher to scratch or crack than Gorilla Glass. According to experts, Gorilla Glass is the chemically strengthened glass Apple has used in recent iPhones. The hardness of sapphire could be a strong selling point for customers. About 11 percent of iPhone users have a device with a cracked screen, according to SquareTrade. The company sells insurance for electronic devices.

## Better Than Gorilla Glass?

But sapphire has a softer side. Touch-screen devices recognize a user's finger by detecting the change in the electrical field above the display. Sapphire has better electrical properties than glass. It picks up on touch more easily, experts say. GT claims that sapphire performed 42 percent better than Gorilla Glass in touch testing.

A spokesman defended Gorilla Glass's durability and sensitivity. Experts also note that the toughness of sapphire depends on how it's cut. A screen made from sapphire might not hold up better than one made of Gorilla Glass.

Touch-screen technology is already advanced. Analysts, though, see plenty of room for improvement. With a sapphire screen, a device might be able to sense fingerprints across the entire display. That could make online payments easier. It would let users save the prints of multiple fingers or sign their signature more easily on their smartphone screens, Margolis said.

## Easier Typing

Sapphire screens would also allow for more precise typing. They could even recognize instruments ranging from styluses to old-fashioned pencils, experts say. A more responsive screen also promises to make gaming more fun.

"This can improve the user experience in gaming, typing and playing instruments in apps like Garage Band," according to Carolina Milanesi. She is chief of research and head of U.S. business at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.

The technology could also help preschoolers use Apple devices more easily. Although many young children love technology, glass touch-screens have trouble picking up their little fingers, Hsu said.

What's more, sapphire is denser than glass. That means Apple may be able to use a thinner layer to shield its devices, Hsu said. With slim phones in fashion, that's an important consideration, he noted.

"Everyone's looking at ways to save tenths of millimeters," Hsu said.

## All Eyes On Apple

As with other technological breakthroughs, Apple was not the first to adopt sapphire. Yet, it may be the company to set the standard for the smartphone industry. Luxury smartphone-maker Vertu offers phones with sapphire screens. Also, Kyocera recently released a device with such sapphire display.

Analysts say smartphone manufacturers will be watching Apple as they consider whether to use sapphire in their own devices. Of course, if sapphire spreads across the market, Apple would have to find a new way to wow consumers. Could a diamond screen be next?

"I wouldn't rule that out," Hsu said, laughing.
