CHICAGO â€” On a recent afternoon, a group of 9- and 10-year-old African-American girls talked about beauty.

They all agreed that women with short, kinky hair were not beautiful. But then Ladon Brumfield, founder of the group Girls Rule!, passed around a photograph of Lupita Nyong'o. The dark-skinned actress wears her hair extra-short. The girls were silent for a moment.

Then, once again, they all agreed: Nyong'o was beautiful.

The girls had to change their thinking, said Brumfield, whose group empowers girls. Usually, all they hear and see on television and magazines is about long hair.

## Afros, Braids And Twists

For more than 10 years, more black women have been wearing their hair in Afros, braids and twists. In an Afro, the hair is combed up from the head in a halo. It was especially popular in the African-American community in the 1960s and 1970s. But thanks to Nyong'o, the TWA, or teenie weenie Afro, is making black hairstyles acceptable in the general community as well.

Nyong'o is a Kenyan-Mexican actress who won an Academy Award this year. She isn't the first black actress to wear her hair in a super-short Afro. But what's different about Nyong'o is that people outside the black community admire her beauty.

Experts say there are still many issues in the black community about beauty and hair. These issues reach back to slavery. But Nyong'o helps black women feel confident to wear their hair short.

If the Afro becomes acceptable to the wider community, it becomes more acceptable in the black community, said Tonya Roberts. She works for the research company Mintel. "Especially if the question is 'Will I be able to get a job with this hairstyle? Will my co-workers or family members accept me?' "

Mintel asked black women to rate different hair styles.

## All Styles Seen Attractive

Roberts said women considered long hair "healthy" and "professional." Short hair was considered the most "professional" and "classy." And natural hair was seen as expressing confidence. All of the styles were considered attractive.

Throughout history, long hair has been a symbol of beauty and femininity. But long hair can be tough for some black women. Their hair type can range from straight to wavy to curly to kinky. Also, the natural curl of their hair makes it look shorter.

Women who want longer hair need hair straightening products. These include chemical straighteners, hot combs and flat irons. They also use wigs, weaves and extensions. Weaves and extensions are made of human hair or fake hair, which are added to the natural hair to make it longer.

Frances Simmons is a black hair care stylist. Too many girls are getting weaves and extensions at a very young age. This is bad for healthy hair and a healthy self-image, she said.

Simmons said she's met a lot of girls who prefer fake hair instead of their own. They feel hair has to be long to be beautiful, she said. It doesn't matter if the fake hair looks cheap and braids are falling off. "What does that say about our self-esteem and self-worth?"

## To Love Their Real Hair

Encouraging women to have short hair is hard, because television and magazines show too many pictures women whose long hair is "bouncing and behaving," said Aeleise Jana. She is a Chicago stylist. She specializes in cutting the hair of black women.

Jana said that many of her customers are done with chemical straighteners and weaves. Their only chance for a healthy head of hair is to cut most of it off.

Chicagoan Candace Peterson is the co-founder of the Kiss My Curls blog. In 2011, she cut off most of her own hair. People were not kind.

"People would say things like ... 'Your hair is too nappy. How often do you comb it?' Or, 'You can't go out with me looking like that,'" Peterson said.

Peterson hopes Nyong'o will inspire black girls to love their real hair.

She also hopes Nyong'o represents a new standard of beauty for girls. "You never know what will make a difference in a child's life. Maybe by seeing someone who looks like her, she can feel more self-assured and brave."
