BAGHDAD, Iraq â€” The Islamic State group has been selling some very old objects from Iraq and Syria. They are important pieces of the area's history. The objects are called antiquities. They show how people lived there hundreds of years ago. The objects are part of their culture. The group has made millions of dollars from selling these things, experts said.

The sales are a bit surprising. They come as the Islamic State fighters have also been destroying big ancient statues and buildings. Those larger pieces are also important parts of history. The Islamic State group said the larger items represent ideas that are against its religion.

## Wiping Out History, Piece By Piece

Islamic State is an extremist group. It has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Another name is Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It wants to set up its own country. The country would be ruled by Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria and some of northern and western Iraq.

The Islamic State group took over Mosul in Iraq a year ago. Selling the antiquities is against the law, or illegal. The illegal business is growing. This is a sign that the Islamic State is more in charge.

Recently, the group captured a very old area in Syria. It was part of a city called Palmyra. The area had parts of old buildings that were 2,000 years old. These are called ruins. The capture of the ruins in Palmyra drew attention to how the Islamic State group was a danger to the area's important cultural history. Experts say the group controls 4,500 areas that have remains of how people lived centuries ago.

"They steal everything that they can sell," said Qais Hussein Rasheed. If they cannot sell it, they destroy it, he said. Rasheed works for the Iraqi government. He is in charge of antiquities. People have been sneaking more of those items out of Iraq since Mosul was captured, he said. It is to keep the objects safe.

## A Booming Business

The Islamic State group first started looting, or stealing, when it took over part of Syria. Since then, the group has taken over more land. At the same time, the looting has become more organized.

Iraqi officials say selling the antiquities is the group's second-most-important business. The first is selling oil. The group makes many millions of dollars from selling the antiquities.

Rounding up and selling antiquities is a sure way to make money, said Michael Danti. He is a professor at Boston University.

Danti works with the U.S. government. He gives advice about the business of stolen antiquities. He said some stolen objects have wound up in the United States.

## There Are Rules To Follow

The United Nations is a group of countries. It started a rule in 1970. An antiquity had to have been found before 1970 to be sold legally. Not a lot of people follow the rule.

The Islamic State group will probably try to make it seem as if the larger objects can be sold legally. This can take years. The group will have to get fake documents. These are phony papers about how the items were found and sold.

A lot of smaller antiquities from Iraq and Syria are now sold online, said Deborah Lehr. She runs the Antiquities Coalition. Her group wants to end illegal sales of ancient objects.

Lehr says people need to learn more about the problem. People need to know that money they use to buy these antiquities could go to bad people, she said. The buyers could be giving money to extremists like the Islamic State group. People also should pay attention to the rules about selling antiquities, she said.
