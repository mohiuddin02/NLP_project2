This high rate is almost three times the average. The strandings have baffled marine biologists and made them wonder if there could be a single, deadly explanation.

"We're all starting to pay close attention to what might be going on," said Florida government scientist Denise Boyd. Scientists are hoping to "see if there are any links or if they're unrelated."

One theory is that the whales might have contracted morbillivirus, an illness similar to measles. This has been attacking dolphins along the East Coast this year. But examinations of dead whales have failed to turn up the disease.

The series of cold fronts that marched across Florida in the past month could be part of the problem. "Any kind of front or a hurricane disorients the animals," said ocean scientist Erin Fougeres. And when that happens, "they come in."

## Cause Not Known So Far

Sonar waves sent out by Navy ships to locate objects underwater can cause whales to aim toward shore. But that explanation has been ruled out, Fougeres said. The Navy wasn't conducting any sonar exercises when the whales stranded.

Or, the whales could have been following a sick leader, Boyd said. Sick whales often head toward shallow waters to make breathing easier.

But nothing so far is definite, Fougeres said. And "there are cases where we just never know the cause."

On average, about 200 whales land on Florida's shores each year. About one "mass stranding," involving at least several whales, occurs every three years in the state.

Yet in just the past two months, a total of 93 whales came ashore in Florida. And most of those, 91, were involved in two mass strandings.

On Dec. 4, 43 pilot whales got caught in the shallows of Everglades National Park on the state's southwestern coast. Nine died. Four days later, 11 pilot whales, part of the same pod, beached at Snipe Point near Key West. All of those whales died.

From Jan. 19–22, 12 pilot whales beached themselves between Naples and Fort Myers. Eight died or were put to sleep. On Jan. 23, 25 more whales, most believed to be part of the same pod, were found dead on Kice Island, south of Marco Island.

"Mass strandings aren't necessarily rare, but to have two so close together is," Fougeres said.

At the same time, on Jan. 2, a dead sperm whale was found floating near Key Largo. And on Jan. 10, a sperm whale weighing up to 15 tons was found dead at Spanish River Park in Boca Raton.

## Tropical Water Dwellers

Florida sees more stranded whales than any other state, followed by California. Beachings also have been reported in large numbers along the northern Gulf Coast. Before the latest cases, the most recent strandings in Florida were in 2012 at Fort Pierce, in 2011 on Cudjoe Key and in 2003 on Big Pine Key.

Pilot and sperm whales are commonly found 1,000 to 2,000 feet down in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. There they feast on squid, octopus, crab, shrimp and other fish.

Pilot whales typically reach a length of 18 to 20 feet and weigh up to two tons. Normally, they inhabit tropical and moderate temperature waters.

Sperm whales are considerably larger. Up to 60 feet and 40 tons, they are roughly the size of a school bus. Females remain in tropical or subtropical waters year-round. Males migrate north to find cooler waters, then return south to breed.

Various other kinds of whales also can be found near Florida. These include pygmy sperm whales, humpback whales, North Atlantic right whales, Bryde's whales and gervais beaked whales.

Government biologists point to one problem they face during rescue tries: Well-meaning bystanders often attempt to push the large marine mammals back into the sea.

"We always ask people not to push the animals back out, because they generally strand for a reason," Boyd said. "These people are well-intentioned, but that can do more harm than good."
