PHILADELPHIA â€”Mothers and father everywhere are capable of grabbing their child's arm too roughly or speaking too harshly.

This goes for rich parents, as well as poor ones. But low-income parents, who struggle with overwhelming stress from hunger or joblessness or poor housing, treat their children harshly more often, researchers say.

And their children suffer from it in ways science is just beginning to understand.

Although not legally defined as child abuse, harsh or authoritarian parenting causes toxic stress in children, researchers say. It can change the structure of their brains and the way their brains function. It also increases the chances of bad behavior, and may lead to heart disease and other health problems.

## Damages Brain Development

"This is an incredibly important public health issue," said Joan Luby, professor of psychiatry at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. After studying 145 children over 12 years, she wrote an article about the effect of poverty on children's brains in the journal JAMA Pediatrics in October.

Think of harsh parenting as being as destructive as lead poisoning, said Daniel Taylor, a pediatrician at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in North Philadelphia.

This kind of parenting often involves "quick 'do-as-I-say' orders from Mom or Dad," Taylor said. Without the buffering effect of a loving, supportive attitude by their parents, it causes the release in children of stress hormones such as cortisol. Stress hormones are released when the body perceives it is in danger, and these hormones can be toxic to developing brains.

They can cause damage to a child's amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. The child may become hyperactive, get into fights, have a short attention span, and cannot calm down, Taylor said.

Toxic stress also may damage the hippocampus, a part of the brain that affects memory, he said. So these children may have trouble remembering things, which reduces their ability to read and do well on tests.

If toxic hormones are released constantly, children will suffer elevated blood pressure, sugar levels and heart rate. This puts them at high risk for developing heart disease, said social worker Marcy Witherspoon, an expert on child welfare and brain development.

Harsh parenting crosses the boundaries of race and income. But Taylor and others believe that poor neighborhoods likely hold countless generations of families suffering from damaged brain development.

"If a child's developing brain was being damaged by high lead levels, landlords would be sued, houses repaired," Taylor said. "If a child's brain was being damaged by mercury in the water, the system would be changed."

But, he asked, "Who is going to pay, who is responsible for ensuring our children are not affected by the toxin of child poverty in America?"

## "I Control Myself"

Dave, who grew up in a poor family, participated in a recent parenting workshop run by Witherspoon. He said he suffered from toxic stress during his childhood during which, he said, "my over-disciplining, yelling, cursing mother ripped me apart."

He's now a single father who lives in Philadelphia with his two young children.

"My mother would always tell me I'd never amount to anything," Dave said. "I was depressed."

He is fearful that he'd pass along toxic stress to his children. "There are only two ways you come out of a situation like mine," Dave said. "You're either a victim and let the bad experiences control you, or you become better in spite of it."

Dave believes that, in part by writing poetry and by drawing, he made peace with his upbringing and prevented passing down toxic stress to his kids.

Dave said he is proud that even if he is angry with his children, he doesn't embarrass them.

"I don't say they're bad, only that they're doing something bad. I control myself," Dave said.

Not all poor children suffer from toxic stress.

Some parents do a good job of protecting their children's brains by being engaged and attentive, said Maria McColgan, medical director of the Child Protection Program at St. Christopher's.

On the other hand, middle-class people are quite capable of delivering toxic stress to their children, a 1998 California study showed.

More recently, a Philadelphia study showed that more than 33 percent of Philadelphia adults experienced emotional abuse during childhood. But high levels of abuse go along with high poverty.

## Stopping The Cycle

Parents don't have to be harsh to do damage. A poor mother distracted by lack of food can become incapable of connecting with her children. This emotional neglect can also cause toxic stress, said Bruce McEwen, a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York.

For good mental health, parents and children need to engage in "serve and return" mode, meaning that a child says something or makes a sound and a parent always responds, like serving and returning a tennis ball. Doing this supports development of language and emotions, McEwen said.

But, he added, if a parent stops responding, "it's a form of emotional abuse."

Despite the pain of toxic stress, there is some good news: "You can heal from it," said Witherspoon, the expert on brain development.

"As long as one adult in a child's life has his back, believes in him, creates hope for the future, that's a positive," she said.

In Witherspoon's parenting classes, parents are taught to stop and give their children attention for the things they do correctly, she said.

They're made to recognize that they create toxic stress in their children because they themselves were victims of it. This knowledge helps them stop treating their children the way their parents treated them, and stop the cycle.

Parents need advocacy, empathy and support to stop taking their stresses out on their kids, Witherspoon said.

"To help," he said, "I say to parents, 'Life sounds really hard. Tell me about it.'"
