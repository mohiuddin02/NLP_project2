### PRO: Absolutely appropriate to provide humanitarian help

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama was right to send U.S. troops to West Africa to help combat the Ebola outbreak. But he did it for the wrong reasons.

Obama called it a "national security" mission. It is clearly not.

True "national security" issues arise due to violent actions by humans, whether countries or extremist groups like al-Qaida. Their actions threaten the lives of Americans. Other types of challenges — be they bad bugs or bad weather — are just problems to be solved.

The challenge of keeping Ebola from becoming a global problem is truly not about security. Helping West Africa deal with Ebola is a humanitarian mission.

## Stopping The Spread of Ebola

It is, of course, absolutely appropriate for the U.S. to provide humanitarian assistance when we have the means to do so and it's in our own interest.

America provided a huge humanitarian response to the 2004 Tsunami in Asia.

Further, the U.S. military undertakes these kinds of missions quite frequently, both at home and overseas. Be it sandbagging during storms or delivering supplies and rescue services after disaster strikes, our military is skilled at assisting in non-military emergencies. It is not the main job for our armed forces, but these are appropriate auxiliary missions — tasks to be done when U.S. troops are needed and available.

Deciding when to launch these missions depends on if they are suitable, possible and acceptable.

Without question, the West African crisis is a suitable use of U.S. forces. The Pentagon can quickly send troops, experts and support to help local groups there stop the spread of the disease.

And it's in our own interest. The best way to keep more Ebola cases from coming across our own border is to help defeat the outbreak at its source. Alternative ways of containing the outbreak — like banning travel — are much less effective.

## Understanding The Danger

Sending troops to West Africa also passes the "possible" and "acceptable" tests. This is not to say the mission poses no risk to our troops.

Even medical professionals who try to take all the right safety steps have caught the disease. But, our troops should know the measures to take to lower their risk.

They are also brave, courageous and willing volunteers. They understand and accept the danger. That is part of the job.

The White House should have classified the operation correctly — as a humanitarian mission. Then it should have explained the reason for this auxiliary mission to the American people.

Words are important, and so are actions. Mislabeling missions suggests a dangerous confusion about the nature of true national security risks and the proper use of our military. Obama did something similar when he called our offensive against the extremist group Islamic State a "humanitarian" mission.

It also raises concern about the conduct of this mission. Has the White House planned this operation properly and sent enough troops to West Africa? Or is the president simply throwing some troops at the problem so he can say he's done something?

### CON: It's asking too much of the U.S. military

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama is using American troops to combat Ebola to show the world he cares enough to send our best. But he's putting them at risk.

Like many of Obama's foreign policy plans, he is acting without thinking through the problem.

Here are reasons why sending our military isn't the best way to offer assistance:

Our military is already taking on too much. The president has decided to cut the Army from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000. The administration's Quadrennial Defense Review said this "strains our ability" to respond to more than one major military problem at a time.

That review came before the president announced plans to send 4,000 soldiers to West Africa. And that number is sure to grow with the president's recent decision to call up National Guard soldiers waiting on reserve. It was also before bombing missions were launched against the extremist group Islamic State, a campaign that may eventually require ground forces.

## Serious Risks To U.S. Soldiers

In light of these challenges, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno recently questioned the wisdom of continuing with the plan to reduce U.S. forces.

Sending troops to West Africa runs the risk that they'll get stuck there. Beyond the military's humanitarian role in the Ebola crisis, it would likely have to keep the peace as well.

The Council on Foreign Relations' Janine Davidson noted, "As the disease spreads, so does panic — and panic leads to violence." Maintaining order in African countries will pose serious risks.

For one, it would require significantly more troops in the future, stretching our military even further. The World Health Organization forecasts new Ebola cases could rise by 10,000 per week by December. That could cause a lot of panic and violence that would need to be subdued.

For another, it could place our soldiers in an impossible position, such as one in which Liberian soldiers recently found themselves. They had to choose between their safety and the public's. Violent rioting triggered by a quarantine left four people wounded and one 16-year-old boy dead.

Imagine U.S. soldiers being forced to make the same choice: Having to shoot unarmed, possibly infected Liberians or allow Ebola to spread.

## Dragged Into Disputes?

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) isn't ready. All of the Ebola patients who contracted the disease on U.S. soil were full-time health care professionals. They caught the disease while treating it using the instructions of the CDC. The CDC is not ready for such a task in Africa.

Bringing the military into humanitarian aid risks getting the U.S. dragged into disputes inside African countries. All three countries at the center of the Ebola outbreak have weak governments.

Sierra Leone and Liberia have just emerged from civil wars in the past few years. Guinea was ruled by the military until 2010. Both Liberia and Guinea have canceled upcoming elections. We're told these countries are so unstable that just banning U.S. travel to the countries could send them into chaos.

"You isolate them, you can cause unrest in the country," said the National Institutes of Health's Anthony Fauci. "It's conceivable that government could fall."

Meanwhile, the Obama administration remains opposed to travel bans, the one measure that might provide Americans some protection.

Our soldiers are being placed at enormous risk all because the president is unwilling stop the flow of possibly infected people from West Africa.
