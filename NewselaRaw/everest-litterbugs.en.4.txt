KATMANDU, Nepal â€” Watch out, litterbugs. What climbers carry up Mount Everest, they must bring back down.

Mount Everest is the world's tallest mountain. It is also the world's tallest garbage dump.

Nepal says there's too much garbage on Everest. It has a new rule.

Climbers must carry their garbage down. Each climber must carry down 18 pounds of garbage. That's how much each throws away. To make sure, Nepali workers will weigh the trash. The new rule starts this spring.

## How To Stop Littering

Climbers don't have to pick up garbage. "We just want them to bring back what they took up." This is according to Maddhu Sudan Burlakoti. He is Nepal's head of mountaineering.

The goal is to stop littering. Climbers throw away all kinds of things. They throw away food wrappers. They also throw away broken tents.

Nepal asked climbers to clean up before. It threatened to charge litterers $4,000. But it never did.

About 230,000 people came to Nepal last year to climb the Himalayas. The Himalayas is a mountain range. Everest is 29,035 feet high.

Trekking companies get teams of people together. Then, the teams climb mountains or hike. They also clean up trash.

## Some Want To Let Everest Rest

No one knows how much garbage there is. "It is impossible to say what is under the ice," says Dawa Steven Sherpa. He leads a trekking company.

Many like the new anti-littering rules.

One of them is Ang Tshering. He is president of a Nepal mountaineering group. He says the government should have made the rules long ago.

The Nepalese believe Everest is holy. They call the mountain Sagarmatha. It means "forehead of the sky" in Nepali. The Tibetan name for Everest is Chomolangma. That means "goddess of the snow."

Some people think too many people climb Everest. It gets too crowded. It also gets dangerous. Reinhold Messner is a famous climber. He wants Nepal to close the mountain. That will give Everest a chance to rest.
