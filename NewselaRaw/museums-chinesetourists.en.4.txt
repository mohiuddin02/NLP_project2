Many people enjoy the J. Paul Getty Museum. Milly Wu, an 11-year-old girl from Hangzhou, China, especially loves taking pictures of the paintings. She will show them to her friends back home.

The Getty and other Los Angeles museums are interested in people like Milly and her father, Will Wu. They are just two of many travelers from China these days.

China is becoming a richer country. Now many more people from China can afford to travel to the United States. The Getty has beautiful art. It attracts Chinese travelers with free tickets, a garden, and a tram ride to a hilltop with beautiful views of the city.

## Getting On China's Websites

Experts from China are working with the Getty. They are helping it become known on popular websites in China.

The Getty is part of a program called "China Ready." The Los Angeles tourism department started the program. It helps businesses get noticed by Chinese vacationers.

Businesses have to complete the program. Then they are considered "China Ready." This shows that they have made their business a good place for Chinese travelers. They can use this in ads to the Chinese travel market.

The Getty probably won't be a top place for group visits. These group visits send travelers on bus tours through Southern California. Right now, theme parks, Hollywood and shopping trips are still more popular.

Daniel Shen runs a travel company. He said that it's different for school groups. Students mostly come in the summer. He says that every student group he has from Asia asks to go to the Getty Museum. They come for longer stays. They have more time to explore Los Angeles. This makes a museum visit a good thing to do, he said.

## How To Be "China Ready"

A new deal with China may have more Chinese coming back. People from China used to have to get a new visa (permission) to enter the United States every year. Now, visas are good for 10 years.

Visits from China to Los Angeles rose in 2014. The numbers are expected to continue growing every year.

To become "China Ready" museums must do many things for Chinese visitors. They have to make a website in Chinese. They must hand out maps and guides in Chinese, too. Museums also must accept a Chinese credit card.

Museums also do other things. Some have workers who speak Chinese. They may also give out museum audio guides in Chinese. Adding Chinese dishes to the museum's food courts is also helpful. At the Getty's cafeteria, visitors can get a menu in Chinese. There will usually be a Chinese dish, too.

## Her Interest In Art

Will Wu asked a Chinese friend who lives in Los Angeles for a good museum to see art. Milly, the 11-year-old who took photos of the paintings, takes painting classes back home. This was a chance to raise her interest in art.

She likes to see famous paintings, Wu said.

Which did Milly like best? Her face rounded into a big smile as she answered in Chinese.

"She says she likes the irises," her father said.
