PRETORIA, South Africa â€” Singing washed like waves over the crowds gathered outside the hospital on Thursday where Nelson Mandela is fighting a lung infection. Every July 18 is known as Mandela Day to celebrate the life of South Africa's former president. It was his 95th birthday.

Music rang out as choirs, political groups, schoolchildren and others arrived. People danced, sang and laughed. Each group had its own musical tribute to the man they see as the one who brought them freedom.

And it wouldn't have been South Africa without the deafening vuvuzelas. The popular and very loud plastic horns were blown at full blast.

Mandela led the fight to end apartheid, a set of laws that separated people by the color of their skin. White people ruled South Africa. Black people were not allowed to vote or own land.

## 27 Years In Prison

Mandela believed that all people should have equal rights, and spent 27 years in prison for these beliefs. Apartheid ended in the 1990s. Mandela was elected as South Africa's first black president in 1994. He ran the country for five years and greatly improved the relationship between blacks and whites.

On June 8 he was taken to the hospital with a lung infection, and he has been very ill since then. A  wall outside the hospital has filled with tributes to Mandela. The heaps of flowers, artwork, posters and letters have spread along the wall and down a nearby hill.

Hopes rose on Wednesday evening when Mandela's daughter Zindzi said that his health had improved dramatically. She told British television he might be able to return home "any time soon."

Mandela's family gathered to celebrate his birthday inside the hospital. South African President Jacob Zuma visited the national hero on Thursday morning. Zuma then stood in the parking lot while a brass band played South Africa's national anthem.

Zuma released a statement confirming that Mandela's health had continued to improve. Mandela is known as Madiba, the name given to him by his African clan. Zuma's statement said: "Madiba remains in hospital in Pretoria but his doctors have confirmed that his health is steadily improving."

The president wished Mandela a joyous 95th birthday on behalf of all the people of South Africa. Zuma thanked the people for supporting Mandela through his illness, and giving him the biggest birthday celebration ever this year.

## Community Service Performed

South African newspapers marked Mandela's birthday with big headlines. The Sowetan paper ran a huge 95, in front of photographs of the leader. The Citizen's front page headline was simply "Happy Birthday!"

Thursday was also Mandela's wedding anniversary. He married his third wife, Graca Machel, on his 80th birthday. She has been at his side throughout his hospitalization.

South Africans around the county contributed 67 minutes of community service to honor Mandela's 67 years of public work. Members of Mandela's family visited schools and hospitals. Other South Africans distributed food to the homeless, picked up garbage, collected money for charity, cleaned hospitals or did work in homes for the elderly or orphans.

Grace Shongoane, 23, a receptionist, paid tribute to Mandela at the hospital. She then planned to go to the Lesedi orphanage in Mamelodi township, east of Pretoria.

"I want to go to them and to be with them for the day just to educate them about what Mandela has done for the country," she said. "As a man, he's got a very good heart because he thought of us when he was fighting for freedom. He thought of us."

## Father Of The Nation

Timothy Sepeng, 50, drove a group of children to the hospital. "I came today to wish our President Tata a speedy recovery," he said. "He's very much important to me because he has made me what I am today. I'm free because of him. I'm free. And I've got the freedom to do anything I like."

Tata is another name for Mandela. It means father. He is often seen as the "Father of the Nation."
