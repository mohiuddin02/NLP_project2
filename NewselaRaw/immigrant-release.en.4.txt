TUCSON, Ariz. â€” The group of immigration protesters called the "Dream 9" are free after being arrested and held for two weeks. The protesters were born in Mexico, but were brought illegally to the United States by their parents and have lived here most of their lives.

They were arrested during a protest last month. They were trying to draw attention to the 1 million people sent back to Mexico during Barack Obama's time as president. Several of them left the United States and then tried to come back from Mexico.

They will still have to convince a judge to let them stay in the country for good. But they will be able to return to their U.S. communities until their day in court. Their lawyer said it could take years for that to happen.

They hope there will be changes in the laws that decide which foreign-born people can stay in the country by then.

## Named After Dream Act

One of the "Dream 9" is Lizbeth Mateo. She was born in Mexico. But she has spent most of her 29 years in Los Angeles. She is set to begin law school on Monday.

Now she's even more determined to succeed. "I am absolutely ready to go to law school," Mateo said.

Mateo and the other protesters take their name from the Dream Act. The proposed law would provide a way for immigrants like them who were brought to the United States illegally as children to stay in the country legally.

The nine had been held at the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona. Eloy is like a jail for people being held by immigration authorities. They rode a bus to Tucson after they were released. Immigrant rights supporters and news crews awaited them.

"You're here!" someone shouted. Some of the freed activists and their supporters cried. The five women came off the bus first. They wore graduation gowns and hats. They were wearing those outfits when they were arrested last month. Next came the four men. They were dressed in street clothes.

## Asylum Cases Usually Denied

Mateo said she spoke to several people like her at Eloy.

She said she wants the government to recognize that there are people who grew up in the United States who have been deported. They should be allowed to come back without facing arrest. "They shouldn't have to go through what we went through," she said. "They should come home."

Why do the "Dream 9" get to stay for now? Immigration officials decided all nine had a reasonable fear that they could be persecuted or tortured in Mexico. The decision meant they could not be sent back right away.

But that is just a first step. Now their cases go to an immigration judge. They are seeking asylum, or the chance to stay for good because they could be hurt at home. Experts say 98 percent of Mexicans' asylum cases are denied.

## "So Much Freedom Here"

Mateo and two others voluntarily crossed into Mexico. Then they tried to re-enter the United States. This was meant as an act of protest. The other six were attempting to return after leaving for Mexico more than a year ago.

Maria Peniche, 22, left a year ago to live in Mexico City. She came to the United States legally when she was 10, she said. Then she stayed longer than she was supposed to.

Peniche said she worked three jobs in Boston to pay for college. She grew frustrated that there was no sign that she would be able to stay legally.

Life in Mexico was difficult, Peniche said. She was targeted because she'd lived so long in the United States. She was relieved to be free, and grateful to be back in the country. "It's amazing. I feel like I have so much freedom here. I can be myself and not be afraid," she said.
