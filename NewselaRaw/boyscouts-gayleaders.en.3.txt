The Boy Scouts of America president urged it to allow gay Scout leaders.

Scouting must keep up with the times, said Robert Gates at a meeting in Atlanta, Georgia,  Thursday. If it doesn't, he thinks the Scouts might face the end as a national organization.

## Gays In The U.S. Military

Two years ago, the Boy Scouts made the decision to allow gay youths into the Scouts. Adults who are gay still cannot be Scout leaders.

Gates was elected president of the Scouts last year. He warned that the ban on gay Scout leaders would lead to challenges in court unless the policy was changed.

"We must deal with the world as it is, not as we might wish it would be," said Gates. He is a former U.S. secretary of defense who was in charge of ending the military's rule against gays. Before, the law did not allow gay and lesbian soldiers to serve in the military.

## Some Churches Favor Ban

Gates' remarks come at an important time for the Scouts. The organization has come under increasing pressure to change its rule about gay Scout leaders. Gay rights supporters said Gates' speech sent a strong signal that the Boy Scouts would permit gay leaders soon. Perhaps, they said, the change would come within the year.

Homosexuality and same-sex marriage have increasingly been accepted by the American public. Same-sex marriage is when two men or two women marry. It is also called gay marriage. The Scouts refused to allow gay leaders in part because of the strong influence of religious groups. Some churches believe that homosexuality is forbidden by the Bible. About 7 out of every 10 Boy Scouts belong to troops sponsored by Mormon, Catholic or other churches.

## Looking For Compromise

In his speech, Gates suggested that every Boy Scout group should decide on its own about gay leaders. His solution would satisfy those who want to end the gay ban. At the same time, groups who don't want gay leaders would not have to accept them.

The Boy Scouts may face lawsuits around the country involving gay leaders. These leaders had been fired or denied a job because they are gay.

In New York, Pascal Tessier is a gay Scout leader. He was hired by the local Scout group even though it isn't allowed by the national Scout leadership. Tessier has hired a law firm to represent him in court if he is fired because he is gay.

The firm has also filed a court complaint against the Denver Boy Scouts. The group had offered a job to a woman and then took it back after it learned she was gay. There are other cases like hers in Ohio, Oklahoma and elsewhere, said Josh Schiller. He is a partner in the law firm.

## Scouts For Equality

Next month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide whether gay couples can marry.

In the past, the Scouts have been sued, but remained firm on not allowing gay leaders. Recently, many states have passed laws banning discrimination against gays.

Some people in the Boy Scouts also oppose the ban on gay leaders. Nationally, 20 local councils have passed a rule protecting gays, said Zach Wahls. He is a Scout and is the head of Scouts for Equality. The group was started to promote gay rights within the Boy Scouts.

## Challenge Won't Go Away

The Boy Scouts know there will be many challenges if they don't begin allowing gay leaders, Wahls said. "They've realized this isn't a fight they want to have in 2015."

On Thursday, Gates said that the Boy Scouts would not punish councils that have hired gay leaders. He also warned that the Boy Scouts cannot keep avoiding the issue.

"The one thing we cannot do is put our heads in the sand and pretend this challenge will go away," Gates said. "Quite the opposite is happening."
