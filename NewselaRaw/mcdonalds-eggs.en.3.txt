The next egg you eat may come from a chicken raised in a roomier barn.

The reason is McDonald's recent decision to switch to "cage-free" eggs. The decision is expected to change the egg business. Each year $9 billion worth of eggs are sold. Right now, egg companies still produce almost all of their eggs in barns full of stacked wire cages.

Animal rights supporters have pushed for more room for the hens that lay the eggs. They want the barns to be cage-free. They think it is better for the hens. Some farmers do not agree. They say it costs more to produce cage-free eggs. They also say it may not be better for the eggs.

McDonald's buys 2 billion eggs each year, so it is hard to ignore. Many other companies have also made a similar switch. Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks are just three. The number of eggs all the companies buy means egg producers will do what the companies ask.

California passed a law requiring more space for egg-laying hens in 2008. Other states have made similar laws since then.

## Cage-Free Future Predicted

"The McDonald's announcement really settles the debate," about the cage-free issue, said Paul Shapiro. He is vice president of farm animal protection for the Humane Society of the U.S. He believes most eggs will be cage-free in the future.

Ken Klippen is the head of the National Association of Egg Farmers. He agrees that the McDonald's decision is huge. He isn't happy, though. His group represents egg farmers, so he wrote to McDonald's. He challenged the idea that giving chickens more room is a good idea. He says letting hens walk around leads to them getting dirty. He says it can be unhealthy for the eggs.

Glenn Hickman has already started changing how he keeps his hens. The Arizona egg farmer responded to McDonald's announcement with plans to build a modern building to hold 2 million hens. Hickman already sells in California. Like other producers who sell in California, he has been moving toward giving hens more room since California's law passed in 2008.

## California Hens Able To Move More

The California law says that hens must have the ability to turn around freely. They have to be able to lie down, stand up and fully extend their limbs. California's law says each bird has to have about 116 square inches.

Before the law passed, Hickman housed several million chickens in stacked wire cages. They are known as battery cages. The small cages leave each bird with less space than a sheet of photocopy paper, or about 90 square inches.

By December, 4 million of his hens will live in larger spaces. The spaces have perches and private areas to lay eggs.

Large egg farms in the Midwest also have made changes. Rose Acre Farms in Indiana has about 25 million hens. It agreed to put larger spaces in any new barns.

## Eggs Are More Expensive

The shift to cage-free has increased costs. The difference between prices in California and other states has also increased, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

This week, the average price for a dozen white, large eggs was around $2.40 in California. That is up by $1.26 from last year, according to the USDA. The U.S. average was $1.78, up about 82 cents from last year.

Bird flu outbreaks this spring have been blamed for much of the price increase. The disease killed more than 42 million hens in the U.S. Midwest.

Egg farmers have warned of big price increases due to the cage-free craze. San Diego, California, egg farmer Frank Hilliker, for example, said he lost several customers after he made the switch.

Klippen said egg producers will fight efforts to spread the cage-free rules. He said McDonald's gave in to "a small group" of customers who support animal rights.
