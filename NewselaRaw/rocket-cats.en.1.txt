If a 16th century German prince was plotting to crush a peasant rebellion, what would he do? What about a general leading an army against the Ottoman Empire? Or someone looking to settle the score with a rival nobleman?

If illustrations are any indication, then they'd use rocket cats.

Illustrations from the 16th century have people scratching their heads because the pictures are of cats and doves with what looks like jet packs strapped to their backs.

The unusual pictures were from a manual on artillery and siege warfare published around 1530. The captions below each illustration are in German. The text helpfully advises military commanders of the time how to use the illustrated animals: "Set fire to a castle or city which you can't get at otherwise."

## Devilish Devices

The drawings recently caught the attention of not only an Australian book blog, but also University of Pennsylvania researchers. The University has since scanned and digitized the illustrations, some in full color.

"I really didn't know what to make of it," said Mitch Fraas, who works at the University of Pennsylvania. "It clearly looks like there's some sort of jet of fire coming out of a device strapped to these animals."

Fraas, a historian and digital humanities expert at the Penn library, set out to unravel the mystery.

So were these unfortunate animals from the 1500s really wearing 20th-century technology?

Fraas' conclusion: No. Obviously.

The work in question was written by artillery master Franz Helm of Cologne. He was believed to have fought in several conflicts against the Turks in south-central Europe at a time when gunpowder was changing warfare.

## "A Harebrained Scheme"

Widely circulated and illustrated by multiple artists, Helm's manual is filled with all sorts of strange and terrible pictures, from bombs packed with shrapnel to missile-like explosive devices studded with spikes â€” and those weaponized cats and birds.

According to Fraas' translation, Helm explained how animals could be used to deliver explosive devices: "Create a small sack like a fire-arrow. If you would like to get at a town or castle, seek to obtain a cat from that place. And bind the sack to the back of the cat, ignite it, let it glow well and thereafter let the cat go, so it runs to the nearest castle or town, and out of fear it thinks to hide itself where it ends up in barn hay or straw it will be ignited."

In other words, capture a cat from enemy territory, attach a bomb to its back, light the fuse and then hope it runs back home and starts a raging fire.

Fraas said he could find no evidence that cats and birds were used in early modern warfare in the way prescribed by Helm.

A good thing, too.

"Sort of a harebrained scheme," Fraas said. "It seems like a really terrible idea, and very unlikely the animals would run back to where they came from. More likely they'd set your own camp on fire."
