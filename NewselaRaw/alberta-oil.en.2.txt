FORT CHIPEWYAN, Canadaâ€” A hundred miles up the Athabasca River, the forest has been leveled by enormous strip mines. Massive shovels pick up 100 tons of earth at a time and dump it into yellow trucks as big as houses.

The dirt contains a fortune in oil.

Oil sands production, as the mining is called, is booming in Alberta. It has enriched local Native Indian villages and provides jobs for thousands of people in places where work is scarce. But there are fears that the oil sands production is polluting the environment. It also may be damaging the health of those in its path.

## A Deadly Choice

The Native Indians face a terrible question.

"Their thinking seems to be 'It's a choice between whether we starve to death or are poisoned to death,'" said John O'Connor, a local doctor.

In the Cree language, "athabasca" means "a place where grass is everywhere." In Alberta, the Athabasca River flows through forests of spruce and birch.

The oil-filled sand along the river's banks is eventually shipped to oil refineries, where it will be processed for gasoline and other fuels. The leftovers remain in miles-long landfills. Air cannons are fired to keep birds from landing on the poisonous ponds.

Debate in the U.S. over the pipeline has mainly focused on whether the oil sands contribute to [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) or spills. But in northeastern Alberta, the issue is more complicated.

In Fort Chipewyan, cancer and other diseases have struck the mostly Cree, Dene and Metis Indian populations. In 2009, the government found that cancer rates were 30 percent higher than normal.

Three weeks ago, government scientists told villagers they had found toxic levels of mercury in the eggs of birds downstream from the oil sands. Fishermen say fish in the lake show bulging eyes and other defects.

Three studies show rising amounts of polluting chemicals in lakes and rivers near the oil sands. Some cause cancer.

## Environmental Woes

Industry officials and the Alberta government insist the chemicals occur naturally.

They also say they are taking steps to protect local communities. Some of the native peoples, known as the First Nations, have hunted and fished here for thousands of years.

The oil industry is paying for a system to monitor pollution. Efforts to remove the harmful effects of the mining can take years, if not decades. Of the thousands of acres mined over 40 years, only 247 acres have been restored.

Canada already is the largest exporter of crude oil to the United States, mainly from oil sands. Officials hope to increase production by 2030 to about 5 million barrels a day from the current 1.9 million barrels. Many of the world's biggest oil companies lease land along the Athabasca River and other parts of eastern Alberta.

If the U.S. approves the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta, oil sands production is expected to increase. Some local residents fear the pipeline would hasten development of the oil sands and cause more pollution.

A 2013 study on lakes near oil sand mines showed increased pollution and ecological change, said Joshua Kurek. He studies at Queen's University in Ontario and is the study's lead author.

The government has decided the oil industry does not have to follow rules to protect wetlands.

Cal Dallas, who works for the government, insisted it is still taking good care of the land.

"No one cares about the environment of our province more than the people who live there," he said.

There were 4,000 possible violations of environmental regulations from 1996 to 2012. Of those, Alberta authorities took actions in 37 cases, according to a July report.

## A Double-Edged Sword

Yet, jobs are scarce. And some native groups have made their peace with oil sands development.

For years, the villagers at Fort MacKay fought each oil sands project. Each time, they lost. By the 1990s, they began to work with the oil industry.

"It's like sleeping next to a huge elephant," said Jim Boucher, chief of the Fort McKay First Nation. "At the end of the day, we have to make the best of it."

When the wind blows from the south, Fort MacKay smells of the mines. But the village has gained millions of dollars from mining. It is building a new youth center, church and theater. Homes are being built in the hills above the village; residents drive Cadillacs and own backyard teepees.

In Fort Chipewyan, a youth center downtown is named for an oil company. Residents fear oil sands development. But they feel they can't stop it.

Alice Rigney wonders whether her breast cancer was related to the mining. She would like to see the waste ponds cleaned up. But the lifelong resident is also realistic: The wages the oil company are offering are too good for Canadians to turn down.

"I don't think we can win. I don't even know what winning looks like," Rigney, who teaches the Dene language. "This oil is just too important for the rest of Canada."
