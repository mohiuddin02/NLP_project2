WASHINGTON â€“ When Barack Obama was running for president, he promised that he would close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Easier said than done. As president, he called the prison "expensive," and wasteful and said it helps create more terrorists. Still, he's failed to shut it down. On April 30, Obama promised that he will go back to the Guantanamo problem, which frustrated him during his first term. His promise raises many questions, some easier to answer than others.

## Q: How long has the Guantanamo detention center been around?

A: Then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced on Dec. 27, 2001, that some prisoners captured in Afghanistan would be held at the 45-square-mile U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The first 20 detainees arrived Jan. 11, 2002.

## Q: Why Guantanamo?

A: Pentagon officials considered a variety of Pacific islands and other remote locations for holding men detained after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Officials eventually turned to Guantanamo, which had been used to house people from Haiti and Cuba who had been picked up on the high seas trying to reach the United States. Officials thought Guantanamo's island location would calm worries about security. Also, since it is part of Cuba, the men held there would not be able to take their case to U.S. courts. However, the Supreme Court later rejected that argument and said they could go to court.

## Q: Who is being held at Guantanamo?

A: Currently, 166 men are detained there, more than half of them from Yemen. Three of the 166 have been convicted of crimes by a military court, seven have been charged with crimes - including the five accused of planning in the 9/11 attacks - and 24 may face criminal charges. Another 86 have been cleared for release or transfer to other countries. Also, 46 face no criminal charges but they were found to be too dangerous to release. At its peak, in May 2003, the facility held about 680 men.

## Q: Why are they called detainees rather than prisoners?

A: The Pentagon says it uses the term for most of the men because they have not been convicted of crimes.

## Q: What are the conditions like?

A: When the first detainees arrived, they were housed in wire enclosures that looked like a backyard dog kennel. Now most detainees are in air-conditioned buildings that look like a maximum-security prison in the United States. The buildings are called camps. Until recently, most of the detainees were in Camp 6, where they were allowed to keep their cell doors open and move freely, watch television and eat together. But in April, detainees covered cameras used to monitor them. So guards forced all the prisoners back into their 6.8-foot-by-12-foot cells. The most secret part of Guantanamo, Camp 7, holds about 15 of the detainees, including those accused of planning the 9/11 attacks. As of Monday, 100 detainees were refusing food; 23 of those are force-fed twice a day through tubes snaked up their noses and down their throats.

## Q: What rules apply to how they are treated?

A: Detainees are supposed to be treated humanely, based on the Geneva Conventions. This international agreement outlines the humane treatment of prisoners of war. Congress also made a law against "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment.

## Q: Does the U.S. Constitution apply to detainees at Guantanamo?

A: To a degree. The Supreme Court ruled in a 2008 decision that Guantanamo detainees had the same constitutional right to get their day in court as prisoners in the United States. The Supreme Court noted that even though Cuba owns the land, the U.S. has had complete control for more than 100 years. The justices decided that meant it was really part of the United States.

## Q: How much does Guantanamo cost to operate?

A: The White House said it spends about $150 million per year to run Guantanamo. That works out to about $800,00 per prisoner. It costs about $30,000 a year to keep someone at a regular prison in the United States. The U.S. has also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the facility since Bush was in the White House.

## Q: What is stopping Obama from closing it and moving the men to U.S. prisons?

A: Since 2009, Congress has made it difficult for the White House to transfer men out of Guantanamo. One law forbids using money from the military to transfer detainees to the United States. It also forbids sending them to an unstable country where the U.S. might not be able to keep track of them.

## Q: How many released Guantanamo detainees have returned to fighting the United States?

A: People are arguing about that. In January, the top U.S. spy reported on the 603 men who had been sent out of Guantanamo. The report found that 97 went back to fighting U.S. forces. Half of those were dead or back in detention. Another 72 were suspected of fighting against U.S. forces.
