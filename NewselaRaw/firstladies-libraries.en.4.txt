It would seem wrong if he just packed up and threw everything away. The papers, photos and records of a president's work are interesting to historians and all Americans. So where does everything get stored?

The answer is at the presidential library. When it is time for a president to leave office, a library is built to preserve his things from the White House that are important to history. These libraries are open to visitors. They allow people to see the history of American presidents up close.

Today, presidential libraries are not just about presidents. The libraries are also about the work and lives of presidents' wives. The wives of American presidents are known as "first ladies."

## First Ladies Have A Special Place

Library exhibits have begun to look at first ladies' achievements more than they used to. It recognizes the important work that first ladies do. It also helps capture the partnership between a president and first lady. At the White House, the president and first lady often work together, even though presidents usually get most of the credit.

In fact, first ladies have a long history of helping to build their husbands' libraries.

The current first lady, Michelle Obama, is a good example. As her husband's time in office ends, she will help plan his library. She will work to make sure the library turns out how she and her husband imagine it.

The library will also include records of Michelle Obama's efforts to help the public. One of her most famous projects is called "Let's Move." It helps children with their nutrition and health.

First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is featured in the library of her husband, President Bill Clinton. An exhibit called "Putting People First" highlights her efforts to improve health care for Americans. Another exhibit includes awards she got for her work in education.

First lady Laura Bush played a big part in planning President George W. Bush's library. Before becoming first lady, she was a librarian. She had a lot of ideas for her husband's library. She helped choose where it would be built and how it should look.

## Shaping The Libraries With Memories

The story goes back much further. In fact, the first presidential library was set up by first lady Sarah Polk.

In 1849, President James Polk left office. He was sick and he died soon after. Sarah Polk then collected his papers, paintings and belongings. She put them in a small room where they could be seen by anyone. This was the first presidential library.

Jacqueline Kennedy is another example. She was President John F. Kennedy's wife. He was killed in 1963 by a man named Lee Harvey Oswald. After his sudden death, his wife had to set up his library. She worked hard to plan it. It was important to her that the library preserve her husband's memory.

Today, first ladies are as involved as ever in the making of presidential libraries. They take part in other ways, too. First ladies have helped presidents shape their goals. Some have become examples of good character for the American people. Others have fought for causes they believe in.
