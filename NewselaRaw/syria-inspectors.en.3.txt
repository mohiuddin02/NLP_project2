BEIRUT â€” United Nations chemical weapons inspectors arrived outside of Damascus on Aug. 26. They were inspecting a part of Syria that was allegedly hit by a poison gas attack last week. Their trip had been delayed a bit by a shooting attack.

The inspectors visited a pair of field hospitals. They also met with witnesses, the U.N. said.

The inspectors traveled to the Muadhamiya district, southwest of Damascus. Shooting by snipers, or long-distance marksmen, initially forced the U.N. vehicles to turn back. A U.N. vehicle was struck in the incident. No one was injured, the U.N. said in a statement. The damaged vehicle was replaced and the mission proceeded.

The U.N. appeared to have worked out an agreement for safe passage with the two warring sides. No details were released. Each side in the conflict blamed the other for the sniper fire. The civil war in Syria began in March 2011.

## Attack Killed Hundreds, Rebels Say

The U.N. planned to lodge a "strong complaint" with both the government and opposition forces about the shooting, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. The inspectors are unarmed. They will continue their work on Aug. 27. Ban vowed that the investigators would be kept safe.

The team is supposed to find out whether chemical weapons were used. It is not meant to determine who used them. The rebels and the government have been trading blame for who was responsible. Many in the West are pushing for a military response. Each side has its own international supporters.

There was no word on whether anything that the inspectors learned Monday supported or contradicted rebel allegations. The opposition to Syria's government said that a poison-gas attack last week killed hundreds of people outside Damascus. The people killed were not soldiers, they said.

Syrian President Bashar Assad strongly denied allegations that his country's forces used the weapons. He did this during an interview with the Russian newspaper Izvestia. His comments were published on Monday.

## Seeking Contaminated Soil

The inspectors traveled to two field hospitals and interviewed witnesses, doctors and people who lived through the attack, Ban said. The inspectors took statements. They also collected unspecified "samples."

Officials previously said that the team would be seeking traces of possibly contaminated soil. They would also collect tissue, hair and other samples from victims. The samples will be taken for laboratory tests. The process could take weeks.

It was not clear why the team initially chose to visit Muadhamiya. About 80 people were reported killed there in last week's suspected chemical attack. But the hardest-hit area was apparently an area in the opposite direction.

An opposition group in Muadhamiya was waiting when the inspectors arrived, according to an activist in the town reached on a video-messaging service. The U.N. experts spoke with doctors and patients at a field hospital. They also took blood and hair samples, the activist said.

Afterward, some in the U.N. group went to visit a mosque that was allegedly hit during the chemical attack last week. The activist said they also visited another reported site of a rocket attack.

## Russia Warns U.S. Over Syria

Amateur video said to be from the inspectors' visit showed blue-helmeted U.N. workers speaking with people and visiting what appeared to be a medical treatment area. Some patients were lying in beds.

Chemical weapons are considered especially bad. They cause harsh suffering along with death.

The situation in Syria is one of several that has the United States at odds with Russia.

The White House said on Sunday there was "very little doubt" that Syrian forces had used poison gas against civilians. The statement appeared to move the U.S. closer to a military strike against Syria in response.

 Russia said Monday that Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had warned his U.S. counterpart, John Kerry, about the "extremely dangerous" results of launching military action against Syria.
