ASHEBORO, N.C. — Last week, the school board in Randolph County, N.C., voted to ban a book. The vote meant that school libraries in the county could not carry Ralph Ellison's novel, "Invisible Man."

The book is famous. Ellison published it in 1952. It is about the challenge of being an African-American during that time.

But a lot of the people who live in the county were embarrassed by the vote. They let the board know that they were angry. Some called the board members names.

Now the board is reconsidering the decision. It is holding a special meeting Wednesday.

The original vote came after the mother of an 11th-grader complained about the book. She said that the book was "too much for teenagers."

## "Laughingstock Of The United States"

The county is about 85 miles northeast of Charlotte. The ban made national news. The local newspaper was flooded with 168 reader comments. Practically all of them ridiculed the board's decision.

One Courier-Tribune reader called the board "the laughingstock of the United States" and "dim-witted."

Another reader called the board "stupid."

A third reader wrote: "I think we should be embarrassed."

Ray Criscoe is the paper's editor. He hasn't published a letter in favor of the ban. So far he hasn't received any that are even close. He said he could not think of another topic that made so many readers respond.

## Librarians Get Involved

The board's timing could not be worse. This week is the American Library Association's annual Banned Books Week. The event celebrates the freedom to read. The association and the Kids' Right to Read Project sent letters to the board. They urged that the ban be lifted.

The book was published in 1952. It is considered one of the greatest books of the 20th century. It looks at how racism affects people who show the behavior and their victims. The narrator is not named. He says he is invisible "simply because people refuse to see me."

Twenty-three people were on a waiting list to check out "Invisible Man" at the main county library. The ban was a prime topic.

"Embarrassed? Of course I am," Pat Dillard said as she made her weekly library visit. "I'm embarrassed not just for our county, but for our entire state. We're going backwards."

Shakema Steele, an Asheboro 10th-grader, said of the ban: "That's just not right. That book is timeless. How can they ban it based on one person's complaint?"

## "A Hard Read"

School board Chairman Tommy McDonald voted to ban the book. He said it was "a hard read."

The book was one of three that juniors at Randleman High School could choose for summer reading. Kimiyutta Parson is the mother of a junior. She sent the board a 12-page letter outlining her objections to "Invisible Man."

"This book is filthier, too much for teenagers," she wrote.

The book includes passages describing adult topics. But several Courier-Tribune readers pointed out that the Bible includes those topics, too.

The Courier-Tribune reported that board members were given copies of the book before the Sept. 16 meeting. It was not clear whether all members had actually read it.

"I doubt the entire board read the book before they decided to ban it," one reader wrote the newspaper. "No worries. No surer way to elevate a book to the Must Read list of teen readers than to ban it."

## Story Update

ASHEBORO, N.C – The Randolph County school board reversed its ban of "Invisible Man" Wednesday night. Members voted 6-1 to return the novel to school bookshelves.

Several said the complaints they got opened their eyes to other viewpoints.

Before Wednesday's vote, board members heard from two teachers. The teachers explained why the book is meaningful. They said that today's students can still relate to the narrator's experiences as a black man in the 1950s.

Board member Tracy Boyle voted for the ban at first. He changed his mind Wednesday night. He choked back tears at the meeting. He explained that his son had been in the military "fighting for those freedoms that I'm here passing a vote to take away."

He added, "Is that right of me? No."
