KLAMATH, Calif. â€” Lauren Alvarado says it simply: "Meth is everywhere in Indian country."

Like many on the Yurok reservation here, she first tried the highly addictive drug methamphetamine at age 12. Legal trouble came at 13 with an arrest for public intoxication. In the years that followed, she relied on charm and tricks to get by, letting her grandmother down often.

But today, at 31, Alvarado and her grandmother have built a new trust. She has been clean for nine months, she said recently, and is "hopeful, more grateful."

Her recovery has come through a novel wellness program. It puts traditional Yurok values to work to heal addicted men and women from California's largest tribe. The Yurok tribe of almost 6,000 lives on ancestral lands along the banks of the Klamath River.

## Earning A Rare Trust

Yurok Tribal Court Chief Judge Abby Abinanti created the wellness program four years ago. Abinati is also a longtime San Francisco County Superior Court Commissioner. This "wellness court" has earned a rare trust with the criminal justice system in Del Norte and Humboldt counties.

Some tribal members charged with nonviolent crimes linked to drugs or alcohol come as a condition of probation, in which they are released but remain under court supervision. Others are sent to Abinanti's court before trial. If they succeed, charges are dropped.

Other participants find their way to the program on their own. They hope that the cultural focus and village-style responsibility to their communities will work where other approaches have not.

Alvarado was one of those. She sought out wellness court coordinator Anthony Trombetti after a minor arrest left her facing a choice.

"Either I would keep messing up and I would be in jail, or I would have to be better for myself," Alvarado said. "I chose myself."

Wellness court staff found Alvarado a job assisting a doctoral student who had come back to the reservation to research mid-sized carnivores. One fall afternoon, the two women sat together before the tribal council. Alvarado helped explain the strips of land they'd marked, the bones they had found, and the maps she helped create.

She was so nervous, Alvarado later acknowledged, she thought she would throw up. But it didn't show. She beamed with pride as tribal chairman Thomas O'Rourke asked her to name her father's village.

## Fall, Crack, Find Nourishment

For participants who have taken the greatest steps toward self-discovery, Trombetti presents a large, hand-carved, redwood acorn. The symbolism is strong: Like the participants, the acorn must fall, crack, and find nourishment before it can flourish.

Alvarado is one of just two people to receive an acorn. She keeps it on the dresser in the sober-living home she is managing in Crescent City. She credits Trombetti and other wellness program staff for her success. But, she has special praise for Abinanti, who sits around a common table with court participants and never rejects a call for help.

Lori Nesbitt works for the wellness court. She pores over county jail logs to identify those who need help. She snoops with aunts and uncles of court participants to get the lowdown on how they're really doing.

"People say, 'That's intrusive,' but it's not, it's how we do things," Nesbitt said. Aunts and uncles have particular authority in Yurok culture to be strict with youngsters, she noted.

Not long ago, after a girl bolted from drug treatment, Nesbitt and Abinanti piled into a car to look for her, and found her at the Crescent City McDonald's. She tried to run away, but then Abinanti showed her who was with them: her grandmother and aunt. She stopped in her tracks.

Tribal members are scattered through the remote coastal mountains that hug the river. It is Abinanti's staff who fetch them for state court appearances, transport them to drug treatment and make sure they stay. If they are allowed visits with their children, the tribe gets them there.

## Regalia For The Jump Dance

Rebecca Salinas, 32, sought out the program after hearing of Trombetti's group counseling sessions. Like Alvarado, she and her brother were caught in the inter-generational trap of addiction: Their parents sold methamphetamine when they were kids and they followed suit.

Clean for nearly 11 months now, Salinas recently told Abinanti during a court appearance that she had landed a job. When she was using meth, she lost custody of her four children. Overjoyed, she reported that her second-oldest, age 10, would be coming home to her after Christmas.

After her appearance, the tribal court's SUV pulled up to take Salinas on the long drive to pick up two of her girls for a weekend visit. The next morning, they sat around the kitchen table of her sober-living house, beading.

As a young girl, Salinas had stored away beads to make Yurok ceremonial regalia and dresses to pass on through the generations. The clothes were believed to be alive with their own spirit.

In wellness court, Trombetti had urged her to get back to it. Now, she is working on regalia for the summer Jump Dance.

"I knew I had to be clean and sober to do it," Salinas said. "Now I can make those dresses for my kids, and pass them on."
