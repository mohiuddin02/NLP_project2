HERSHEY, Pa. — Student Eugene Toner has been learning how to restore antique cars. Today, though, he has a problem. He had just stomped on the foot-operated ignition of a 1916 Scripps-Booth Model D automobile. The engine sputtered and coughed, but would not catch. Here at The Elegance, one of the nation's most prestigious gatherings of antique automobiles, the exquisitely restored cars are expected to run, not just sit pretty.

Toner's instructor lifted the hood to adjust the choke linkage. A few tense moments later, the Scripps-Booth roared to life, allowing 24-year-old Toner to pull out of his spot and begin a triumphant circuit around the show grounds.

## Passion And Pistons

You have to expect some car trouble when your ride is a one-of-a-kind classic like the Scripps, which, after all, had not been driven since 1959. It sat idle for decades until students at Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport got hold of it this spring and got it back on the road.

"I can't say enough about our students' passion," said restoration instructor Roy Klinger.

Passion is what the hobby desperately needs from young people right now.

In 2012 Penn College began an antique vehicle restoration major. It became one of just a handful of degree programs around the country teaching young people how to restore and maintain North America's fleet of more than 10 million classic cars.

## "A Huge Void"

"We have a huge void," said Earl Mowrey, who heads youth development at the Antique Automobile Club of America. "There's been a generation or a generation and a half of missed opportunity."

Mowrey and others worry that vital skills like metal shaping and upholstering might be lost unless young people with a fondness for old cars are enticed into the field. The multibillion-dollar industry recognizes the problem of its aging workforce and has been throwing money at training programs and scholarships.

The efforts are beginning to pay off. The first graduating class at Penn College had eight students, and 23 more are on track to complete the program next year. McPherson College in Kansas, whose much larger program has been around for nearly 40 years, also reports increased student interest.

## Lots Of Jobs

With demand high, graduates usually have a job waiting for them at a shop, museum or private collection.

"There are jobs everywhere, because people are retiring," said Diane Fitzgerald, national director of the Hagerty Education Program at America's Car Museum in Tacoma, Washington. Her program has provided $2.7 million in training and scholarship money since 2005.

As a high school student, Jay Rhoads wanted to work on classic cars for a living. However, his guidance counselor told him to consider auto restoration as a hobby, not a career.

Rhoads took her advice. He joined the National Guard and served in Afghanistan, then got a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. Eventually he realized he did not want a career in law enforcement.

The cars were calling.

## Muscle Car Makes His Heart Race

So Rhoads enrolled at Penn College. This spring, he found himself under the hood of a classic muscle car, a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 with a powerful, growling, 450-horsepower engine.

"Just sitting behind the wheel and starting it up is enough to make your heart race," said Rhoads, 27. The prospect of a good job also quickens his pulse: "It's a hot, growing industry right now."

Across the shop sat the century-old Scripps-Booth. The black town car was built to order for Eleanora Sears, a tennis star and descendant of Thomas Jefferson, for the princely sum of $17,500 — 40 times the cost of a Ford Model T and more than $380,000 in today's dollars.

The Scripps' unusual pedigree posed a challenge. Coming from a museum, it was already preserved. However, "there was no manual, no book, no resource that we could lean on to make this car run," said instructor Shaun Hack.

## Adventure Under The Hood

So the budding technicians stuck to the basics: fuel, air, compression, spark. They replaced worn wiring, tinkered with the carburetor, made new gaskets. Finally, on the last day of class, they got the engine to fire for the first time in more than 50 years. Comedian and talk show host Jay Leno, a noted classic car collector, came calling and took the Scripps for a spin.

Weeks later, the newly road-worthy Scripps took its place at The Elegance, where 74 of the world's finest automobiles went on display and drew throngs of auto enthusiasts. The cars ranged from the 1964 Aston Martin driven by James Bond in the movie "Goldfinger" to a mammoth 1949 Daimler DE36 drophead coupe that won Best in Show.

Donned in period garb, students chatted with show-goers who stopped to admire the Scripps, take pictures and ask questions. When it came time for the awards ceremony — the Scripps got a participation award — the show's announcer talked up the students' work.

"It's nice to see somebody under 100 that likes (antique) cars," he joked.
