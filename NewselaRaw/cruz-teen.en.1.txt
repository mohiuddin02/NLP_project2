WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” It's the start of a new school year, and C.J. Pearson is busy.

The conservative social media star from Georgia is recruiting fellow teenagers across the country to help Texas Senator Ted Cruz win the Republican presidential nomination.

He's also running for re-election as student council president and just started eighth grade.

Coreco JaQuan Pearson, 13, is the chairman of Teens for Ted. His mission: persuade high schoolers to spread the gospel of Cruz to eligible voters who care about them. He would also like to persuade their parents.

## The Power Of the Internet Generation

"The Internet allows really anyone to have a voice and build a following, and C.J. is a great example," said Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler. "He can make a real difference. He's kind of the model that we want others to follow."

C.J. has an immense social media following that he attracted in February. When former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani questioned how much President Barack Obama loved America, C.J. defended Giuliani with a YouTube video.

Conservative news websites jumped on it and applauded the teenager who stood up to the president. What followed was 2 million YouTube views, 36,000 Twitter followers, Fox News interviews and plenty of angry feedback.

## An Early Entry Into The Political Arena

C.J., an only child, lives in Grovetown, Georgia, with his grandparents, Willie Pearson, 51, who works for the state energy department, and Robin Pearson, 54, who stays at home.

C.J. said politics first piqued his interest in 2008 when his first-grade class held a mock presidential election. He was awed by Senator John McCain's military service and started following political news.

He decided in early 2014 that he wanted to be a political strategist, or planner. But he didn't become a Republican until he started learning about the party's principles.

"Government that governs least governs best," C.J. said. "Conservatism resonates with me because I've seen firsthand the damaging effects big government can have on our America and to be quite frank, I don't like it one bit." As an example, C.J. points to Common Core education standards, which are controversial in part because they were strongly encouraged by the Democratic Obama administration.

## First Stop: Local School Board

C.J. said he plans to join the local school board as soon as he graduates from high school, and then work behind the scenes in politics after college before he runs for office. Though his relatives are Democrats and want Vice President Joe Biden to run in 2016, C.J. said they support his work with Cruz, even if they won't vote for him.

Before his ascent to stardom, C.J. volunteered for local Republicans Senator David Perdue, Representative Rick Allen and Governor Nathan Deal in 2014. He then founded Young Georgians in Government and persuaded state legislators to introduce a bill to lower election ages for the state house.

Now, C.J. is tapping into his fan base for Cruz, seeking out other politically minded youngsters to build a national network. They'll use Twitter and Instagram to sell their peers on the senator.

And those teens can then lean on the eligible voters they interact with every day.

C.J. said Cruz has a natural appeal to teens: He drives elders crazy.

## Young, Bold And Caring

"He's a bold person. He's really someone who's led on issues and stood up to everyone," said C.J., comparing Cruz to current Republican front-runner Donald Trump. "That's something a lot of young teenagers are looking for."

Cruz said something similar recently when he announced C.J.'s role as chairman of Teens for Ted.

"Young people are looking for someone who does more than just talk a good game. They want someone who has walked the walk," said Cruz, recounting his 2013 fight against increasing the federal government's borrowing limit, which he ultimately lost. "They're looking for a fighter. But most importantly, they're looking for someone who cares."

C.J. said he also appreciates Cruz's willingness to get a little silly, like when he twirled around in the name of freedom for the news and entertainment website BuzzFeed. Another time, he cooked bacon on the barrel of a machine gun for a site called IJ Review.

After meeting Cruz at a state party convention, C.J. contacted David Sawyer, a regional director for the Cruz campaign, about getting involved.

The campaign made sure C.J. and his family were comfortable with the role and then welcomed him on board, said Tyler, the campaign spokesman.

## Counting On Teen's Influence With Peers

C.J.'s network can help Cruz stand out to voters in a crowded Republican field, the spokesman said. If stump speeches and ads don't resonate with voters, their children or younger siblings might.

"The message is, 'I am the future and the future is in your hands, and I'm really encouraging you to vote for Ted Cruz,'" Tyler said.

C.J. predicted that 17-year-olds soon eligible to vote could be more reliable than college students in Iowa. The college students are more concerned with exams than the ballot.

He said if he's able to reach these teenagers on caucus night, when party leaders meet to select their candidates, the teenagers will be voting there along with their parents.
