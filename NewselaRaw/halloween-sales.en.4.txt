It's the end of October. Time to get dressed up in celebrate Halloween, right? But the U.S. economy is not doing as well as people would like. That is scaring some shoppers.

Anna Harris of St. Paul, Minn., is among those cutting back this Halloween. "Because I have less money," she explained.

Still, Harris plans on celebrating. She will dress up as Catwoman for two parties. At the St. Paul Wal-Mart store last week, she was deciding between two masks. One was a black-satin cat mask with sequins. The other was a leopard mask. It came with a matching kitty tail. Both cost about $5. She plans on spending another $5 on makeup.

The economy measures the amount of business going on in the country. A recession is a drop in the economy. There was a big one that ended a few years ago. But things have not gotten better as quickly as expected.

## More People Will Spend Less Money

For retailers, Halloween is an important bridge between the two biggest events of the year: back-to-school and Christmas buying seasons. There have been early signs that shoppers are gloomy. Still, 158 million shoppers plan to celebrate Halloween in some manner this year. Giving out candy to trick-or-treaters will be the most popular thing to do, of course.

"While we are expecting people to cut back on their spending a bit this Halloween, there's no sense it will be a bust," said Kathy Grannis. She works for the National Retail Federation. The NRF is a group that represents retailers such as stores.

"It's a muddy picture," said George John. He teaches at the University of Minnesota. His subject is how to sell things. In terms of sales, "We're trucking along. We're not falling off a cliff, but we're not surging upward, either," John added.

The NRF sent out a survey recently. It said that nearly nine in 10 people plan to spend less on Halloween items this season than they did last year. Total spending on the holiday is expected to reach $6.9 billion nationwide this year. That's about $75.03 a person. Each person spent almost $5 more last year.

About a quarter of the shoppers surveyed said they are spending less because of the economy.

Some Halloween fans plan on cutting back by just buying a piece or two. They will get something like fake hair or just a mask, instead of a complete costume.

Target Corp. took advantage of that idea. It teamed up with fashion and costume designer Chris March for a series of striking wigs. They serve as the centerpiece of the retailer's Halloween collection. March designed eight styles: Geisha, Greaser, Starlet, Witch, Medusa, Monster Bride, Mohawk and Afro. Each sells for $20 or less.

## Dressing Up The Dog

Not all retailers are reporting Halloween-spending jitters. The NRF survey said shoppers nationwide are expected to spend a little over $1 billion on children's costumes. They will also spend $1.2 billion on adult costumes.

"We're definitely not seeing people spending less," said Roberta Bonoff. She runs the Minneapolis-based children's store Creative Kidstuff. "People are still buying. Kids are kids, and they celebrate Halloween. No matter what goes on in the world, people will spend on their kids."

Among the favorites at the her stores are police, firefighter, vampire and magician costumes. Plus, smaller items are hot this season. These are things like spider-web earrings and people paints.

Another area where shoppers are less likely to cut back: pet costumes.

About 13.8 percent of those surveyed for NRF say they will take extra time to find the "perfect costume" for their pet. Shoppers are expected to spend $330 million on pet costumes.

Google Shopping listed several popular doggie costumes. They included hot dog, Wonder Woman, Ewok and matador get-ups.
