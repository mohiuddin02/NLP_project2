More than a year ago, Jeramey Winfield graduated from college. He still does not have a full-time job.

In fact, he said, he has had very few interviews.

"I had this vision of helping my mom out, since she struggled to raise five of us. I wanted to give her some relief," Winfield said. He is the first person in his family to attend college.

More people have jobs right now in the United States than they have had in years. However, recent college graduates are struggling to find work. For young black men and women, the job search has been especially tough.

## Where Are The Jobs?

According to a new research study, it is harder for blacks to find a job. They are more likely to work in a job that does not pay much and does not require a college degree. Also, they are paid less than white workers with the same experience.

Science, technology, engineering and math are winners in the job market. However, even blacks who studied them had a hard time finding work, said John Schmitt. He helped write a new report. It is called "A College Degree is No Guarantee."

"We are looking at a group of people who did everything right," Schmitt said. "They graduated high school like they were told. They went to college and graduated."

Still, they are more likely to be jobless than white people, he said.

Like Winfield, many of these graduates were the first in their family to attend college. They may feel pressure to be successful. They may also need to help support their family. All of this makes it very important for them to find jobs.

## "So Much To Give"

There are many reasons for the job gap. Black college graduates may not know people who can help them find jobs. More importantly, employers may treat them unfairly because they are black.

Employers are more likely to offer a job to a white person, Schmitt said. More than twice as many white graduates found jobs than black graduates.

Anita Jenke is with the Career Transitions Center of Chicago. She said that some of the black graduates come from poor communities. They do not have the money to get to interviews. Sometimes they lack a working cellphone or Internet.

"These kids have so much to give," Jenke said. "They are so motivated, so personable and committed to making it." They have so many good skills, she said. Many of them want to work to make the world a better place. "They just need an opportunity."

## Working Harder To Be More Successful

Winfield graduated from Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire. He was a star student and began the school's first gospel choir.

"Jeramey is just a wonderful person who made our campus a better place," said Tom Galligan. He is the college's president and became friends with Winfield.

Winfield was very successful in college. That is part of the reason he cannot understand why he has had such a hard time finding a job.

"I've always gone above and beyond," he said. But now he asks himself, "Am I not good enough? What's wrong with me?"

Now, Winfield earns money from working with kids at his former high school. He also sometimes fills in as a substitute teacher. The rest of the time, he volunteers as a youth leader at his church and looks for work.

Winfield said he feels rejected by the working world. But it has "pushed me to go harder working at my high school and my church," he said. "I'm still a success to the people here."
