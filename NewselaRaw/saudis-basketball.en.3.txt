JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia â€” In the Middle Eastern country of Saudi Arabia, there are many things a woman is not allowed to do. Now, a group of women and girls in the kingdom are challenging tradition by playing basketball.

Women's basketball is becoming popular in Saudi Arabia. Saudi women are using the sport to push for greater rights on and off the basketball courts.

Lina Almaeena started the first women's basketball team here 11 years ago.

"We are an activist team," said Almaeena.

In 2006, Jiddah United became the first sports club in Saudi Arabia to include women. The women promoted the sport at a time when the idea of women playing basketball was unthinkable.

## The Running Rebels

For the players, basketball is not merely a sport. It's also an act of rebellion. In Saudi Arabia, strict religious people do not believe that women and girls should exercise. Physical education is still not taught to girls in Saudi public schools.

There are rules about what women can wear. They cannot be seen by men while jogging in sweat pants. They can't be seen wearing tight or short shorts. Most women in Saudi Arabia hide their hair and face with a covering known as the niqab. All women are required to wear a loose black dress known as the abaya in public.

Nevertheless, Saudi women's basketball is on the rise. Women from the very religious kingdom are even playing in other Arab countries. Hadeer Sadagah, 20, started playing eight years ago with Almaeena at Jiddah United. She now plays at the college level for the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.

"I wouldn't be the person I am today without the sport and the team," she said. "It made me more social. It made me confident."

## No League Of Their Own

At a basketball practice in Jiddah, girls as young as 4 years old took shots and ran on open-air basketball courts behind gated concrete walls. Boys played in nearby courts. The children and their coaches stopped for daily prayers.

Almaeena says basketball is becoming popular among Saudi girls because it offers the camaraderie of a team sport. Society also sees basketball as more acceptable than other sports for girls. The girls can practice in loose, traditional clothes.

The sport has grown into a network of teams in different cities. No proper league exists. Women's teams play in private tournaments.

Even in Jiddah, women's basketball still faces many challenges. For one, the kingdom has rules about keeping men and women apart.

Women often struggle to find places to train. They are not allowed to attend matches in stadiums.

In Jiddah, the older female players practice and play in a female-only gym. They only play tournaments in front of other women. Even their male coaches do not attend games.

It wasn't until 2012 that Saudi Arabia sent its first female competitors to the Olympics. That year, they sent two women. But two years later, the kingdom again sent only men.

## Parents Encourage Players

After Almaeena's team played a tournament in Jordan in 2009, Saudi newspapers attacked them for not wearing traditional abayas. They printed pictures of them in modest track suits. They were labeled "immoral," Almaeena said.

It makes sense that Jiddah would become the home of women's basketball in Saudi Arabia. The coastal city is much more open than other Saudi cities like the capital, Riyadh.

Jiddah created public spaces where women and girls walk alongside men in sporty black robes. This is rare in Saudi Arabia. Saudi women usually exercise in private.

Even in Jiddah, though, it is mostly rich women who play sports.

A club like Jiddah United costs around $130 a month. Women also have to pay for a driver to get there, because Saudi women are not allowed to drive.

For now, women's basketball in Saudi Arabia is far from mainstream. But for players and their parents, it is a welcome way for girls to exercise and build confidence.

Alaa AlShuwayer recently checked out a basketball practice in Jiddah. She was considering signing up her two young daughters.

"There's nothing wrong with girls or boys playing sports," she said. "I'd rather they play sports than buy them dresses and earrings."
