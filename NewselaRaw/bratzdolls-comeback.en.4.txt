Bratz dolls first came out 15 years ago. They were known for their big heads and big lips. The company that makes them is called MGA Entertainment. It says Bratz are coming back with a new look. MGA has new ideas to make the dolls better.

## Not As Popular Any More

Bratz dolls used to be very popular. However, people buy fewer of them now. There are two reasons that sales are slow. First, MGA Entertainment started to fight with Mattel, Inc. Mattel is the company that makes Barbie dolls. Barbies are also very popular with girls. These two companies went to court. Second, kids interest in toys changes very fast. A toy that was popular 15 years ago might not be popular now. So MGA gave Bratz a new look.

The new Bratz look different than older dolls. Today's dolls have less makeup. Some of the Bratz dolls have cellphones.

## Dolls With An App

Isaac Larian is in charge of MGA Entertainment. He helps create Bratz. Isaac said Bratz has had to change over the years. Girls want different kinds of toys than they used to. 

The new Bratz dolls are for today's modern girl. There is a #SelfieSnaps doll. It comes with a tiny camera. There are YouTube videos with Bratz dolls. There is an app, too. 

## Bratz Against Barbie

MGA Entertainment and Mattel both sell dolls. The companies are fighting. MGA Entertainment is a newer company. Some people who buy Bratz used to buy Barbies instead. The companies are fighting in court. They both want more customers.

Mattel says that MGA stole the idea for Bratz from them. MGA said Mattel sent spies into their business. Both companies say these things never happened. 

There are many different toys to buy from the toy store. Bratz dolls look new and different. The company hopes they will succeed. 

"It's a super brand," Isaac said. "It will be around forever."
