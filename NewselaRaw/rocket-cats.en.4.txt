Pictures from hundreds of years ago have people talking. The pictures show cats and birds with what look like modern-day bombs strapped to their backs.

The strange pictures of the animals were from a book. The book was a guide on weapons and war. It was published around the year 1530.

Words at the bottom of each drawing tell what the pictures are about. The words are in German.

The book tried to tell army commanders about how to use the animals. They were supposed to be used in wars. They could strap the weapons or bombs to the animals. Then, the animals could start fires in an enemy castle or city.

## Some Strange Pictures ...

The pictures fascinated people from all around the world. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania were very interested in the pictures, too.

The researchers scanned each of the drawings, some in full color, into computers. Because they are online, more people can look at them.

Mitch Fraas works at the University of Pennsylvania. He said that when he first saw the drawings he didn't know what to think of them.

Fraas thought the pictures looked strange. That's because the animals in the pictures had fire coming out of the gear strapped to their backs.

Were animals from the 1500s really wearing technology used today?

Fraas says definitely not.

A man named Franz Helm wrote the book. He knew a lot about weapons. He was believed to have fought in many battles.

When Helm was alive, gunpowder was changing the way wars were fought. Gunpowder is a material that can explode.

## ... And Even Stranger Advice

Helm's book was popular back then and more than one artist helped draw the pictures in it.

The book shows cats and birds with weapons strapped to them. It explained how animals could be used to fight enemies.

The book says to find and take an animal from an enemy's land. Then it recommends strapping something to the animal that will start a large fire.

Helm thought that once the animal had the weapon on its back, it would run home. Once home, the gear on the animal's back would start a raging fire.

But Fraas said he could not find any proof that this happened 480 years ago. He found no proof that animals were used to cause harm.

It's a good thing, too, because Fraas said that it's "really a terrible idea."

He said it's "very unlikely the animals would run back to where they came from."

Instead they would probably stay put, Fraas said. That would mean that a fire would start exactly where it wasn't supposed to start.
