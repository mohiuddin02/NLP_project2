If the University of Missouri was the spark, then the fire didn't take long to spread.

On Nov. 10, the president and chancellor of the university resigned and since then, protesters have organized at more than 100 colleges and universities nationwide. Social media sites have been buzzing with voices of passion. What began as a grievance over racism on the campus of Missouri has evolved into a movement.

Inspired by the marches in Ferguson, Missouri, and Black Lives Matter, students across the nation are taking to social media to question the institutions they once trusted.

The students are calling for racial and social reforms on their campuses, and they are borrowing tactics of the past — hunger strikes, sit-ins and lists of demands. Together, the students have found a voice to address their frustrations, hurt and rage.

## Officials Hear Calls For Diversity

Their actions are not going unnoticed. 

Last week, the dean of students at Claremont McKenna College stepped down. Members of the campus protested that the president was not supportive of minorities, which caused her resignation. 

Occidental College in California is reacting to unrest as well. On Tuesday, college President Jonathan Vetch said he and other administrators are considering ways to make the campus more open and accepting of black students. They are thinking about creating a black studies major and offering more diversity training.

Students at the University of Southern California have proposed similar plans to improve their school. They are petitioning for the school to hire a top administrator to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.

Nationwide, complaints of racism are spreading online. Universities of all types are facing the question of how to react.

## Protests Have Played Historic Role

For decades, students have helped drive social change in America, if not the world. According to University of California President Janet Napolitano, colleges have been an important part of reforms. Campuses, she said, have historically been places where social issues in the United States are raised and where many voices are heard.

Over the decades, student protests have shifted attitudes in the country on a variety of issues, including civil rights, the Vietnam War and nuclear weapons. Today's actions are borrowing from tactics of the past.

Although some of the strategies may seem familiar, it is the speed and the urgency of today's protests that are different.

"What is unique about these issues is how social media has changed the way protests take place on college campuses," said Tyrone Howard, associate dean of equity, diversity and inclusion at the University of California, Los Angeles. "A protest goes viral in no time flat. With Instagram and Twitter, you're in an immediate news cycle. This was not how it was 20 or 30 years ago."

## Students Realize New Power

Howard also believes that the president's resignation at the University of Missouri has encouraged students on other campuses to raise their voices.

"A president stepping down is a huge step," he said. "Students elsewhere have to wonder, 'Wow, if that can happen there, why can't we bring out our issues to the forefront as well?'"

Shaun Harper, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education, agrees. The resignation of two top Missouri administrators, Harper said, showed students around the country that they have power they may not have realized before.

The protests show "we're all together and we have the power to make the change we deserve," said Lindsay Opoku-Acheampong, a senior at Occidental.

According to senior Dalin Celamy, the events are affirming and remind students that they're not crazy. Celamy said it's a signal that this type of injustice is "happening to people who are just like you all over the country."

Celamy and other students are watching the protests unfolding across the nation now, and thinking of the unrest decades earlier.

## Tactics Echo 1960s

Elements of the 1960s demonstrations come through in today's actions, said Robert Cohen, a professor at New York University and author of a book about Mario Savio, who led the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley in the 1960s.

"The tactical dynamism of these nonviolent protests and the public criticism of them are in important ways reminiscent of the 1960s," Cohen said. He said that today's protests, like those in the '60s, are memorable because they are pushing for change and sparking dialogue.

The targets of these protests are the obvious and subtle forms of racism and inequity that affect students' lives. However, the theme of the protests resonates with the recent incidents of intolerance and racial inequity on the streets of America.

Campuses are microcosms of society, according to Howard, and are often comparable in terms of representation and opportunity. Students are wanting more representation, acceptance and inclusion.

"As a black person, I think black people are just fed up. It's time out for ignoring these issues," said Harper, of the University of Pennsylvania. 

## Sensitivity Clashes With Free Speech

While protests in the 1960s helped create specific protections for universities today, such as Title IX, which guarantees equal access for all students to any educational program or activity receiving financial assistance from the federal government, a gap has widened over the years between students and administrators over perceptions of bias.

Institutions often valued for their support of free speech find themselves wrestling with the prospect of limiting free speech. But to focus on what is or isn't politically correct avoids the more important issues, Cohen said, which are whether campuses are diverse enough or how to reduce racism.

Occidental student Raihana Haynes-Venerable has heard criticism that modern students are too sensitive, but she argues that subtle forms of discrimination still have a profound effect, such as women making less than men and fewer minorities getting jobs.

"This is the new form of racism," she said.
