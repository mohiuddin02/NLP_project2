BERLIN — England wants its bear back.

Not just any bear, of course. The bear in question is none other than Winnie-the-Pooh, the famous talking bear created by English writer A.A. Milne in the 1920s. Since then, Pooh and his friends have become the subject of countless television shows and movies and are found in stuffed animal collections everywhere.

Before he was famous, though, Winnie-the-Pooh was a yellow stuffed bear that belonged to Milne's son Christopher Robin. The author wrote the stories about the imaginary world his son shared with his animals. The original Pooh has been in the United States since 1947. Now, England wants him back.

## An English Bear In New York

Pooh's story is long and complicated. The bear's original owner, the real-life Christopher Robin Milne, kept Pooh until 1947, at which point he gave the bear to the American publisher of his father's stories. He joked at the time that since he was an adult, it was time to give up his childhood companion.

Pooh stayed in the publisher's office until 1987 and was then donated to the New York Power Authority, which handed it over to the New York Public Library. Pooh has lived at the library ever since.

But Winnie-the-Pooh is an English bear, not a New Yorker. British newspaper The Times of London published an article recently arguing that the bear should be returned to its homeland. This might seem like a small matter to many. Winnie-the-Pooh is just a stuffed animal, after all. For some people in England, Pooh is not just any stuffed animal, but a symbol of childhood and an important part of English culture.

The effort to return Pooh to England is hardly a new cause. According to some, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair even discussed it with former President Bill Clinton.

## Pooh Is Quite Comfortable

The Times once again made the case for the return of Pooh. First, the newspaper questioned how Pooh came to live in America in the first place. The article noted that Pooh "was apparently not paid for and the English people were not consulted on its relocation across the ocean."

The Times added: "It is obvious then that Winnie-the-Pooh, whatever else he is, is not an American."

The newspaper argued that Pooh would be given a warm welcome in England, imagining a specially built museum in East Sussex, a county in southeastern England. The museum would be near the Five Hundred Acre Wood, the real-life forest that the imaginary Hundred Acre Wood was based on. The Times argued that this would be a better home for Pooh than the New York Public Library, where the bear is currently on display "in the basement."

Greece has used the same argument with Britain over the Elgin Marbles. The statues were sent, but not by the Greeks, to Britain from Athens in the early 1800s. They remain in the British Museum.

The New York Public Library feels differently, however. Angela Montefinise, a library spokeswoman, said Pooh is comfortable where he is.

She said that Pooh's so-called "basement" display, a part of the library's research collection, is a place of pride. Pooh and friends "live in our Children's Center" at the library. The collection also includes treasures such as original copies of William Shakespeare's plays, a Bible made on the first-ever printing press, Charles Dickens' writing desk and a lock of Mary Shelley's hair. She wrote "Frankenstein." There is also a copy of the Declaration of Independence.

## The Pooh Tug Of War

Montefinise gave another reason for not moving Pooh. She said that the bear, who is nearly 100 years old, is fragile. Montefinise admits that it is a nice idea to send Pooh back to his hometown for a visit, but the bear might not survive the trip.

Also, the English are not the only ones with strong feelings for Winnie-the-Pooh. He matters a great deal to many New Yorkers, too.

Montefinise said that it is common to see adults get very emotional when they first see the stuffed animals. There have even been marriage proposals in front of the display case. "The librarians themselves leave Winnie a pot of honey and a red balloon every year on his birthday — he is a cherished part of everyday life at (the library)," she explained.

Still, The Times insisted that England and Pooh are meant to be together. Winnie-the-Pooh is a proud part of English culture, it said. The newspaper urged Americans to think about what it feels like for the English to see Pooh on display overseas. The article compared Pooh, a British cultural treasure, to "Moby Dick," one of the great American novels. "Imagine what it would be like if the original Moby Dick were to be displayed in, say, a Chinese museum," The Times wrote.
