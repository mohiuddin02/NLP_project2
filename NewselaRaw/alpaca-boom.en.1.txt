CORVALLIS, Ore. — Alpacas with innocent eyes gaze out from stalls with wood shavings on the ground at the large-animal hospital at Oregon State University.

These animals, related to camels, draw out even more sympathy from observers who know what they've gone through. According to authorities, they were starving to death.

There are 15 that need special care, and 160 more that are well enough to be in outdoor pens in a field owned by the university.

Last week, Shari Bond and Jackie Glover drove down to begin finding homes for the 175 extremely skinny alpacas that were seized by the Polk County Sheriff's Office.

## Sheriff Saves Starving Alpacas

It's the biggest job ever for the nonprofit organization Cross Creek Alpaca Rescue, which the two women founded four years ago.

"Look, you can see her backbone," says Bond, pointing to a skinny alpaca.

Bond means that this alpaca is so thin that even after more than a month of being fed by the Sheriff's Office, her spine is still showing, when in a healthy animal it wouldn't.

But at least it's better than in late December, when the sheriff got permission from the court to take over the alpacas at Jocelyn's Alpaca Ranch in nearby Falls City.

At that time "you could see ribs and hip bones," Bond said.

The sight of alpacas is familiar to those taking a country drive in the Pacific Northwest.

Washington and Oregon, with respectively 20,000 and 16,000 registered alpacas, are second and third in alpaca population in the U.S. Ohio is No. 1 with 28,000.

The first alpacas arrived in the U.S. from the Peruvian mountains in the mid-1980s. The animals were valued for their shiny fur which does not bother people allergic to sheep wool and other fibers.

People could make money selling the fur, but also by breeding and selling valuable animals. A female could sell for $70,000, a male for about $30,000.

A TV commercial made by the alpaca industry showed an older couple having coffee and happily watching their herd of alpacas.

The wife says, "I step out the front door and I'm at work – it's a wonderful business."

But one agricultural economics expert wonders if the prices for alpacas have climbed too high too quickly.

## "Things Got Out Of Hand"

Representatives of the alpaca industry say that is not the case.

"I honestly believe that what may have happened in that ranch in Oregon is that it started off with the best of intentions and then things got out of hand," said Chris Sturgeon, president of the Pacific Northwest Alpaca Association.

Sturgeon and his wife, Elise, are therapists who also own an alpaca ranch. They say the market for alpacas is strong.

He points to a male alpaca on his farm that he says is worth $350,000.  Sturgeon's website says that price was set in 2006.

In December, when police arrived at the ranch owned by Jocelyn and Robert Silver, they found 16 dead alpacas and 20 more that died later. Tests revealed that many of them had starved to death.

Each of the Silvers has been charged in court with animal neglect. They have pleaded not guilty.

When contacted by phone, Robert Silver, 73, says he has receipts to show the animals had been fed hay.

Silver says he and his wife got into the alpaca business after she went to a livestock show and fell in love with them.

He says they began in 2005 to 2006, and eventually spent $320,000 for a total of about 50 animals, which averages out to $6,400 per alpaca.

Building a barn, paying for alpaca food, and other expenses pushed the Silvers' total cost to $750,000.

"It was our life's savings," Silver says.

He said they hoped their female alpacas would give birth to babies, which they could sell for a profit.

"We never were able to sell any," Silver says.

## Going To New Homes

By last year, they had to sell females for $1,000 each. They were losing a lot of money.

Now, Silver is warning others that it is not so easy to make money in the alpaca business.

"You have to be independently wealthy. It has to be a labor of love," he says.

Bond, of the alpaca rescue organization, had heard about the starving animals and called the police. She then asked Oregon State veterinarians for help.

Saving the alpacas has not been cheap. The police have spent $16,000, though donations have helped with the costs. The Oregon State veterinarians are working for free. They say helping the animals is a valuable experience for vet students.

Today, Bond and Glover are at the hospital, deciding which alpacas can be taken to new homes.

There are 300 people who want to adopt the alpacas. Today, four have arrived with their trailers.

Among them is Jo Sowards, 71, of Goldendale, Wash.

She and her husband, Glen, retired there on 35 acres and breed racing dogs. They also rescue dogs that need homes.

She takes home four adult female alpacas, one a mom with a baby, and one that is pregnant.

"I'm doing what you call community service. These are dumb animals that needed help," Sowards says.
