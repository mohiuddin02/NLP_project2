Giving teachers fewer students to teach in a class is an education reform that seems to make sense on a gut level.

The idea is popular with parents and politicians alike. In fact, at least 40 states have carried out some kind of class-size reduction in the past 15 years.

But despite more than four decades of research in the U.S. and abroad, the effects of this simple idea about how to raise student achievement have been hard to measure.

Researchers generally agree that smaller classes, at least in the earliest grades, are linked to educational benefits. Among the positives are better test scores, fewer dropouts and higher graduation rates, especially for disadvantaged children.

## Why Does It Work?

They disagree, however, on whether those benefits outweigh the costs.

In recent years, researchers have been trying to figure out why smaller class size works, how it works and who benefits most.

The answers would help educators, policymakers — and the public —understand what else they need to do besides just shrinking classes to get the biggest bang for the buck.

The studies, based on classroom observations and interviews, have revealed some surprising information.

The most persuasive class-size research in the United States comes from a large experiment in Tennessee. Students in small classes there outperformed students in larger groups, even when teachers had the help of aides.

Project STAR was conducted in Tennessee from 1985 to 1989. It involved more than 1,200 teachers and almost 12,000 students, according to Jeremy Finn, a statistician at the University of Buffalo who helped set up the experiment.

## A California Conundrum

The Tennessee results inspired California and Wisconsin to carry out statewide class size-reduction projects in lower grades in 1996, when state governments had extra money.

Wisconsin achieved similar results to Tennessee, but California did not. Critics blamed California's poorer results in hiring inexperienced teachers and not having enough space to accommodate smaller classroom sizes. The experiences of the two states showed that simply making classes smaller is not all that needs to be addressed.

In 2003, Finn co-authored a paper that identified a gaping hole in the puzzle. It said that many studies show positive effects. Still, "research has yet to come up with a consistent, integrated explanation for the gains attributable to reduced class size."

The idea that teachers give students more individualized instruction in smaller classrooms did not pan out when researchers observed what actually happened in smaller classes.

## Nowhere To Hide

Several studies have found that while teachers may spend more time with each student, they tend to teach the same way they always have, regardless of the size of the class.

Finn and his colleagues proposed a different explanation, which they believe better fit the evidence from the studies and also matched classroom observations: Students behave better and participate more often when they can't hide in the back of the classroom.

He saw the change himself visiting classrooms in Buffalo, New York.

"In a big class, everybody in the back of the room is talking and giggling, and the little kids are throwing things at each other," Finn said. "But in a small class, the first thing a teacher says is 'Let's all bring our chairs around me here in a circle.'"

Smaller, quieter classes (fewer than 20 students) may have their biggest effect on kids who are inattentive and try to avoid looking the teacher in the eye. That's because they can't hide either.

## Strategies For Teachers, Administrators

Using Project STAR data, Finn compared the academic performance of fourth-graders considered to be disruptive, inattentive or neither.

"Most people I talk to predict that the disruptive kids are the worst, but they're not. The inattentive, withdrawn kids are by far and away poorer students than all the others," Finn said.

So it looks as if smaller classes work because students change their behavior. Would they work even better if teachers and principals changed what they're doing, too?

That's the question Elizabeth Graue and her colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have been studying at schools involved in a project called SAGE.

The SAGE program began in 1996 with 30 low-income schools around Milwaukee. It eventually spread to almost 500 schools around the state as part of a broader effort to combat poverty.

Graue and her team have studied several SAGE schools to get a handle on what it takes for teachers and principals to make the most of small classes.

They found wide variations.

## Give Them Their Space

For example, sometimes schools would put two veteran teachers in the same room, which lowered the class size on paper.

But in practice, if one teacher was doing administrative work while the other was teaching all the kids, then the class size had effectively gone up for those kids.

It also didn't work well if teachers didn't have enough physical space.

"We saw classes that were in former locker rooms," Graue said. "I don't know how many classrooms I saw where they used a row of bookcases as a wall ... and anytime the other class did anything noisy, everything ground to a halt in the class next door."

Smaller classes worked best when teachers were trained in how to better tailor instruction to each student's needs and when they spent more time getting to know their students' families.

"Class-size reduction alone will only get fewer children in a class," Graue said. "It doesn't translate directly to a change in achievement."
