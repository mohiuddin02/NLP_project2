For their recent first-round playoff matchup with the Golden State Warriors, the Los Angeles Clippers had a little help on defense. They used to have to send a scout to games or watch film if they wanted to figure out how to defend Warriors star Steph Curry. Now they can use computers to find that answer.

This year every NBA team can use advanced tracking data from a company called SportVU. SportVU cameras are installed in every NBA arena. They collect large sets of small tidbits of information about the position of the ball and every player on the court for every second of every game of the season.

The data from the cameras is starting to revolutionize professional basketball. It is influencing everything from game strategy and player conditioning to how fans interact with the sport.

"It's a real game changer," said Ben Alamar, a professor of sport management, who also works for the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. "It's allowing us to ask questions that we really couldn't ask before."

Thanks to advances in technology, scientists and companies can explore everything from outer space to individual consumer desires. The possible uses for the NBA's new camera system is the latest example of the trend known as big data.

## Basketball Pushing The Edge

All sports are at the point where they're using a lot of data to make better decisions, said Brian Kopp, a senior executive at Stats, a Chicago-based sports data company. "Basketball is pushing the front edge of that conversation."

SportVU was founded in Israel in 2005 by technicians who had worked on optical missile-tracking systems for that country's military. After Stats acquired SportVU in 2008, it redesigned the system to track basketball.

The system's cameras are arranged in an oval in the rafters of the arenas. The linked cameras collect location data 25 times a second. They track the two-dimensional position of each player on the court and the three-dimensional position of the ball. Computer "vision technology" keeps tabs on individual players by the number and color on their jerseys.

The player-tracking data is fed from the cameras to a computer workstation in each arena. Then it's uploaded to SportVU's servers, and from there it's fed into an Oracle database. The database matches it up with the play-by-play data from human scorekeepers. Teams can get reports based on the combined data 60 seconds after something has happened on the court, according to Kopp.

The technology was first embraced by individual NBA teams, rather than by the whole league. Four teams installed the camera system before the 2010-2011 season. Before the start of this season, the league formally adopted the technology and made sure all NBA teams could use it.

## A Shooter's Sweet Spots

The SportVU system can determine how fast players move, how often they change direction and how much they run during a game. It can track how well players shoot from particular spots on the court.

The system also helps track defense. Users can learn how well a particular player guards another or how well a team does against a certain defense.

The data reinforces what coaches already know in many cases, experts say. It is especially helpful in scouting opponents. Coaches can know their rivals as well as they know their own team.

According to data from the NBA's website, Clippers star Blake Griffin takes the vast majority of his shots at or near the basket. He's an excellent shooter there. He also takes a lot of long 2-point shots in the arc around the foul stripe. Despite favoring that area, he's a relatively poor shooter there.

"You can make adjustments based on that," Sammy Gelfand, the Warriors' coordinator for data, said in an interview. "At the end of the day, you want to take away what they do well."

## Big Data Says: Pass The Ball!

SportVU helped teams determine that the 3-point shot is one of the most efficient ways to score points. It also recommended taking uncontested shots, said Steve Hellmuth, the NBA's director of operations and technology.

That led to a lot of passing and games where the ball moves rapidly around, Hellmuth said.

Teams also use SportVU to help identify players they want to add and to gauge players' fitness. The system can help the training staff know if a player is suffering from fatigue.

Fans can see some of the SportVU data on the NBA's website. They can see diagrams showing how well and how often players shoot from particular spots on the court. Fans can also find data on how well certain players shoot when guarded by particular members of a rival team.

In the near future, the NBA and its teams may be doing a lot more with the data. It could allow coaches to make real-time in-game adjustments to their play calling. The data could also allow the NBA's TV partners to quickly broadcast the same images and analysis that now is available only after the game.

The league might be able to automate some of the calls now made by human referees and scorekeepers with the camera system.

"This data will become more valuable, more powerful just as time goes on," said Stats' Kopp.
