MIAMI â€” Archaeologists have spent months uncovering evidence of an ancient [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) village. They've concluded it's probably one of the most significant early sites in the United States. And it's right in the middle of downtown Miami.

The archaeologists, who study humans from the past, have been working under the direction of Florida archaeologist Bob Carr. So far they've carefully dug up eight large circles. The circles consist of uniform holes carved in limestone. Archaeologists believe these to be foundation holes for Tequesta Indian homes dating as far back as 2,000 years.

They have also discovered rows of hundreds of such postholes stretching across the site. Carr believes that these mark the foundations for other structures. It's possible that the Tequesta built boardwalks connecting their homes. The village site once sat along the water. It borders what his team has concluded was the original natural shoreline where Biscayne Bay and the Miami River meet. That spot was filled in by soil long ago.

"What's unusual and unique about the site is that it's this huge chunk of land where a major part of this ancient Tequesta village site is preserved,'' Carr said. "It's one of the earliest urban plans in eastern North America."

## What Should Be Preserved?

The discovery has caused a major problem. The Tequesta village site is on an empty, two-acre city block on the north side of the river. Real estate developer MDM Development Group owns it. The group plans to build movie theaters, restaurants and a hotel on the site.

The city of Miami approved MDM's plan, called the Met Square project. But, it has not given it a final building permit. When the plan was approved, the full extent of the archaeological finds was not known. Thousands of Tequesta artifacts have now been found, including bone and shell tools.

State and local historic-preservation officials want to save part or all of the archaeological site. That could require a major redesign of the Met Square project.

MDM says it could lose a lot of money if that happens. The developer has offered to carve out the limestone holding one or two of the larger circles on the site. Those would be displayed in a public square. MDM officials have also discussed doing more.

"There is no easy answer to this at all,'' says Ian Swanson, who runs MDM.

Carr is being paid by MDM. The company is required by law to pay for the archaeological survey. Carr has recommended to MDM that as much as possible of the site be preserved in place.

"If you have a necklace filled with pearls, what makes it valuable is its entirety, not four or five pearls,'' Carr said.

Preservationists say MDM took a chance when it purchased the property 10 years ago. It knew the site was inside an archaeological zone. The site was covered by a parking lot for 70 years. Yet, Carr and other archaeologists long suspected it was once part of a Tequesta village. Burial grounds previously found in the immediate area made it likely there would be something more.

## Miami's Birthplace

The issue echoes the battle to save the Miami Circle. In 1998, a set of postholes were discovered by Carr on the south bank of the Miami River. Those postholes are opposite the recently uncovered Tequesta village site. Archaeologists concluded the Miami Circle marked the site of a Tequesta council house or ceremonial structure as old as 2,000 years.

A real estate developer owned the land and planned to build apartments on it. After an international outcry, the developer sold the property to the state for $27 million.

The city's historic preservation board has authority over archaeological sites. It plans to debate what to do about the Tequesta site.

Preservationists and city board members say there is support to create an exhibit around part of the archaeological site. State officials say it would likely qualify to be a National Historic Landmark, like the Statue of Liberty.

Making the site even more significant, they say, is that Carr's team has uncovered other artifacts there. Two historic structures were later built over the Tequesta village. A well and artifacts from Fort Dallas, a military base used during two of the Seminole Indian wars in the mid-1800s, were found. Remains of the 1897 Royal Palm Hotel, which led to the founding of Miami, have also been recently discovered.

"It's extremely important,'' said city preservation board member Gerald Marston of the site. "If they gave it a name, it's the birthplace of Miami.''
