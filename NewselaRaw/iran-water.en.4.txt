TEHRAN, Iran â€” The Middle Eastern country of Iran is struggling with a shortage of water. It rained very little last year and the country has wasted a lot of its water supply.

On Friday, religious people asked God for rain in Tehran. The city is the capital of Iran.

"For God's sake, let's go to God's door and ask his Almighty to send water," Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi said.

The ayatollah is the leader of those who follow the Muslim religion. The lack of water could be a sign, the ayatollah said. God must want Iranians to pay more attention to their religion.

## A Thirsty Country Calls For Rain

Worries are growing about the lack of water in Iran. Water is scarce in the crowded capital. Small towns and cities are thirsty too. Far corners of the nation, much of which is desert, are seeing less and less water. Lakes and rivers have been drying up. There have been water supply cuts in some areas.

On the streets people complain about cuts to their water supply. Many buildings have tanks on the roofs to collect rainwater. Sadly, it has not rained in months. Bottled water is sold in Iran but many Iranians don't have enough money to buy it. Most people here depend on tap water for both drinking and washing.

Akbar Aziz is a 40-year-old worker who lives in an area of the capital called Khorasan. "On some days of the week, our tap water is cut for seven or eight hours," he said.  Aziz has young daughters. "We only shower two times a week," he said.

There are many reasons why this is happening. Iran has gone for a  long time without rain. There have been changes in its weather. Some people farm or use water at home in wasteful ways. Iran is one of the worst countries in the world at managing water.

## What Is The Water Answer?

The capital had a very hot summer. Even in late September and early fall the weather was still warm. The water problem is not going away anytime soon.

For now, there is no real answer, B. Alijani said. He teaches college students about climate and geography. Alijani said that Iranians need to learn how to use less water. They have to learn how to stop "wasting it both at home and in the fields."

To give an example, he talked about farmers planting apple and cherry trees in dry areas such as Lake Urmia. These trees need large amounts of water. Underground pipes take water to the trees.

Lake Urmia was once a large body of saltwater in northwestern Iran. Now, the lake is drying up as its shores shrink every year. Pools of water that lie below ground and send water into the lake are going empty.

## Changing Old Water Habits

This month, Iran's first vice president visited some man-made lakes that store water. He also visited places where dirty water is cleaned. He and others are trying to raise awareness about the lack of water.

People must take serious steps, the vice president said.

He also warned that the cost of water could go up. He said people could be forced to cut their water use if the lakes are not filled by rain.

There are big plans for recycling waste water. People are thinking of ideas to improve farming methods and to change wasteful use of water.

Iran has very little money to raise the water supply. People are also not willing to change their old habits of using water.

The people in charge are desperate. They are turning to religious leaders for help. They felt asking people to pray together would let everyone know that Iran is running out of water. The leaders were also told to ask people to use less water.
