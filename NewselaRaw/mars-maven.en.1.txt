Mars' atmosphere is so thin, it amounts to less than one percent of Earth's. Yet the Red Planet at one time apparently had rivers and lakes, which suggests it also once had a much larger layer of gasses that could have kept the planet warm and supported life.

Where did this thick Martian atmosphere go? Solving that mystery is the first order of business for NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, which arrived in orbit around Mars on Sept. 21.

"One of the really overarching questions about Mars is whether there was ever life," Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN's principal investigator told reporters last week. Life, most scientists assume, would have required liquid water — as all life on Earth does. MAVEN will measure Mars' current atmosphere, and scientists will use those measurements to try to understand what might once have been there and how it was lost. "We're learning about the history of the habitability of Mars," he says.

## Working With India's Orbiter

The spacecraft has been traveling toward Mars since its launch 10 months ago, in November 2013. On Sunday night, it completed a tricky maneuver that allowed Mars' gravity to pull it into orbit. Over the next six weeks, MAVEN will gradually lose altitude. Eventually, it will shrink its current 35-hour wider orbit to a tighter circle that takes just four and a half hours to complete. Its eight instruments will begin taking scientific measurements in November.

If all goes well, MAVEN scientists hope to coordinate with the researchers behind India's Mars Orbiter Mission, which is due to arrive in orbit just three days after MAVEN, on Sept. 24. While MAVEN will focus exclusively on Mars's upper atmosphere, the Indian mission will be broader: It will record images of the planet's surface and atmosphere.

Mars Orbiter's science capabilities are limited compared to MAVEN's. Still, if it succeeds in reaching Mars, it will make history as the first Asian spacecraft to do so. "Both India and NASA are really quite interested in cooperating," said Jim Green, NASA's planetary science division director. "I think we'll see as both spacecraft get into orbit and the science teams begin to understand their data, those opportunities will open up."

Mars' thin atmosphere is 95 percent carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, argon, oxygen and other chemicals. Scientists speculate that there are two main routes by which the bulk of the atmosphere could have escaped. It could have seeped down through the surface to the planet's crust. Or, it could have floated up and been lost to space.

## A Lucky Comet Will Cruise By

For clues, MAVEN will watch to see when and how gas is currently stripped off the top of the atmosphere — a process that is thought to be driven by solar wind. "The question is whether over long periods of time this process or any of the other processes that are operating have been responsible for removing most of the gas," Jakosky said.

MAVEN will get a bonus in the form of comet C/2013 A1 — also known as Siding Spring. By chance, the comet will cruise to within 80 miles of Mars on Oct. 19. Cometary dust and gas that strikes Mars' atmosphere should help scientists understand  the composition of both the comet and the Martian atmosphere. "The odds of having an approach that close to Mars are about one in a million years," Jakosky said, "so it's really luck that we get the opportunity here."

MAVEN is the latest phase in an all-out scientific assault on Mars. Largely led by NASA, that effort aims to fill in the story of our neighboring planet. MAVEN will join NASA's two other operating orbiters — the Mars Odyssey spacecraft and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter — as well as the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, which drive along the planet's surface. Europe's Mars Express orbiter is the only other currently operating spacecraft at the planet.

Not only do the missions aim to understand whether life could ever have existed on Mars; they are also laying the groundwork for future human exploration. "This is our next big step on our journey to Mars," Jakosky said. "It's really the planetary scientists that are blazing the trail for us to understand everything about Mars that we need to for humans to be able to land safely on Mars and explore and journey around the planet." In NASA's eyes, every new insight brings us closer to the day when the first human footprints are planted on the Red Planet's surface.
