In hospitals, it's used to help burn victims. It can wipe out dangerous "superbugs" that are resistant to regular antibiotics.

Now, companies are trying to make money off of people's fear of germs. They're adding the tiny, strong bits of silver on cutting boards, underwear, and yoga mats. They're even adding the silver to running shirts, socks and an other "antibacterial" goods.

Such products are made possible by new advances in technology that allow manufacturers to make nano-sized silver and put it into different materials. Nanometer-sized silver is smaller than you can imagine. About 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers fit on a single strand of hair.

But some scientists and environmental watchdog groups say using so much nanosilver may have risks. No one knows how being exposed to the specks of silver may affect human health. It could hurt the ecosystem in the long run.

## "Frightened Of Bacteria"

They also worry that silver may lose its power to fight infections. Bacteria could get used to the silver and learn to fight back. That's what has happened with antibiotics.

"Some humans are quite frightened of bacteria," said Samuel Luoma in a  report. He's a researcher at the U.S. Geological Survey, which studies the Earth and its materials, like silver. He thinks people could over use the silver nanoparticles.

Luoma said he's worried about "the explosion of products," which he doesn't think is necessary. And he doesn't know if they work. "It's important to prove it's worth taking the risk" before it's put into the world, he said.

Silver kills germs when it oxidizes and releases silver ions, which kill bacteria. Ancient people used the metal to treat open wounds. American pioneers tossed silver coins into barrels to keep water fresh.

Silver companies say concerns about nanosilver are unnecessary. They point out that silver has been used effectively as an antibiotic agent. It's also usually used in very small amounts.

## Super-Small Size Scares Some

The companies also say nano-sized silver has been used for more than a century. Nanoscale silver products have been safely used in swimming pools since the 1970s, said Rosalind Volpe,  head of the Silver Nanotechnology Working Group. It's also been used to make water pure.

"It's the most sustainable and by now the most researched and safest biocide technology on the market," said Carlo Centonze. He is CEO of HeiQ. The Swiss company produces nano-sized silver for medicine.

Some manufacturers also argue that treating textiles with silver nanoparticles is environmentally friendly. It reduces the need for washing and allows for cleaning at lower temperatures. It also makes the products last longer.

Experts agree that humans can safely withstand fairly high doses of silver. But things have changed over the past 10 years. Nanoparticles have been manipulated and put in places where silver has never been before.

Some fear the nanoparticles' small size may cause unintended health problems. And it can affect nature.

## Spreading Through The Body?

Studies have found that nanosilver and other nanoparticles can spread all over the body.

Nanosilver could upset the delicate balance of bacteria in the digestive system. So said Marina Quadros of the Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology. Silver nanoparticles can kill both good and bad bacteria.

There are concerns about nanosilver pollution. The pollution could be in landfills, wastewater treatment plants and industrial areas. Several lab studies also have found that nanosilver can leach out of products when washed.

Andrew Maynard, head of the University of Michigan Risk Center, said people may be overreacting. Using nanosilver in a product may make sense. It can serve a purpose in medicine and it works, he said.

"Rather than a marketing ploy, it should be something that will benefit people," Maynard said. "We've survived for many years without having antimicrobial shirts and tools."
