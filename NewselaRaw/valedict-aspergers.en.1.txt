SEATTLE — Chance Mair sometimes has trouble expressing his feelings. He has struggled to show people whether he is very happy or sad. Mair has a condition known as Asperger's syndrome. His brain works a little differently than the average brain.

It was certainly a happy night at Marysville Arts and Technology High School recently. The senior class, including Mair, was graduating. Students filed into the auditorium in black gowns and royal-blue scarves.

## From Special Ed To Top Spot

For Mair it was not only that he was graduating with the 50 seniors in his class. He was the class valedictorian — the top student in his grade. He would give the valedictorian speech. Finishing first in the class is a big deal for anyone. Speaking in public is a very big deal for someone with Asperger's syndrome.

Mair had never told most of his classmates that he has Asperger's. He never told them he had started his schooling in a special-education classroom, or that he had received treatment for Asperger's when he was younger.

"It's one of those things that for the longest time I didn't want to tell people," he said earlier in the day. "But now that I'm graduating, I don't want to hold it back — I want people to know me for who I really am."

Growing up in Marysville, Washington, Mair spent his childhood learning how to do things that come naturally to other children.

## Lots Of Early Struggles

Having Asperger's meant he did not talk much, and had trouble understanding how other people were feeling. Loud noises and strong flavors bothered him a great deal. His parents tell stories about how it was a struggle for him to let other children know he wanted to play with them. Instead of saying anything, he would simply stand quietly by their side.

"I can know that I need to say something and I can feel the confidence to say it when I'm playing it out," he said. "But then when I get to that step where I actually have to do it, like the execution, that's when I tense up and get really nervous, really scared.

"Sometimes it's not even a shyness, sometimes it's like a fear."

His parents knew his success depended on finding a place where he could build his social skills — and have fun doing it, too.

## Learning By Bowling

One way he did that was through bowling. He became fascinated with the sport when he was about 5 years old, and ended up playing with different teams in bowling alleys around the Marysville area.

One reason he liked bowling so much is that it has so much variety. "There's no one kind of person, there's no one way you can bowl," he said.

His parents saw bowling as a way for him to work on his communication skills, and signed him up for as many leagues as possible.

"You put him in a bowling alley, it's his environment, it's his home," said Mair's father, Derek Mair. "Doesn't matter what bowling alley — he loves it."

At Marysville Arts and Technology high school, Mair was a member of the bowling team. His favorite ball is a 15-pound, solid blue Hy-Road.

## Things Start To Add Up

"It's the one I've been using the longest and the one I can always count on to get strikes — it's never let me down," he said.

Mair was also extremely good at mathematics. His mother, Christine, remembers he would write numbers to the thousands back in kindergarten.

"I can count better than I can talk sometimes," he said.

By the time he was in high school, Mair was so advanced in math he ended up taking courses at Everett Community College.

In August, Mair will enter Washington State University, where he will major in mathematics.

"I'm really happy that I've achieved so much and that I've gotten to this point in life," he said.

## "It's Up To Us"

Many at Marysville only learned about Mair's Asperger's when he gave his valedictorian speech.

During the speech Mair said his struggles are similar to the struggles everyone faces in their lives. Everyone has challenges they need to beat, he said. It is just a matter of learning how and moving forward.

"Wherever our individual paths take us, there will be challenges," Mair told the graduates. There will be people and situations that say, "No we can't," he said. "It's up to us to decide whether or not we listen to them."

"We choose whether we sink or swim, stand up or lay down, fight or fall, succeed or fail."

After he finished speaking, the entire audience cheered loudly. Asperger's could not keep Chance Mair down.
