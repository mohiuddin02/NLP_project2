They became the first to scale a slippery, bleak face of El Capitan, reaching the top before dark. The rock formation in Yosemite National Park is considered so treacherous that no one else has ever dared try to climb it.

The relief of the difficult, three-week climb up the Dawn Wall could be felt thousands of feet below. Hundreds of people screamed as climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson pulled themselves over the final ledge.

"It has been such a part of our lives, I miss it already," said Cauldwell's father, Mike.

"I'm shaking," added Jorgeson's mother, Gaelena. She left Santa Rosa at 5 a.m. to reach Yosemite in time to witness what may be the world's most difficult free climb ever. In a free climb, climbers use only their hands and feet to climb up a cliff or boulder. They are attached to safety ropes in case they fall.

## El Capitan's Vertical Face

It took the climbers six years to get to the top of the 3,000-foot vertical face of El Capitan

They had failed in 2010 because of bad weather and in 2011 when Jorgeson broke his ankle. On Wednesday, Jorgeson fell on the first section of the climb, slowing down the team.

Their families and loved ones have shared in their journey. They watched the men study, plan and train for the agonizing undertaking.

Jorgeson and Caldwell will keep returning to Yosemite. The national park holds some of the world's best climbing territory.

Caldwell has been climbing the rocks there for much of his life. His father, Mike, described taking him up one of El Capitan's 100 routes as a kid. His father called his son's latest feat "the next level in a video game."

The climbers caught the attention of the world, with thousands following them online. The White House even tweeted a picture of President Barack Obama posing for a picture in front of a painting of Yosemite. He said in the tweet, "You remind us that anything is possible."

## Little To Grab On To

Caldwell and Jorgeson began the journey Dec. 27. They have been spending their nights in tents bolted to the rock and hanging 1,200 feet above the valley floor. The two have overcome battered and bloodied fingers, falls and exhaustion.

Described as the world's most difficult free climb, the route is nearly straight up and there is little to grab on to.

The Dawn Wall is named because it catches the first morning sun rising over the Sierra. It was first climbed in 1970, but the climbers used bolts and ropes, known as an aided climb.

Wednesday's summit is just the latest unforgettable experience for Caldwell.

In 2000, Caldwell and his friends were kidnapped for six days while climbing in Kyrgyzstan in Asia.

Later, Caldwell lost a finger in an accident, but kept on climbing.

Caldwell grew up in the shadow of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado and began climbing at 3 with his dad. He turned professional at 17 after winning a competition in Utah.

## Love Of Climbing

Jorgeson also climbed as a child and trained at an indoor climbing gym in Santa Rosa, California. He is known as one of the world's top boulder climbers. He scrambles up 400-foot pieces of rock with enthusiasm and no ropes.

Caldwell and his wife, Rebecca Rodden, named their baby son Fitz after Mount Fitz Roy in Argentina. Last year, Caldwell and another climber went up the famous Fitz Roy in four days.

Caldwell's love of climbing already is rubbing off on the family's next generation. His 9-year-old nephew, Grant Van Nieuwenhuyzen, spoke about his own budding career right before his uncle made it to the top.

Grant peered up at the rocky perches, and exclaimed, "I'll try that."

After the climb, Jorgeson said he hopes it inspires other people to follow their dream.

"We've been working on this thing a long time, slowly and surely," he said. "I think everyone has their own secret Dawn Wall to complete one day."
