NEW YORK â€” Want a side salad with that Big Mac? Now, you might be able to get one.

McDonald's says it will start giving customers healthier choices. If they don't want french fries, they may order a salad, fruit or vegetable with their value meals.

McDonald's will make the change early next year in the United States. People will not have to pay extra to substitute fries. McDonald's already lets customers change their order in other countries.

It will work to make the change in 20 countries where it sells the most food. McDonald's has more than 34,000 restaurants around the world.

## Promoting Milk And Juice

McDonald's is the world's biggest hamburger chain. Don Thompson is the company's boss. He announced the change at an event with former President Bill Clinton.

McDonald's is looking to make other healthy sides, Thompson said. The company already sells cups of corn in some places. It also sells kiwi on a stick. McDonald's could sell them more widely. It could also sell other fruits and vegetables in more places.

"What is it that customers will choose, and what will they eat?" Thompson said. "What we don't want to do is just put something on the menu and say, hey, we did it." McDonald's wants people to actually eat the food, he said.

McDonald's also said that it would change its packaging. It will try to make healthier choices more appealing to kids. A side of carrots might come in a bag with more colors. Parents will still be able to order soda with Happy Meals. But McDonald's says it will only showcase milk, juice and water. All advertising to kids will include a "fun nutrition or children's well-being" message, the company said.

## Worldwide Sales Are Choppy

Margo Wootan works for a group that pushes for healthy eating. She said taking soda off the Happy Meals menu was a big step. Other fast-food chains should follow it, she said. But she still was against the push to include nutrition messages in ads to kids. She warned it could make McDonald's seem healthier than it actually is.

McDonald's is a target of people who push for healthy eating. They say it promotes bad eating habits.

Its business has been better than its rivals for years. But now McDonald's is having trouble shaking its fast-food image. It needs to keep up with changing tastes. Late last year, the company reported that its monthly sales went down. This was the first time it happened in nearly 10 years. Sales around the world have been choppy ever since.

It wants to better match the way people are eating. McDonald's began letting customers put egg whites in all its breakfast sandwiches. It also started selling chicken wraps. They are partly intended to attract people who want foods they feel are fresher or healthier.

## Changing How It Sells To Kids

How McDonald's sells to children is also a problem. A study found that the chain usually shows toy giveaways and movie tie-ins in its ads for children. It does not show food. And a 9-year-old girl made headlines at its latest shareholders meeting. She stood up to ask Thompson to stop "tricking" kids into eating the company's food.

The girl was with her mother. She is a part of a group called Corporate Accountability. It has pressured McDonald's to change how it sells to kids.

This is clearly a tough topic for Thompson. He said that the Alliance for a Healthier Generation approached the company. It wanted to use its popularity to help kids. They are working with McDonald's on its new health goals.

Howell Wechsler is the head of the Alliance. He said the agreement with McDonald's could help change the way people eat. He said this was because everyone knows about McDonald's.
