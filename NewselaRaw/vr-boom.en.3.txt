SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” Virtual reality (VR) is a type of technology that lets users enter new worlds. The worlds are created by computers. Putting on a headset allows one to step into these computer-created places.

Earlier this month, two big companies announced their new VR technology. Oculus released information about the VR headset it is working on. Sony also provided more details about its own VR headset.

Buyers can get VR headsets in 2016. Before this can happen, VR companies need to work through a few problems with their technology.

Jack McCauley is the inventor of the Oculus headset. Oculus started in 2012 and has become one of the biggest VR companies. It was bought by Facebook last year.

VR headsets can sometimes make their users sick. McCauley said this feeling occurs because there is a difference between what your eyes see and what your ears feel and hear. Our eyes and ears work together to keep our body balanced. If one of them experiences something different than the other, it can make us feel ill. When done correctly, VR can produce a wonderful sense of speed and power. When it is not done correctly, VR can make a user ill.

## Pixel Problems Can Plague Digital Pictures

There is also a problem with the pixels. Pixels are the building blocks of any digital picture. It takes many of them to make a single picture. Because the screen is so close to a player's eyes in VR headsets, users can see the pixels that makes up the images. It's like looking through a screen. It can ruin the experience of the virtual world.

Game developers must learn new ways to make games. This will take some time, however.

Nick Whiting is the head game creator at Epic Games. He has found a way to help with these problems. He thinks it is best to have a virtual object near the user at all times. This lets users have something they can use to tell where they are, and measure distance.

Another way game developers can help is by guiding the eyes of the user. They are going to use a type of 3-D audio to do this. This technology allows VR headsets to make users believe they are in a 3-D world. It allows them to hear things all around them, even if they can't see them. A certain sound can make a user look in a certain direction. This audio technology will be used along with vibrations from controllers to change the user's experience.

## Some Games Must Be Reinvented

Some styles of video games do not work well in VR right now. Flight and racing games work well with VR. Shooter games do not work as well because they move too fast for VR.

"They must be reinvented," said Richard Marks. He is a game developer at Sony.

There is also an opportunity to use VR technology to connect people who live long distances apart. VR gives users a sense of physical presence. Two friends who are hundreds of miles away can feel like they are right next to each other in the virtual world.

## Technology Can Help In Music

The technology might also be used by people who build buildings and make music. Some companies that build buildings make models or pictures before they start building. Instead of showing pictures to customers, a building company could give them a headset to take a virtual tour.

Someday, VR technology might be used in music concerts. Users can attend a concert through a VR headset and feel like they are right there.

VR will bring people to all kinds of "cool spaces," says Marks of Sony.
