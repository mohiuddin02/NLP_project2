LOS ANGELES â€” Kids love pizza, but pizza is making them fat.

On days when children eat pizza, they take in a lot more calories than when they eat their regular diet, a new study found. Calories are the amount of food or drink people take in. If a person eats more calories than they use up through physical activity, they become fatter.

On days they eat pizza, children take in about 408 calories more than on a normal day. They also take in more salt and more fat.

## Lots Of Pizza

More children are overweight now than in the past. Some people have called this a crisis. The new study looked at whether pizza is partly to blame. It looked at pizza because so many kids eat it. Each day, 1 in 5 kids between the ages of 6 and 19 eat pizza. That compares to about 1 in 10 Americans overall.

The only foods more popular with kids are desserts such as cakes, cookies and doughnuts.

Lisa Powell is a professor at the University of Illinois. She and her coworkers used a survey to figure out how pizza affects children's diets. They asked thousands of children to make a list of everything they ate and drank in the past 24 hours.

Overall, pizza makes up only a small amount of the calories kids eat or drink.

## Lots Of Calories

But on days when they eat pizza it shoots up. Pizza makes up a fifth of young children's calories on days they eat it, the professors found. It makes up a quarter of teens' calories on pizza days. Calories measure how much energy a person gets from eating food. Sometimes people eat more calories than their bodies use. The body stores those extra calories as fat.

The survey was done in 2009-2010. Though the numbers are high, they were even worse in 2003 and 2004. Both young children and teens ate more pizza in 2003 and 2004 than they do now.

## Try A Different Snack

Kids also ate a small amount of pizza for breakfast or as snacks. The snack pizza was particularly worrying to the professors. On days when children ate snack pizza, they ate 202 more calories than on days when they didn't.

Powell and her co-workers aren't declaring a war on pizza. They did say, though, that pizza is almost as big a problem as sugary drinks.

Doctors should talk to overweight children about pizza, they wrote.
