INDEPENDENCE, Mo. — After becoming wildly disruptive in school, Kari Knudtson's 10-year-old son was asked to leave his classroom. His teacher sent the fourth-grader to Mill Creek Elementary School's isolation room. 

Knudtson said her son has had trouble controlling his behavior in the past and ended up in time out, suspension or in a "buddy room" alone with a school staff member until he could calm down. But an isolation room? That, she wasn't familiar with.

"I didn't know that isolation rooms even existed until I learned that my son had been in one," Knudtson said.

Schools are used to dealing with students acting out in class. But the way they handle these challenges has evolved. Over the years, consequences for dangerous behavior have ranged from being hit with a ruler on the knuckles to being expelled from school altogether. 

But isolation rooms are a different story.  

## District Says It's Space To Calm Down

Some schools have isolation rooms where they send students who are out of control or a threat to themselves or others. Educators see the rooms as a place where students go to calm down. However, the rooms have stirred up controversy between families and educators. Some experts say sending a student to a small room by himself is not acceptable if it's used as punishment.

In recent years, parents across the country have fought to change these policies. Families are upset their kids are being held in isolation rooms and boxes as punishment. And recent research suggests these consequences do not work. 

The Independence School District where Knudtson sends her son is exploring other strategies for addressing poor behavior in school. Some staff members are looking into ways to stop students before they lose control, including staying calm themselves and recognizing signals that a situation is escalating.

According to assistant superintendent Beth Savidge, the school district uses "numerous strategies in behavior management to keep students and staff safe."

Still, the district has 15 isolation rooms across its schools.

## But Parents View Room As Punishment

The isolation room at Mill Creek "is an empty room with a door that opens into the room," said assistant superintendent Janet Richards. It had previously been used as a conference room, copy room and a small instructional room, and according to Richards, a student cannot be locked inside.  

A trained staff member would guide a student to the room, she said, and be with them at all times, unless the student is physically dangerous. If the student poses a threat to safety, the staff member could leave the room and monitor the student through a window in the door.

The district maintains the rooms are not used for punishment. Rather, officials said, the rooms allow students to calm down and get away from whatever may be upsetting them so they can ideally return to the classroom. 

Still, a group of Mill Creek parents is trying to force the school to get rid of the rooms. 

"We want those gone," said Joni Gentry, who has a fifth-grader at the school.

She and other parents said they have talked with school and district officials about their concerns but have not been satisfied with the responses. 

"We didn't need them in the past; why do we need them now?" Gentry said.

## Acting Out And District Policies

Several parents acknowledged their children have behavior issues that they have been working on with the school's help. And one mom said isolation rooms have helped her son, a student who attends another school in the Independence district.

But other parents have complained about the Mill Creek room, claiming it is unsafe and should not be used since it has a brick wall and exposed, uncovered electrical sockets.

"Parents are furious that the school has an isolation room, and most parents are not even aware that it exists," said Sara Baker, whose 6-year-old attends Mill Creek. "We just don't feel like this is a proper tool for this school."

The district has denied the Mill Creek isolation room has ever been used to discipline a child. However, officials do say such a space could be helpful if a student became uncontrollable or violent.

Isolation and restraint rooms are legal, though a district has to follow state and federal regulations if they chose to have one. A school district can also prohibit the use of seclusion, isolation or restraint.

## Other Ways To Deal With Behavior

This is not the first time the use of isolation rooms in an elementary school has drawn complaints. In 2012, a Washington public school made headlines when a second-grader was barricaded in a small padded closet the district called an isolation room. Parents claimed that the room was a solitary confinement box.

Last year, North Texas schools were investigated for using seclusion and isolation rooms. The smallest of these rooms was 56 square feet, about the size of a parking space.

Medical experts said many schools across the country are phasing out the use of isolation rooms as they realize there are more effective ways to address bad behavior. 

In fact, for the last two years, the Independence district has been involved with the Trauma Sensitive Schools program to explore ways to prevent students from acting out in the first place. However, transforming behavior policies and consequences is a long process. 

In the short term, Independence parents will discuss their concerns about the isolation room at Mill Creek at an upcoming school board meeting.
