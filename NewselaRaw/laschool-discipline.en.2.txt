LOS ANGELES — Starting this school year, students who break the rules in one of the nation's largest school districts will face new punishments.

Los Angeles students who are caught on school grounds with alcohol or marijuana, for example, will be sent to a counseling center or the principal's office. Before, these students might have been arrested and sent to court.

The new system of discipline is meant to keep students, especially minorities, from getting stuck in the criminal justice system of police and courts.

The new style of punishment is quite different from "zero tolerance" discipline policies that first appeared in the 1970s and 1980s. Zero tolerance generally requires serious punishments for students who break the rules.

Lately, the trend has been to steer clear of strict punishments. In January, the Obama administration advised schools to emphasize conflict resolution and classroom management over arrests and fines.

## It's What Is "Appropriate"

The Los Angeles Unified School District has more than 640,000 students in more than 1,000 schools. It's one of the largest districts that has adopted a new discipline policy that puts less emphasis on punishment.

"This is a huge breakthrough," said Zoe Rawson of the Community Rights Campaign, a grass-roots organization that lobbied for the reforms.

The new system will keep young students out of the "permanent hole" of the criminal justice system, Rawson said. Instead, "a guidance counselor will be there to sit down and be there with a young person and their family."

But these new rules do not apply to more serious violations of the rules. A student who sells drugs or displays a weapon can still be arrested and sent to court. According to school board member Mónica García, the new discipline policy is about being "appropriate."

For fighting, vandalizing school property, or carrying alcohol or marijuana, students will be sent to on- or off- campus centers where they will receive support and counseling. In the past, these students would have gone to court.

## The Young People Need Guidance

The new guidelines don't specify how to deal with a student who repeatedly breaks the rules. This gives officers and school officials more flexibility.

"It's not like three times, then you go to the court," Rawson said. She added that the new policy makes it easier for school officials to help students, rather than just punish them.

"There's plenty of evidence we are tough. This is about changing behavior," García said. "We're acknowledging we have young people who need guidance and an opportunity to learn from their mistakes."

Zero tolerance discipline may sound simple. Every student who breaks the rules must face serious punishment. But critics said the rules created unfairness. Minority students were much more likely to be arrested under zero tolerance than white students, according to activists and educators.

"It really is in low-income communities of color that we've seen this increase in law enforcement presence," said Ruth Cusick, a lawyer who helped create the policy changes.

## Changes Needed To Be Made

There were 9,000 arrests and tickets in the 2011-2012 school year. Ninety-three percent involved black or Latino students, according to statistics from the Labor/Community Strategy Center.

During the 2013-2014 school year, black students made up 11 percent of the district's students, but they were about 33 percent of those suspended.

The federal Department of Education investigated the Los Angeles school district in 2011 and found that punishments were given out unfairly. The district agreed to make changes.

In recent years, the school district has used less harsh punishments. In 2013, it stopped suspending students for defiance, or not obeying teachers. In 2012, students who skipped class would no longer get tickets from the police. Instead, they would receive off-campus counseling.

## Misbehaving Is Part Of Growing Up

According to Jim Eichner, who works on civil rights issues in Washington, D.C., students will always misbehave, and they should not be punished too severely.

"Disruptive behavior is sometimes par for the course for students who are learning to behave properly," Eichner said.

Eichner disagreed that educators were going soft on misbehaving students. He said the counseling and treatments students get under the new system are effective and challenging.

"That's actually really being tough on kids because it makes kids face up to their behavior," Eichner said.
