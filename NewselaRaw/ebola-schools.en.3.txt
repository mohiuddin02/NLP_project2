FORTH WORTH, Texas â€” Two weeks ago, Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person in the United States to be diagnosed with Ebola. Duncan infected two nurses caring for him before he died in Dallas on Oct. 8.

Ebola is a deadly virus that has been spreading through West Africa. Duncan was in the African country of Liberia before he came to the United States. Now, people are worried that the disease could spread through North America, too.

People in the Dallas area have become worried about the deadly disease since Duncan was found to have Ebola.

The schools continued their battle against the virus Friday. Workers used cleaning products to disinfect schools. The schools made sure students who were absent were not coming back to school sick.

They also tried to stop people from spreading rumors about the disease.

## Lot Of Kids Kept Home

Parents at Lake Pointe Elementary were notified Wednesday that a student was placed in voluntary isolation. He is going to stay away from other people until he knows for certain that he does not have Ebola.

He could have gotten the disease if his father has it. The student's father was on an airplane flight with infected health care worker Amber Joy Vinson.

Since Wednesday, attendance at the school the boy goes to has dropped.

"It is the first time it really got real for our community," said Kristin Courtney, spokeswoman for the school district. "And our community needed some time to process the information."

Forty percent of Lake Pointe Elementary school students were absent on Thursday, Courtney said. Twenty-eight percent of the students were absent again on Friday. Normally, Courtney said, about 4 percent of the students in the district are absent on any given day.

The district did not close any schools, but did extra cleanings Wednesday night. It cleaned again Thursday morning. The school district already does regular cleanings with products used in hospitals, Courtney said.

## Worried Parents

Roland Kennedy is the father of a 7-year-old at Lake Pointe Elementary. He said it was difficult to send his son to school. Lake Pointe's communication with parents and cleaning efforts played a role in his decision.

"It reassured me that that it is OK, that he can go back to school," Kennedy said. "And if he did come into contact with that student, the damage is done. I hope they do keep us informed, keep up with the phone calls and notices, because communication is key in this."

Chelsea Salas is the mother of a first-grader. She said that she and her husband decided to send their daughter to school.

"I just got real nervous. I couldn't sleep. I kept worrying about if we should keep her home," Salas said.

The district is developing a specialized education plan for the isolated student, Courtney said. The student will use technology to help complete schoolwork and not fall behind.

## Keep Calm, Judge Says

Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins has been working to educate the public about Ebola. On Friday, he urged North Texans not to overreact to the threat of Ebola. He said this was especially necessary in the case of schoolchildren.

Jenkins said some hospital workers were being treated unfairly. They told him that their children were being told to stay away from day care.

"These hometown heroes are in a difficult situation, dealing with their children being discriminated against in day care and school," Jenkins said. "It's not representative of North Texas and American values."

Jenkins defended those who have been on the front line in the fight against Ebola.

Workers who do not have symptoms have "zero" chance of spreading Ebola, Jenkins said.

## Spreading The Word

Highland Park school district Superintendent Dawson Orr posted a message Friday on the district website. He explained that all schools will be cleaned over the weekend. Cleaning will also be increased during the school day.

The district also said its nursing staff has been trained to spot signs of Ebola. It also listed what steps would be taken in the event of a case being suspected.

The district also has a section on its website called "Help with rumor control." There it addresses rumors. An example: questions about an elementary school student and his mother being on the same Frontier Airlines flight with Vinson.

The Fort Worth school district is also trying to answer rumors, said spokesman Clint Bond. The district had not even had any reported contact with Ebola.

Officials have reinforced rules for their school nurses on how to deal with diseases that can spread quickly, Bond said. They did this just to be safe, he said.

The district has also put up information on the website. In a release called "Know the Plan," the district outlines the questioning method for possible contact with Ebola.
