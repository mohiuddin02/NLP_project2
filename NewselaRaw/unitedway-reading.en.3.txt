WASHINGTON â€” Texas principal Alfreida Colvin encourages reading every way she can.

So when the country's largest charity offered to include her school in its new early reading program, she jumped at the chance. The United Way gave the school a reading nook and books for students to keep. The charity also signed up the school for a reading website.

Last week, the United Way began the program, called Club Connect Adopt-a-School, in schools across the country. It is the first time the organization has adopted poor schools in so many states.

## Beanbags And A Rocking Chair

Colvin's school is Harlean Beal Elementary in Fort Worth. Beal did not have enough room to put in a reading nook. The only available location was a cubbyhole next to her office. Parents used to sit there and look at newsletters.

Colvin asked janitors to make a little curtain for a door on the cubbyhole. United Way brought in some colorful beanbags and a rocking chair. Scholastic, the children's book publisher, contributed books. Someone even added a big stuffed lion.

"They're using it, and it is awesome," Colvin said.

Parents read to children there when they have lunch at school together, and preschoolers use it during an after-school program. Young readers curl up on the beanbags.

The creator of the new United Way program, Bill O'Dowd, is the head of Dolphin Entertainment. His company makes television programs and movies for children and families.

## Reading For Success In School

The early reading project is a partnership between three different organizations. They are United Way, the National Association of Elementary School Principals and Scholastic. "They've come together to design what principals think will do the most to help them get every kid to read," O'Dowd said.

His volunteer work for United Way led to Club Connect and the reading nooks. He said charities are really trying to make huge and lasting changes in society. The United Way decided to focus on stopping teen pregnancy, reducing crime, and lowering the number of high school dropouts.

Experts have long said that graduating from high school improves the odds for a better life. Research shows that the ability to read by third grade is critical for later school success. Third grade is when children stop learning to read and begin reading to learn, O'Dowd said.

Still, it is no secret that many students are behind. In 2013, the government tested children across the country to see what they know and can do. The results showed that only 32 percent of boys and 38 percent of girls were reading well in fourth grade.

## Designed For The Poorest Schools

O'Dowd said he spoke with principals in many states. The principals told him they wanted help to keep children reading after school, on the weekends and during the summer.

The new program was designed for the nation's poorest schools, like Harlean Beal. The program gives the students books and other materials they do not have at home.

Parents register their children to use the website, which encourages reading through games. Celebrities also read books to the children online. The United Way sends the parents emails about the importance of reading, as well as coupons from companies "to encourage and reward them," O'Dowd said.

"There's definitely a great need in Tarrant County," said Emily Furney. She is with the United Way of Tarrant County, where Colvin's school is located. "We'd love to be able to provide these resources for all of our schools," she said.

O'Dowd said it is likely that Club Connect programs will help kids read in schools nationwide. The United Way is active in communities across the country, he said.
