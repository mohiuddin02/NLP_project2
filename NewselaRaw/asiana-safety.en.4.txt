SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” The crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 showed that safety improvements over the last 30 years made a big difference.

Three people died in the crash. That is sad. But 304 people lived. There were "nowhere near" as many deaths as you would have expected, said Larry Rooney. He works for an important pilots group.

Several things helped save lives. The passenger seats were stronger and fireproof.  Materials inside the cabin and around the cargo areas slowed flames from spreading. Lighted strips on the floor led to the door where people should leave.  Flight attendants were also taught to speak up when they saw something wrong. And pilots were taught to pay attention to them.

The plane that crashed July 6 is one of the safest planes in the sky, said Kevin Hiatt. He runs the Flight Safety Foundation.

## Airplane Accidents Rare

There are still problems to study. Some escape slides opened inside the airplane. Two flight attendants got trapped by those slides for a short time. Getting people out of the plane was delayed for 90 seconds.  Seat belts in most of the seats hurt some passengers. Of course, they also helped save their lives.

Airplane accidents do not happen a lot. "This one will be closely looked at," said Todd Curtis. He worked on safety features at Boeing. Now he operates a Web site that has information for travelers on safety and security. Rules could change because of the crash, he said.

The airplane had its first flight on Feb 5, 2006. It was built when safety features developed in the late 1980s and 1990s were being put into new airliners.

## Among The Safety Features:

## Stronger Seats

Firefighters entering the airplane found the seats toward the front of the airplane in almost perfect shape. It was "like you could fluff the pillows and almost go out," National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said. The damage was worse near the back.

Hiatt said passengers may have climbed over the seats, pushing them forward.

## Easier Escape

The path lighting on the floor worked. The feature was added to airplanes built in 1986 and later.  The speaker system was still working. Passengers could hear the important order to get out of  the plane.

## Safer Materials

The passengers had time to escape even though the plane burned. In the 1980s, the FAA issued rules requiring materials inside the cabin be hard to burn. Improvements continue today.

Also, materials inside the passenger area are made to not crack. That way there are no sharp edges.

## Training For Flight Crews

"The crews are better trained than they were," said Rooney, who has flown for 30 years. That includes the flight attendants.

Crews are now trained to give information to each other. It does not matter who is in charge. The order to get out of Flight 214 was given after a flight attendant noticed fire outside the cabin and passed word to the captain. He reversed an earlier instruction not to evacuate.

Investigators want to know why there was a delay. "When the aircraft has gone through that crash landing, the chances of a fire starting are almost 100 percent. Why not order an evacuation?" asked Vahid Motevalli. He was one of the people who wrote a 2005 study of airplane accidents.

## Better Equipment

Improved navigation technology and better instruments for flying in bad weather have made flight much safer.
