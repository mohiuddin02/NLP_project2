In hospitals, it's used to help people with burns. It can stop germs on medical equipment. It even wipes out "superbugs" that can withstand other treatments.

Product makers are taking advantage of people's fear of germs and getting sick. Companies are adding tiny, strong bits of silver on cutting boards and underwear. They're even adding it to running shirts and socks. The tiny bits of silver are on all sorts of other goods. The companies advertise them as "antibacterial."

It's all made possible by new technology that allows product makers to make silver the size of a nanometer. A nanometer is extremely tiny. About 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers can fit on a strand of hair.

Companies mix the nanometer-sized silver into other things.

But some scientists and environmental groups are worried. They say using so much nanosilver may cause problems. No one knows if having contact with tiny pieces of silver may hurt people. It could also hurt the ecosystem.

## May Be Used Too Much

They also worry that silver may lose its power to fight infections. The diseases the silver is supposed to fight could get used to silver. If they did, the silver would be unable to fight the disease.

Samuel Luoma is a scientist. He says the problem is that some people are quite frightened of bacteria. There's a good chance nanosilver will be used too much.

Luoma says he is worried about all the new things that have nano-sized silver. He doesn't think people really need them. He doesn't know if they work. It's important to prove they work before putting them into the world, he said.

Silver companies say people shouldn't worry. Nano-sized silver has been used for a long time to make drinking water clean. Usually, only a little bit of it is used.

Some companies also say that treating machines with silver nanoparticles is good for the environment. It makes it so machines don't have to be cleaned as often. It also makes the machines last longer.

Those who know a lot about silver say that people can safely handle fairly high doses of silver. But things have changed over the past 10 years. Nanoparticles are different now. They have also been put in places where silver has never been before.

## Worries About Pollution

Some fear the nanoparticles' small size may cause health problems. They also fear that it could hurt the ecosystem.

Studies have found that nanosilver and other nanoparticles can spread all over the body.

Nanosilver could hurt how people get nutrition from eating food, said Marina Quadros. She works for the Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology. Quadros says silver nanoparticles can kill bad bacteria. But they can also kill good bacteria.

There are worries about nanosilver pollution. Several lab studies also have found that nanosilver can leach out during washing.

Andrew Maynard studies silver at a school called the University of Michigan. He says people may be overreacting. Using nanosilver may make sense. It can help patients, he says.

But it shouldn't be a way to sell products, he warned. It should be something that will help people, Maynard said. "We've survived for many years without having antimicrobial shirts and tools."
