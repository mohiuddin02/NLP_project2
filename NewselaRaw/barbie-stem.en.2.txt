CHICAGO, Ill. — For years, a general complaint about dolls has been that they send the wrong messages to children. Dolls are often blamed for encouraging an unrealistic, too-perfect image of what girls' bodies should look like. They are also blamed for discouraging girls from trying activities that boys have always done.

Looking for a different kind of toy? The Lottie astronomer doll comes complete with a telescope, camera equipment and fact sheet about notable women stargazers. The fossil hunter is armed with a magnifying glass, geology hammer and fossils.

A Lego vet clinic with a mini-doll named Mia has five stars on Amazon. A GoldieBlox skydive action figure, also highly rated on Amazon, invites children to build a parachute pack.

The dolls are part of a movement catering to shoppers' interest in STEM. STEM aims to encourage children to study science, technology, engineering and math.

## New Dolls Popular With Parents

Parents, perhaps thinking of their daughters' futures, are helping to make STEM dolls popular, according to Jackie Breyer. She is the editor-in-chief for the gift guide website Toy Insider.

For example, the Mighty Makers line from K'nex includes a construction kit with two female dolls who get to build their dream house. The I am Elemental line of female action figures has a character named Industry. She can "repair anything that is broken." iBesties is a doll line to show girls they can start their own business.

"Doll lines that teach kids science, technology, engineering and math principles are doing extremely well," Breyer said.

STEM dolls, specifically, might be one of the key ways that young girls are exposed to those subjects.

## More Building Toys Bought For Boys

Last summer, Purdue University researchers released a study. They found that engineering or building toys are purchased for boys twice as often as girls.

Stores have been receptive to carrying STEM toys, including dolls.

Toys R Us added Project Mc2 dolls to its "holiday hot toy list." Both dolls are chic dressers and knowledgeable about science and technology. 

Chicago's Timeless Toys carries Lottie and GoldieBlox lines. Besides encouraging girls to consider scientific fields, "Lottie dolls have been very popular because they have a positive body-type image," store manager Scott Friedland said. "They look like preteens instead of fashion models." Lottie dolls wear bomber jackets, long-sleeve T-shirts, sturdy brown boots, cargo shorts and baseball caps. They do not wear makeup, jewelry or high heels.

Timeless Toys has sold seven times as many STEM dolls this year as it did last year, Friedland said. GoldieBlox is the top-selling doll in the store.

## Dolls Come With Science Projects

Caroline Dickinson, 6, might find Project Mc2 dolls under the Christmas tree this year. Her dad, Dorian Dickinson, hopes that the science experiment they come with "will keep Caroline engaged throughout Christmas break and beyond."

Caroline's favorite doll now is her American Girl doll. It is also named Caroline, and one of her characteristics is bravery.

"While being brave is a great attribute for our Caroline to grow up with, we usually lean toward STEM-based toys and even dolls for Caroline," Dickinson said. One recent morning, Caroline asked if American Girl had a doctor outfit for her doll. It does not.

"Finding STEM-based toys is becoming a bit easier," Dickinson said. "We're also big fans of GoldieBlox and Legos."

## Barbie Dream House Still A Hit

According to online shopping tracker Adobe, non-STEM Barbie is still more popular. For example, on Cyber Monday the five top-selling toys included the pink Barbie Dream House and Shopkins dolls. Their tagline is "Once you shop, you can't stop."

"While traditional dolls like American Girl and Barbie Dream House remain one of the most popular items, Shopkins and Doc McStuffins dolls were also popular," said Jay Hanson, eBay merchandising vice president. Doc McStuffins is a female veterinarian. 

Chicago mom Terrand Bashua has her eye on GoldieBlox. The brand says its skydiving and zip-lining girl action figures help teach spatial skills, engineering principles and problem-solving.

Bashua said she knows that "girls are underrepresented in STEM fields — especially African-American girls." She wants her daughter to have "the confidence and support to go into any field."

Products made by Chicago-based North American Bear include stuffed dolls.

"STEM for girls is definitely a trend we're watching," said Vice President Melissa Bullock. Right now, most STEM toys are aimed at school-aged children, but the soft dolls are meant for children younger than 6. 

## Any Toy Can Teach Early Skills

For now, STEM dolls are mostly a vinyl-doll toy aimed at older children. Bullock said, "but as things progress it is certainly something we want to do."

She adds that any toy can be used to teach early STEM skills. For example, playthings can be lined up to be counted or sorted.

Todd Mielcarz hosts a parenting radio podcast. He said his 10-year-old daughter plays with Barbie, Monster High and American Girl dolls, and science kits.

"She used to be all about princess but has moved away from that and plays with the dolls in more of everyday-type scenarios," he said. "We've seen commercials for the Project Mc2 dolls, but she hasn't shown much interest" in that line.

Mielcarz said, "I would certainly look toward a STEM-type doll before a Barbie doll in the future."
