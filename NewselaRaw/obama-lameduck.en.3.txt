WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama has two years left as president.

If Obama wants to get anything done, he will have to find ways to get along with Congress, experts say.

It may be harder than it looks. On Tuesday, Republicans won elections all over the country. They already had control of the House of Representatives. Now, Republican lawmakers will make up the majority in the Senate as well.

The Senate and the House are both parts of Congress, the legislative body that makes the country's laws.

The Republican victory means that Obama, a Democrat, will spend his last two years as president with a Congress that does not agree with him. Experts say that will make it even harder for him to deal with serious problems.

## Facing Big Problems

There are a number of crises.

The U.S. is becoming wealthier, but many people are not getting paid more at their jobs. A group of extremist fighters called Islamic State has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria in the Middle East. The deadly Ebola virus in the United States has frightened many people. The outbreak also raised questions about whether the White House can handle several big problems at once.

Next week, Obama will fly to Asia and Australia for meetings, and the old Congress will return to Washington to finish working. The new Republican-led Senate will start its new session in January, as will the House of Representatives with a bigger Republican majority.

Obama will not deal with Congress on at least one issue. Government officials said Obama would sign an order to help some of the 11 million immigrants who are in the country against the law. Under the order, they will be able stay and work in the U.S. They will not be sent back to their home countries, at least for now.

## "Work Together On Issues"

Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said that he and Obama must "work together on issues" they agree on. McConnell won re-election on Tuesday. He is likely to be the leader of the Republicans in the Senate.

McConnell added, "I don't expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently. He knows I won't, either."

Meanwhile, much of Washington and the political world is ignoring Obama. They are starting to look at who will be the next president. Obama will be "yesterday's news" as soon as the 2016 presidential race begins, said New Hampshire State Senator Lou D'Allesandro. He is a Democrat.

D'Allesandro expects that president will not accomplish much in his last two years. He said Republicans will stand in Obama's way.

## Unhappy Voters

Americans have not been happy with Obama lately. Because of this, many people who have voted for Democrats in the past voted for Republicans on Tuesday.

But if he's unpopular, so are Republicans. Vice President Joe Biden argued that Republicans will need to work with Obama if they want to get anything done.

Obama is "ready to compromise," he said. Biden said he thinks the Republicans might also be willing. "The message from the people, and I'm getting it all over the country, is they're tired of Washington not being able to do anything," he said.

Advisers of other presidents who had to work with Congresses that disagreed with them say it is possible.

"President Obama, like any president, wants to finish strong and leave" his mark on history, said William Galston. He worked with President Bill Clinton. Clinton was a Democrat who also had to work with a Republican Congress during his last two years in office.

## Unpopular Politicians

Galson said the Republicans are not very popular either. They have good reason "to show they can do business."

Ken Duberstein served as chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. Duberstein said Obama has to figure out a way to work with a Republican-led Congress.

"There are ways to bridge the differences," said Duberstein. "I think there is a fork in the road."
