SVALBARD ISLAND, Norway â€” The North Pole is a place of stories. Not far from it there is a place that could be the setting for a story itself. On an isolated island in the Arctic Ocean, between the North Pole and Norway, is a vault, or giant safe. It is called the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The safe is like a huge cave and has enormous rooms inside. It is built into a rocky mountain that is usually covered with snow. Huge steel doors keep out the wind and cold.

Inside, bright bulbs shine on rows and rows of shelves. Thousands of black boxes are on each shelf. Each box is stuffed with many tightly sealed, silver packets. They are actually handfuls of seeds, there to make sure that the world will always have food in the future.

## Like Noah's Ark

Sometimes called a seed bank, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a backup for other seed banks all around the world. It is safe from earthquakes and other bad things that could happen. The vault is like a Noah's Ark for plants. Just like the boat in the story, it is built to be strong, and lets in only a few of each kind. In this case, it is a sample of seeds and not two animals.

It is surrounded by ocean and ice, and its builders think it is strong enough to last for 1,000 years. It should also stand up through any disaster that might wipe out crops.

The vault has only been open for seven years. Already, a customer is taking out seeds. The customer is a seed bank from Aleppo, Syria. Two years ago, the bank had to move because of war in Syria. The bank sent boxes of seeds to Svalbard to keep safe. Now the bank has a new home in Beirut, Lebanon, and can take back its seeds.

## Guarding Against Disaster

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault protects humans against a disaster. It stores seeds that can be used if something wipes out the world's food. However, it was also built to help customers like the one that had to move from Syria to Lebanon. The group just needed a place to keep their seeds safe while they moved.

Cary Fowler works at the seed vault. He says another reason the vault is needed is to save samples of plants that are no longer grown. Fowler said that he sees the vault as "a library of life."

Most farmers are now only growing crops that they know people will buy. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization is a group that works hard to keep people from going hungry. It says farmers are only growing one type of plant for every four types that they used to. The good news is that more are saved in seed banks.

## Wheat Crops Threatened

Scientists say that it is not safe to only grow only a few types of crops. What happens if a disease wipes out one type? Then there would be fewer types left. Right now, a disease is destroying wheat crops in Africa and the Middle East. Scientists are trying to stop the disease from spreading. If they cannot, the world food supply could be badly hurt.

Storing seeds is not new. Farmers in the Middle East used to save seeds each harvest. Then they knew they would have a crop the next year. Some seeds were buried underground in baskets full of ash. Others were sealed in containers and stored in huts. Now, scientists are saving seeds in seed banks, including the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. These seeds just might save humans if disaster strikes the world's crops.
