ORLANDO, Fla. — At Rafiki's Planet Watch at Disney's Animal Kingdom, the animals and wildlife are not the only things on display. Tourists can also peer into a lab where researchers' work includes studying hormones extracted from monkey droppings.

A few miles away at SeaWorld, a Pennsylvania researcher recently scrutinized dolphins' and whales' swimming patterns for a study that could lead to advances in underwater robotic systems for tasks such as mine detection.

Theme parks might be popular as a means of escaping reality, but in many cases there is very real scientific research going on behind the scenes. Disney staffers, for example, have published about 2,500 research papers on their findings.

"The research we do here is critical to how it is that we care for animals here as well as in the wild," said Jackie Ogden, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts' vice president of animals, science and environment.

## Science Is Also Good Public Relations

The Association of Zoos and Aquariums requires "a demonstrated commitment to scientific research" for the accreditation it gives Disney's Animal Kingdom and SeaWorld. The work is also good public relations. This is particularly important right now for SeaWorld. Attendance has suffered amid controversy over the treatment of their captive whales.

"It allows them to go out and say, 'Look at all the wonderful things we do for these animals. This is the good side of being a zoo and having animals in captivity,'" said Scott Smith, a hospitality professor at the University of South Carolina.

Epcot's Future World has had a scientific focus ever since it opened in 1982. At The Land, which features agriculture grown with a variety of methods, visitors taking the Behind the Seeds tour can see wasps bred to keep pests in check. Two U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists are also there studying more efficient ways to grow pears, Disney said.

Things changed in 1998 when Animal Kingdom opened. Research "really became sort of a larger effort," Ogden said.

## For Mandrill Monkeys, Disney's Assistance Was Critical

In reality, most of the analysis at the attraction revolves around monitoring the health of its own mammals, reptiles and birds. Despite this, many members of Disney's staff — who hold advanced science degrees — also contribute to conservation efforts outside Disney.

Animal Kingdom scientist Shana Lavin is working with the Jane Goodall Institute to examine the health of colorful African monkeys named mandrills, which are being released back into the wild. The Jane Goodall Institute's Republic of Congo sanctuary collected almost 3,000 samples of mandrill dung, dried them out and shipped them to Disney. Lavin then developed a system to detect hormones from them to determine stress levels throughout the relocation process.

Miles Woodruff, the institute's mandrill project manager, said involving Disney was critical because "they have a world-class lab", and they are experts in endocrinology — a branch of biology which studies glands and the endocrine system.

Disney World Conservation Director Anne Savage is considered a leader in the field of preserving another type of monkey: the critically endangered cotton-top tamarin. The small Colombian natives are known for being difficult to track. At Disney, Savage worked on a method to count them in the wild. She designed special transmitters that can be worn on their backs. Savage also used hair dye as an identifier. She tested this method on the Disney cotton-tops first to ensure seeing colored fur on their companions wouldn't upset them.

## Broad Respect For Disney

Disney has also been credited with contributing to sea turtle research. It has done studies showing negative effects of sea walls on nests. It has also produced important data on the migration of purple martin birds, which frequently roost at Disney World.

The company is "really respected with both the scientific and conservation communities," said Alan Bolten, associate director of the University of Florida's Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research.

The idea of research at animal theme parks has its skeptics, though. Not everyone is convinced about the credibility of research coming out of such profit-driven organizations.

"It is an interesting thing to see amusement parks that keep animals captive for profit-making purposes try to justify that with science," said Kathy Guillermo, a senior vice president with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

## Criticism Of SeaWorld Is Sharper

Animal rights organizations have taken a harsher view of SeaWorld's research than Disney's. The groups say they are more supportive of programs that benefit animals in the wild and don't use captive ones directly.

Orlando-based SeaWorld Entertainment says the studies it has done benefit both its own animals and those in the wild. The company says its research contributes to the understanding of topics including metabolism, sleep patterns and reproduction. Most of SeaWorld's studies have been carried out by scientists from universities or research institutes, although SeaWorld says its own staffers have worked on more than 350 papers.

Much of the research has a biological focus. Some of it, however, has implications in fields such as engineering. Last year, a New Jersey Institute of Technology researcher studied remoras: fish that attach themselves to marine mammals using adhesive discs on their heads. They can be found at SeaWorld's Discovery Cove. Researchers said understanding their mechanics could help improve designs for everything from animal trackers to bandages.

Frank Fish, a biology professor at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, recently observed and recorded dolphins and whales swimming at SeaWorld. He was hoping to better understand the motion of their flukes. Fish's research is supported with money from the Navy, with the expectation that his studies might lead to designs for robotic vehicles that could one day replace live dolphins used for mine detection and other underwater work.
