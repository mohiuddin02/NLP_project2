ZWICKAU, Germany — Christmas carols sound in the medieval square. The scents of hot spiced wine, cookies and candles waft through the air at Zwickau's traditional Christmas market.

Four siblings wander from stand to stand, looking at the mouthwatering treats. They are part of the Habashieh family, Muslim refugees from Syria. They fled their native country seeking safety and a better life in Germany. While they do not celebrate Christmas, they are filled with joy to be taking part in local traditions in their new home. 

Life in Germany was not always like this for the family. Just weeks ago, Khawla Kareem, the matriarch, was so unhappy that she said she would rather brave bombs in Damascus, Syria's capital, than spend another day there. At the time, the family was living in yet another cramped shelter with no privacy, no school for the children and fear of racist attacks.

## Full Of Happiness, Holiday Spirit

Syria is in the middle of a civil war. The extremist group Islamic State, or ISIS, is attempting to set up its own country governed by its version of Islamic law in the Middle East. The group's fighters have captured parts of Syria and Iraq. The war makes living in Syria very dangerous and has caused many people to leave, becoming refugees in the countries they move to. 

Today in Germany, Khawla Kareem couldn't be happier. German authorities found them an empty apartment where they can live with dignity. The family is getting in the festive holiday spirit, decorating the door of their apartment with glittery red bells and tree branches in green and gold.

"We're fully integrated now," Reem Habashieh, the family's oldest daughter, jokes.

## Even The Youngest Faced Dangers

The Habashiehs' journey has been full of hardship and heartbreak. They have experienced unimaginable challenges. They braved choppy Mediterranean waters in a small boat and trekked through cornfields with no water in scorching heat. They jumped across barbed wire in fear of Hungarian border police and paid Romanian smugglers thousands of dollars to take them to Berlin. The family spent countless sleepless nights in asylum centers packed with other refugees. This was all part of the journey to escape Syria.

It all now feels like a bad dream.

Now they are living a German dream. These days, it is full of cheer and holiday sweets, like gingerbread hearts, glazed apples, cotton candy, and safety. 

In some ways, the family's routines here in Zwickau are very different from their days in Syria. But some things remain the same. For instance, Khawla Kareem still gets up before dawn, makes herself a strong Arabic coffee and listens to Lebanese star Fairuz. 

## Not All Germans Are Welcoming

Then the family all walks together to their nearby German class where Khawla Kareem is a student, too. The kids are thriving in school. In fact, Reem is a teacher's assistant, helping to translate instructions from English into Arabic for other refugee students.

Not all asylum-seekers have been as fortunate as the Habashiehs. Most of the nearly 1 million migrants who have registered for asylum in Germany so far this year are still stuck in overcrowded reception centers. They must wait for months to have their requests processed. Scuffles between different ethnic groups are increasingly common, and there are growing concerns about safety for women and children.  

Meanwhile, for many Germans, the mood toward the migrants has changed from a spirit of welcome to hostility. Asylum shelters under construction are frequently vandalized or burned, and some have been attacked. There have been protest rallies against the surge of refugees. And workers dealing with the arrivals — police, translators, city employees and social workers — say they're exhausted.

The Habashiehs say they feel the rejection, too. Reem has received hostile stares from locals simply because she covers her hair with a hijab, which is a Muslim tradition.

## Upcoming Interview Raises Hopes

Only about 3,000 — a little over 2 percent — of the total population in Zwickau are foreigners. There are only 130 Syrians.

Despite the hardships, the Habashiehs were overjoyed when they learned of their latest turn of fortune: They will have their asylum interview on December 22, three days before Christmas. The interview is an important step for refugees. 

"We have high hopes that we will receive refugee status soon," says Reem. Refugee status is a way for people who flee their countries to be formally recognized in the place they now live. Almost all Syrians who are granted refugee status, or asylum, get German residency for one to three years.

"Our big dream is still Berlin," Reem says. The family spent their first two weeks in Germany in an immigrant community in Berlin. "The dream is blurry and vague, and the colors keep changing, but that's where we see our future."

## Christmas Rap From A Refugee

Back at the Christmas festival, Yaman, the younger son, stopped in front of a big Christmas tree. He asked for a microphone as German revelers looked on in bewilderment.

He started to rap about what it feels like to be a 15-year-old Syrian refugee in Germany:

"I still remember the sound of crowded Damascus, when I was saying goodbye to my friends,

I arrived in a new country and now I'm the foreigner,

Got up tired this morning but nobody is asking how I feel,

Can't take it anymore, I'm looking for a warm country after my own one was destroyed!"
