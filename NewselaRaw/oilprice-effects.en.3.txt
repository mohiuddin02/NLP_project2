NEW YORK â€” The price of oil has fallen by nearly half in just six months. The drop in price has surprised many people. Car and truck drivers, airlines, shipping companies and anyone who buys oil or gas is thrilled. Oil producers, on the other hand, are very upset because they will not be making as much money.

Economists are puzzled. They are trying to decide if this is a good or bad thing for the economy, which measures the level of wealth and number of jobs a country has.

A barrel of oil now costs about $58. Last summer it cost $107.

## Who Decides How Much Oil To Sell?

So what's going on? There is too much oil and too few people who want to buy it. That is having an effect on the world's economies, for better or worse.

Years of high oil prices inspired companies that drill for oil to search the Earth for more. And they found it.

Since 2008, oil companies in the United States, for example, have increased production 70 percent. They are now pumping 3.5 million more barrels of oil each day. To put it another way, that increase alone is more than most countries pump in a day.

A group of 12 of big oil-producing countries in the world work together to decide how much oil they will sell. Most of the countries are in the Middle East and Africa.

Violence and political conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa have gotten worse over several years. Some countries there had to pump less oil as a result. Other countries stepped up to produce more oil.

The group of 12 nations plans to keep pumping oil steadily. It is expected that more oil will be pumped next year than the world needs. That extra supply is sending global prices lower.

## Some Countries Buying Less Oil

More oil will be needed this year than was needed last year, but the increase will be less than people were thinking it would be. The biggest buyer of oil is the United States, and its economy is strong. China, Japan and Western Europe are the next biggest buyers of oil. Their economies all appear to be weakening. When the countries have less money, they will buy less oil.

Even in the United States, demand for oil and gasoline is not increasing, as Americans buy cars that burn less gas. The Energy Department in the United States predicts a slight decrease in gasoline demand next year.

Car and truck drivers have plenty to like about the drop in oil prices.

Gasoline prices are the cheapest since 2009, when the economy was not so good. Cheap gas this year equals an extra $100 a month for each U.S. family as they shop for holiday gifts.

"Any time gas prices go down that is a good thing," said Randy Daniels, a 30-year-old who was shopping recently at a mall in Atlanta, Georgia. "An extra 20 or 30 bucks in my pocket goes far."

## Economies Collide

Heating oil is the cheapest it has been in four years, leading to lower home heating prices just in time for winter.

Falling fuel prices put extra money in people's pockets. When people spend their extra money it gives the economy a boost. But economists are growing concerned that there are hidden problems.

Oil's plunge could be a sign that the global economy is truly struggling. A weak global economy could then hurt the U.S. economy. The United States would not be able to export as many of the products it makes to other countries, which would cause companies to make fewer items. Companies might hire fewer people and Americans would have less money to spend. All those factors could hurt the economy so much that people would hardly notice the cheaper fuel.

For oil companies, oil-producing states, and oil-exporting countries, the oil price drop is painful.

Oil companies pump oil from wells they drill. Yet, lower prices could cause them to spend less exploring for oil. Experts say thousands of people could be fired at oil companies.

## Many Depend On Price Of Oil

States such as Alaska, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas rely on money from oil companies. They get money when oil companies drill on their land. Some states have already cut spending. It could mean fewer services that people in those states need.

Countries that export a lot of oil such as Iran, Iraq, Russia and Venezuela rely on money from oil. The governments in those countries own oil companies. They use money from the oil companies to run their governments.

At the moment, many are struggling. One study found that every $1 drop in the price of oil costs Venezuela $770 million a year. If prices stay this low, the country could lose $36 billion.
