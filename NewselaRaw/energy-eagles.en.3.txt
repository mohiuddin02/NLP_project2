<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/US_NEWS_BALDEAGLE_FL.jpg" />SEATTLE â€”  Government officials said Friday that some wind power companies will be allowed to kill, by accident, bald and golden eagles for up to 30 years. And they won't get in trouble for it.

The White House wants to produce more energy from earth-friendly sources. Wind and solar power are two such sources. They're called green energy.

The idea is to get away from using so much oil and coal for power. Those types of energy are bad for nature.

But, wind energy can hurt wildlife like bald and golden eagles. The problem is that eagles die by accident when they fly into the wind farms. The farms have turbines which spin around. The birds get caught in them.

## Permits Extended To 30 Years

Nature groups slammed the White House's new rules. They said it was a bad move for wildlife.

"It's outrageous that the government is sanctioning the killing of America's symbol, the bald eagle," David Yarnold said. He is president of the National Audubon Society, a conservation organization that focuses on birds.

Peter Kelley is a spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association. He disagrees. He said that for a wind farm to get a permit under the new rules, it must list all of the different ways it will preserve the eagles. The farms will be checked on every five years.

He said, "Even then, if more eagles are dying than you expected, you have to do more things or lose your permit."

The government began handing out permits to wind farms in 2009. The permits allowed for the accidental killing of bald and golden eagles, which are protected by the government.

The old permits lasted five years at most. Wind businesses said that was not enough. They argued that the permits needed to be longer. Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth spending money to build wind power farms.

The new rules would extend the permits. But, to no more than 30 years. And, they will be granted only to companies that run their business "to ensure the preservation of eagles," the government said.

## Stopping Climate Change

Kelley said the new rules would "increase the protection of eagles and will help develop more wind farms." He said wind farms are important. They can help stop climate change.

Climate change is a shift in weather patterns. It's thought to be caused in part by humans burning fuels. That leads to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).

He says that climate change is "the No. 1 threat to all eagles and all wildlife." Not wind farms.

Under the new rules, permits will be looked at every five years. And the number of eagle deaths will be counted. Population levels of the birds will also be checked. Government officials could make companies put new plans into place to save more eagles.

And they could take away their permits.

But the American Bird Conservancy says that the new rules are voluntary. Wind farms don't have to pay attention to them. And it said that the government was relying on the companies to tell it if they've killed the eagles.

## Birds And Bats At Risk

Kelley, of the American Wind Energy Association, said that wind farms hadn't had a big effect on bald eagles. He said that only a tiny amount of the golden eagles killed by humans died because of wind farms. The population of golden eagles in the western U.S. is stable, he said. It may even be going up.

Michael Hutchins is an expert on wind power at the bird conservancy. He pointed to a new study that found that 573,000 birds and 888,000 bats are killed every year by wind farms.

And that could get worse, Hutchins said. The White House wants 12 times more energy to come from wind and solar energy, from the sun, by 2030.

He asked, "If it's not done right, what kind of an impact is that going to have on birds and bats?"

Roughly 50 years ago, the greatest danger to eagles was chemicals used on crops. They caused the birds to become endangered, Hutchins said. New dangers include construction around areas where eagles nest and, now, wind power.

He supports wind power. "But it ought to be done right," Hutchins said. "You can't call it green if it's killing hundreds of thousands of birds and bats annually and if it's killing large numbers of protected eagles."
