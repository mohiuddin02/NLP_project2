NOVOAZOVSK, Ukraine — Russian tanks and military vehicles fired missiles at the Ukrainian military on the border Thursday, a top Ukrainian official said. Ukraine's border guards were overmatched and fled. Russian troops then rolled into the country, he said.

The United States also said that the Russian military had invaded southeastern Ukraine. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) provided more evidence of the invasion. NATO is a military partnership among countries that agree to defend one another from threats.

A top NATO official said at least 1,000 Russian troops have poured into Ukraine and fought with Ukrainian soldiers. He said another 20,000 Russian troops were right over the Russian border.

"Russian forces have entered Ukraine," Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko declared Thursday.

## An Important Town Taken

The southeastern town of Novoazovsk appeared under the control of Russia and rebels in Ukraine who want to join Russia. The move spreads the war to southeastern Ukraine. Rebels backed by Russia have been fighting Ukraine's military for months to the north of Novoazovsk. The rebels consider themselves to be ethnically Russian. They want parts of Ukraine to separate from Ukraine and join Russia.

Fears are growing that Russia is widening the war. It could push the U.S. and some European countries to block trade and business by Russian companies.

Some blocks on trade already exist. The earlier ones were meant to punish Russia for taking over the Ukrainian region of Crimea in March. Russia sees Crimea as part of Russia. Until 1954, it was part of Russia and more than half of the Crimeans consider themselves Russian.

Blocks on trade were increased following the downing of a Malaysian airplane. The U.S. and some European countries blamed the crash on a Russian missile fired by the rebels.

NATO spokesman Nico Tak said that Russia's goal was to keep the rebels from being defeated by Ukraine's army. Tak said the Ukrainian military had been winning the battle in the northern part of eastern Ukraine. He believes Russia wants to weaken the Ukrainian government in Kiev.

## Russian Tanks And Rocket Launchers

NATO also produced satellite pictures. NATO said they prove that Russian soldiers are operating inside Ukraine.

"We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons," Tak said. He said the weapons are being given to rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Alexander Zakharchenko is the leader of the rebels. He said on Russian television that 3,000 to 4,000 Russians have fought on the side of the rebels.

The U.S. government accused Russia of helping rebel forces expand their fight. It said Russia sent in tanks, rocket launchers and armored vehicles.

U.S. government spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Russia was hiding its actions, even from its own people.

Russian forces, she said, are being sent inside Ukraine without them or their families knowing where they are going. She mentioned reports of burials in Russia for those who have died in Ukraine.

## The Sea Of Azov

Journalists have reported seeing rebel checkpoints outside Novoazovsk.

Novoazovsk lies along the road connecting Russia to Crimea, which it controls. It had come under attack for three days. On Wednesday the rebels entered Novoazovsk. Until now it had escaped the fighting to the north. The only way rebels could have reached the southeast was coming through Russia.

The fighting in southeastern Ukraine raises fears that the rebels want to link Russia and Crimea by land. If successful, it could give them or Russia control over the entire Sea of Azov. Experts think the sea is rich in gas and minerals which Russia wants.

Joseph Dempsey is a military expert in London. He said photos in eastern Ukraine showed a type of Russian tank there. Dempsey said that tank is not known to have been used outside of Russia.

The tank's presence, Dempsey said, "strongly supports" the view that Russia is supplying the rebels.

Journalists on the border have seen the rebels with unmarked military equipment — including tanks and missile launchers. The journalists have run into many Russians among the rebel fighters. Ukraine also captured 10 Russian soldiers Monday near the Russian border.

Donetsk is the largest rebel-held city. Eleven people were killed in attacks there overnight, the city said Thursday.
