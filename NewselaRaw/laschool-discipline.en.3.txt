LOS ANGELES — This year, Los Angeles school students will face different punishments if they break the rules.

Police and courts are out. Counseling and support are in.

Students who bring alcohol onto school grounds, for example, will now be sent to the principal's office or a counseling center off campus. In the past, these students would have been arrested and sent to court.

School officials hope the new discipline policy can keep students out of the criminal justice system of police, courts and eventually jail.

This new system is very different from "zero tolerance." That system requires strict punishment for anyone who breaks a rule. Zero tolerance rules first appeared in the 1970s and '80s.

## Questioning Fairness Of Punishments

Zero tolerance is a simple idea. Any student who breaks the rules must face serious consequences. But these rules created injustice, activists and educators say. Minority students were much more likely to be arrested under zero tolerance policies than white students.

Poor communities with many minority students have seen more police in schools, according to attorney Ruth Cusick.

LA schools saw 9,000 arrests and tickets in the 2011-2012 school year. Ninety-three percent involved black or Latino students.

Black students made up 11 percent of the district in 2013-2014, but they were about 33 percent of those suspended.

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Education investigated Los Angeles schools and found punishments were given out unfairly. The district agreed to make changes.

## The White House Weighs In

The trend lately has been to stop the strict punishments. In January, the White House told schools to work on managing classrooms so they stay calm.

In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District stopped suspending students who disobeyed teachers. In 2012, students who skipped class no longer got tickets from the police. Instead, they received off-campus counseling.

The Los Angeles school district is one of the largest groups of schools to put this type of system in place. It has more than 640,000 students and more than 1,000 schools.

"This is a huge breakthrough," said Zoe Rawson of the Community Rights Campaign.

She pointed out that the new system of discipline is more likely to help troubled students. In the past, the young people who broke the rules could find themselves in the "permanent hole" of the criminal justice system. Students who are punished harshly with arrests or jail time may go back to school with worse behavior. The argument is that the punishments do not fix what caused the bad behavior in the first place.

Now,  "a guidance counselor will be there to sit down and be there with a young person and their family," Rawson said.

## Still Tough On Serious Violations

These new rules do not apply to more serious violations. A student who sells drugs or displays a weapon at school can still be arrested and sent to court.

The new rules make punishments "appropriate," according to school board member Mónica García.

Students who fight, break school property, do graffiti or bring drugs to school will now receive counseling. Before, they would have been charged with crimes in court.

The new guidelines give school officials flexibility to deal with students who repeatedly break rules.

"It's not like three times, then you go to the court," Rawson said. She added that the new policy makes it easier for school officials to help, rather than just punish.

"There's plenty of evidence we are tough. This is about changing behavior," García said. "We're acknowledging we have young people who need guidance and an opportunity to learn from their mistakes."

## Learning About Behavior

Jim Eichner works on civil rights issues in Washington, D.C. He said harsh punishments are a mistake because young people will always break the rules.

Being disruptive can be normal for students who are learning how to behave properly, he said.

Eichner disagreed that the new system is "going soft" on students. He said the counseling and treatments students get now are effective and challenging.

"That's actually really being tough on kids because it makes kids face up to their behavior," Eichner said.
