"I never had anyone say anything to me about my hair," Jacobs said.

That changed in April. The Army made new rules for how women in uniform should wear their hair.

The rules tell the soldiers what their hair should look like. The rules outlaw certain hairstyles. Many of these hairstyles are popular among black women. These include twists and large braids.

The rules stirred up strong feelings in the black community. For hundreds of years, black women have argued over what is "good" or "bad" hair.

## Fighting The Rules

Jacobs, who is black, decided to fight. She began a petition to change the new rules. A petition is a request to change something.

The new rules are unfair, the petition says. They punish the 26,000 black women in the Army. Many black women have very curly hair. They can't always wear it in the same hairstyles as white women.

More than 17,000 people agreed with the petition and signed it. It got the attention of black lawmakers. They asked Chuck Hagel to rethink the hair rule. Hagel is in charge of the Army.

Troy A. Rolan Sr. is an Army spokesman. He said the Army wants hair to look neat. It also can't get in the way of the helmets and caps worn by soldiers.

"I just think I said what everyone else was thinking," said Jacobs. She called the new rules hurtful and insulting. She said she could not stay quiet.

## Chemicals To Straighten Hair

Tarshia Stanley is an expert on black women. Black women are told their hair has to be long and straight to be beautiful.

"To tell black women that their hair isn't good enough is hurtful," she said.

Jacobs used to straighten her hair. She stopped about four years ago. The straightening chemicals burned her head. She lost hair. Natural hair is healthier and safer, she said. It's also easier to take care of.

She's not hopeful that the Army will give in. They have to admit they made a mistake, Jacobs said.

On Tuesday, Hagel told the Army to rethink the hair rules.

They were not meant to be hurtful, Hagel wrote to the black lawmakers. "I take your concerns very seriously."
