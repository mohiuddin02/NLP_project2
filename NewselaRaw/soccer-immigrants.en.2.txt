OAKLAND, Calif. — The boys of Oakland International High School play soccer under a blazing sun, on hot black asphalt. The newest player is Paulos Gurmu, a boy from Ethiopia. Other players are from Burma, Colombia, Yemen and Liberia.

During the girls game, Fernanda Barrera, a 10th-grader from Guatemala, screamed coaching advice to fellow players from the sidelines. "Relax, blue, and pass the ball," she yelled to her team.

Playing soccer allows these students to make friends, work together, gain confidence — even before they have learned English.

Oakland International is home to students from more than 30 countries. Many of the students are refugees who came to the U.S. to escape war in their homelands. Some of them have witnessed terrible things. A fourth of the students had little or no formal education before arriving.

## A Cultural Mix At School

In this mixing pot of cultures and languages, unity comes in part through Soccer Without Borders. The  program was started at this campus and has since spread globally. Founder Ben Gucciardi created the group to help kids bond across cultural gaps and grow as leaders in and out of the classroom.

Through soccer, Barrera said, we "make communication with people who are different from us."

Gucciardi, a semipro soccer player with a master's degree in alternative education, started Soccer Without Borders at Oakland International in 2008 as a volunteer.

These days, half of the school's more than 300 students participate at some point during the year. Team members have a 95 percent graduation rate.

"I see soccer as a tool," said Gucciardi. He sets out rules the students must follow: healthy eating, a helping spirit and, above all, respectful treatment of others on and off the field. "I'm not interested in winning or losing; but if this is something that can help these amazing young people get where they want to go, then we've done our job."

Omar Benitez, 18, from Bogota, Colombia, made his first school friend — from Liberia — on the soccer team, even before he could speak English. "Coach Ben" has helped Benitez prepare for his SATs and apply for college scholarships, even advising him on his relationship with a new step-father.

Benitez said Gucciardi has made a huge difference in his new life in America, acting like a second father to the teen.

Now Benitez and the other players are uniting off the field. They are tired of practicing on broken asphalt or playing at parks. The students at Oakland International are asking for a field of their own.

## A Lesson In Democracy

The field next to Oakland International High was given to a parents group from another high school years ago. The parents raised more than $400,000 to turn it into a baseball field. Oakland International was so tiny at the time, school leaders thought it didn't need an athletic field.

For a while, the international students were allowed to use the field for physical education and soccer, but the baseball parents didn't like the sharing arrangement. Starting last fall, the international students could no longer use the field.

"It feels sad," said Graciela Bibiano, 17, a tall, thin captain of the girls team who grew up playing soccer near Acapulco, Mexico. "We don't get to play together as a team and a big family. And that's what we are."

Now, the soccer-playing international students are getting a lesson in democracy in action as they fight for the right to play.

Bolor Erdenebat, 17, from Mongolia, went along with other students to a school board meeting. She spoke at the meeting and said she was impressed by the school board members' ability to keep the peace.

"It was a whole process, with people demonstrating their ideas and trying to get something," she said.

## "They Can Make A Difference"

Yasser Alwan, 17, used multimedia skills he learned at Oakland International High. During an internship at the school district's TV station, he worked for hours to create a promotional video for the soccer field campaign.

Meanwhile, Solomon Camara, a 17-year-old from Liberia, began approaching board members by phone and email. "I learned that politics is a little fun — I just like it," he said. "Before, I would have felt intimidated."

The school district held a meeting in April in the school cafeteria. The International students were on one side, the baseball parents on the other. The parents were mainly angry at the district, but some comments were unpleasant — like the suggestion that the young refugees could return to their own countries if they were unhappy here.

"Some of them, they hide some hate for us," Benitz said in an interview later.

Still, both groups came to the middle of the room to shake hands at the end. The conversation continued. School officials now hope to create a field on city land that could be used for soccer, baseball and softball.

"It gives me a lot of heartache to see that much conflict," said school board member Jody London, who represents the district and must work on behalf of both schools. "But it's really shown these students that they can have a voice and they can make a difference."
