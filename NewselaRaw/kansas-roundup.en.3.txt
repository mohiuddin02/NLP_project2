KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Jake Betts tugs the reins of his horse named Leroy. He rides up to the top of a hill.

On his saddle is a coil of rope. In the distance are cows, almost 1,100 to be herded on a recent day. The workers will gather the cows together and guide them to where they need to go.

Late July is shipping season. This is the time when cows are rounded up and sent to be fattened so they can be turned into food.

The cows are scattered across a vast field. For the last four months, the animals have munched on bluestem grasses.

Betts and the other workers like him are cowboys and cowgirls. These days, the cowboys and cowgirls use cellphones and computers. Even with high-tech tools, they follow the ways of the Old West. Men, women and children round up the cows on horseback, instead of the pickup trucks that many ranchers prefer.

## Cowboys Have Not Disappeared

"For 50 years — since about 1890, actually — we've been talking about the disappearing cowboy," said James F. Hoy. He is a professor and writes books on Kansas history.

But "cowboys are still out there," Hoy said. "They don't carry a pistol anymore in their holster. Now it's a cellphone."

A cellphone and a computer help Cliff Cole run the ranch. About six caretakers live on 80,000 acres, about 125 square miles, watching over 40,000 cows.

Three generations of the Nelson family have herded cattle on horseback.

Holton Nelson is 15. He has helped to herd cattle since he was 4 years old.

Older brother Nate has taken college classes on ranching. "But what we're doing now," said Nate, "you're not going to learn out of a book."

The Nelsons have seen plenty of changes. But the roundup, as they see it, must be carried out the way it always has been.

## Blue Jeans, Boots And Spurs

The cowboys wear long sleeves even in the heat and pointed boots. Their jeans are always blue.

Many cowboys don't get paid. They are neighbors and relatives willing to help out.

Jade Cole is 16. She rose at 3:30 in the morning to meet her uncle Cliff Cole. Other cowboys also arrived for the roundup.

In the hills are thousands of beef cattle, which are about a year old.

The riders take their places, and their horses start moving at an easy trot.

"Hyah! Hep, hep! Tsssh!"

Each cowboy has his own command to get the wandering cattle moving in the right direction. All the cattle obey.

"That's their herd mentality," says Nate Nelson. "You get into their little bubbles of safety and they'll start moving, following each other."

The cattle have learned they are safer all together.

"Epp! Epp!"

That's Ryan Gasche directing traffic. "Ryan's a yelper," Betts says.

## A Herd On The Move

At 7 a.m. the horses pick up the pace. The herd flows shoulder-to-shoulder to the top of a hill. They break into a jog. It is as if the pens are just where these cows want to be.

Gene Ernest backs his cattle truck to the far end of a pen. "Heah! Yah, yah!" More than 70 cows go up a ramp and pound into the truck.

The truckers will drive the cows 50 miles to a feedlot.

"I'm 51 and been doing this since I was 18," Ernest says. "It's the (friendship) I like. That keeps everything going."

The cattle will eat and gain weight. They'll go from 620 pounds to 1,200 in about 30 weeks. Then it's on to the slaughterhouse.

These cowboys and cowgirls like their job. They don't like talking about it much with outsiders, though.

"We don't like to go to town more than we have to," said Cliff Cole. "Hate to say it this way, but we don't really want to be (near) to people."

Some of the ranch workers say they understand cows better than people.

"You have to get them to know who you are," said Shane Nelson.
