TOKYO, Japan â€” Chikara Yamanobe is so skinny his ribs stick out and he tears up when he gets roughed up in the ring. He is about as far from a sumo wrestler as a kid can be.

Still, Chikara, whose name means "power" in Japanese, wants to be a professional sumo wrestler when he grows up. He has a long way to go, though. Chikara is only 5 years old.

Sumo is a Japanese sport in which two wrestlers try to force each other out of the ring.

"I want to be like Endo," he said, referring to a Japanese sumo star.

Chances are Chikara won't make it.

## Bats And Gloves Over Wrestling Holds

Japan's national sport is in a slump. Boys in this baseball-mad country have lost interest in the sport. It is seldom shown on nighttime TV and offers little in the way of fun products, like toys or T-shirts.

In recent years, sumo has become dominated by foreigners. When the summer grand sumo tournament wrapped up this month, the winners were all from somewhere else. Terunofuji Haruo, who is from Mongolia, emerged victorious from a competition that featured two wrestlers from his country and a Bulgarian. Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, along with an Egyptian and a couple of Georgians, also did well this year.

This is partly because people have moved away from the rigid traditions in Japan. Also, the life of a professional sumo wrestler is particularly tough. Young sumo wrestlers must leave school at 15. They have to live in training quarters, where everything from their hairstyle to their diet is decided for them.

In addition, the sport is not easy to see. The main sumo matches happen in the afternoon when kids are in school. Sumo arenas are filled largely with senior citizens and tourists.

## "Nothing Cool About It"

Mike Wesemann, an American who runs the blog Sumo Talk, said it's difficult for sumo to compete with other sports. Sumo wrestlers wear loincloths, strips of cloth wrapped around their hips. There are no jerseys and hats kids can wear, like in baseball and soccer, and kids can't exactly practice with their dads.

"There's just nothing cool about it," Wesermann said.

Sumo officials are all too aware of this.

"Sumo is not a familiar sport compared to others like soccer and baseball," said Kento Nakazawa. He is with the Japan Sumo Association.

Noboru Yoshimura, with the Japanese Sumo Federation, is also worried. Even though martial arts became part of junior high school in 2012, kids are not choosing sumo.

Participation in a children's sumo tournament dropped from 70,000 kids in 1994 to 33,000 in 2014.

## Spending Hours At The Dojo

Still, at the sumo training school in Tokyo, known as a dojo, boys spent hours doing exercises. They wrestled with coaches and fetched Band-Aids for grazes.

Sumo students are almost always boys, as girls and women have not traditionally been allowed in the ring. The boys generally practice sumo as a sport until high school. Then, if they want to continue, things become a lot more serious.

Toshiyo Abe sat on a mat watching his 6-year-old son Shotaro wrestle older boys. Shotaro asked to start sumo a year ago, so now they travel an hour by train to the dojo every Saturday and Sunday.

"I'm a little envious that he is having so much fun," Abe said.

Some parents, however, are unhappy about an important part of getting ahead in sumo: being heavy.

"Some high school clubs make you eat until you throw up, but some clubs just leave it to you to bulk up," said Akiteru Kiyomiya as he watched his two sons train. "If this is the path they want to take, then yes, I'll support them."

## A Part Of Japanese Culture

The training session lasted four hours. Afterward, coach Shinju Taira said he was worried about the decline of sumo both as a sport and as a part of Japanese culture.

"It's not that everybody will get into the professional levels. But we're trying to raise future leaders, people who can be leaders in our society," he said.

Hisao Yoshiyoka has two sons studying at the dojo. She said it taught them how to survive in Japanese society and also about Japanese traditions.

Her youngest son, Ryudai, 7, has already chosen his professional sumo wrestler name. Watch out in 2030 for a yokozuna, or grand champion, called Dairyu.
