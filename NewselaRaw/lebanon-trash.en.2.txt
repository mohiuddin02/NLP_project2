BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” It's summer in this proud Mediterranean city, which is full of international visitors for festivals and parties. Yet the country's own citizens are suffocating from mountains of stinking garbage piling up on the streets.

Lebanon has been relatively calm in contrast with the violence in neighboring Iraq and Syria. Despite a massive flood of Syrian refugees and occasional religious clashes, Beirut is largely quiet. Its politicians, though, have been unable to agree on a new president much less a solution for the capital's rubbish.

They may have to figure out something soon. Two weeks ago, authorities permanently closed Beirut's main garbage dump. The Naameh landfill south of Beirut had already been kept open for a year beyond its planned closure, in hopes that the government would find an alternative. It did not.

## Temperatures, Tensions On The Rise

When the landfill closed July 17, Lebanon's government again failed to take action. Piles of rubbish were left to bake in the sun in the streets of Beirut and its suburbs.

It came amid the busiest time of year in Beirut. International singing stars such including jazz musician Richard Bona are performing at Lebanon's famed summer festivals. Cafes and beaches are at full capacity. Partygoers sidestep rotting garbage on the way to bars at Lebanon's famous Gemayzeh Street.

Temperatures are rising, though. The country's electricity cuts are becoming more frequent. The sweltering heat and the stinking, rotting garbage has led to an outcry from Beirut's 2 million residents.

"It is a scandal, and what is even a bigger scandal is the politicians who don't feel the need to resign," said Paul Abi Rached. He is the head of the Lebanese Eco Movement.

## Dumping In The Dark Of Night

For 10 days, garbage trucks could not collect the trash, because they had nowhere to dump it. The fumes got so bad that some residents wore surgical masks to try to block out the stench. Piles of trash began growing on streets, sidewalks and near building entrances.

Lebanon's commercial center is full of beautifully restored historic buildings and luxurious apartments. It has been spared the piles of garbage for now. Officials have found a short-term solution by taking most of the trash to an empty lot and covering it with a plastic tarp.

Lebanon's waste management company Sukleen resumed collection on a small scale. It took trash to two temporary landfills, including one near Beirut International Airport. But those are filling up. Nearby cities have refused to accept Beirut's garbage.

Meanwhile, some people have taken to paying for private pickup truck owners to collect the garbage in front of their homes. The garbage is dumped at night in unknown locations. The country has no recycling services or even basic trash sorting, making the problem worse.

## Health Hazard On Many Levels

Abi Rached said garbage is polluting natural reserves, rivers and valleys.

"It's gotten to a point where people are digging up pits and burying the trash," he said.

Some people burn trash on the street. A brown, poisonous haze is drifting over the city's horizon.

"It is my duty to warn of the extensive health perils that may result from the current situation," Health Minister Wael Abou Faour said at a recent press conference. "We don't have the luxury of time or waiting."

He said he was sounding the alarm because some landfills are full, including the dump site near Beirut's airport. The trash poses air safety risks because of smoke and birds flying over the pit.

## No Hurry

Germany has offered to take away Lebanon's trash by sea. The Lebanese government said it was studying the offer along with proposals for long-term solutions. These include garbage incinerators to burn the trash and developing new landfills.

But the government does not seem to be in a hurry, postponing the issue from one meeting to the next.

The government has long been criticized for failing to take action on Lebanon's ancient infrastructure, from roads and bridges to landfills. It is symptom of the country's poorly working power-sharing system among Lebanon's major religions.

The civil war in neighboring Syria and the 1.2 million refugees living in Lebanon have made the situation worse.

## Where Are The Protests?

Despite a public outcry, very few have taken to the streets in protest. In typical Lebanese style, life has gone on, but the situation may change as anger on the street mounts.

"Shame on them (politicians) and shame on us if we accept to live like this," Antoine Samaha said. His family was seriously considering taking his mother, who has breathing problems, to live with his brother in Paris. "Every decent Lebanese should protest this situation."
