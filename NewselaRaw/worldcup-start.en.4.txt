SAO PAULO â€” Brazil last hosted the World Cup in 1950. Brazilians have waited 64 years for the World Cup to return. Now it's back in their home country.

"Tudo bem", or "all good," as the Brazilians like to say.

Well, just about.

Brazil kicked off one of the most troubled World Cups ever on Thursday. On the one hand, the country was excited. On the other, small protests popped up all over Brazil.

The Brazilian government spent billions of dollars to host the World Cup. Many in Brazil disagree with that spending. Especially while millions of Brazilians are so poor.

Yet, Brazil still roared to life Thursday with a joyous 3-1 win for the home team. Over the next month, the _futebol_ world will be watching the World Cup. "Futebol" is how Brazilians say soccer.

## Brazil's Beloved National Team

The World Cup will showcase Brazil's growth as a world power as well as its problems. Thursday's game took place in a stadium that almost wasn't ready on time. It was the first of 64 matches in 12 cities.

A few hundred people protesting the World Cup gathered in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Brasilia and Belo Horizonte.

J-Lo performed at a funky opening ceremony. Then Brazil's beloved national team took to the field. The star-studded Brazilians were not brilliant in their opening match. But they made a solid start. The goal is a sixth world title for Brazil.

Brazil's first opponent was Croatia. The Croatians were tough. The match was watched by millions around the world. It put the Brazilian fans through the wringer.

"I'm very emotional, happy, and happy that it's over," said one soccer fan, Ricieri Garbelini. "I was nervous."

## Love And Hate For The World Cup

Brazil had a terrible start though. Brazilian defender Marcelo looked stunned when he scored on his own goal. He gave Croatia a 1-0 lead after just 11 minutes. The crowd of 62,103 wailed. Grown men watching in bars let out howls.

The mood lifted when Neymar lived up to his hype as the team's biggest star. He scored in the 29th minute to tie the game for Brazil. An ear-splitting roar was unleashed from the crowd and across the nation.

The love-hate relationship Brazilians have developed with this World Cup was on display. The crowd made hairs stand on end when it sang the national anthem. But then they started chanting against unpopular Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. There were also boos for FIFA. It's the organization that runs the soccer league.

Neymar scored his second goal in the 71st minute. Oscar got the third in the 90th minute.

But the party wasn't all fun-loving. In Sao Paulo, more than 300 protesters gathered near the stadium. Some of the protests got violent.

"I'm totally against the Cup," said protester and university student Tameres Mota. "We're in a country where the money doesn't go to the community, and meanwhile we see all these millions spent on stadiums."
