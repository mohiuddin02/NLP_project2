BEIJING, China â€” The presidents of the United States and China announced a new plan to fight climate change on Wednesday. The two leaders laid out an ambitious effort to cut pollution in their own countries.

President Barack Obama said the U.S. must do more to prevent global warming. Under the new plan, the country will aim to cut pollution that causes climate change by at least 26 percent by 2025. The new target doubles the previous goal of cutting pollution.

To meet the new target, the U.S. would have to significantly lower its use of coal and oil. When fuels like coal and oil are burned for heat and electricity, they release carbon dioxide, or CO2. The CO2 stays in the earth's atmosphere. CO2 is known as a greenhouse gas, because it heats up in the atmosphere and makes global temperatures rise.

Chinese President Xi Jinping also announced that his country would speed up its efforts to reduce pollution. He said that China would increase its use of alternative energy sources. Alternative sources of energy are those that do not give off CO2. They include nuclear, wind and solar energy.

## Ambitious, But Achievable

"This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship," Obama said. "It shows what's possible when we work together on an urgent challenge." The president called the new goals ambitious, but achievable.

The U.S. and China are the two countries most responsible for creating greenhouse gases. Together, they account for more than a third of the global buildup in greenhouse gases.

"History may look back and say this was the turning point," said Congressman Henry Waxman.

The deal was immediately challenged by Obama's Republican critics. The president's opponents have pledged to roll back his measures on the environment.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell spoke out against the agreement immediately. He called it an "unrealistic plan." McConnell said it would lead to people paying higher electricity bills and "far fewer jobs."

## Preventing Global Warming

The new agreement could lead to significant change, said Ken Lieberthal, an expert on the relationship between China and the U.S. If all goes well, he said, greenhouse gases could be reduced 80 percent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. Scientists have said that only cutbacks of that size will prevent a big rise in global temperatures.

For change to occur, both the U.S. and China would have to meet their new goals. Lieberthal said other countries would have to follow their lead. Without other nations cutting their own greenhouse gases, real progress won't be made, he said.

The new agreement came shortly after the release of a report by the United Nations. The scientists behind the report said climate change is already affecting life on every continent and in the oceans. Furthermore, if governments don't act quickly, it will soon be too late to prevent the worst predicted damage.

The deal between the U.S. and China was finalized late Tuesday night as Obama and Xi met at Xi's residence.

Under the deal, Xi said China would lower CO2 pollution to targeted levels by around 2030. He also announced plans to steadily increase the use of alternative energy. By 2030, he pledged alternative energy will account for 20 percent of his country's total energy use. At that level, it would exceed the energy provided by all of China's coal power plants now. It would equal the U.S.'s total electricity production.

## Investing In Alternative Energy

China will have to work very hard to meet its goal of 20 percent alternative energy use, Lieberthal said.

China is now by far the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases. Its severe air pollution has upset people in China and embarrassed the country internationally, said Wang Yiwei of Beijing's People's University. He said Chinese leaders can no longer ignore the problem.

"Climate change is now Chinese business. It's not just someone from the outside pressing" China, Wang said.

China is investing heavily in alternative energy. At the same time, China's government wants to shift the country away from heavily polluting industries. It hopes to encourage the country to grow more slowly and develop less polluting businesses.

Here in the U.S., Obama's plans to fight climate change face obstacles other than the Republicans in Congress. The administration's rules on power plants could be weakened or overturned if courts rule against them. A new president in 2016 could also reverse the rules, Lieberthal pointed out.
