DALLAS — Like many 20-somethings, Cole Leonard has reached a professional crossroads: Should he follow a safe career path? Or should he go for a dream that might not work out?

But few people his age face such an extreme choice: He must decide between becoming a lawyer — or dying on the surface of Mars.

It's a difficult decision for the 27-year-old, who hails from Plano, Texas. Leonard has been accepted into law school at Texas Tech for the fall. But he is also one of 705 candidates competing to become part of the first human colony on Mars.

The journey is being organized by Mars One, a company founded by a Dutch [businessman](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) who insists it can be accomplished with current technology. Last year, the group began inviting would-be colonists to apply to the project. So far, more than 200,000 people from around the world have signed up. The list will be whittled down to 24 by next year, organizers said.

## Space Travel Classes

Each colonist would undergo at least eight years of training. They'd learn about space travel. And they would learn how to live on a planet with vicious dust storms,  temperatures below minus 200 degrees and a lack of breathable air.

But there's this one big catch: The technology doesn't yet exist to launch a return flight. For those who end up getting picked, it would be a one-way trip.

That sounds like a good deal to Leonard, though he doesn't much fit the bill of an astronaut. He currently works as an assistant to Dallas County Commissioner Mike Cantrell. The job consists of writing position papers and maintaining Cantrell's website. Leonard doesn't have much training in flight, engineering, agriculture, medicine or any of the other skills useful for surviving on another planet.

## Pick Me!

But in other ways, he says, he's a perfect candidate. He's young, healthy and single and has always been interested in space and science fiction. And, more importantly, he is deeply excited by the idea of exploring, and is convinced of the need for humankind to broaden its horizons.

"For some reason, people think that exploration just ended when Columbus came over and found the West Indies," he said.

Plus, he would leave behind an identical twin on Earth.

Still, there's some hesitation. Leonard says he doesn't doubt Mars One's sincerity, but he needs to be convinced that the group can pull off its grand idea. Before leaving Earth, he'd need to know more about the technology and emergency backup plans. After all, he'd hate to run out of food or electricity or water 34 million miles from home.

## The Real Astronauts Of Mars

Mars One officials declined to comment. Founder Bas Lansdorp has estimated that it will cost $6 billion to send the first group of four to Mars. He hopes to raise much of that through a worldwide reality television show, which would broadcast the training, the trip and the landing.

Leonard has simpler worries, too. He can't study to become a lawyer and train to be an astronaut at the same time. He's hesitant to give up law school for a dream that may not pan out.

Plus, he'd miss music and simple, everyday things like relaxing outdoors on a patio. There are still lots of places on Earth he hasn't seen. And, of course, there's his family, who don't want him to go.

"They flip between denial, to anger, to disgust, to thinking it's all a joke," Leonard said.

His twin, Mitchell, said that's not completely true. The family believes he's a good candidate — they just don't want him to leave the planet, or to regret his decision as he journeys through space.

"The whole family knows that Cole can get picked," said Mitchell, who is planning to room with Leonard in law school, just as he does now. "They already see him flying off into the sky."

## It's A Toss-Up

Leonard said he understands that law school would be a more practical choice — and one that might lengthen his life. But certain death on Mars doesn't scare him, he says, because death is certain everywhere.

If he becomes a lawyer, he said, "I am going to die here in some crappy retirement home in Florida." If he's going to die anyway, he feels, why not do it somewhere exciting? "Why not Mars?"
