Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's first female Prime Minister and a powerful political figure, died on April 8 after suffering a stroke. She was 87.

Thatcher was prime minister, the leader of the government in the United Kingdom, between 1979 and 1990,  a time when a  there were very few women in politics, especially in powerful positions. She was such a strong politician that she became known as the "Iron Lady," a nickname she greatly enjoyed.

Through Thatcher's political convictions, radical policies and determined personality, she changed life in Britain forever. She was also an incredibly controversial leader.

While some people think she was the best prime minister in British history, others believe she was by far the worst, and since her death there have been fierce arguments about her legacy.

## Modest Beginnings

Thatcher was born as Margaret Hilda Roberts in October 1925. But unlike many politicians of the time, she did not come from a wealthy family – she was born and lived in an apartment above the grocery store that her father owned.

A gifted student, Thatcher went to the prestigious Oxford University, where she became more and more interested in politics. She quickly rose through the ranks to become a member of Parliament, the British equivalent of being in Congress, in 1959. She became prime minister at the age of 53 in 1979.

Britain, like the United States with its Democrat and Republican parties, has a largely two-party system, where Labour represents the liberal left wing of politics while the Conservative party, also known as the Tories, represents the conservative right wing.

Margaret Thatcher was a committed Conservative, but her own particular set of beliefs and the way she enacted them became known as Thatcherism, a radical version of Conservative policy. She ruled by the politics of Thatcherism throughout her long and powerful political career.

## "Thatcher The Milk Snatcher"

Thatcher believed in a small state, meaning that the government should have limited power over the lives of its citizens.

She said, "There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families." Following this ideology, Thatcher's government legislated that people would have to pay fewer and lower taxes. As a result, they would have more take-home pay, but enjoy fewer services provided by the government.

A famous example of Thatcher's cuts to services made her unpopular among children all over the U.K. Since the end of World War II, the British government had given all schoolchildren a daily bottle of free milk, hoping to improve nutrition for younger generations. When Thatcher was in charge of education, she cut the free milk supply for all children above age 7. This earned her another nickname: "Thatcher The Milk Snatcher."

In economic policy, Thatcher believed in competition as a way of making Britain more efficient and richer. In order to increase economic competition, Thatcher took harsh measures against what she considered to be underperforming industries, like coal mining, but encouraged the growth of industries perceived to be more profitable, like banking.

## Looking For Profits

Industries in Britain, like in most other countries, are geographically concentrated in certain regions. The banking industry, located in and around London, thrived during Thatcher's leadership and it continues to do so today. But her policies also resulted in the widespread closure of large numbers of coal mines, factories and shipyards, which were mostly located in northern England, Scotland and Wales.

Given her belief in a small state and lack of government help, it also meant that workers in these areas struggled to find new employment, especially as Thatcher's government was reluctant to invest in training or other opportunities.

Workers protested against these difficult conditions by going on strike – stopping their employers' ability to function by refusing to go to work. The most important example was the huge miners' strike of 1984-85, which made international headlines as one of the longest industrial disputes in European history.

## Winning Wars

Thatcher described the striking miners as the "enemy within," but she had international "enemies" too. The territory of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean is still subject to dispute between Britain and Argentina. In 1982, Argentina invaded the islands and Thatcher responded decisively with British military force. The U.K. won a two-month war with Argentina, increasing Thatcher's popularity in Britain.

Thatcher had a very strong relationship with U.S. President Ronald Reagan, as the pair were personal friends as well as political allies who shared many of the same beliefs. Some referred to them as "soul mates." Reagan and Thatcher worked together to negotiate with the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. By collaborating, Reagan, Thatcher and Gorbachev helped end the Cold War peacefully. The Cold War, a state of political and military tension between the United States and its allies against the Soviet Union and its allies, had raged for a few decades.

## Controversial To The End

Thatcher resigned as prime minister in November 1990 and had been unwell for several years before her death. When she died, the current Prime Minister David Cameron said, "As our first woman prime minister, Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds. Margaret Thatcher didn't just lead our country. She saved our country."

As always with Thatcher, someone was quick to claim the opposite. Ken Livingstone, a former mayor of London, said, "Every real problem we face today is the legacy of the fact she was fundamentally wrong."

Maybe no one will ever agree on whether Thatcher was good, bad, or somewhere in between, but her politics and personality made Britain the place it is today.
