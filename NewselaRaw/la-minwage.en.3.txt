LOS ANGELES â€” Minimum wage is the least amount of money a boss is allowed to pay his or her workers. The amount is different in some areas of the country. In Los Angeles, the minimum wage is $9 an hour.

On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council announced a plan to raise the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour. The increase would happen gradually, in stages. Los Angeles' minimum wage would first rise to $10.50 an hour in July 2016. It would finally reach $15 an hour by 2020.

A final vote on the increase will not happen until next month. However, the measure seems likely to pass. Mayor Eric Garcetti supports it and has promised to sign it into law.

As many as 800,000 workers citywide may see their pay go up.

## City Would Be The Biggest To Raise Wages

Los Angeles is now the largest city in the country to push for a big minimum-wage increase. Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle have already approved increases.

"Make no mistake," said Councilman Paul Krekorian. "Today the city of Los Angeles, the second-biggest city in the nation, is leading the nation."

Maria Elena Durazo is a fighter for workers' rights. A higher minimum wage in Los Angeles will serve as an example for the rest of the country, she said. It will lead other cities to push for the same thing.

"Without a doubt, it was a very big victory," said Durazo.

City business groups criticized the wage increase harshly. They warned that it would force businesses to lay off workers or leave the city altogether.

The wage increase is going to hurt the very people it is supposed to help, said business group leader Ruben Gonzalez.

"It's simple math," Gonzalez said. Businesses will not be able to pay workers that much more money in such a short time.

Councilman Mitchell Englander was the only council member who voted against the increase. The wage increase could "make it impossible" for many companies to do business in Los Angeles, he said. Businesses may be forced to leave the city.

## Workers Say They Don't Make Enough Money

Many Los Angeles workers see things differently.

On Tuesday, the council heard from some low-wage Angelenos before voting. Juan Moran, who is a cook, was one person who spoke up. He told the council the current minimum wage of $9 an hour is not enough to live on.

"Sometimes I have to walk half an hour from work to get to my apartment because money's not enough to pay a ride on the bus," Moran said. "Or I work 12 hours straight without stop ... just to pay rent."

Efforts to raise the minimum wage have spread across the nation. Several West Coast cities have already introduced higher minimum wages. New York City and Washington, D.C., are considering doing the same.

Los Angeles began by raising the wages of hotel workers. Last fall, the minimum wage for workers at the city's large hotels was raised to to $15.37 an hour. Now, all low-wage workers in Los Angeles may see their pay go up.

## Lawmakers Aren't Sure What Will Happen

Some council members who voted for the plan say there could be problems. It is not easy to tell what the effects of the wage increase will be, they say.

"This is an experiment," Councilman Paul Koretz said. "If anyone tells you they know exactly how this is going to go ... they're not being honest with you."

Councilman Mike Bonin was one of the pay increase's early champions. He admitted there is some uncertainty about what its effects will be, but said the council made the right choice.

Worries about what might happen are outweighed by what people are already experiencing, he said. Every day in Los Angeles, people are "getting a poverty wage for working full time."
