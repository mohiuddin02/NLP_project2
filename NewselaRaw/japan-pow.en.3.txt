YOKOHAMA, Japan â€” World War II ended 70 years ago. About 132,000 soldiers were taken prisoner by Japan. This week, nine of them went back to Japan to mark the end of the war.

The former American soldiers are now all in their 90s. They visited some of the places where they were held prisoner and described what happened to them.

The men began the trip Monday with a memorial service for soldiers who had died. The nine men laid flowers on the graves. They also plan to visit former prisoner-of-war (POW) camp sites in several Japanese cities.

## A Focus On Forgiveness

The theme of the trip was forgiveness.

George Rogers lives in Lynchburg, Virginia. He said he is not angry with the Japanese. Rogers is now 96 years old. In 1942, he was taken prisoner by the Japanese and lived through the Bataan Death March. During the march, thousands of prisoners were forced to walk more than 60 miles under terrible conditions. Many died.

During nearly 3 1/2 years as a prisoner, Rogers did not get enough food. He had to work in a steel factory without pay. Sometimes, he was beaten up.

Rogers said that he was lucky to stay alive. He also said he had "no hard feelings" toward the Japanese.

"Just like we do what we're told to do as far as the Army is concerned, your (Japanese) men do the same thing. They tell them to do it, they do it," he said. "Other than that, I think we lived."

## Survivor Became Healthy Again

Japan lost the war and surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945. A month later, Rogers returned to the United States. He was 6 feet, 3 inches tall, but weighed only 85 pounds. Although he was just 26, his doctor told him that he would most likely not live past 45 or 50. The doctor also said that his teeth would probably fall out and he would not have children.

Rogers, who still has his teeth, has five children. One of his children went with him to Japan.

World War II was fought by most of the countries of the world. The two sides were the Allies and the Axis. The Allies included the United States and England. The Axis included Japan, Germany and Italy. About 132,000 members off the Allied forces were held as prisoners across Asia during World War II. More than 30,000 of them were held in Japan, historians say. Of the total, about 35,800, or nearly one-third, died after being taken prisoner. They died at a much higher rate than prisoners taken by Germany and Italy.

## Many Are Still Angry

Many former POWs are still angry because the Japanese treated them badly.

Arthur Gruenberg is 94 years old. He is is from Camano Island in Washington state. The former Marine surrendered to the Japanese in May 1942, and was sent to work in a mine in Fukuoka, in southern Japan. By then he was blind in one eye because there was not enough vitamin A in his food.

Gruenberg said he was impressed by today's modern Japan. He hopes it remains a peace-loving nation.

"Everything is just amazing, it's unbelievable," he said. "I can't say it (my feelings) has changed much; I just hope we don't have any more wars."
