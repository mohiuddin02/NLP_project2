WASHINGTON â€” One of the most famous portraits of George Washington will soon get a face-lift of sorts. For the first time in decades, the painting known as the "Lansdowne" portrait will be closely examined and cleaned as part of an extensive conservation project. Experts will use high-tech tools to peel away the effects of time, making it look much as it did when it was originally painted.

The Lansdowne portrait shows George Washington when he was serving as America's first president. The 8-foot-by-5-foot picture was painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1796 and has since become one of the most recognized portraits of Washington as president.

The Lansdowne is currently on display at the Smithsonian museum's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. It has been a centerpiece at the Smithsonian since 1968, and about 1 million visitors see it each year.

## George Will Look His Best

The conservation project, aimed at restoring the painting to its original appearance, will take some time. Work will begin in 2016 to delicately remove a yellowed varnish that has built up on the surface. This will make it possible to see the original colors and details intended by the artist. The project is expected to take 18 months.

Brandon Brame Fortune, who is chief curator at the Smithsonian, said the painting needs some touching up. "We want to be sure our visitors are seeing it looking its absolute best," he said.

The painting is in good condition but does have problems, including paint losses in Washington's black coat, said CindyLou Molnar, the museum's head of conservation. The biggest problem, though, is the heavy yellow varnish that makes it hard to see details in the painting.

"It will take me quite a while to figure out what it will take to safely remove the yellow resinous varnish and not disturb the actual paint surface," Molnar said.

## Revealing The Many Layers

In addition to cleaning the painting, the Smithsonian also hopes to use technology to learn more about it. Digital X-ray and other scientific tools can reveal more about how the painting changed as Stuart worked on it.

As painters revise their work, they continually paint over what they have already done. This creates multiple layers, each one corresponding to a different version or "draft" of the painting. Only the final outer layer can be seen with the naked eye. With the use of technology, however, it is possible to see previous versions of a painting as well.

In 2001, film X-rays of the Lansdowne revealed some changes Stuart made in the picture. In one case, he moved a quill ink pen on the table beside Washington. These X-ray images indicate that Stuart was having trouble finding the right positions for everything in the portrait, Molnar said. New technology will provide clearer images of the painting's hidden layers. The hope is that these images will lead to new discoveries about how the painting was made and how it evolved.

## Dolley To The Rescue

The interest in examining and restoring the Lansdowne is a testament to the painting's artistic and historical significance. It was Washington's first full-length presidential portrait not in military uniform. It shows him dressed in a black velvet suit, his official dress for receiving the public as a civilian leader.

The president posed for the painting in Philadelphia and helped determine how he would be portrayed. It was originally painted for the Marquis of Lansdowne, a British nobleman who had been a supporter of the colonies during the Revolutionary War.

After completing the original in 1796, Stuart later created three copies of the portrait, one of which is held by the White House. The painting's fame grew, thanks to an incident that took place in 1814 while the United States was at war with Great Britain for a second time. British troops took Washington, D.C., and proceeded to set fire to much of the city, including the White House. The president at the time was James Madison. His wife, Dolley Madison, famously rescued the Lansdowne portrait from the fire. This event added to the portrait's fame, securing its place in American history.

## We Will See The Symbolism

The painting is also notable for its depiction of Washington as a forefather of a revolutionary new nation. The premiere portrait artist of his day, Stuart packed symbols of American history into his depiction of Washington. Furniture in the picture is carved with eagles and the U.S. seal. Books in the painting reference the U.S. Constitution, Congress and the Federalist papers, an important collection of essays written in the early days of the United States. In the windows behind Washington, a rainbow appears in the sky behind dark clouds.

"The storm clouds had to do with the passing of the American Revolution," Fortune said, "and the rainbow signified a new beginning for the new republic. The coming conservation project may make details like these more visible to future museum-goers.
