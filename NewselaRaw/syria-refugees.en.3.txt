MAFRAQ, Jordan â€” U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday postponed U.S. missile strikes against the Syrian government so he could first seek approval from Congress. The decision brought anger and fear to the Zaatari refugee camp.

"If they're going to strike, let them strike once and for all" and get rid of the government, grumbled Um Hafiz. She had fled with her husband and five children from their village near Syria's southern city of Daara in January.

Others said Sunday they worried that Obama's decision would make Syrian President Bashar Assad more brave. He might even dare to attack Zaatari, they said. The camp is a major recruiting ground for rebel fighters. It is located about five miles inside Jordan. It is also a dusty, sun-stricken stretch of tents and metal huts.

"People are angry, but when the Americans do attack, we will be happy they do," said Raad Zoubi, 23. Zoubi has lived in the camp for the past year.

## U.S. Says Poison Gas Used

The refugees in Zaatari were excited that an attack would happen late last week. The United States signaled that cruise-missile strikes would happen any day. U.S. officials said that they were highly confident that the Assad government was behind an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack. The attack took place in a town near Damascus that is held by rebels. It killed at least 1,429 people who were not soldiers.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that evidence showed sarin gas was used. Sarin is a deadly nerve gas. The gas can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin. U.N. inspectors have not confirmed if the gas was used. They are still testing samples collected in Syria last week.

People in the camp heard Obama's decision on live broadcasts of his announcement Saturday. It was carried by Arabic-language television channels.

"Everybody was watching," said Zoubi, 23, a baker from Taybeh, a village outside Daara. The anti-Assad protests that led to the civil war erupted there on March 18, 2011.

## Under An Assad For Decades

More than 120,000 people live in the camp. Most probably did not understand Obama's decision to seek congressional approval. A majority of Americans were against the United States getting involved in Syria. But the people in Zaatari come from a country that has been controlled by just one family for more than 40 years.

Obama's decision at the very least delays any military strike. Some in Congress doubt that Obama can win approval at all.

Fadil Issa said many refugees think Obama called off the U.S. strikes for fear they could have triggered hostilities between the United States and Iran. Iran is one of Assad's main allies.

"People are unhappy by this postponement. They don't understand why he's afraid of Iran," he said.

Some people were also unhappy with life at the camp. They were willing to return to Syria, no matter the danger.

## "We're Not Afraid"

Many men, women and children waited in the heat late one afternoon. They would get on buses that would leave them at unofficial border crossings maintained by the Jordanian military. From there, they were to walk to Syrian territory controlled by rebels of the Free Syrian Army. The FSA is a loose collection of rebel groups.

Seats on the buses are limited. It's first come, first served. So the crowd charged the vehicles as they pulled up in clouds of choking dust. People pushed and shoved through the doors, their possessions stuffed in cloth bundles and old suitcases.

Jordanian police forces in three armored cars stood by impassively. They were on guard against serious trouble.

The buses were preceded by a truck hauling a trailer with windows cut into its sides. It appeared to be bringing rebel fighters back into Syria. Only men and teenage boys swarmed into the trailer.

"It's unbearable to live here," said Hafiz as she watched the scene, several of her daughters clustered by her side. "Even with rocket explosions, it's better over there. We're not afraid. Whatever Allah has written for us will happen."
