Much has improved for women in the past 20 years. Gradually, women have gained more freedom and more equal opportunities. Still, women and girls all over the world continue to be treated unfairly.

In 1995, the United Nations (U.N.) held a meeting in Beijing, China. The United Nations is a gathering of leaders from countries all over the world. The goal of the U.N. is to allow countries to cooperate and solve the world's toughest problems.

The problem that was discussed in Beijing was how to help women and children around the world get fair treatment and equal rights. U.N. members came up with a set of goals. They called it the "Platform for Action" and 189 countries agreed to it.

This year, U.N. members will gather to discuss women's rights once again. They will review how much progress has been made. According to two new studies, many of their goals have not been met.

## It's Still A Man's World

One study was done by the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), a top university. The study found that most countries still have laws that are unfair to women.

The other study came from the U.N. itself. It reviewed how much has changed in the past 20 years. It indicated that there has been some progress. It found that there is a long way to go, however.

For example, men still have more control in government than women. Only 20 countries around the world are led by women. Although women make up about half the world's population, only about one fifth of lawmakers are women. Around the world, women are also paid less than men for doing the same work.

Although there have been some changes, it has been slow. At the current speed, it will take about 50 years for there to be as many women in government as men. It will take 81 years for women to have as many jobs and make as much money as men.

Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka is the head of the U.N. group that works to improve women's lives. She discussed the U.N. study last week. She said that world leaders have not done enough.

"The leaders entrusted with the power to realize the promises made in Beijing have failed women and girls," she said.

## More Schoolgirls, Fewer Child Brides

There have been improvements, though. Nearly half of all grade school students are now girls. More workers are women as well. Health care for women has also improved.

Many countries have also passed laws that protect young girls. In some places, girls are pressured to get married at a young age. This makes it hard for them to make their own choices, get jobs or earn money. It also means they often become mothers at a young age.

"Girls who marry young have babies young," said Jody Heymann. She was one of the people behind the UCLA study. Having children at a young age is dangerous for women's health and for their babies' health, she said.

Now, almost every country has a law that says that people cannot marry until they reach a certain age. The Maldives is an island country in the Indian Ocean. The country passed a law in 2001 that said that people could not marry until the age of 18. Since then, the number of girls getting married between the ages of 15 and 18 has dropped substantially.

Still, all around the world, nearly five times more girls than boys get married before they turn 18.

Even though women and girls are still treated unfairly, the UCLA study found that positive changes have been made in every region of the world.

"Clearly we have the capability to do this as a global community," Heymann said. "It's a question of whether we all focus on getting the job done."
