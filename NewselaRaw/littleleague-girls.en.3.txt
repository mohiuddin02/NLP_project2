SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. â€” Kathryn "Tubby" Johnston Massar cut off her braids and tucked her hair under her cap. She made herself look like a boy to become the first girl to play Little League baseball. That was more than 60 years ago. Today she's thrilled to see two girls in the Little League World Series.

"It's truly amazing. I'm very happy to see girls playing," Massar said. She is now 78 years old.

## You Go Girls!

On Friday, the two girls stepped onto the field at the Little League World Series. Mo'ne Davis plays for Philadelphia. Emma March plays for Canada. They became the 17th and 18th girls to ever play in the tournament. The tournament has been going on for 68 years. It is only the third time that two girls are playing in the same series.

Davis pitched for Philadelphia as it beat Nashville 4-0. She had eight strikeouts and did not walk a single batter. She only gave up two hits.

Fans cheered loudly when Davis struck out the final batter. She became the first girl to pitch a game without giving up any runs in Little League World Series history. Pitching a whole game without giving up a run is called a shutout.

"It's very unreal. I never thought at the age of 13, I would be a role model," Davis said. "Hopefully, more girls play Little League."

## Deep Hit To The Outfield

March did not do as well.

She batted fourth and played first base. Her brother Evan batted right after her. March went hitless Friday as Canada lost 4-3 to Mexico.

Still, the fans were excited to see March play. In the fourth inning she stepped into the batter's box to hit.

She hit a ball deep into the outfield. It looked like it might be a home run. However, the hit went foul and into the stands.

## Little League Today, Big League Tomorrow

Before every game, someone gets to throw out the first pitch. It is an honor. Massar was chosen to throw out the first pitch at one of Monday's games. She believes more girls will play Little League. She is certain that someday a woman will play Major League Baseball.

Massar played in Little League in 1950. Girls were banned from playing after people found out that she was a girl. The rule was changed in 1974. Massar said she celebrates her place in history.

"It's something I'm proud of," she said. "Why not play baseball with the boys?"

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett watched Davis play. He said she seemed to handle the pressure well. He said he was wondering if she would play professional baseball one day.

"I don't know," Corbett said. "She's played as well as any kid out there right now."
