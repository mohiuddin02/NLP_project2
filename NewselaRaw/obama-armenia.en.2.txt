WASHINGTON — This year marks the 100th anniversary of the mass killing of more than 1 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks. On Friday, President Barack Obama will give a speech memorializing those who died. However, he will not use the word "genocide" to describe the killings, the White House said.

Genocide is the planned killing of a large group of people primarily because of their race or ethnicity.

The decision not to use the word backs down from a previous Obama pledge. Armenian-American activists immediately reacted with anger.

"The president's surrender represents a national disgrace," said Aram S. Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America. "It is a betrayal of the truth, and it is a betrayal of trust."

## "Deeply Disappointed"

White House officials defended the decision and said it was necessary to preserve the chance of cooperation with Turkey on conflicts in the Middle East.

The Turkish government has said that the mass killings do not meet the legal definition of genocide.

California has the country's largest population of people of Armenian descent. More than 200,000 Armenian-Americans live in Los Angeles County alone.

California Representative Adam B. Schiff has led efforts in Congress to recognize the genocide. Schiff said he was "deeply disappointed" by the decision.

"How long must the victims and their families wait before our nation has the courage to confront Turkey with the truth about the murderous past of the Ottoman Empire? If not this president, who spoke so eloquently and passionately about recognition in the past, whom? If not after 100 years, when?" he said in a statement.

## Keeping The Same Approach

A senior White House administration official said Obama will mark "the historical significance" of the mass killings.

"We know and respect that there are some who are hoping to hear different language this year. We understand" their point of view, the official said.

However, the official added, "the approach we have taken in previous years remains the right one." It is right, the official said, "both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present." The United States hopes for cooperation from Turkey, particularly in confronting the civil war in Syria. Thus, it seeks to avoid offending the country's government.

White House official Susan Rice met Tuesday afternoon with Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. She urged him "to take concrete steps to improve relations with Armenia." In addition, she said he should encourage "an open and frank dialogue in Turkey about the atrocities of 1915."

The United States will send a delegation to Armenia this week, including California Representative Jackie Speier. In a statement, Speier said, "I intend to call it what it was — I will call it a genocide everywhere I go."

## Past Administrations Also Resisted

Roughly 1.5 million Armenians were killed starting in 1915 during the chaotic collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

Whether to use the word "genocide" to describe those killings has been a tricky and emotional political issue for years. Turkish officials say there was no plan to wipe out Armenians, so they say the killings do not meet the legal definition of genocide. Most historians, however, have concluded that the use of the word is appropriate.

U.S. administrations have in the past resisted using the word so as not to offend Turkey.

Armenian activists had hoped Obama would break with the past this year. They became particularly hopeful after Pope Francis referred to genocide in a statement just over a week ago.

The pope and various European leaders have been "encouraging Turkey to come to terms with its past," said Bryan Ardouny, executive director of Armenian Assembly of America. "We had hoped and expected that President Obama would have done the same."

## President's 2008 "Facts"

In the past, Obama has supported using the term to describe the killings. When he was a senator and a presidential candidate, he criticized the George W. Bush administration for not doing so.

Armenian genocide is "a widely documented fact" supported by "historical evidence," Obama said in 2008. "The facts are undeniable."
