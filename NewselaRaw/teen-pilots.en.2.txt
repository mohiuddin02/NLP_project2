CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Whenever 17-year-old Selena Berry is having a hard day, she looks toward the sky. She imagines herself soaring high in the clouds above her troubled neighborhood and schools.

"Flying makes you feel big," Berry said. "You are on top of everything. Untouchable. You look down and all you see is the view, the beauty."

This summer, Berry and seven other African-American students from the Chicago area are enrolled in a program called Tuskegee Next. The program teaches teens how to fly planes. At the end, students will graduate and have earned a private pilot's license. This is the first step toward learning to fly commercial airliners. It is a special effort to increase the number of African-Americans who can work as pilots.

The group was named after the Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military pilots.

## Flying Lessons Are Not Cheap

Stephen L. Davis, the founder of Tuskegee Next and owner of a lighting company in Illinois, spent much of his life wanting to become a pilot. But growing up, he could not pay for the expensive schooling. By the time he could afford lessons, he had a wife and children and did not want to take the risk. He is now the first African-American to serve as chairman of the DuPage County Airport Authority Board.

"When you don't see black pilots, you don't think you can do it," he said. "Even if these kids don't become pilots, learning to fly will give them confidence to do other great things."

It costs about $25,000 to earn a pilot's license. The money pays for flying time and lessons. But it is free for the students in Davis' program. Davis donates his own money and raises funds to cover the tuition.

## Building Confidence, Life Skills

For every 100 pilots in the United States, fewer than two are African-American. This may discourage young African-Americans from learning to fly.

For kids growing up in poor communities, learning to fly can have many benefits. Getting behind the controls of a plane and soaring into the sky allows kids to escape the harsh realities of their communities. They also learn discipline and build confidence.

"Flying an airplane is not necessarily as difficult as some of the other decisions these kids will have to make," Davis said. "It's good for them to learn how to fly. But we also have to mentor them so they can make good life decisions and make it to 18 safely."

The Tuskegee Next program works with kids from troubled communities. They welcome kids who might never have such an opportunity and pay for all of their lessons.

## Ready For That Solo Flight

Some of the students in Tuskegee Next receive a small paycheck when they participate. This money makes up for the summer jobs they would have had if they were not enrolled in the program. The students live on the campuses of local colleges so they will not be distracted by regular life. The spend their mornings doing fitness drills to stay healthy and in shape. Then they spend time in classrooms completing coursework.

All eight of the students have passed the written exam. Now they are spending hours piloting a small Cessna aircraft with an instructor.

Some of the students are already flying the planes alone.

On a recent sunny afternoon, 20-year-old Quiana White spent about an hour alone in a Cessna airplane practicing turns. This was her first solo flight and her peers celebrated after she landed.

Marcellus Freeman, 18, grew up in the far South Side. He became familiar with flying because his father worked at an airport as a ramp agent guiding planes to their gates and his family traveled frequently. Ever since, he knew he wanted to work in the sky.

"You're not the same person once you go up on your own," he said. "No matter what happens, I know I'm a pilot."
