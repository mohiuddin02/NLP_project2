MILWAUKEE, Wis. â€” A drone is a remote-controlled airplane. It has a camera. It takes pictures or video from the air. A computer can steer the drone. A person on the ground can fly it.

Zach Fiene once spent hours walking through farm fields. He looked for sick plants and bugs. He looked for dry spots. Now he just flies a drone.

A drone can tell him that information in minutes.

## Drones Are Helpers

Zach owns DMZ Aerial with his cousin. It is a company that uses drones to help farmers.

Drones can get information about crops. They tell farmers where to put weed killer. Drones can also tell farmers where to water.

It can take a lot of time to walk through a field. Farmers can still miss something, Zach said.

Farmers might walk past a problem area. They may not even see it. Then later, the farmer's corn is dead, he said.

## New Rules Are Needed

The Federal Aviation Administration is in charge of the skies. It is writing new rules for drones. These rules would let businesses use drones.

Pilots worry that some drones are too small. Pilots cannot see them, said Andrew Moore. He works with the National Agricultural Aviation Association. Drones can cause crashes.

Andrew's group wants to put lights on drones. Lights would help airplane pilots spot them.

## Flying A Drone Can Be Fun

There are other problems. Drones can take pictures of people from above. The people would never know.

Landmark Cooperative Services is a farming business in Wisconsin. It uses drones and people. First a drone flies over a farm. It might find a problem. Then a crop scout takes a closer look.

Drones are fun, said Chase Sellnow. He works at Landmark.

They make work less boring.

Everybody wants to fly a drone, Chase said.
