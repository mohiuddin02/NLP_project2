BEIJING â€” If you want a full-time teaching job in China, Luo Chunlei advises that you buy the school principal a box of mooncakes. Then follow that up with an envelope full of cash.

Having an operation? Better slip the main doctor some money. Don't forget the one giving the painkiller, too.

"I'm absolutely disgusted by it, but this is how our system works," said Luo. He is a math teacher who now fights for social change. Luo is campaigning against what he calls widespread corruption in China's society.

Gift-giving has long been a big part of Chinese life. But these days it is increasingly colliding with modern anti-bribery laws.

## Communist Party Poopers

This year, the government has turned party pooper. It has begun speaking forcefully against excessive gift-giving.

"Gift-giving is a must, but you should avoid extravagance," advised the official state paper, the People's Daily. Gifts of luxury brands, wine, expensive cigarette and large amounts of cash were all warned against.

The new standards on gift-giving are part of an overall campaign launched by China's new president, Xi Jinping. The campaign is aimed at fighting corruption, or wrongdoing in government. The crackdown started last month with the beginning of the holiday season. This runs from the Sept. 19 Mid-Autumn Festival to the Lunar New Year at the end of January.

Wang Qishan is the government's new anti-corruption czar. He recently declared that gifts have gotten more and more expensive. The rich gifts have "polluted" the holiday season, he said.

"China has always been a society of guanxi," or connections, said economist Hu Xingdou. "Treating people to meals, giving people gifts, is all part of the Chinese lifestyle. This is something that goes way back and definitely clashes with the rule of law."

## Expensive And Excessive Exchanges

The crackdown has forced the Chinese to ask a tough question: How much is too much?

For the Mid-Autumn Festival, businessmen give each other hockey-puck-shaped mooncakes. These sometimes cost as much as $200 per box.

Luxury Panda brand cigarettes wrapped for holidays are another popular gift. Prices can reach up to $50 a pack.

In southern China, cash is slipped into red envelopes. Gift certificates are also popular, because they can easily be traded for cash.

Then there are the gifts parents give to help make sure their children get good grades. These are especially expected on Teachers' Day, a public holiday in China.

But such gifts are chicken feed compared with the gifts given to important people: things like expensive Montblanc pens and $10,000 Rolex watches.

Or a $3 million villa on the French Riviera. That's what former government official Bo Xilai got. Bo was recently sentenced to life in prison for accepting illegal payments favors.

## Giving Gifts To Get A Job

China's population is enormous, which means people have to fight for education, health care and jobs can be strong. Gifts are widely seen as a way to gain some advantage.

Luo said that his family paid doctors around $16,000 when his grandfather was having an operation. They did this even though the operation was supposedly alreayd paid for by health insurance.

Parents in his hometown, he added, have to pay at least $3,200 if they want their child transfered to a better school.

Some in China are particularly concerned with the bribing of government officials. Some have published photos of officials wearing expensive watches. Official shouldn't be able to afford such watches, since most make no more than $850 per month.

One mid-level official had a collection of timepieces that included a $62,000 Vacheron Constantin. This earned him the nickname "Brother Watch." It also got him a 14-year prison sentence.

Legally, officials are not supposed to take gifts worth more than about $820 each. But the law is widely ignored. And when it is not ignored, it is unevenly enforced.

## Corruption Campaigns Come And Go

President Xi is not the first Chinese leader to speak up about corruption.

"There is a pattern in China. Each time a new leader comes in, he sets a fire and starts to crack down very hard on corruption," said Professor Qiao Xinsheng. "These campaigns come and go." But eventually, China will not accept corruption as easily, Qiao said.

Hu, the economist, said that enforcement of anti-corruption laws in China remains uneven.

It has to be that way, he said. "We couldn't possibly hold all Chinese officials to the same standard because if we did, there would be no officials left standing."
