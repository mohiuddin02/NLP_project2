LOS ANGELES â€” Scientists from China and Massachusetts think they know what was responsible for the largest extinction our planet has ever seen. They pin the blame on tiny microbes on the bottom of the ocean floor.

Microbes are living things, usually bacteria, that can only be seen under a microscope. The microbes discussed in the study were so small, that 1 billion of them could fit in a thimble-full of dirt found on the ocean floor. Despite their size, they were almost responsible for killing off all the life on our planet, the scientists suggest.

It happened during what scientists call the end-Permian extinction, the worst mass extinction the Earth has ever seen. Scientists say it was roughly 252 million years ago, long before the time of the dinosaurs. The extinction continued for 20,000 years. By the time it was over, nearly 90 percent of all life on Earth had been destroyed, the scientists say.

"It was not as dramatic as the impact that probably killed the dinosaurs, but it was worse," said Gregory Fournier, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who studies evolution. "Things were very close to being over for good."

## Rise In Carbon Levels

Scientists have struggled to understand exactly what caused the long, slow, mass die-off. Information found from studying layers of rocks tells us there was a quick increase in CO2 levels at the time. That would have caused the oceans to become more acidic and the Earth to heat up. Most forms of life would not have been able to survive. But what actually caused the CO2 levels to rise has remained a mystery.

Some scientists have suggested an asteroid could be to blame, while others say that volcanic activity or coal fires might have been the cause.

Now, researchers from MIT and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have named a new and unlikely suspect. They blame a tiny microbe known as Methanosarcina that spewed out methane gas.

The first clue that microscopic microbes could be involved came when MIT geophysicist Dan Rothman was looking at how carbon levels grew during this time. What he saw was not a straight line, but rather a rapid upward curve. A sudden fire in a coal field in Siberia would not have created CO2 that way, he said.

It was the first time anyone had suggested microbes might be involved with the end-Permian extinction. But microbes have been accused of changing the chemistry of our planet at other times. For example, microbes are responsible for creating the first oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.

"What they do is crucial," Rothman said. "And if they do better or worse, things change."

Fournier put it this way: "Microbiologists like to say, 'Microbes rule the Earth, and we just live on it.'"

## Microbes Fed On Nickel

To figure out exactly which kind of microbe might have been responsible, Rothman took his research to Fournier. The biologist had published a paper about Methanosarcina in 2008. The paper showed that sometime in the last 400 million years, Methanosarcina got a new gene. The new gene allowed it to produce methane more efficiently than ever before.

After seeing Rothman's analysis, Fournier worked to figure out more specifically when the gene appeared. He found it most likely occurred about 250 million years ago.

The researchers cannot say for certain that the microbe and the vast quantities of methane it produced were responsible for the end-Permian extinction. Still, they do have one more line of evidence to support their hypothesis. In order to make methane, Methanosarcina needs nickel.

"Even if they had all the food in the world they would be limited if they were starved for nickel," Fournier said.

But if there was a lot of nickel around, the microbes would have no problem. And, wouldn't you know, much of the volcanic activity at the time occurred in Siberia, which has some of the world's largest deposits of nickel. Furthermore, the researchers found an increase in nickel in dirt from that time.

"Our proposal is unusual, but it does bring together many observations, and ties a lot of stuff together," Rothman said. "That doesn't make it right, but it is consistent, and that's what is necessary to move forward and provide further tests."
