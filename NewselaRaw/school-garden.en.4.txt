LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Not long ago, Elizabeth Castro had never tasted beets. Now she eats them. She even grows them.

Elizabeth is 15 years old. She goes to a gardening club at school.  She grows fruits and vegetables there. Her school is in a strange place for a such a big garden. It is in the middle of the city. It is near auto shops and fast food places. She brings home some of the things she grows for her family to try.

The garden was started four years ago. Soon the school will build a greenhouse. Then the students can grow food when it is cold out.

## Gardens Help People Be Healthy

Gardening programs help people be healthy. Growing food that is good for them makes them want to eat it.

The program helps children eat more fruits and vegetables. This helps them to not get fat.

The program is after school. It is 12 weeks long. Students grow all kinds of food. They cook using what they grow.

## Students Eat Better, Do Better In School

Many of the school's students are overweight. The garden will help them in many ways.

The people who run the program said students in it eat better. They also do better in school.

## Trying New Things

Azucena Lozoya is 16 years old. She is in the program. Azucena signed up because she had never tried anything like it.  Azucena said she has enjoyed tasting vegetables like kale. Her mother never made things like that.

Many schools have outside spots that are not used. It would help kids eat better and do better if schools made those places into gardens.
