LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — On April 1, California Governor Jerry Brown stood on a patch of brown grass in the Sierra Nevada — one that is usually covered with several feet of snow — to announce the first forced water restrictions in California history.

Brown watched as state officials took stock of the Sierra Nevada's historically low levels of snowpack during the state's continuing drought. "It's a different world," he said. "We have to act differently."

## Cut Water Use By 25 Percent

Brown ordered the State Water Resources Control Board to implement forced restrictions to reduce water use by 25 percent. The water savings are expected to amount to 1.5 million acre-feet of water over the next nine months.

Brown's plan would also:

—Require golf courses, cemeteries and other large landscaped spaces to reduce water consumption.

—Create partnerships with local governments throughout the state to replace 50 million square feet of lawn with drought-tolerant landscaping.

—Establish financial incentives for replacing old appliances with more water- and energy-efficient ones.

—Establish water-efficient drip irrigation standards for new homes.

—Ban watering ornamental grass on public street dividers.

—Call on water agencies to implement new pricing models that discourage excessive water use.

## "Way Below The Records"

Frank Gehrke, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Survey Program, said he has been attending the snowpack measurements since 1987 and had never before seen the ground bare of snow on April 1. "It's way below the records," he added.

It's another cause for concern in a state already struggling through a drought, especially since the wet season is winding to a close.

April 1 is typically considered the peak of snowpack accumulation in California, but the water content measurements of this year's snow were only about 5 percent of the usual average.

This year's snowpack is expected to be lower than any year since 1950, when record-keeping began. Never before has the amount of water in the snow on April 1 dipped lower than 25 percent of the historical average for that day.

Melted snowpack usually accounts for about 30 percent of California's water supply. While reservoir levels and rainfall totals have recently improved, officials from the Department of Water Resources are still concerned that there will be virtually no snow runoff when the rain stops and temperatures rise.

Department spokesman Doug Carlson called the situation "dismal," saying his team has never encountered anything like it before.

## Dropping Snow Levels

The April 1 reading will be state water officials' fourth manual snow survey this year at Phillips Station, about 90 miles east of Sacramento. Carlson said the station traditionally averages more than 60 inches of snow at this time of year.

Snow levels in the Sierra have declined each month since manual surveying began on Dec. 30. That initial reading showed that the snow's water content was 50 percent of the normal level for the date. A month later, it dropped to 25 percent of the usual average, and in March, it was only 19 percent.

Carlson said that will likely mean looking to water located below the earth's surface, called groundwater, as a solution. "That brings in a whole other set of problems and complications since the groundwater seems to be over-tapped," he said.

Officials say the low snowfall totals are the result of relatively meager rainfall combined with unusually warm weather.

At the eight stations in the northern Sierra where the Department of Water Resources measures precipitation, about 32 inches of rain — just 76 percent of the usual average — have fallen since the water year began in October.

According to the National Weather Service, Sacramento has also seen temperatures as much as six degrees higher than normal each month for the past 15 months.

## Rains Helped Reservoirs

The rest of the state's water picture doesn't look as dreary.

Major storms that hit California in December and February were warm, so the precipitation fell as rain rather than snow. Though precipitation levels are below the state's historical average, the northern Sierra stations have already gotten more rain since October than they did during all of the 2013-14 water year, which lasts from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.

That rain has helped refill the state's reservoirs. As of March 30, Lake Oroville — the keystone reservoir of the California State Water Project, which delivers water from Northern California to the south — was at 51 percent of its capacity, compared with 49 percent a year ago. Lake Shasta, the state's largest reservoir, had about 150 billion gallons more water in it on March 30 than it did a year ago.

Still, that rainfall hasn't been enough to set the State Water Resources Control Board at ease. As Board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus has described it, the state of California's snowpack is "just terrifying."

## Stricter Drought Regulations

As a result, the board recently made its emergency drought regulations more strict by directing local agencies to limit the number of days residents can water their yards. The board also warned that it will impose tougher restrictions of its own if local agencies don't ramp up conservation efforts.

"We are not seeing the level of stepping up and ringing the alarm bells that the situation warrants," Marcus said.

Governor Brown and lawmakers have responded to the drought with new legislation, including a $1 billion plan the governor signed last week.

It includes $127.8 million for food and water supplies and immediate measures to protect the environment from the effects of the drought. Most of the funding is for long-term projects such as recycling sewage water, improving treatment facilities and supporting desalination plants.
