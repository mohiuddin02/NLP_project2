WASHINGTON â€”The United States has a weight problem. Over one-third of adults are more than just overweight, they are obese. So are one-tenth of children. On Tuesday, the top U.S. medical organization voted to label obesity as a disease.

The move affects 78 million American adults and 12 million children. They will now be seen as patients having a medical condition that requires treatment.

The American Medical Association is the nation's leading group of doctors. The AMA took the vote after much debate. They argued whether the action would do more to help overweight patients get useful treatment, or would add more shame to the condition.

The AMA's own experts had cautioned against the move. But in the end, AMA decided to extend the new disease status.

## Tackling The Problem

Dr. Patrice Harris is an AMA board member. He said labeling [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) as a disease will help change the way the doctors tackle the issue.

Tuesday's vote should put pressure on health insurance companies. There is demand for the companies to pay doctors for time-consuming talks with their patients about obesity. It should make doctors more likely to recommend weight-loss programs and monitor their patients' progress.

Obesity is measured by body mass index. Having a body mass index above 30 makes someone obese. A person's height and weight go into this measurement.

Medicare is a government-sponsored program. It insures an estimated 13 million obese Americans who are over 65 or disabled. Medicare already covers the costs of some treatments for these patients. Those treatments include exercise and eating more healthy foods. It also pays for certain operations. For example, some patients can get an operation to reduce the size of their stomach.

But not all insurance covers such obesity treatments.

## Recommending Treatments

The AMA's decision means doctors will have a duty to tell their patients that they are obese. They will also need to recommend treatment.

The decision should help doctors get over their discomfort about talking about obesity. More than half of obese patients have never been told by a doctor they need to lose weight, studies show. Doctors avoid having the talk. Not only do they not want to offend their patient, but they may also be unwilling to start a long conversation for which they won't be paid.

The AMA used to call to obesity a condition, a concern and a disorder. The new disease label is more urgent and serious.

Doctors "tend to look at obesity as a behavior problem," said Dr. Rexford Ahima of the University of Pennsylvania. "This will force (doctors) to address it, even if we don't have a cure for it."

Americans have been gaining weight at a fast pace for 30 years. All those extra pounds have caused a lot of expensive health problems. Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are just two of them. Treatment for weight-related diseases costs the U.S. $150 billion a year. That figure could rise by $550 billion over the next 20 years, Duke University found.

## Prevention Programs Boosted

The AMA argued that calling obesity a disease could bring new treatments. The government has approved just two new weight-loss medications since 1999. Making obesity a disease could pressure the government to approve new obesity drugs. That could help get new medications invented. It could also make doctors prescribe them more, the AMA noted.

Labeling obesity a disease also might help prevention programs.  More physical education and better school lunches were two examples the AMA mentioned. The vote may also make companies pay for obesity treatments for their workers. And obese workers may be less likely to face job discrimination, the AMA said.

But the AMA also said that making obesity a disease has risks. It could put more unwanted attention on obese people. Some patients could be doomed to endless nagging. Even those who were otherwise healthy or had lost enough weight to improve their health.

It might also shift focus toward expensive drugs and surgeries. The AMA does not want these to overshadow healthy diets and regular exercise.

Dr. Daniel H. Bessesen is an obesity expert at the University of Colorado. He called the AMA's shift "a double-edged sword." Changing the label shows there's "a growing awareness that obesity is not someone's fault." Still, he worried that the term disease may make people feel ashamed. People who are obese don't need to feel any more shame, he added.
