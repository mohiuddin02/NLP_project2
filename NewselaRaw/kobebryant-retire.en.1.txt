LOS ANGELES, Calif. — After a lifetime in basketball, Kobe Bryant fulfilled his longstanding promise that he would never play basketball for another team. On Sunday, he announced that he will retire after this season, ending a landmark 20-year NBA career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Lakers. He was serenaded with cheers throughout the team's 107-103 loss to Indiana during Sunday's game.

"I had to just accept the fact that I don't want to do this anymore, and I'm OK with that," the smiling Bryant said after the game.

Bryant made the long-expected declaration in a poem titled "Dear Basketball," which was posted on The Players' Tribune website on Sunday.

"My heart can take the pounding. My mind can handle the grind. But my body knows it's time to say goodbye," wrote Bryant, who is the third-leading scorer in NBA history. "And that's OK. I'm ready to let you go. I want you to know now. So we both can savor every moment we have left together. The good and the bad. We have given each other all that we have."

## Pride In The Purple And Gold

When the Lakers played against the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night, fans did not expect much from the struggling team. Instead they received a letter from Bryant in a black envelope stamped with gold.

"What you've done for me is far greater than anything I've done for you," Bryant wrote. "I knew that each minute of each game I wore purple and gold," the team's colors.

Bryant's announcement fit a dramatic career that has included five championship rings and 17 All-Star selections. No other NBA player has played so long on a single team.

In 1996, Bryant went straight from high school in suburban Philadelphia to his favorite childhood team. He became the top scorer in Lakers history with creativity and resourceful athleticism that inspired a generation of fans and players.

## Injuries Ended Last 3 Seasons

"Kobe was my (Michael) Jordan," said Paul George, who plays basketball for the Indiana Pacers. "Watching him win championships when I was growing up, that's who I idolized. That was the standard."

But Bryant's last three seasons have ended early due to injuries, and he played in only 41 games over the previous two years. He struggled in the first 16 games of this season, making just 32 percent of his shots — the worst of his career — and dealing with pain and exhaustion every day.

"There's so much beauty in the pain of this thing," Bryant said. "It sounds really weird to say that, but I appreciate the really, really tough times as much as I appreciate the great times. It's important to go through that progression, because I think that's where you really learn about the self."

## Coach Surprised By Star's Decision

Lakers coach Byron Scott, Bryant's teammate during the 1996-97 season, was surprised by Bryant's decision and thought he "had at least another year" in him.

Bryant disagreed, and he decided to make it public after talking with superstar player Michael Jordan and other basketball "muses."

"If I had a burning desire to continue to play, I would," Bryant said. "I feel very solid in my decision."

Even during his late-career struggles with the Lakers, Bryant's fans have remained devoted to the 6-foot-6 star.

"Kobe Bryant is one of the greatest players in the history of our game," NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. "Whether competing in the Finals or hoisting jump shots after midnight in an empty gym, Kobe has an unconditional love for the game."

Before Sunday's game, as Bryant warmed up, more people than usual took cellphone pictures of him. Then Bryant missed his first six shots in the game. Later, he made two important shots.

## At $25 Million, His Pay Tops NBA

Although the Lakers are already likely to miss the playoffs for the third straight season, Bryant intends to keep going.

"There's nothing I would love more than to be able to play this entire season, to go through all of these tough times, to be able to suit up and play on the road in these buildings for the last time," Bryant said.

Bryant earns $25 million and is the NBA's highest-paid player this season.

"Clearly, we're not playing at the kind of level that a player of Kobe's age and experience finds challenging," said Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak, who didn't learn of Bryant's decision until Sunday afternoon. "So I'm not surprised that he would make the announcement now. I think the game will be easier for him now. I think he'll be able to enjoy the rest of the season."

In his first public comments since his decision, Bryant spoke about the peace of mind created by his decision. He did not say much about plans for the future, but provided hints such as describing himself as "a storyteller" and talked about his conversations with the fashion designer Giorgio Armani.

None of Bryant's plans appear to involve basketball, although he said it would be "an honor" to play for his third Olympic gold medal next summer if he is picked for the U.S. team.

"I don't want to get too Zen-like," Bryant said. "But honestly, when I'm sitting in meditation, my mind starts drifting, and it always drifted toward basketball, always." Bryant added that he doesn't think about basketball all the time now, "and to me, that was really the first indicator that this game is not something I can obsess over for much longer."
