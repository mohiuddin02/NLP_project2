SAN JOSE, Calif. — Last year, a high school student received a text message from her parent at school. The parent wanted her to come home to talk about her grades. The girl was a star athlete and straight-A student. But, she had received a D in one class.

She walked out of class and collapsed.

The student at Los Altos High School in California was very depressed. She felt hopeless and like she was not good enough. She also was found to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. People with ADHD are overactive and have trouble paying attention. It took her parents six months to accept that she had a mental illness.

She is not alone.

## Schools Hiring Counselors

Educators are seeing more and more students who are depressed. Many feel anxious, or overly worried, and are scared of being social around other kids. Experts are seeing these mental illnesses in younger children.

The student said her parents raised her to make it seem like everything was perfect. She always did and said the right things. She hid her real feelings until one day "everything just shattered."

This anxiety does not only affect kids from rich and well-educated families. Schools are reporting it in all kids — poor as well as rich.

Overfelt High School in California is seeing a big rise in panic attacks. Panic attacks are intense fears of something bad happening. Nearby schools say there is a lot of anxiety, as well.

Judith Cameron is with the San Ramon Valley Unified School District. She said the students are coming to school with more emotional problems. And these are beginning at a younger age.

Not all schools have reported an increase in mental illness. But many school also do not watch out for it.

Yet that is changing. Schools are hiring counselors to help these kids. The San Mateo Union district has six classes to help kids deal with emotional and behavioral problems. They are all full.

## Some Causes Of Stress

What's causing the increase in mental illness is not clear. Some think it is caused by poverty or absent and busy parents. Technology and social media like Facebook may play a part. Intense pressure on kids to do well in school also seems to be a problem.

Students "are not expected to be great. They're expected to be" amazing, said Cristy Dawson. She is assistant principal at Los Altos High.

Sometimes, anxiety turns into fears. "Kids are so depressed or anxious, they're not getting out of bed," said Helen Hsu. She is with the city of Fremont's Youth and Family Services.

Some parents worry that mental illness is shameful. So they do not seek help for their children.

"I've had parents refuse to sign permission for counseling for one boy," Hsu said. They were afraid colleges would learn about the counseling. Then they might not accept him.

Studies show that one out of four teens have felt very anxious at some point. But these studies are old. Experts say the real number is probably higher.

## Students Pressuring Themselves

Students are under pressure to get into a good college.

"There's a constant feeling that you have to be the best," said Borna Barzan, 16. She is a junior at Los Altos High. Barzan runs a school club that helps kids understand mental illness.

Brenda Carrillo runs the student services program at Palo Alto Unified. She said that pressure to do well in school should not be blamed. Mental illness has many causes.

The Los Altos student feels much better now. Students face pressure from friends, she said. When they see on Facebook what college their friends got into they can get down. But students also put pressure on themselves, she said. They overload themselves with advanced classes and clubs. They think too much about future success.

She added, "But no one's looking at themselves and asking, 'Am I happy?'"
