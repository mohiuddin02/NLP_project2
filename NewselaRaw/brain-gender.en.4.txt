Scientists say there is no such thing as a male or female brain. Scientists say people have a little of both.

Scientists say that some parts of the brain are different. Parts that run how men and women feel and behave are different. Parts that run how they use words are also different. 

One thing is the same. Scientists say that men and women think the same way. They say that means brains are not male or female. They are both.

They found that out by reading more than 100 studies. A study is a close look at something. 

## Each Brain Is Different

Scientists wrote a report. They found that a man's brain is a little bigger than a woman's. 

Scientists wanted to find out what that meant. 

Daphna Joel is a scientist in Israel. Israel is a country in Asia. Joel and a team of scientists looked at many pictures of brains. 

Joel and her team wrote another report. In it they said that each brain has things that make it different. Some brains have more things that are male. Some brains have more things that are female. Some have both.

## Male Or Female? Most Are Both

The team wanted to learn more. They looked for more things in the brain that were only male or only female.  

Joel and her team asked people to join a test group. They were all between 18 and 79 years old. The scientists took pictures of their brains. They looked for areas in the brain that seemed most different between men and women.

Scientists made three groups of the brain pictures. There was a male group and a female group. Then there was one group that was both. The brains that were both had female things in some parts of the brain and male things in the other.

Very few people in the group scored as male or female. Most people scored as both.

The scientists then studied two big groups of American teens. They looked at their behavior. Very few of the teenagers scored as just male or just female. More than half scored as both. 

Finally, Joel and her team looked at college students. They asked them about what they liked. They asked what TV shows they watch and if they played video games. The results were like before. Very few of the students scored as male or female. More than half scored as both.
