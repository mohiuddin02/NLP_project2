Shopping in an expensive store usually involves suspicious glances or rude service. It doesn't usually involve handcuffs and police officers.

Yet when a black teenager said he was wrongly jailed after buying a $350 belt at a luxury shop in Manhattan, it struck a nerve with African-Americans. Many are used to finding that their money is not necessarily as good as everyone else's. Shopping while black, they say, can be an upsetting experience.

Much attention has been paid to this issue over the years. Oprah Winfrey once complained that a clerk did not think she could afford a $38,000 handbag. Even President Barack Obama has said he was once followed in stores.

But shoppers interviewed on Monday said many people don't recognize how common this unfair treatment is. People also don't realize how the constant small insults can add up to a large problem.

## Black Customers Profiled, And Accused

Natasha Eubanks said that it's one thing if people don't understand the issue. But she added: "Don't ever tell me it doesn't happen to me." Eubanks runs a gossip website and often shops at high-end stores in New York City. "You can't assume it doesn't happen just because it doesn't happen to you," she said.

Sometimes, it takes clerks more than five minutes to simply acknowledge her, she said. At other times, the store assistants ask her question after question. Eubanks explained that if you're a black girl looking at expensive goods, the clerks want to know what you're doing in the store and what you do for a living. Eubanks said she has dealt with this at least 20 times in New York.

Trayon Christian's problem was not how he was treated when he went into Barneys New York. Barneys is a store that sells expensive clothes. It was what happened afterwards. In a lawsuit filed last week, the 19-year-old said that he bought a Ferragamo belt at the store, but when he left he was stopped by undercover city police officers.

According to the lawsuit, police said Christian "could not afford to make such an expensive purchase." He says he was arrested, even though he showed police the receipt, the bank card he used and ID.

Days later another black Barneys shopper said she was accused of fraud after buying a $2,500 handbag. Then black actor Robert Brown told how he was paraded through Macy's in handcuffs and detained for an hour. He was also accused of credit card fraud.

## The Other Side Of The Counter

For Yvonne Chan, the reports were a painful reminder of when she worked in a store in a mostly white Massachusetts town. Every few months someone would be caught stealing. About half the time it was a black person.

Chan said she always tried not to judge people on the color of their skin. But the graduate student admitted that she found herself watching black people more carefully.

Chan added that she wanted to consider everybody equally, but did end up thinking of groups of people differently due to her experiences. Chan said that this changed her view of people as individuals.

Views based on race can affect who gets arrested for theft, said Jerome Williams. He is a business professor at Rutgers University.

Many people say treating black shoppers differently is OK because black customers are more likely to steal. But one study showed that white women in their 40s did more shoplifting than other groups.

Williams explained that these white women don't show up in crime figures because they are not always caught. Clerks don't watch white women as closely as they watch black customers.

The figures that show that black customers steal more "are not really an indication of who's shoplifting," Williams said.

## Discrimination Comes In All Colors

New York City college student Dido Kanyandekwe knows he is being watched. But the 18-year-old said that when he sees staff looking at him he jokes with them. Kanyandekwe says "Hello, I see you" to store guards or waves at them. The student was in Barneys on Monday buying a $600 pair of Italian designer sneakers.

"Most black people don't have the money to buy stuff at Barneys," said Kanyandekwe, the son of wealthy parents. "But that does not mean all black people are not able to buy these things,"

Black people are not the only ones who can face unequal treatment in stores. Hispanic shoppers have made the same complaints. And Sher Graham, a white woman who lives in Alabama, says black servers in the fast-food restaurants often wait on black customers first. But the experience is most common for African-Americans.

Candace Witherspoon is a stylist in Los Angeles. She went to a store in Century City last April. She wanted to buy a purse. Witherspoon said the sales assistant barely greeted her, then ignored her. Witherspoon saw that white customers in the store were treated very differently.

Witherspoon said that as the other customers left, the assistant said 'Thanks ladies for shopping. Have a good day.' But Witherspoon said that when she left, the same staff member gave her a nasty look and didn't say anything.

Toni Duclottni, who runs a fashion web site in Los Angeles, recently went to a department store intending to spend about $4,000 on shoes. But she spent the money in another store when she was ignored.

Duclottni said that the solution to this discrimination problem is simple. "They rush to judgment, they jump into it assuming something without speaking to a person," she said. "They'd be surprised if they just walked up and said, "Hello, can I help you find something?'"
