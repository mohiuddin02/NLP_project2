LOS ANGELES â€” It's something you might have wondered when asked for money by a homeless person: Will the change in my pocket prevent hunger or support an addiction?

Pasadena is now testing an alternative to giving money to panhandlers.

Fourteen repurposed parking meters across the city will collect change for nonprofits that help the homeless. The meters are painted bright orange and decorated with smiley faces and inspirational sayings. They are supposed to raise awareness for the city's homeless programs.

Pasadena is the first city in Los Angeles County to try the donation meters, though Los Angeles has been talking about trying them out in downtown. Officials do not expect to raise huge sums of money. The two meters currently in place raised just $270 over three weeks. "This is a clear alternative," said Bill Huang, who works with the city. He says people will now know where their money is going.

## Meters Get Mixed Reviews

But the meters have sparked debate. Some people say the donation meters would suck up all the money that could go to genuinely needy people. Paul Boden is the director of a homelessness advocacy group. He says the meters would not be needed if we addressed the economic and social issues that contribute to homelessness.

He thinks the meter programs are useless and says they are designed to help cities push out the homeless. In San Diego and Denver, for example, the donation meters were used as panhandling deterrents, installed in areas where people gathered to ask for money. Pasadena officials said their main goal is to raise awareness. They also admit the meters could reduce panhandling too.

The view on the streets of Pasadena is mixed.

Dorothy Edwards, 56, used to panhandle, or ask for money, by the Target in eastern Pasadena. She would use the money to buy food for her dog, rain gear and tents. Buying her own supplies helped her feel independent, but the money also made it easier for her to stay homeless, she said.

"Homeless people wouldn't be out there doing that if they didn't really need it," said Edwards, who found permanent housing in 2011 after a city worker approached her. "But when you look at the big picture, the meters are going to be a long-term solution."

## Where The Money Is Really Needed

But other homeless people are uneasy about the idea. Holly Johnson, a woman panhandling on Lake Avenue, said that nonprofits don't always spend money on what homeless people need. Granola bars are pointless for people without healthy teeth and canned food is no good without a can opener.

She needs money for her own reasons like her health and safety. Underneath an eye patch her eye is red and swollen from infection. She also said the outdoors are especially dangerous for women. Panhandling money could pay for a hotel room where she could sleep without fear of sexual assault. "It's a nice idea," Johnson said. "But we won't get that money."

Pasadena leaders argue the meters could encourage the public to give more. They say people might feel better knowing that their money will not be used for drugs or alcohol. That would attract people who would not otherwise give.

Huang cited a recent survey by a neighborhood in San Francisco. It found 44 percent of panhandlers surveyed admitted to purchasing drugs and alcohol with handouts, in addition to food. About 31 percent of visitors to San Francisco's Union Square said they would prefer to donate to services supporting the homeless. They would rather do that than give money directly to the panhandlers.

## Some Cities Have Better Luck

Since 2007, Denver, Colorado, has installed 55 refurbished parking meters to collect donations. Officials claim the meters have cut down on panhandling while raising more than $30,000 annually for food, housing and therapy for the homeless. In other cities the results have been more modest. In Orlando, Florida, 15 parking meters raised $2,027 in three years. That's just $27 more than what the city spent to install them. In downtown San Diego, California, about 20 meters generate about $3,600 a year in change.

The Pasadena meter campaign was designed by a class of students at the Art Center College of Design and cost about $350,000. It was paid for by money from companies. The meters were also donated and most of the cash was spent on the design of the meters, Huang said. No city funds were used.

Two local organizations will collect the money from the meter, and groups helping the homeless can apply for the cash. Businesses can also sponsor meters for a $1,500 annual donation, which will pay for the future upkeep of the meters.

Huang says the money could help low-wage workers pay their back rent to avoid being kicked out of their homes. He also says it could build housing for the homeless and help pay for cheaper housing. Programs like these have helped cut Pasadena's homeless population in half over the last three years, down from 1,300 in 2011 to about 650, officials said.
