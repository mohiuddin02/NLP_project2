DALLAS — When a Dallas, Texas, man was bitten by an African bush viper, the Dallas Zoo came to the rescue.

Along with one of the country's most impressive collections of venomous snakes, the zoo also has one of the largest supplies of antivenom.

Most snakebites involve native species and people's bad judgment, commented Bradley Lawrence, the zoo's reptile and amphibian supervisor.

"Most of the time it's native venomous snakes that somebody has decided to mess around with, late at night," he said. "Like, 'Oh, look, there's a snake. Let's pick it up!'"

## Refrigerator Stocked With Antivenom

Most native snakes' antivenom is stocked in hospitals. However, when someone in the Southwest, from Louisiana to California, needs an antidote for an exotic snakebite, the zoo is often asked to send its own antivenom.

The zoo will deliver at least half of its supply of the antivenom by using the police or a special service that flies it by helicopter or plane.

The zoo keeps thousands of vials — about $200,000 worth — in a small refrigerator.

The most recent call for help came in January, when a man in the Dallas-Fort Worth area was bitten by his African bush viper, an exotic species with no antivenom. In cases like that, the zoo sends antivenom from another type of snake that research has shown could work, Lawrence said.

## It's Just A Copperhead Bite

Typically anyone bitten by such a snake in the Dallas area is treated at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Toxicologist expert Dr. Nancy Onisko, who treats poison cases, calls the hospital "the Snakebite Center of Excellence."

In 2014, Parkland treated one or two snakebites from exotic species, compared with about 50 bites involving native species like copperheads and rattlesnakes.

Copperhead bites are the most common, and they generally involve only pain and swelling.

The hospital occasionally treats rattlesnake bites. They can cause tissue death, and other symptoms such as a rapid heartbeat and problems with blood clotting.

When treating a bite, doctors determine the kind of snake involved and learn about the venom's effects, the best antivenom to use and the risks.

Basic prices for antivenom range from $200 a vial for Asian snakes to $2,500 a vial for Australian species.

Therapy usually begins with four to six vials, but up to 30 vials may be needed in extreme cases.

"I can't imagine the hospital bill on a snakebite," Lawrence said.

## Fascination With Snakes

At the Dallas Zoo's reptile house, each cage is labeled with information about the snake and the appropriate antivenom. On the walls where the snake keepers work are several red buttons labeled "snakebite alarm." About 65 of the building's 90 species of snakes are venomous, said Ruston Hartdegen, the zoo's curator of herpetology, the study of amphibians and reptiles.

All staff members learn how to work with the venomous snakes, but to work with cobras and other especially dangerous snakes they must go through special training, Hartdegen said.

In the zoo's 127-year history, handlers have been bitten only three times, but none of them involved venom.

The zookeepers are as fascinated with snakes as the zoo's visitors. Lawrence is a fan of the cobras and mambas, but assistant supervisor Matt Vaughan is a pit viper guy, which he described as "the Ferraris of the predators." They get their name from the two heat-sensing pits between their nostrils and eyes.

Vaughan grew up near a lake teeming with reptiles and amphibians. For a kid who was fascinated with dinosaurs, "I was in heaven," he said.

Lawrence has a green mamba snake tattoo swirling up his arm. He got his first snake — a green snake — from his father, who was a science teacher, when he was 10.

## Exotic, Venomous Pets Are Frowned Upon

If someone is bitten by a death adder, the zoo provides all six of its vials of antivenom for treatment. That means zookeepers can't handle their own death adders, because there would be no way to treat anyone who was bitten until the zoo gets a new supply of antivenom.

"That's the part that's irresponsible, keeping venomous snakes when you know you don't have the antivenom," Lawrence said. "We'd prefer if people did not keep exotic venomous things at home."

## Snakebite Rules

With warmer weather, more snakes are coming out of brumation, similar to hibernation. If you come across one, leave it alone. But if you are bitten, here's what to do — and not to do:

## DO:

—Go to the emergency room.

—If you cannot get to an emergency facility, or if you are extremely dizzy or have trouble breathing, call 911.

—If bitten on an arm or leg, keep it still so the circulation of the venom might be slowed.

—Take a picture of the snake that bit you or try to remember its markings.

## DON'T:

—Don't try to suck the venom out like they do in movies. It doesn't work.

—Never make a cut where the snakebite is and try to draw the venom out.

## The Antivenom Process

Healthy snakes are typically milked about every two weeks to collect the venom.

Snakes are held between the index finger and thumb. Gentle pressure is applied so fangs are exposed and the snake bites onto a glass funnel. The venom runs down the funnel into a vial.

The venom is injected into a host animal — either a horse or a sheep — which will produce the antibodies.

After several months, blood is extracted from the animal and purified to become antivenom.
