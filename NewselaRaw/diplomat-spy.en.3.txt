ST. LOUIS - The roommates at Colgate University would talk about what they hoped to do after college. They were just freshmen, but they had some ideas. One wanted to be a lawyer. Another, a music producer. And then there was Ryan C. Fogle from Missouri. He wanted to join the FBI or CIA.

"Those were his goals in life," Ben Flicker, one of those roommates who is now an attorney in Denver, said Wednesday.

"He had this sense of service, of duty. And if he reached the FBI or CIA, that was the highest level of duty he could imagine giving to his country."

Fogle, 29, seems to have achieved his dream. And the whole world now seems to know about it.

Fogle is accused by Russia of spying for the CIA while posing as a low-level U.S. diplomat in Moscow. His arrest by Russian security services was in all the newspapers and news networks on Tuesday. It appeared to be designed to embarrass the United States and its spy agency.

## A Knife, A Compass And Pepper Spray

Russian television showed Fogle, wearing a blond wig under a baseball cap, and what were reportedly spy tools. These included wads of cash, several pairs of dark sunglasses, a compass and Moscow map, a knife, more wigs, and pepper spray. He also had a letter on him describing his plans.

Then Fogle was kicked out of the country.

But the details of Fogle's arrest have raised suspicions. Some think he was used - even framed - to make a point in the political struggle between the United States and Russia.

Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, said initial stories of Fogle's arrest only made her "curiouser and curiouser."

"If the allegations Russia is making are true, it appears that our effort at gaining intelligence is rather lame. It reads like something you would see in a movie. I know our intelligence community is very sophisticated, so that's why it doesn't compute," she told reporters.

As a diplomat, Fogle was an employee of the U.S. State Department, which represents the United States in other countries. The State Department said little about the incident. A spokesman said it did not even come up during a meeting Wednesday between John Kerry, who heads the State Department, and a top Russian official.

"I wouldn't read too much into one incident one way or another," spokesman Patrick Ventrell said.

The FSB is like Russia's own version of the FBI. It claims Fogle was trying to get a Russian anti-terrorism officer to spy for the United States. The officer was an expert in the Caucasus region. That is where the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects had roots.

## Not Genuine Tools

Eric O'Neill, a former FBI officer, said he believes Fogle really works for the CIA. And he probably was trying to recruit double agents. That seems believable. But the items that Fogle carried with him did not appear to be genuine tools of a CIA spy.

"I doubt he had this kit on him," he said. "It was planted on him for political theater."

O'Neill helped capture former FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who spied for the Russians for more than two decades. He thought the pepper spray and knife were not believable. The compass is unnecessary in an era of GPS. "I doubt he was really running around with a wig," he said.

The wording of the letter intended to recruit the Russian official sounded fake to O'Neill. The letter, written in Russian, offered $100,000 plus $1 million a year. "That's a pretty big budget," he said.

He also noticed the letter opens with "Dear friend" and closes with "Your friends." Those phrases are similar to ones that Russians sent to Hanssen, O'Neill said. That is how Russian handlers wrote to Hanssen. It is not how Americans talk to Russians.

"That doesn't ring true to me," he said.

## "'70s Tradecraft"

Peter Earnest worked for the CIA for 36 years. He said it was possible a CIA agent would use a compass and wigs.

"I am not thrown off by what looks like '70s tradecraft," said Earnest, now executive director of the International Spy Museum in Washington. "We used very traditional means to run spies."

Earnest thought Fogle was likely caught by "a dangle operation," where Russian agents created an opportunity that he could not resist. The Russians might have wanted to publicly embarrass the CIA after 10 Russian spies had their cover blown in 2010 in the United States.

Fogle is described as very smart, which make his supposed missteps hard to understand. He graduated from Colgate in Hamilton, New York, in 2006.

At Colgate, he had a double major of political science and international relations. He was an honor student and was recalled as politically conservative. He was focused on his goal.

Flicker, his former roommate, said Fogle did not want to be near students who were doing drugs, fearful that it might affect his application to the FBI or CIA.

Fogle joined the U.S. foreign service in 2011, according to public records. He was reportedly working as a third secretary in the political division of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The title is a very low position in the U.S. diplomatic corps.
