RIO DE JANEIRO — The 2016 Summer Olympics will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. On a recent visit to the future site of Olympic Park, Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff promised that the games would be "the Olympics of all Olympics."

The president said the Olympics would benefit from Brazil's experience organizing last summer's World Cup soccer tournament. Brazil's handling of the Cup drew praise from hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists.

However, memories of what happened in Rio during the buildup to the Cup terrify some Brazilians. The most anxious are those who live in Rio's favelas — the culturally rich but materially poor communities that climb the city's hillsides.

## Forced Evictions

After a last-minute scramble to organize the World Cup, the event went more smoothly than anticipated — but not for favela residents.

For those who live in the path of planned building projects, so far the consequence of the mega-sporting events has been forced evictions.

Favela do Metro, just 300 yards from the Maracana soccer stadium, is a symbol of what is happening throughout the city. It reflects the sometimes overlooked human cost of playing host to huge sporting events.

In Favela do Metro, rats roam freely, as mounds of garbage and old furniture pile up, bearing bed frames and spoiled food. Debris from walls and floors violently ripped out of homes remain.

Brazilian officials started evicting residents by force and simultaneously demolishing this decades-old favela prior to the World Cup. This was supposedly done as part of the massive upgrade required by the global soccer tournament and the 2016 Olympics.

## "We Are Not Animals"

Then midway through the process, the tearing down of houses stopped and the community was left to decay on its own.

Rusty, metal wires now stick out of 6-foot-high piles of rubble. Sofa cushions, tires and old clothes litter a neighborhood that looks like it has been bombed.

Adjacent homes are in varying states of disrepair. Laundry hangs outside one, while one next to it has a shattered top floor but people still living on the lower level and a third has been demolished. The destroyed and semi-demolished homes are symbolic of the haphazard way city officials have treated this community.

A desperate cry for help is scrawled on a wall: "We are not animals to be discarded in this way."

In striking contrast to the lush, manicured field at Maracana, Favela do Metro lacks running water.

Favela do Metro isn't the only community feeling the negative impact of hosting major sporting events.

## Drug Traffickers Move In

Recently, residents of Vila Uniao protested their homes being cleared to build the BRT-TransOlimpico rapid bus system.

The community of Vila Autodromo, which lies within the planned Olympic Park, has also protested over forced evictions.

What happened in Favela do Metro, though, stands out for its harshness.

One consequence of how Favela do Metro has been neglected is that many newcomers have moved in, despite the terrible conditions. Some are drug traffickers.

Others are genuinely seeking a better life. Some criticize them as squatters, but for Bianca da Silva, 32, and her husband, Joao Alves de Souza, 27, this is better than living on the streets, as they did before.

The way in which Favela do Metro has been abandoned has also fueled suspicions. Some believe it is part of a larger Brazil government plan to clear out the poor before real estate developers move in.

"The city takes any chance there is to remove people," said Theresa Williamson, founder of an organization that assists Rio's favela communities, in order to "create opportunities for real estate construction."

## Officials Hail "Resettlements"

Rio de Janeiro city officials offer a more upbeat picture of events in Favela do Metro.

A city press official called what has happened there "resettlements," adding that residents consented and had plenty of notice. Many were moved to public housing, while others who gave up their homes received money from the city, she said.

However, both residents here and other witnesses deny those claims.

The evictions, which started in 2010, and continued through this year, were violent and involved police, they say. "Most families did not know until the day, and were forced onto a bus," said Williamson, who has been following the process.

The initial reason given for the evictions was that a parking lot needed to be built near Maracana before the World Cup — but that didn't happen.

## "Prisoners Inside Our Own City"

Families were initially sent across town, at least two hours away by bus. Those who resisted eviction were moved to nearby public housing.

Some do prefer their new homes.

"There is no comparison to where I am now," said Francisco Lima Santos, 42. He lived in Favela do Metro until 2012, when he was moved to nearby public housing.

Meanwhile, conditions are growing even worse in Favela do Metro. Barbara Cabral Souza, 38, says that city officials have yet to offer her a way out.

The shops and jobs that were once here are gone. There is no security presence and drug dealers have become her neighbors.

"We are prisoners inside our own city," she said.
