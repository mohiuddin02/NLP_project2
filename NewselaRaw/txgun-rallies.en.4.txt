FORT WORTH, Texas â€” Texans love guns. But the nation's largest gun-rights group is angry with some Texans. Its argument is about demonstrations in favor of carrying weapons openly. The group says the protests look bad.

Some pro-gun Texans recently have held rallies. They have taken place at fast-food restaurants and home-improvement stores. But officials with the National Rifle Association say the protests are "downright weird."

The group praises Texas for a strong "gun culture." But they scolded a small number of people. They said those people "crossed the line from enthusiasm to downright foolishness."

Many Republicans are going to their Texas state convention. It is being held in Fort Worth later this week. Some plan to carry long guns outside the Fort Worth Convention Center.

Whether guns can be carried into the center has been a concern.

## Some Guns Must Stay Outside

The head of the Republican Party of Texas put out a statement. He said that "anyone carrying an openly exposed weapon will be asked to do so outside of the building."

Some people have a license to carry concealed handguns. That means the guns are not out in the open. These people will be fine. They may carry their concealed handguns inside.

Gun supporters are telling other people to do it too. They want them to carry black powder guns inside. These guns will be out in the open.

There have been  several local gun demonstrations. The most recent took place at a Home Depot parking lot.

Organizers have said around 150 people showed up. They supported openly carrying handguns. Money was accepted. The group gave out black powder revolvers and bullets as prizes.

Police say they are now investigating the event. State gambling laws might have been broken.

## Responsibility Is Important For Safety

Another pro-gun group also made national headlines. Someone called 911 when the group went to a Jack in the Box. The caller was worried about a group of men that was walking around with long-barreled guns.

Another demonstration took place in Dallas. It was at a Chipotle Mexican Grill. The demonstration gained attention when Chipotle workers asked customers not to bring guns into their restaurants. That is, "unless they are authorized law enforcement."

Long guns aren't allowed in places that sell alcohol. The business could lose its permit to sell drinks.

Carrying guns openly has become a hot political issue. Candidates for Texas governor have said that a change in the law will be debated soon.

Some leaders in the open-carry movement recently sent out a letter. It called on supporters to stop trying to carry long guns into Texas businesses.

"We ask that members take a step back," the letter said. "Help us get open carry passed for everyone." It was signed by four different groups.

NRA officials said they weren't against guns. They "love AR-15s and AKs as much as anybody." They "know that these sorts of (guns) are among the most popular, fastest- selling firearms in America today."

## Making The Wrong Impression

But they said that some people aren't familiar with the guns. For them seeing these protests "can be downright scary. It makes folks who might normally be perfectly open-minded about firearms feel uncomfortable."

Several fast-food companies have asked people to stop bringing long guns.

NRA officials say these protests are "just not neighborly" and are "out of character for the big-hearted residents of Texas. Using guns merely to draw attention to yourself in public defies common sense."

Also, "it shows a lack of manners. That's not the Texas way. And that's certainly not the NRA way," the officials said.
