TOPEKA, Kan. â€” Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed a bill into law Thursday that will establish stricter rules for receiving the government money that is provided to poor people. The law shortens the time a person can receive the money, known as welfare. It also places new restrictions on where welfare money can be spent.

Brownback hailed the law as a way to promote self-reliance. He said it will lift people out of poverty by pushing them back into the workforce.

The Republican governor pushed back against national criticism that has been directed against the bill in recent weeks. So, too, did Phyllis Gilmore, head of Kansas' Department for Children and Families. She called the bill the most far-reaching welfare reform passed by any state in the country.

For a bill to become a law, it must be approved by both houses of the Legislature; then the bill goes to the governor, who signs it into law.

"We encourage other states to look to Kansas on how to help end government dependency," Gilmore said. She said the policies are aimed at helping low-income people achieve self-sufficiency. When people remain dependent on government, she said, it is a "disservice to the individual, a disservice to our culture and certainly a disservice to the taxpayer."

## Work Yes, Tattoos No

The law requires that able-bodied adults work at least 20 hours a week or go through a job training program in order to qualify for welfare. It also puts many restrictions on where welfare money can be spent. For example, it cannot be used at movie theaters, tattoo parlors or swimming pools.

"The primary focus of the bill is to get people back to work," Brownback said. "The real benefit is getting people off public assistance."

## Law Hurts Families, Critics Say

Brownback said employment is one of the main factors in lifting a person out of poverty. He added that family structure was the most important factor.

However, some elements of the law have drawn criticism for being anti-family. If a person lies in order to receive benefits, both that person and other adults living in the same home would be banned for life from receiving welfare. Critics say this rule would punish people simply for being married if a husband or wife abuses the system without their partner's knowledge.

Another restriction in the law. has also been heavily criticized. It would deny people food assistance for the rest of their lives if they are convicted on drug-related charges two times.

Brownback said he is open to changing the law if practical problems arise.

"I'm open to revisiting all of it, if it's not working," he said.

Democrats have been critical of the legislation, which they say is mean-spirited.

"Child poverty and homelessness in Kansas are at record levels," Senator Anthony Hensley said.

The law will "make it harder for Kansans in need to break the cycle and climb out of poverty," Hensley said. "This is just one more example of how Sam Brownback is out of touch with the real world and has our state on the wrong path."

Representative Tom Burroughs said the law "does nothing to address the root causes of poverty in our state."

Kansas should not be passing "mean-spirited bills that demean the poor in their time of greatest need," Burroughs said. "We should focus on providing quality education and creating economic opportunity to ensure that all Kansans have a fair chance to succeed."

Gilmore did not say what would happen if people tried to spend welfare money at a restricted business, such as a tattoo parlor. She said such spending would be a policy violation but not a crime.

## ATM Cash Strictly Limited

Another provision in the law limits the amount of welfare money a person can withdraw from a cash machine to $25 a day. Republican state Representative Travis Couture-Lovelady said this rule is meant to ensure that the money is spent on necessities.

When asked whether he thought poor people could not be trusted to spend their welfare money responsibly, Couture-Lovelady responded, "Most can. Absolutely most can."

"Just because most people don't commit murder doesn't mean we shouldn't keep it illegal," he said. "The key point is that it hurts the folks who are using the program in the correct manner when the money is spent in these incorrect manners."

## Harsh Law For Working Moms, Activist Says

Shannon Cotsoradis, president of the group Kansas Action for Children, said that the law does more than just limit where people can spend their welfare money. She said the law would require a woman to return to work shortly after having a baby in order to keep receiving money. At the same time, she said, the law makes it more difficult to qualify for childcare assistance through welfare.

"By signing this bill into law, Governor Brownback has added to the burden that the poorest Kansans already carry," Cotsoradis said. "It's always been hard to be poor in Kansas. Now, it's going to be a lot harder."
