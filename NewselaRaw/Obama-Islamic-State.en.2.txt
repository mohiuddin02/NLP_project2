WASHINGTON â€” Opening a new battle zone in the Middle East, President Barack Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time Wednesday night. Airstrikes in Iraq will be expanded, he announced. Obama called it part of "a steady, relentless effort" to root out Islamic State (ISIL) extremists.

ISIL was once part of the al-Qaida terrorist group, blamed for the 9/11 attacks in the U.S. Later ISIL broke off. It has now seized large parts of northern and western Iraq. It is trying to set up its own country in Iraq and Syria. The country would be governed by its own strict version of Islamic law.

In recent weeks, the group released videos showing the grisly murder of two American journalists in Syria.

"We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are," Obama declared in a prime-time address to the nation from the White House. "This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven."

The extremist group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

## From Anti-War To Airstrikes

Obama announced that he was sending nearly 500 more U.S. troops to Iraq to assist the Iraqi military. The additional troops brings the total number of American forces sent there this summer to more than 1,500. He also pushed for money to train and arm Syrian rebels. The rebels are fighting both ISIL militants and Syria's government.

Obama's announcement is a striking shift for the president. He first rose to political popularity partly because he opposed the U.S. war in Iraq. While in office, he has sought to end American wars in the Middle East and avoid new ones. He's particularly avoided involvement in Syria. The country has been gripped in an continuing civil war. Its chaos has given ISIL the space to thrive and move across the border with Iraq.

Speaking on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Obama's plans also showed that years of American-led war in the Middle East have not silenced the terror threats in the region.

Obama declared his intention to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the ISIL fighters, but said he would not send U.S. troops to fight on the  ground in the Middle East. Even so, he acknowledged that there could be risks involved to the servicemen and women who will carry out the airstrike missions.

"But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil," he added.

## A Long And Difficult Decision

The White House had spent months debating how to respond to the violent ISIL. Administration officials have said they are not aware of a true threat of a potential attack by the group in the U.S. All the same, they say it poses risks to Americans and interests across the Middle East. Officials are also concerned that Westerners, including Americans, who have joined ISIL could launch attacks in their home countries.

The brutal killing of the journalists appear to have had an effect on the American public. Multiple polls now show that the majority of Americans support airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.

The U.S. began launching limited airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq earlier this summer. But Obama vowed that he would not immediately commit the U.S. to a deeper military campaign. He first wanted Iraq to form a government allowing more involvement from all religious groups. Iraqi leaders took that step Tuesday.

Obama plans to proceed with the airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. He'll do so without seeking new authorization from Congress. Instead, he will act under authorization Congress passed after 9/11 to give President George W. Bush the ability to go after those responsible for the terror attacks.

"This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground," he said.

House Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, praised Obama for speaking about the "grave and growing threat" that Islamic extremists pose. However, he said Obama was coming to that conclusion far too late.

"He has finally begun to make the case the nation has needed him to make for quite some time: that destroying this terrorist threat requires decisive action and must be the highest priority for the United States and other nations of the free world," Boehner said.

## Europe Joining Fight If Needed

As if to answer the criticism that he has been too cautious, Obama declared of his plan: "This is American leadership at its best."

Obama is pushing for money to train and arm more members of the Syrian opposition. Some of Obama's own advisers pressed him to arm the rebels early in their fight against Assad. But Obama resisted. He had argued that there was too much uncertainty about the rebel forces and how extreme they were. He also expressed concern about adding more firepower to an already bloody civil war.

The White House announced Wednesday that it was also providing $25 million in military assistance to the Iraqi government to combat ISIL.

The Treasury Department will also step up efforts to cut off the supply of money to the extremist group.

The U.S. has been pressing allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere to help with efforts to weaken ISIL. France said Wednesday that it would take part in airstrikes against extremist fighters in Iraq if needed. Germany has said it will send weapons to fighters battling ISIL.
