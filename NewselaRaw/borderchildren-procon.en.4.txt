### PRO: Fixing a problem

INDIANAPOLIS — Most immigrants who cross into the U.S. without permission come through the border of Mexico. Now, more and more of them are children. Violence in Central America is growing worse. Children are gathering along the border to get away.

Indiana is a long way from the Mexican border. Many children from Central America caught at the border were sent to Indiana by the government. They ended up in immigration holding centers and were treated badly.

From 2004 to 2010, the federal government hired a youth jail center in Vincennes, Indiana, called the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village to hold immigrant children. It was supposed to house the most dangerous children.

These children arrived at the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village. Police at the border had spotted tattoos on some of them that made them seem like gang members. Others were stopped because of crimes in their home countries. Some had caused trouble or run away from other housing centers in the United States. A few had U.S. police records.

## Their Legal Rights

I run the Immigration Clinic of Indiana University's law school. I traveled to Vincennes with volunteer law school students. We went to help these kids.

The U.S. government helped pay for my law students and me to meet with the children. We explained their legal rights to them. We let them know what they could expect in immigration court. We found lawyers willing to work for free for some of them.

The children told us stories of fleeing abuse at home, gangs and drugs. Some were mistreated in other U.S. immigrant centers.

Many were reunited with family in the United States. Others decided to go home. Some were sent home.

At one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes peacefully protested against their conditions. The response was harsh. Police arrived with billy clubs and a police dog. Children were not allowed out of their rooms. Some were put in rooms by themselves and allowed no human contact.

When they told my law school students of their bad treatment, we reported it. The U.S. government stopped the Vincennes center from holding immigrant children.

## Asking For Protection Here

The U.S. is handling the situation with immigrant children today just like it did for the kids at Vincennes. It's just happening in a much larger way.

U.S. law protects people who have been mistreated, but it is not perfect. President Obama is trying to protect these children as best he can.

People afraid of being hurt can ask for protection in the U.S. It doesn't matter what country they come from. Our laws allow them the right to ask to stay here. They are given rights as refugees.

Not every child should be allowed to stay. But just turning children away goes against our laws and our history. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their rights protected. They should be allowed to stay when they deserve to, and sent back home safely when necessary.

### CON: Ending a disaster

WASHINGTON — There's a disaster happening at the U.S.-Mexico border. President Obama is partly to blame. He has handled the situation badly. His actions even encourage people to make the dangerous and illegal crossing into the U.S.

Obama must secure the border and stop illegal crossings.

The president is trying to do too much. He wants to keep Latino leaders happy because he needs their support. At the same time, he wants to convince Central Americans not to start the dangerous trip north.

Obama made things worse with his actions. He made people think immigrants here illegally might be allowed to stay here. In 2012, Obama decided to stop sending children back to their home countries if they had already spent years in the U.S.  Then news spread that young children arriving at the border were being released until their court hearings. It started rumors that the U.S. was allowing people to stay.

## Weakly Guarded Border?

Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez blames the problem on confusion about U.S. border rules. The Central American leader said this confusion "pulls" people to cross the U.S. border.

Hernandez also said drug violence and gangs "push" people to leave their countries. El Salvador and Guatemala face the same problems. Unfortunately, these are poor nations. Their governments cannot handle these challenges.

Supporters of refugees say that most people crossing the border have good reasons.

A survey in May by the Border Patrol found something different. Nearly all of the immigrants they interviewed made the trip because they heard the border was weakly guarded.  So-called "coyotes" make money sneaking people into the U.S. The coyotes promise people that it will be easy to get across the U.S. border.

## Stop Illegal Crossings

People fleeing war or natural disasters in their home country are refugees. The U.S. must protect them. However, the United Nations should help refugees in their own countries. It shouldn't wait for them to run all the way to the U.S. border.

No one should risk the trip through Mexico. Many migrants are abused, robbed or killed along the journey.

A weak border makes it too easy for people to risk their lives. We must change that now.

Securing the border is Obama's job. It seems like he wants Congress to deal with it. But it's not the job of Congress. He must stop illegal crossings and send most border crossers back home. He must also put an end to rumors that people who entered illegally will be allowed to stay.
