As the smell of barbecuing fills the air and hip-hop thumps from a speaker, two inner-city teens are playing hard. The boys are leading their teams in a friendly, but spirited game of pickup football.

Alex, 18 and wiry, weaves across the field, making athletic catches and striding into the end zone — but it is 15-year-old Sammy who later returns a punt to win the game. As he sprints downfield, Sammy turns to the cheering sideline, his face breaking into a smile. The madness is miles away.

Alex and Sammy live in a place where porches get shot up and the menacing slide of a passing van's door can carry a deadly threat. Surviving demands rapid decisions, urgent sprints to safety or, as Sammy describes it, just dumb luck. Sammy counts three near-misses in his young life.

The teens are part of a new program called Urban Warriors, which was created by the YMCA of Metro Chicago. Running for 12 weeks at a time, the program pairs kids from one of Chicago's rougher neighborhoods with people who know all about surviving in dangerous places: military veterans who fought in the nation's two most recent wars.

## A Tough Way To Grow Up

The program's first group of teens, including Sammy and Alex, all live in a tough Chicago neighborhood known as Little Village.

In the first six months of this year, killings in Chicago held even at 171. However, the number of shooting victims was up 8 percent, with 1,103 people wounded. Though killings have dropped significantly from the early 1990s, when as many as 900 people a year were slain, Chicago still ranks tops among the nation's larger cities in shootings and murders. In neighborhoods such as Little Village, Englewood and Roseland, the threat seems as constant as ever.

That kind of violence takes a toll on young people, said Eddie Bocanegra, one of the new program's directors.

On a recent weekend, as more than 80 people were shot, 16 fatally, Chicago once again made national news for its violence. The youths in the program face that violence daily. Urban Warriors is one small effort to help them.

All of the teens in Urban Warriors are routinely exposed to violence, and many are involved with gangs.

## Violence And Near Misses

The vets and youths in the program have shared "war stories," of losing friends and witnessing violence. Each week, a kid seemed to arrive with a fresh battle story.

"I've seen people get shot," said Alex, whose mind flashes back to those events. "It does … mess my head up. But I am living it every day — so, like, I guess I put up with it."

Even at age 15, Sammy has not one, but three "war stories" to tell.

"We passed through 24th and Millard, and some dude on a bike came out and started shooting, saying, 'Where you from, where you from?' We turned real quick. We ran across real quick — I was like, 'Let's go, let's go!'"

Sammy said that was the first shooting he recalled — the next was at his high school.

"Right when I walked outside they shot someone at the corner. Then they started chasing me and shooting … I got away — again. That was my second time."

In the third shooting incident, Sammy, who is not in a gang, escaped a spray of gunfire on a porch where he was sitting. In his haste to get away, he fell down the porch stairs and landed in a good hiding place. "I got behind a tree luckily," he said, "and they didn't see me."

## The Vets Can Relate Their Experiences

Many of the vets had grown up in Little Village themselves. They talked of their own scrapes with trouble or of having family members involved in violence. One, Alberto Boleres — who in 2007 survived a roadside bomb near Tikrit, Iraq — had been shot in Chicago.

Organizers of Urban Warriors also saw a critical benefit to the veterans: It provides a sense of purpose, something many who leave the military struggle to find.

Weekly discussions center on such topics as loyalty, belonging and manhood. One special focus is on image and the pressure to maintain it.

"These kids are poor," Bocanegra said. They may not have money, he explained, but what they do have is reputation. They are "the gang leaders, the playboys of the neighborhood." Reputation "means a lot for these kids — and what that reputation means is, 'I have to maintain an image.' Because at the end of the day, it's about protecting yourself."

The vets said they could relate to the youths on some levels.

"They always said they had to be on point or aware or careful," said Richard Rivera, 30, who served in the Marines. "We told them we can relate a lot — except you guys are fighting for a street corner, and we are fighting for a country."

Researchers have been studying Urban Warriors to figure out how much it has been helping youths and the vets. One thing is already clear, though: A bond has been formed between the two groups.
