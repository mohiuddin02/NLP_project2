A total of 458 people were on board. At least 15 people were taken to safety during the rescue effort, including three pulled from the boat Tuesday. At least five people died in the accident, the Xinhua News Agency reported.

The boat was carrying mostly elderly tourists from Nanjing to the southwestern city of Chongqing.

Divers rescued a 65-year-old woman and, later, two men who had been trapped, Chinese television station CCTV reported. More people have been found alive and were being rescued.

CCTV video showed rescuers in orange life vests climbing on the ship's hull. One of them lay down on the boat. The rescuer tapped the boat with a hammer, listened and then gestured downward into the boat where he thought he heard sounds.

"We will do everything we can to rescue everyone trapped in there, no matter they're still alive or not," said Chen Shoumin. He is the military commander of Hubei province where the boat overturned.

The ship's captain and chief engineer both survived the accident. Police took them to be questioned.

## Ship Suddenly In Trouble From Storm

The captain and engineer said the boat tipped over quickly after being caught in a cyclone, which is like a hurricane. A Chinese newspaper said the ship overturned within two minutes in the river, which was 50 feet deep in that area.

Zhang Hui, a tour guide, survived the disaster. He said the ship tilted and he grabbed a life jacket. Bottles fell off shelves, and suddenly, the boat turned all the way over.

Zhang said he cannot swim. He drifted in the river all night and reached the shore just before dawn.

"The raindrops hitting my face felt like hailstones," Zhang said.

Some survivors swam ashore. Others were saved more than 12 hours after the accident.

Thirteen navy divers were helping with the rescue, and 170 more were joining them, Chen said. In total, more than 50 boats and 3,000 people helped with the search. Fast-moving water in the river made the rescue difficult.

A 65-year-old woman was saved by divers. They brought extra breathing equipment into the boat and taught her how to use it.

That woman "had a very strong will and learned very fast," Chen said.

The overturned ship drifted almost 2 miles before stopping close to shore.

## Upside-Down Boat Might Still Have Air To Breathe

This was a good sign for rescuers. It meant there was enough air inside for the boat to float. It also meant there might be air inside for survivors to breathe, said Park Chi-mo. He is a professor at South Korea's Ulsan University.

The boat had been carrying 411 passengers and a crew of 47. Most of the passengers were 50 to 80 years old.

In Shanghai, relatives of the passengers were angry. They demanded to know whether the captain did enough to make sure the passengers were safe. Huang Yan wept as she said she thought that her husband and his elderly father were on board. She said she couldn't be sure of that because she hadn't seen a passenger list yet.

"Why did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?" Huang shouted. "We want the government to release the name list to see who was on the boat."

The Eastern Star was 251 feet long and 36 feet wide.

The Yangtze is the world's third-longest river and sometimes floods during the summer rainy season.

CCTV reported that 6 inches of rain had fallen where the boat overturned in the past 24 hours. Winds in the area reached 80 miles an hour during the accident.
