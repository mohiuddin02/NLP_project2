LAKE VILLAGE, Ark. — From the edge of his rice fields in southeastern Arkansas, Joe Mencer can see a small Mississippi River port that loads up grain for a trip to New Orleans. From there, it would take a week for rice from Mencer's fields to reach the Cuban capital of Havana. It is less than 1,000 miles down the Mississippi and across the Gulf of Mexico. These days, however, Cuba's rice generally comes from Vietnam, some 11,000 miles and six weeks away.

"I'm 55 years old. This is my 34th rice crop," Mencer said, as he looked toward the Mississippi. "I keep hoping I'll be able to sell some of it to Cuba before I retire."

Right now, the chance of that happening is uncertain, despite the Obama administration's opening the United States to Cuba. Obama renewed diplomatic relations with the island nation just 90 miles from U.S. shores.

## Congress Must Lift Embargo

The United States broke off all relations with Cuba in the early 1960s, after Fidel Castro took power in 1959. Castro imposed a communist government that took over all private businesses. President John F. Kennedy ordered an embargo that banned all U.S. businesses from selling products in Cuba.

Eliminating the embargo on businesses requires approval by the U.S. Congress. Many lawmakers oppose lifting the embargo until the Cuban government improves human rights for its people.

The opening announced last December aims to undo a policy the White House says is out of date and not effective. For American farmers, it could mean a thriving market that has 11 million people but not the farms to feed them. Rice farmers in Arkansas would love to get more of their product on Cubans' plates; so would citrus growers in Florida, blueberry growers in Maine and wheat growers in Kansas.

"We're blessed in Arkansas — we grow about everything," said Republican Senator John Boozman. But the senator faces significant opposition to partially or completely lifting the embargo and other restrictions that have governed trade with Cuba for decades. Despite support from both Republicans and Democrats, the opposition to doing business with Cuba is strong and deep and getting any law through Congress this session will be difficult, according to experts on both sides.

## Exports Disappointing So Far

Beyond that, Cuba has not recently burned up the shipping lanes, despite the White House's opening. Exports from the United States to Cuba in the first seven months of 2015 have been less than in 2014. Exports this year are also far lower than in 2008, when a law first allowed U.S. farmers to sell some products in Cuba.

Frozen chicken is tops among the list of foods exported from the United States to Cuba. Soybeans, corn and processed products such as whiskeys and soups were listed as well, but rice was nowhere to be found.

Mencer, who farms about 1,700 acres of rice here in the southeastern corner of Arkansas, said it has not always been that way. He has traveled to Cuba and testified before a U.S. Senate committee on the issue. In 1951, Cuba was the destination for a significant share of U.S. rice exports, Mencer told senators. Sales were steady in the 1950s but dropped after the trade embargo took effect starting in 1960.

Even after the rules were relaxed in 2000, sales were not what U.S. growers hoped. After growing briefly in the mid-2000s, when the embargo rules were relaxed, U.S. rice sales in Cuba dropped to zero. This frustrates Mencer, who knows Cubans eat more rice than Americans and that they used to like the taste of U.S. rice.

## Cuba Might Buy More On Credit

Getting Cuba to buy more U.S. rice could require the government to allow sales on credit. U.S. farmers can sell to Cuba only in exchange for cash because of the embargo rules, but Cuba is a poor country. A group of members of Congress want to relax the rules against credit. The group includes some Republicans, who generally oppose the president's foreign policy.

Relaxing the rules does not mean sales will take off, said John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. He warned that Cuba is being oversold. Vietnam gives Cuba two or more years to pay for rice and even if Congress changes the rules, U.S. farmers will not want to sell on those terms, he said.

Getting anything through the U.S. Congress this year will be tough, anyway. The calendar is full with debates over the federal budget, relations with Iran and government funding for Planned Parenthood's birth control services. It will be difficult for Cuba measures to move this year, said Jason Poblete, a lawyer with Poblete Tamargo LLP of Washington who used to work as a congressional staffer.

## Lawmakers Debate Changes In Policy

At least three bills in the Senate have gotten a lot of attention. They will still need to get through heavy opposition from senators set against Obama's Cuba opening, such as Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator from Florida.

Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, supports all three bills. King knows the bills are against stiff odds this session, but he's hopeful for the long term. He said an opening of trade could help agriculture and other Maine industries, from potato and blueberry growers to boat builders.

"It's a policy that no longer makes any sense," said King. "At some point, even the Congress will wake up to that fact."
