Every year, millions of Muslims travel to both places. They come to visit mosques and sites that are important to the religion of Islam. The journey is known as the hajj. It has been happening for centuries.

This year, 2 million Muslims will arrive in Saudi Arabia. For them, the hajj experience will be safer and more comfortable than ever before. They have several big changes to thank for that.

For one thing, smartphones are now allowed at the holy places. They can be used in case of emergencies.

Phones are being used for social purposes too. Young pilgrims have taken to snapping photos of themselves. They are taking selfies with holy places in the background. Some shoot pictures of themselves kissing the Grand Mosque's black stone. Then, they post their pictures online.

Many Muslim scholars are not happy about the selfies.

## Taking Selfies Is "Showing Off"

Teacher Zahra Mohammad said taking selfies is wrong. Hajj, he said, is supposed to be free of "boasting or showing off."

Scholar Sheik Abdul Razzaq al-Badr agreed.

"It is as though the only purpose of this trip is to take pictures and not worship," he said.

Still, many appreciate other new changes. They have made things much safer, they say.

In the past, the hajj has seen serious problems. Deadly stampedes and heat stroke are just two of the things pilgrims faced.

## Many Changes Were Made To Help People

It can get very crowded during the hajj. Hundreds of thousands of people walk around inside the mosques at the same time.

Very hot weather is often a problem. Pilgrims pray outdoors in temperatures that can go above 120 degrees. In the past, there was nothing to protect them from the sun.

At Mecca's Grand Mosque, a courtyard has been changed. It should help with crowding. Now the mosque can handle 130,000 pilgrims an hour.

Improvements have also been made at the Masjid al-Nabawi mosque in Medina. Giant umbrellas have been placed over the courtyard. They shade pilgrims from the afternoon sun.

Sliding roofs have also been set up outside the mosque. They can be opened to provide protection from the sun.

## Some Phones Have Special Apps

Sixty thousand guards will protect this year's hajj.

Saudi doctors will keep a close watch at Jidda airport. They will check arriving African pilgrims for the Ebola virus. The goal is to prevent the disease's spread.

For the first time, 300 Indian pilgrims will be given free cellphones. The phones are loaded with a special new app. The app translates Arabic and gives directions. It will be offered to people in other countries next year.

People getting the new cellphones might want to avoid one thing, though. They probably should not use them to take selfies.
