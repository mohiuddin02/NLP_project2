PHILADELPHIA, Pa. — "Hope" was a scrawny German shepherd picked up as a stray this summer in York County, Pennsylvania. Her ribs stuck out, and her fur was patchy. She didn't look like much but she had spunk. Carol Skaziak believed she might make an ideal police dog.

Skaziak's hunch led to nine weeks of rehabilitation. Hopefully, it would also give the stray a future with purpose. 

Throw Away Dogs Project is a Huntingdon Valley, Pa. nonprofit. The group rescues shelter dogs and donates them to small agencies in need. It was co-founded by Skaziak and Jason Walters, a police officer and K-9 handler. They didn't know much about Hope, but they decided to give the energetic tail-wagger a second chance.

Skaziak renamed her Rousey. It is a reference to Ronda Rousey, the popular mixed martial arts fighter.

## Often, Police Cannot Afford A Dog

It feels great to save a dog's life, give them a job and help police, Skaziak said.

From local police to the U.S. Department of Defense, many different organizations use working dogs. Dogs also provide protection for corporations and individuals. 

The stakes are high for law enforcement agencies. A patrol dog who cannot perform in a violent situation is unacceptable.  

Law enforcement dogs often come from elite European breeders. They cost $6,000 to $30,000. Many police departments cannot afford them.

Throw Away Dogs intends to fill that need, one dog at a time.

After meeting Hope at the rescue, Skaziak returned with Walters. Inside a huge training building, skinny Hope displayed her strong hunt drive. She fetched balls and sniffed out hidden objects. She even walked by a large cage with menacing barking dogs without flinching. 

"I don't think she has any fears," Walters said.

## Everyone Wonders: Will She Bite?

Skaziak took Hope home. 

The newly renamed Rousey trained for weeks with a foster family. Then came an important test.

Trainer Steve Primavera took Rousey to an empty field. Primavera is familiar with Schutzhund, the traditional German sport used to test dogs for police work. 

Primavera wore a padded bite sleeve. He swatted the sleeve with a stick.

Rousey reared up on her hind legs and barked ferociously. Then, she bit the padded sleeve and refused to let go.

Primavera smiled. It was just the behavior he wanted to see. 

Primavera continued with the bite tests, raising the stick and pretending to threaten Rousey. 

Rousey refused to back down.

## One Dog, Many Abilities

Skaziak was excited to learn about Rousey's bite ability. Throw Away Dogs has already given dogs to several law enforcement agencies. However, this was the first dog that could do two jobs. Not only could Rousey use her keen sense of smell to sniff out bombs or drugs, she was also brave enough to catch criminals. 

In October, Skaziak and Walters delivered Rousey to the Winchester Police Department in Virginia. She had weighed 50 pounds at Char-Will. Now she was at 70 pounds, and her coat was thick and even.

Rousey was tested yet again. She was tied to a tree. A stranger wearing a gray hoodie jumped out and tried to scare her, pretending to strike her with a raised arm.

## A Test To Measure Bravery

Sergeant Brian King, head of the department's K-9 unit, told Skaziak it was a "courage test."

Rousey stared at the stranger. Her ears perked, then she started barking.

After a few moments, the stranger showed himself. It was police detective Steven Spaid, a K-9 trainer.

"She ain't scared at all," Spaid said.

The next test was fetching balls in tall grass. Rousey retrieved the ball each time even after one of the testers spun her around to make her dizzy.

Spaid then tested Rousey on a bite sleeve. Rousey barked excitedly and bit hard.

The testing was done.

"She'll work," Spaid said. 

It was time for Skaziak and Walters to go.

Skaziak teared up.

"Please take care of her," she said.
