MIAMI — On Aug. 3, 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from Spain with three ships on his voyage to the New World.

Only two made it back. On Christmas Day, the Santa Maria ran aground near the coast of Cap-Haitien in what is now northern Haiti. Now, an underwater explorer says he is certain that he has found the long-lost Santa Maria.

On Tuesday, Barry Clifford said he discovered the remains of Columbus' flagship near the spot where it was lost.

"It was precisely where Christopher Columbus said it would be," he said of the Santa Maria.

Years earlier, Clifford photographed what he now believes to have been a 15th-century wrought-iron lombard or cannon. Since then, it has disappeared.

"There are only seven lombards that have been found in the Western world," Clifford said. "We found the eighth, exactly the distance where Columbus said he lost the Santa Maria."

## Searching The Waters

The Santa Maria drifted into a reef and had to be abandoned. Using the wreckage, Columbus ordered sailors to build a fort nearby in Haiti. Then he sailed the remaining two ships — La Nina and La Pinta — back to Spain to report what he had found.

Cliffords' claim, which still needs to be proven, has its share of naysayers. One of them is another underwater explorer, Daniel Koski-Karell. He also believed he had discovered the remains of the Santa Maria. He thought he found the ship while snorkeling in 1987 off Haiti's northern coast.

"There is a lot of water, a lot of history around Haiti, and there have been many, many shipwrecks along the coast of Haiti," said Koski-Karell. His 1991 journey to confirm his hunch was canceled because of violence in the island nation.

But if Clifford really found the ship, the discovery would solve a 500-year-old riddle. The question of what happened to the Santa Maria is one of history's great mysteries. It would also be good for Haiti's image, which is struggling to rebuild four years after an enormous earthquake.

"It would be a tremendous discovery for Haiti," said Haitian Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe. But he, and others in the government, aren't celebrating just yet.

Still, Clifford is already planning a traveling exhibit of the wreck.

"This ship that changed the course of human history needs to be protected and preserved for the Haitian people. That is much more valuable than gold," Clifford said. "This is an irreplaceable resource for the Haitian people."

## A Ship And A Fort

Clifford won't say exactly where the ship is located. But he did say it's on a reef in less than 20 feet of water.

His concern is that what's left will be looted. He has asked Haitian President Michel Martelly to help preserve the site until archaeologists can examine and test the wreckage. This will help determine if the materials could have come from a 500-year-old ship.

If the shipwreck is that old, marine archaeologists from Indiana University will investigate to determine whether the ship is the Santa Maria. Their work may begin as early as this summer.

"The evidence looks very compelling," said Charles Beeker. He is a leading marine archaeologist and director of the university's underwater science program.

Clifford said he has discovered that the cannons on the shipwreck had been stolen. He believes they were sold to treasure hunters.

The cannons were first photographed in 2003 during an expedition to the wreckage. But they were misidentified by the team, Clifford said. It was only on further investigation that he realized the cannons could have been on a Columbus-era ship.

That same year, Columbus' La Navidad fort was discovered nearly 5 miles from the ship's wreckage.

## Journal As Treasure Map

Columbus wrote about the shipwreck in his journal, which has become a treasure map for many an explorer. In it, Columbus told how his crew, with help from the native Indian population, had saved much of the ship. They used the materials to build a fort, La Navidad.

It is precisely these details that Koski-Karell said make Clifford's claim unbelievable.

"Why would he leave cannons on the Santa Maria? There is a saying, in general, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence," Koski-Karell said.

He also questioned how Clifford could misidentify a cannon of that period.

"To my knowledge, there has never been any (definite) proof Fort Navidad has been found," said Koski-Karell. He is an expert on the archaeology of northern Haiti and conducted excavations with teams from the University of Florida. "I could possibly change my mind if I were allowed to review the evidence of it."

Clifford said more could be revealed after he revisits the site in June.
