Southern California's Lake Mission Viejo is certainly beautiful. However, it is also very wasteful. The huge lake is man-made. It was created just for sailing and swimming.

The lake was built during the 1970s. First, an enormous hole was dug. Then, the hole was filled with 1.2 billion gallons of water.

Every year, the lake needs to be partly refilled. The lake's water does not come from rain. It is pumped in from elsewhere.

The lake is not open to everyone. It is owned by the Lake Mission Viejo Association. To use it, you must live in the neighborhood and join the association. It costs more than $200 a year.

## Let's Spread The Good Water Around

California is in the middle of a terrible drought. Many parts of the state need water. For some people, a 1.2 billion-gallon lake that is used only for fun is wasteful and wrong.

State officials are starting to question the lake. They say its water could be put to better use. It could be used to help fill bathtubs and drinking glasses in places that have almost no water at all.

For the last three years, California has been very dry. Governor Jerry Brown has asked Californians to use less water.

Some California towns are almost waterless. They have been forced to bring in water from other places. Many others must use less water for things like car washing and lawn sprinklers.

Things may have to change for Lake Mission Viejo too. Especially if the drought gets much worse.

"When there's not enough water," scientist Max Gomberg said, tough choices have to be made. "Some needs have to be put ahead of others."

## Lake Changes Might Be Necessary

Each year, Lake Mission Viejo needs to be partly refilled with fresh water. The water comes from other parts of the state and elsewhere.

The lake association hopes to keep the lake completely filled during the drought. It hopes to decrease water use in the city of Mission Viejo in places other than the lake. It says that would balance out water use.

If things get bad enough, the association may not have a choice. It may no longer be allowed to refill the lake.

Some association members are unhappy about that. They are angered by the idea of changes to their lake.

"We love coming down here where there aren't too many people," said Carlos Lopez. Nearby, his 4-year-old daughter, Dayleen, was splashing in the water. "She's a fish. I'd have to take her down to the beach, and that's a pain."

For some, it does not matter if there is a drought or not. The lake just seems plain wrong. A "giant swimming pool for the few" makes "no sense at all," says water-use expert Conner Everts.

Lake Mission Viejo is terribly wasteful, Everts said. "You want lakes? Move to Minnesota."
