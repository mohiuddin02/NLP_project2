STOCKHOLM, Sweden â€” Three scientists from Sweden, the United States and Turkey won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday. The award is the most important prize a scientist can get. Winners are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The men's work showed how the body repairs DNA that has been damaged.

DNA is a material that is inside the human body. DNA contains genes, the body's building blocks. Genes holds the information that tells the body how to grow and function. Genes are passed down from parent to child.

## Their Work Helped Others Learn How To Fight Cancer

The three scientists' work did not only make us understand the body better. But it also led to important advances in medicine. It helped doctors figure out new ways to fight the terrible disease cancer.

Swedish scientist Tomas Lindahl, American Paul Modrich and U.S.-Turkish scientist Aziz Sancar did their work in the 1970s and 1980s. They will split the prize money evenly. The award totals close to 1 million dollars.

Lindahl is 77, and Modrich and Sancar are both 69.

Sancar lives in the United States but is Turkish. He is only the second Turk to win a Nobel Prize. The first was writer Orhan Pamuk, who won an award in 2006. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Sweden_Nobel_Prize_Edit.jpg" />

## How Did They React To Hearing They Won?

Sancar said the news was "quite a surprise." He added that the win would be "very important" for Turkey.

His win is a good thing for young Turkish scientists, Sancar said. It shows them that they too can do important work.

Lindahl has worked for years in Britain. He said he was having breakfast when a "nice lady" from the academy called. At first he thought it was all a joke. It was only when she started speaking in Swedish that he realized he really had won.

"Then, of course, it starts sinking in that this is a great honor," he said.

Modrich said the Swedish Academy had trouble finding him at first because he is on vacation in New Hampshire. He only found out about his win after someone he works with emailed him with the news.

The academy "didn't get my number, I guess, until later in the morning," he said.

Someone from the academy did reach him "eventually, so I think it's real," he said with a chuckle.

## Three Did Their Research On DNA Separately

The three prizewinners did their work separately. They managed to figure out how the body keeps its DNA in good shape. DNA is constantly being attacked by harmful UV rays from the sun and by things that can cause cancer, a terrible disease.

Scientists used to believe that the DNA inside human bodies was safe from harm. Then in the 1970s, Lindahl showed that it actually can be damaged very easily and quickly. He realized that the body must have some way of repairing damaged DNA, although he did not know what it could be. Otherwise DNA would soon be destroyed.

Soon, other scientists began trying to figure out how the body manages to repair damaged DNA. Sancar and Modrich made the most important new discoveries.

## Findings Paved Way For Cancer-Fighting Medicine

Sancar discovered how the body repairs DNA that has been damaged by UV rays. Modrich showed how the body corrects mistakes that are made when DNA is copied.

The three scientists' findings are important for doctors who are fighting cancer.

Cancer grows inside the human body, but DNA repairs made by the body help keep cancer alive. Doctors are now looking at ways to prevent those repairs from happening. If a medicine could stop the repairs, the cancer would die, and those who have the disease would get better. Doctors are already using one such medicine, called olaparib.

The three scientists will receive their award on December 10.
