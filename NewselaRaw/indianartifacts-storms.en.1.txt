SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, Calif. — Archaeologist Torben Rick watched with frustration as pounding surf clawed at one of the first places where people once lived in North America. The area was a massive heap of village foundations, cutting tools, beads and kitchen discards left behind over the last 13,000 years.

Here, seafaring tribal members cast fishing nets from canoes made of redwood planks. They prepared dinners on stone griddles and painstakingly chipped out tiny shell beads prized as currency.

But unless something is done, this rich trove of Native American history and several others on the island will almost certainly be destroyed. Rising seas and strong storm surges are destroying many of the beaches where the artifacts are found.

Rick, curator of anthropology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, picked up a tiny pink bead.

"Things like this are golden because they can help us better understand the people who lived here and how they dealt with some of the same unstoppable forces we face today," he said. "The trouble is, a few more storms and all this valuable history will be washed out to sea."

## An Archaeological Accounting

Conservationists and archaeologists are fighting back. Half a dozen scientists armed with trowels, clipboards and global positioning devices fanned out across the island's headlands and rocky fingers earlier this month. They took the first full accounting of archaeological sites heavily threatened by shoreline retreat and storm erosion.

The site inventory will create baseline information to help guide conservation decisions at imperiled sites where there's a shared history between humans and the ecosystem. It will also enable scientists to monitor the destructive forces of marine erosion, which are predicted to get worse.

The archaeological assessment is a combined effort by the Smithsonian Institution, the University of Oregon, Chumash tribal leaders and the Nature Conservancy. The Conservancy manages 76 percent of the 96-square-mile island, the largest of eight Channel Islands, 36 miles off Ventura, California.

"The real tragedy, and the urgency, is that sea level rise is destroying wholesale the opportunity to learn about our past — information we can use to be better conservationists," said Scott Morrison, the Conservancy's director of conservation science. "We're trying to do something about that."

Dozens of sites, including former villages and workshops, were assigned one of five risk categories. Factors such as elevation, distance to the nearest shoreline, coastal slope, soil erosion and precipitation rates were considered.

## Emergency Rescue At A Cave

Eight sites were designated "code red." Those sites contain significant archaeological resources and are in danger of being destroyed by rising seas in the near term.

Among them is a remote cave where the team conducted an "emergency archaeological rescue" of artifacts entombed beneath thick layers of sand and driftwood: arrowheads, crude stone implements, rope and fabric woven out of sea grass.

Also recovered in the cave was a square piece of redwood smeared with brown tar. The piece was used to repair a hole in a canoe.

"The last time one of these planks was found was in the 1960s," said Jon M. Erlandson, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon. Erlandson is an expert on Santa Cruz Island's cultural resources.

The plank is a reminder of a time when the coast teemed with fish, waterfowl and shellfish. "The shoreline was a lot further away than it is now," Erlandson said.

"There's not enough time to save everything," he added. "We're trying to record and salvage all we can before it's too late."

## From The Time Of Pygmy Mammoths

At a site near the cave, at least three Chumash house pits discovered within the last 40 years have been destroyed by the ocean.

The destruction eliminated the possibility of running DNA analysis and chemical studies of the remains. Such studies could provide important information about changes in island culture and the landscape, Erlandson said.

Rising sea levels between 7,000 and 15,000 years ago submerged much of the evidence of the island's earliest occupants. Those people were seafarers who arrived when pygmy mammoths lumbered through inland forests at the end of the last ice age.

Their descendants flourished amid the rich marine environment. In 1542, explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo counted several densely populated villages as he sailed past, and there were many more he didn't see.

The island is relatively large and has a diverse, roadless terrain. There are plunging valleys, conifer forests, steep mountains and windswept beaches. The size and terrain made it hard to survey evidence of the past inhabitants over the centuries.

After wiggling along a rocky road for two hours, Rick brought his four-wheel drive truck to an abrupt stop. "Let's go for a walk," he said.

He was joined by Gil Unzueta, a Chumash Indian monitoring the survey effort. Moments later, they were striding toward the eroding remnants of an ancient settlement and refuse heap that was falling into the sea.

"We're standing on a living history book," Unzueta said. "And we're losing pages from it every day."
