CALAIS, France — The school's floor is sandy like the nearby dunes. Its roof is held up by tree branches covered in flowered cloth. Inside, the students seated at small desks are paying close attention.

"'Light' is 'lumiere,'" said the teacher, giving a French lesson in English to migrants. They have come from far corners of the globe to this vast camp in the French port city of Calais. "A lamp gives you light."

The one-room schoolhouse is located on one edge of the camp known as the "jungle." Anywhere from four to six classes are held there every day and are packed with students.

The school opened its small door — found in a garbage can — on July 11. It was the brainchild of Zimako Jones. He is a Nigerian living in the camp, where an estimated 3,000 migrants are living in dwellings of sticks and tarp. They are among the waves of migrants fleeing violence and poverty, who have arrived on Europe's shores. They are hoping to be allowed to stay and to be given asylum — which is offered to people who would be in danger if they were sent back to their home countries.

## School Provides Humanity Amid The Struggles

"It helps build bridges" between the migrants of different countries, Virginie Tiberghien, one of about 20 volunteer teachers, said of the school. "It really helps maintain a sense of humanity even if their daily lives are very difficult."

Most of the migrants in Calais hope to sneak away through the Channel Tunnel, which connects France and Britain under the English Channel. They believe Britain offers them the chance of a better life. With help from the school, some are trying to learn enough French to end their travels and apply to stay in France instead.

The school offers French, English, painting and tai chi, a Chinese form of exercise. It also offers classes in whatever else the teachers might suggest.

The graffiti on the outside wall of the schoolhouse perhaps best reflects the hopes and dreams of the students. "Never give up hope," says one. "Hey everybody. We are in school," says another.

## Founder Inspired By Many Requests To Translate

Zimako dreamed up the idea for the school and built it with the help of five Sudanese from Africa. He wanted to improve the lives of people in the camp.

"I thought of doing this to help the people of the jungle, to unite them," he said. "It's a school without religion, without color. We are all together, people."

Zimako also wanted to help himself. He arrived in southern France as a migrant in 2013 and moved in April to Calais, where he has applied to stay in France. Fluent in French and English, he was swamped with requests from needy migrants to help them translate. "I was tired," he said.

Today, a big chalkboard covers the front wall of the classroom, and pictures of objects from animals to airplanes are posted on walls with their French names. The classroom can squeeze in up to 35 students, who are mainly adults of different ages.

## Volunteer Teachers Pick Their Subject Matter

Tiberghien is a speech therapist teaching a French class, and Chris Jaumotte, a Belgian artist living in the area, teaches French and art.

"We give them a bit of dignity. I think their dignity is being trampled here," Jaumotte said, referring to the tarp shelters where those in the camp live. She gives the students an A for their effort.

"This is a jungle," said 26-year-old Ahmed Riaz of Pakistan. Riaz hopes the school will help him leave the camp. He ended up sitting in the schoolhouse by accident. He broke a leg trying to catch a ride to Britain through the tunnel. Riaz, who is seeking political asylum to stay in France, has attended French class at the school since it opened.

## Aid Groups Help With Notebooks, Pens

Charities have helped contribute supplies such as notebooks and pens, while Jaumotte bought the paints and brushes for her art class.

At one desk, a young African had painted a boat at sea. It was full of people, much like the boatloads of migrants who make the dangerous passage across the Mediterranean, as many in the camp have done. He titled the picture in red, "Dangerous Days."

Zimako is humble about his accomplishment, and he keeps thinking big. He wants to build a second, larger school.

"It's ideas at work," he said. "It's not me."
