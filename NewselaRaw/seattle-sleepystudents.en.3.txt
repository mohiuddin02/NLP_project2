SEATTLE, Wash. — For a long time, scientists have said that teenagers should not start school before 8 in the morning. They said it is bad for teens' health and their grades. 

More schools around the United States are finally starting to listen.

Some of those schools are in Seattle, a large city in Washington state.

In November, school leaders decided that teenagers should begin school at 8:45 in the morning. All of Seattle's high schools and most of its middle schools will start at this time. The new start time will begin next year.

Seventy school districts across the country already let teens start later. More schools are expected to do the same thing. 

## Doctors Support Plan To Start Later

Last year, a big group of doctors said starting later is a good idea. The group was the American Academy of Pediatrics. It is made up of pediatricians, or doctors who see children. The doctors said later start times can improve students' lives in many ways.  

Teenagers often fall asleep later than their parents would like. Scientists say that if they start school later, they will get more sleep. They may also do better in school and feel better overall. 

"We're going to look back on this time period and wonder why it took so long," said Phyllis Payne. She works with a group called Start School Later. The group helps parents who want later start times for teens.  

## Changing Teens' Start Time Can Cost More

Some schools cannot change start times because they do not have enough money. This happened in St. Paul, the capital city of Minnesota. If they changed start times, the city would have to provide more buses and drivers. This would cost millions of dollars.  

In Seattle, school leaders decided to let teenagers start school later. At first, they also said younger kids had to start earlier. Some parents of younger kids did not like that. Also, some parents of older kids did not like that school would start later. They were afraid this would get in the way of after-school activities.  

Seattle finally approved the switch to a later start time for teens. It happened because school leaders listened to what parents had to say. The final plan was more expensive but also more popular, said Cindy Jatul. She is a Seattle teacher and parent. She also works with the group Start School Later Seattle.

## Listening To Parent Concerns

In the city of Chicago, Illinois, the school district tried to make start times later for teens. The plan failed because school leaders did not listen to parents. "It backfired terribly," Jatul said. Seattle was more successful because the city listened to parents.

Bridget Shelton is a freshman at Seattle's Roosevelt High School. She thinks the change in start times will help her get more sleep. This year, she sleeps six to seven hours a night. Next year, she hopes to get eight hours a night.  

"I know many students that come in and are just struggling to stay awake," she said. "Many of my friends are falling asleep in class."

Katie Benmar is a sophomore. She does not think the new start time will make anything better. She expects her life will just shift one hour later. She will do after-school activities, dinner, homework and bed one hour later than she does now.  

"I'm going to bed at midnight and waking up at 6," Benmar said about her busy life. "I'm really tired right now."
