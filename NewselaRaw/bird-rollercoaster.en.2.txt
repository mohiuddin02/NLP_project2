Some birds in south Asia are flying up and down across the Himalaya Mountain range. The mountains are some of the highest in the whole world.

Scientists followed some bar-headed geese as they flew south for the winter across the world's tallest mountains. Their study determined that the birds do not fly in a straight line. Instead, they climb up and go down, following the shape of the mountains.

The results of the study appeared in a scientific journal. The scientists followed the geese from their home in Mongolia, a country between China and Russia. The birds were tracked to their winter homes in India and southeastern Tibet.

When it comes to seasonal migrations, the bar-headed goose is far from lazy.

## Birds Crossing

The researchers wrote that many birds face challenges when they move from place to place. They have to fly over deserts and oceans. But the scientists added that only a few birds can fly across the high mountains between India and central Asia. The bar-headed goose is one type of bird that manages to cross the Himalaya Mountains.

The talented bar-headed goose can reach great heights. One goose was tracked flying more than 4 miles up in the air for a short while. There were many questions of how high the birds could actually fly and how they do it. Many scientists thought the geese would fly to the top of the mountains and stay there because the birds would not waste energy flying down and back up again.

To find out, a team of researchers needed to collect data from the birds while they were in the air. So they attached instruments to the geese to measure body temperature, speed and heartbeat.

The scientists found that the birds did not fly in a straight line  â€” the most direct route to their base. Instead, the geese would climb to get over a high peak and drop when the ground leveled out. This meant doing extra work to keep flying upward, over and over again.

## Flying Higher And Faster

In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese rose and fell over and over. They climbed almost 4 miles and dropped over 3 miles. It feels like a lot of extra flying to climb only a mile, but it is the best way to travel. The scientists found that if the birds had gone up in straight line, they would have spent 8 percent more energy making the trip.

That's probably because flying at great heights can be very tiring. The air is thinner in the taller peaks, so the birds' wings have less air to push against. They have to work harder to keep moving. The higher the birds flew, the more they had to beat their wings, and the more they beat their wings, the harder their hearts had to work. Flapping their wings 5 percent more made their hearts beat 19 percent faster.

In the end, it seems to be better for the birds to fly low when they can, and fly high when they have to get over a tall peak. The wind in the mountains helps to give them a lift.

In fact, some of the highest flights recorded have been at night. The night air is colder and thicker, so it is easier for the birds to fly through.

Bar-headed geese are heavier than most birds, the scientists wrote. It was very interesting to see such big birds fly so high across the world's tallest mountains.
