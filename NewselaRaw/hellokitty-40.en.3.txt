LOS ANGELES — Hello Kitty began cute. She was created back in 1974 in a Japanese design contest.

Today, 40 years later, her adorable little cartoon face is on 50,000 products around the world. Stars love her. Lady Gaga has worn an eye-popping gown entirely made out of Hello Kitty dolls. Images of Hello Kitty's cute little self sell everything from car products to diamond necklaces. There are Hello Kitty lunch boxes, Hello Kitty toasters, even a Hello Kitty airplane.

The kitty isn't just a product, said Christine Yano. She helped organize the new exhibit, "Hello! Exploring the Supercute World of Hello Kitty." Hello Kitty has taken on a life of its own.

## So Popular She Needs A Convention

This week, the first convention celebrating everything Hello Kitty will take place in the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. It is called, of course, Hello Kitty Con 2014.

However, Hello Kitty is not as popular as she used to be.

For years, Hello Kitty was the best-selling character in Japan, says Character Databank, a company that ranks the most valuable cartoon characters. Hello Ketty now ranks third. Number 2 is Mickey Mouse. Number 1 is Anpanman, a superhero whose head is a jam-filled bun.

"I don't think this can go on forever," said Tom Looser. He is a professor at New York University. He said Kitty is showing her age a bit.

## Kitty's Face Is Everywhere

Sanrio is the Japanese company that created Hello Kitty. Sanrio sells $8 billion worth of Hello Kitty and other characters each year, said Janet Hsu of Sanrio.

Companies pay Sanrio to use Hello Kitty on their products. Sanrio says half the sales at its stores are Hello Kitty items.

Sanrio, though, doesn't want to rely on just Hello Kitty to make money.

Sanrio is searching for the next cute sensation. Its artists have been busy creating new characters. None of them has come close to Hello Kitty's success.

Sanrio recently said it will open a Hello Kitty cafe in California. The company is also launching a new product line called Hello Kitty Men, which will include Hello Kitty men's underwear and T-shirts.

Some think her simple design is the key to her popularity. Kitty's face has no mouth, expression or personality. Fans can imagine whatever they want about her.

Roland Kelts, who wrote "Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Invaded the U.S," said that Hello Kitty is almost like a blank sheet of paper. She is whatever people want her to be.

"If you had a lousy day … you come home to Hello Kitty on your sofa, and she sympathizes," Kelts said. "On the other hand, if you got a raise or met someone and hit it off, Kitty feels good for you."

## Cuteness In Any Language

She became popular in the United States about the same time Americans became interested in eating sushi and reading anime comics. Some scholars consider her the Number 1 example of kawaii, Japanese for cuteness. Kawaii has become a big part of popular culture in Japan.

Every so often, Sanrio tries to bring attention to the kitty. It organizes events like the convention and the museum exhibit at Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles.

The exhibit has attracted such big crowds that the museum had to hire extra workers.

## What's Not To Like?

Like many high-profile stars, though, not everyone loves Hello Kitty.

Some slam her as a girl with no opinions. She can never talk back since she has no mouth. At least one blog is dedicated solely to her.

Inside the museum exhibit a DJ is wearing Hello Kitty headphones. Longtime fan Gianfranco Ocampo is there. The 23-year-old art student said he collected Hello Kitty dolls as a kid. He also has attended Hello Kitty tea parties.

Davi Marchi, who is with Sanrio, can't exactly explain Hello Kitty's appeal.

"If I could explain it," he said, "we would have 30 huge characters."
