A lot of the fruits and vegetables sold in the United States are grown in Mexico. Big U.S. companies like Wal-Mart buy enormous shipments of fruits and vegetables from large Mexican farms. Then, they sell the food to U.S. customers.

Many Mexican farms that sell to U.S. companies have treated their workers poorly.

However, things have been getting better for Mexico's farmworkers over the last several weeks. Some of the biggest farms have installed toilets and beds in the labor camps where workers live. They have gotten rid of labor camp stores that overcharge the workers. Their workers are being paid more quickly.

Now, things may improve even more.

## Big Farms, And Wal-Mart

Last week, many of Mexico's largest farms said they would work together to improve working conditions. At the same time, Wal-Mart announced it too would work to improve the treatment of farmworkers.

Wal-Mart's involvement is important. The company imports more fruits and vegetables from Mexico than any other U.S. company.

It will not be easy to bring about real change, experts said.

To make sure workers are being treated well, Wal-Mart and other U.S. companies might have to do more than they have been doing, the experts said. Most likely, that will mean spending more money.

Mexico's farms will have to spend more money as well. Some will have to improve worker housing and bathrooms. Others will have to provide beds. Some will have to set up new, cheaper labor camp stores.

Even just making sure that workers get paid every week could be difficult.

## Making Surprise Visits

Wal-Mart already has teams of inspectors who visit farms the company buys from. The inspectors give talks on how Wal-Mart wants farm workers to be treated. Wal-Mart has been doing this for years.

In the past, Wal-Mart's approach has not always worked well.

One problem was that many labor camps are hard to get to. As a result, they are not visited often. Another problem is that farm owners are not always truthful.

"When you go down to these places, you basically see what they choose to show you," said farming expert Devon Zagory. Inspectors have to trust farm owners to tell them "where their worst secrets are." Often, farms simply hide problems.

Experts say there are several good ways to find out how workers are really being treated: visit farms often, make surprise visits and talk to workers. However, doing things that way takes longer and costs more money. Wal-Mart has always preferred a faster and cheaper approach.

There are Mexican farm owners who treat their workers well. Some of those owners say Wal-Mart cares only about cost. They say the company buys from farms with the lowest prices, no matter how the workers are treated.

## A Company's Reputation

Thinking only about cost is risky for a company, however. Many U.S. customers want their food to come from farms that treat workers fairly. If those customers start to feel that Wal-Mart does not care enough about farmworkers, they might decide to buy their fruits and vegetables elsewhere.

Emily Miggins used to help run the supermarket chain Safeway. She says it is worth it for Wal-Mart and other companies to inspect farms carefully. The extra cost is not as bad as developing a reputation for not caring about workers.

It rarely costs more than $1,400 to inspect a farm carefully, Miggins said. The price is well worth it, she added. The companies would be sure that the farmworkers are not being mistreated.
