MEXICO CITY — For so long, Nancy Landa kept secrets.

Growing up in South Los Angeles, she never told friends that her parents had brought her illegally from Mexico when she was 9. Because Landa never became a legal U.S. citizen, she grew up knowing that she could be kicked out of the country at any moment.

In college, she was elected to be the first-ever Latina student body president at Cal State Northridge and, after graduating, went on to work in government. All the while, she kept her fears about getting sent back to Mexico to herself. For a long time, she didn't even tell her boyfriend.

## Deported To A Strange "Home"

The day finally came in 2009 while she was turning onto the freeway to go to work. Government officers stopped her and took her across the border to Mexico. They dropped her off that night in Tijuana. She had to start over but she knew no one.

She tried to forge relationships and plan a new future but had trouble letting go of the U.S., the country in which she grew up. Every time she saw the border fence, just a few blocks from her apartment, her sadness returned. It felt "like someone poking at a wound," she said.

Then Landa found out about a new social movement of people like her who grew up in the U.S. but returned to Mexico. With their help, she took control of her new life and began to demand changes to both Mexican and U.S. laws.

They call themselves "Los Otros Dreamers" — "The Other Dreamers." It's a reference to the "Dreamers," the name given to young people who are hoping to be allowed to stay in U.S. but are in danger of being kicked out because they are in the U.S. illegally. They hope that the Dream Act, a proposal that would allow some of them to become legal citizens, will be passed into law.

## Calling All Dreamers

Los Otros Dreamers would not benefit from the Dream Act, however. The new law would let children who have grown up in the U.S. stay there, but there is no such hope for people who have already left or been kicked out of the U.S.

Los Otros Dreamers formed a couple of years ago with the help of Jill Anderson. She is an American researcher in Mexico City. Anderson became interested in people like Landa when she noticed something strange about a call center near her house.

Call centers provide telephone services to help customers with their products. If your Internet doesn't work, for example, you can call a technical support number and speak to someone at a call center.

The person who answers may be located almost anywhere in the world. Many American companies set up call centers in other countries in order to save money. The call center near Anderson's Mexico City home was unusual, though. The employees there dressed in American clothes and spoke English with Southern California accents. "They really seemed like they were from Los Angeles," she said.

## Teased For Broken Spanish

Anderson began a study of call centers and found that many of the employees in Mexican centers were people who grew up in the U.S. Their perfect English made them ideal candidates to help American callers.

Anderson began studying what life was like for people returning to a country that they had little or no memory of. Some described being teased for their American accents or broken Spanish, or for not knowing the basics of Mexican culture and history. Others found themselves isolated in rural communities, struggling to make connections with family members.

Landa experienced difficulties like these in her first months in Tijuana. She also had difficulty finding work and she was unable to continue her education. Her degree from Cal State Northridge put her in a position to succeed in the U.S., but it got her nowhere in Mexico. Eventually she found a job at a call center. She was not allowed to return to the U.S., but all of the sudden she was spending all her time talking to Americans over the phone.

## Working For Change — In Two Countries

Last year, Landa saw a message Anderson had posted online. The message asked people who had been forced to return to Mexico to share their stories. Landa responded and, through Anderson, connected with Los Otros Dreamers.

Soon she was communicating with dozens of people like her. They started talking about changes that would make life easier for people like them.

Now, they are working to make their voices heard. They met with Mexican officials to argue in favor of speeding up the process for returnees seeking local IDs, so they can find jobs. They also called on Mexican universities to let students who grew up in the U.S. pick up their educations in Mexico where they left off, rather than having to start again from scratch.
