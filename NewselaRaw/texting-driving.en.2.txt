SANTA ANA, Calif. — Wayne Irving's daughter was 15 when she asked to get her driver's permit.

"I was already frustrated at how addicted to texting my daughter was," said the San Clemente, Calif., father of four. At the time, he had just learned a grim fact: More than 7,000 Americans had died from texting and driving during the previous year.

Instead of just signing the required slip of paper, Irving decided to try to change things. In 2009 he began work on a smartphone app to help solve the problem of texting while behind the wheel. That app, which he called Text Kills, has since grown into a nonprofit company.

The problem Text Kills is dedicated to fighting has only grown worse since 2009. Texting while driving is now the No. 1 killer of U.S. teens. It kills more teens than drinking and driving.
## Reaching Teens Who Text And Drive

Since 2010 Text Kills has crisscrossed the Unites States in a yellow bus. It plans to visit more than 30 high schools before the end of the year. The goal is to reach the 25 percent of teens who admit to sending or receiving at least one text while driving.

Along the way, the organization hopes to gather several thousand signatures from drivers who promise not to text while driving. NASCAR racers Kyle Busch and Joey Logano already have signed their names to the side of the Text Kills bus. So have more than 100,000 others.

When he and few others began working on the app, said Irving, "we were just a bunch of engineers and ... [businessmen]." Soon they were invited to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate the Text Kills app at a U.S. Department of Transportation event. Lacking the money to fly, Irving and his four co-developers took turns driving Irving's RV. Along the way, they visited college campuses, where they spread the word about the dangers of texting behind the wheel.

"We educated ourselves and hit the road," said Irving, whose first stop was the University of Denver in Colorado; 1,200 students showed up.

"Many of them had their own stories about texting and driving," Irving, 42, said. "One freshman's parents bought her a brand-new Ford Mustang two weeks before college, and she totaled it a week later. Another gal told us her cousin died three weeks earlier when he was texting, ran off the road and hit a tree. We couldn't believe that folks were opening themselves up to us."
## "Smartphones Of Mass Destruction"

In the three years since, he said, "We've heard thousands of stories from kids and parents who have lost loved ones."

According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 11 percent of all drivers under age 20 who are killed in car crashes were distracted when the crash happened. Twenty-one percent were distracted by cellphones.

Earlier this month, Text Kills became even more serious about its mission. It filed papers to become a nonprofit company, and began an online fundraising campaign. The goal is to raise cash for a documentary. Text Kills hopes to be able to offer the documentary to schools across the country.

"Our goal is to produce this thing and distribute it [widely]," Irving said of the film. It will be offered to teachers around the country. The film is titled "Smartphones of Mass Destruction."

It's all part of the Text Kills plan to make students hear its message. The bus has already visited 3,000 schools. At the events, students use simulators -- that is, setups that give them the experience of driving while distracted. One simulator uses a 50-inch TV mounted to the side of the Text Kills bus. Students are able to drive a car on the screen, just like in a video game.
## Distracted Driving's Dangers

"We make them drive in a race car situation around the track and pick up a card that looks like a phone and read it out loud. They read it, and their eyes aren't on the road. Everybody else is watching them drive off the track and hit a wall, and their car is spinning around. It's a nice eye-opener," Ryan Foland, executive producer of Text Kills, said.

Another simulator has drivers attempt to keep a remotely controlled toy car on a track while blindfolded for five seconds — about the time it takes to send a text. Every time, the car goes off the road and hits somebody's ankle, Foland said.

And when people see how easy it is crash because of distracted driving, they think, "Oh, I won't do that again," he added.
