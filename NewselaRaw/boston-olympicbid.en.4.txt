BOSTON â€” Many hope the 2024 Summer Olympics will be held in Boston, Massachusetts.

Still, the snowy winter made getting around the city a huge headache. Now many Bostonians wonder if their city can handle the Olympics. Boston is one of the smallest major cities in the country. Getting around the city could be hard with the Olympics going on.

## "I Can't Imagine The Olympics"

There are other worries about the Olympics too. The games will be very expensive, costing billions of dollars.

Debbie Jones rides the train to work every day. Her commute usually takes 45 minutes. Now it has been taking 2 1/2 hours because of the snow.

"We're already crazy," Jones said. "I can't imagine the Olympics, with 10 times more people."

Eventually winter will end. Spring will come. The snow will melt. The question is: will Bostonians' cold feelings toward the Olympics warm up as well?

One feeling in Boston is that the city does not need the Olympics. Boston is already famous, residents say.

## Who Needs The Olympics?

Boston is a leader in medicine, education and technology. The city is home to top universities and top sports teams.

"People already know where Boston is," said Pat Shaughnessy, who was waiting for a train.

In February, people in Boston were asked if they wanted the Olympics to happen there. Fewer than half of the people asked said that they did. Other cities that have hosted the Games have seen far higher support. In some cities, 8 out of every 10 people have wanted the Olympics. There is still time for people to change their minds in Boston. The decision about which city gets the Olympics is still two years away.

## Mayor Says Olympics Would Be Great

A U.S. city has not hosted the Summer Olympics since Atlanta in 1996. For each Olympics, a country chooses one of its cities. That city goes up against other cities from around the world. Each city wants to hold the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee then chooses one city. It will choose the next host in 2017. If people in Boston are still against the Olympics then, the IOC might not choose Boston.

In the past, voters in Denver, Munich, Germany, and Krakow, Poland, have said no to hosting the Olympics in their cities. They voted against it.

Ed Hula runs a website that writes about the Olympics. He says cities in Europe would be the main competition against Boston. They're also asking to host the Olympics.

Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said the Olympics would allow the city to start making improvements in transportation now. They would be finished in time to celebrate Boston's 400th anniversary in 2030.

He said it would be great for Boston's future.
