ORLANDO, Fla. â€” Armed with a supercomputer capable of conducting 213 trillion calculations per second and an amped-up weather model, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) hopes to improve tropical predictions up to 15 percent this season.

The two powerful forecasting tools should allow the center to better determine how storms are structured. Knowing the structure of a storm can signal where it might be headed and how strong it might get.

"If you don't have the structure of the storm right, it's hard to tell how it will interact with its environment," said James Franklin, the Hurricane Center's top hurricane specialist.

A primary goal will be to better forecast the power of a storm, an area where the Hurricane Center has struggled for decades. The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model, or HWRF, is designed to solve this problem.

## Significantly Sharpening Forecasts

The model has been used for the past six years. But this season, it has been improved to accept massive amounts of information from the atmosphere.

The development has already paid off. The upgraded model has shown a slight improvement over its previous version in predicting the power of the four storms that have emerged so far, said NHC spokesman Dennis Feltgen.

Meanwhile, the problem-solving power of a supercomputer in Reston, Va. nicknamed "Tide" and a backup in Orlando named "Gyre" has been more than doubled, from 90 trillion to 213 trillion calculations per second. To better understand that range: You would have to circle the Earth at the equator 40 million times to travel 1 trillion miles.

The combination of HWRF and Tide alone should significantly sharpen forecasts, Franklin said. But the quest doesn't end there. For the first time this year, the HWRF has been programmed to take in Doppler radar data from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) aircraft. The Hurricane Center is a division of the National Weather Service which in turn is part of NOAA.

## Projecting A Storm's Intensity

The radar should capture a three-dimensional view of how a storm is structured. In turn, the HWRF should be able to analyze how much thunderstorm activity is around the core and whether a system might weaken or burst with strength, Franklin said.

"Hurricanes are about arrangements of thunderstorms, how they interact with each other, how they distribute heat," he said. "If you can put that kind of structure into the model, it will better project intensity."

Better forecasts are vital because forecasters still are unable to anticipate when a system might rapidly bulk up. If it does so just before landfall, coastal residents could be caught by surprise as they were in 2004. Then, Hurricane Charley jumped from Category 2 to 4 in the five hours before striking southwest Florida.

That's the difference between a hurricane with extremely dangerous winds and a major hurricane that will cause catastrophic damage, according to the Saffir-Simpson wind scale.

The NHC has also overestimated a system's power. For example, in 2006, Ernesto was predicted to hit South Florida as a hurricane. It arrived as a weak tropical storm.

## From Hurricanes To Blizzards

The Center has steadily honed its track forecasts so that five-day projections are as accurate as three-day forecasts were in 2000. Even so, the combination of HWRF and the supercomputer should improve path projections between 5 and 15 percent this year, Franklin said.

The upgraded HWRF and supercomputer should also help improve other types of predictions, from excessive heat warnings in South Florida to blizzards in North Dakota, NOAA officials said.

The forecasting improvements were spurred by Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the U.S. East Coast last October. Congress allotted $24.3 million after that storm as part of a disaster relief bill. Additional funds are to be spent for another massive upgrade by 2015, when the supercomputers are to be able to conduct almost 2,000 trillion calculations per second.

"This is historic in terms of capacity increase," said Louis Uccellini. He is the director of the National Weather Service. "I believe we will have more accurate forecasts, especially for extreme events."
