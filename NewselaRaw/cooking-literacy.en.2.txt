PHILADELPHIA — Chef Marc Vetri positioned Max Kane, 12, and his brother Grant, 9, in front of a cutting board. He then gave them a wise piece of advice.

"Here's what I want you to do," the famous chef began somberly. "Don't cut yourself."

In between swigs of olive oil and jokes, Vetri demonstrated knife skills and food-preparation techniques. He also taught a crowd how to make a killer panzanella — an Italian summer salad. His audience included restaurant workers with limited English, kids finding their way around the kitchen for the first time, and parents and grandparents.

Vetri gave the cooking demonstration at the opening event of the new Culinary Literacy Center. The center opened Monday.

The first-of-its-kind program merges cooking and nutrition training with literacy, math and science education. Its home is in a sparkling new demonstration kitchen in Philadelphia's Central Library.

## Cooking Is Science, Math And Fun

Siobhan Reardon is the library's executive director. She said that the idea came out of discussions about what to do with an unused space on the library's fourth floor. It had once housed a cafeteria.

She saw an opportunity to create a new program, while addressing a startling fact. At least half of Philadelphia adults — half a million people — are "low literate," according to a 2009 report. A "low-literate" person would have trouble filling out a job application or following written directions.

Cooking is "science, it's math, it's literacy — and it's fun," Reardon said. "A lot of people who are low literacy don't typically come to the library, because they're concerned about their literacy level. So this is a way to say, 'You are welcome here.'"

The center's welcome mat is a demonstration island facing nine stainless-steel food preparation tables. It's rigged up to a video system so that students can get a close-up view of the food-preparation and cooking process.

There's also a grill top, 16 burners, three ovens and a walk-in refrigerator. Plus, the space contains an outdoor patio and herb garden.

The space will host events, cooking classes open to the public and, it is hoped, talks by cookbook authors. A schedule is online at www.freelibrary.org/cook.

It will also reach many different audiences.

## Plenty Of Space For Everyone

There will be grandparents responsible for caring for grandchildren. Another audience will be Center for Literacy adult students who will use a special reading program focusing on food. Philadelphia schoolchildren along with Spanish-speaking restaurant workers will also participate in food programs at the center.

At the opening, Jose Garces, another well-known Philadelphia chef, unrolled his knives. He then shuffled a set of flash cards for cooks. He helped the audience perfect their English, as well as their knife skills.

Garces said the impact of such lessons "is pretty instant. It's not just the English. It's the confidence it gives (restaurant workers) in the workplace, and they take that out into the community as well."

Mallory Fix-Lopez is the English for the Restaurant program coordinator. She said the library space will make a big difference.

"Even though there are many restaurants throughout the city, they're extremely busy. So finding locations sometimes to do the demos is a little tricky. This is a great central hub ... to come in and experience working in the kitchen without the pressure," she said.

## Feeling At Home

And once workers start spending time in the library, she said they may start using its other resources.

Liz Fitzgerald is the library's new food literacy expert. She hopes that's the case. But she's thinking even bigger.

She wants every person in Philadelphia to be able to cook a meal from scratch.
