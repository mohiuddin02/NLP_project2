LOS ANGELES — On Monday, no one in California will be able to eat an ancient type of Asian food anymore. On that day a law will ban the food — that is, make it illegal. Grocer Emily Gian is not happy about it.

Before Monday, Gian greatly lowered prices on one of the items she sells: shark fins. They are an expensive ingredient of a favorite Chinese soup eaten at special times. In California, they used to sell for more than $2,000 a pound.

Eighteen months ago, California Governor Jerry Brown outlawed the sale of shark fins in his state. Stores were only given permission to sell what they already had in stock. On Monday, even that became illegal. Those who break the new law could be jailed for up to six months. They could also be fined up to $1,000.

Gian's store, which is in Los Angeles' Chinatown, was selling fins for $599 a pound. She had hoped they would sell out before the ban began. "The law is unfair," she said. "Why single out Chinese people in California when shark fins are legal in many other states?"

## Protecting Sharks

Across town, retired science teacher Judy Ki explained why she thinks the ban is a good idea.

Ki grew up in a wealthy Hong Kong family. On special occasions like birthdays, banquets and weddings, they served steaming bowls of shark fin soup.

Today, Ki works for the Asian Pacific American Ocean Harmony Alliance, which tries to protect the ocean. She now sees the expensive food differently.

Shark fin soup was first eaten during China's Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). Then, only emperors were allowed to have it. It was hard at the time for a fisherman to kill a shark. For that reason, shark fin symbolized the power and importance of the emperor.

It's not the flavor of shark fin that makes some people love it. In fact, it hardly tastes like anything. What diners like about shark fin is that it is soft and tender. To give it flavor, chefs often cook it with chicken or ham.

## More Demand, More Hunting

In recent decades, China's middle class has grown. As a result, many more people now eat shark fin. As a result, fishermen have to catch many more sharks. Because they really only want the fins, they slice the fins off live sharks. Then, they throw the crippled animals back into the sea to die.

An estimated 73 million sharks are killed each year for their fins. Ninety percent of some shark species, such as hammerheads, have been killed in recent years.

Ki thinks that is wrong. It's not right to kill millions of sharks for "a bowl of soup that lasts five minutes," Ki said. [And once a species disappears, it never comes back](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species).

Gian and others pointed out that other states allow shark fin. But some other states may soon ban shark fin like California.

Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Maryland and Delaware already have laws banning the sale of shark fins. New York is currently trying to introduce similar legislation.

Aimee David of the Monterey Bay Aquarium said California's new law may lead yet more states to ban shark fins. "California's example has inspired several states to act."

## Trying To Sell Before The Ban

Wing Hop Fung Ginseng &amp; China Products had three bins of dried shark fins left. One was marked with a sign: "Father's Day Special! 20 percent off. $999 a pound."

At the nearby Ocean Seafood, shark fin soup cost $42 a bowl right before the ban. Manager Dennis Fong said the restaurant was changing its menus this week to remove the item.

Some Chinese restaurants are trying to come up with an imitation shark fin soup. This would replace shark fin with more common seafood.

As for Gian, she still had a lot of fins to sell.

"Maybe we'll reduce the prices even more, or eat them ourselves." Or maybe, she said, they'll just "move them to a state where they are still legal."
