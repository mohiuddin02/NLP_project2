SEATTLE, Wash. — Civil rights activist Rachel Dolezal's story has stirred a national conversation around some of the most sensitive issues in American life today — race, gender, identity and cultural inheritance. Chances are, though, that Dolezal never dreamed that this would be her teachable moment.

Dolezal, 37, resigned on Monday as president of the Spokane, Washington, chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The civil rights organization works to eliminate racial discrimination, particularly for African-Americans or colored people. Dolezal gave up her position amid revelations that she is a white woman pretending to be black. Her character was exposed last week by her white parents, who live in Montana and have not seen their daughter in years.

Dolezal's case highlights Americans' conflicting feelings about the country's increasingly multicultural population and about who gets to decide what race people identify with. The swift, loud response to her startling situation swirls around the issue of white privilege and the adoption of a different cultural identity.

## She Resigns NAACP Job As Controversy Grows

This much is known for sure: An ambitious activist in a midsized city unleashed a storm of anger and sympathy last Thursday. The debate spread across the country and shows no sign of resting. On Monday, Dolezal sent a letter of resignation to the NAACP's national headquarters and posted a lengthy explanation on the Spokane chapter's Facebook page.

She spoke about the fight that lies ahead to move "the cause of human rights and the Black Liberation Movement along the continuum ... and into a future of self-determination and empowerment." She did not address the allegations that she lied about her race. She did not apologize for the controversy.

Baz Dreisinger is the author of "Near Black: White-to-Black Passing in American Culture." Many people have liberal and flexible ideas about race, she said. Still, "they're really stuck in a very black-is-black and white-is-white ideology. When a scenario like this comes around to upend those categories, it's a shocker."

## At Black College, She Claimed Discrimination

Dolezal has been praised for revitalizing Spokane's chapter of the 106-year-old civil rights organization. But according to court documents obtained Monday by the Los Angeles Times, when she was a graduate student in art at Howard University, she sued the historically black school in Washington, D.C. Dolezal  charged that she was a victim of racial discrimination.

She claimed that university officials removed some of her artwork from a student exhibit in 2001 "for a discriminatory purpose to favor African American students" over her, according to an appeals court's summary of her arguments.

Her claims were dismissed by both lower and upper courts. A spokeswoman for Howard University declined to comment Monday, calling the matter resolved.

Dolezal recently walked away from a TV reporter who confronted her about her race. The reporter from KXLY in Spokane showed Dolezal a photograph of an elderly black man whose picture was on the Spokane NAACP's Facebook page and asked whether it was her father. "Yes, that's my dad," she replied. Then, when asked whether she is African-American, Dolezal replied, "I don't understand the question," and walked away.

## Her Parents Adopted Four Black Children

Dolezal's mother and father, who adopted three African-American children and one Haitian child, say she has passed as black despite not having any African-American heritage.

"She may have felt that she had some advantage in her activism by being portrayed as a black woman," her mother, Ruthanne Dolezal, said on NBC's "Today" show Monday morning. "We hope that Rachel will get the help she needs to deal with her identity issues."

Rachel Dolezal's father said they had not spoken up about their daughter's race before because they had never been asked.

"We had never been asked to be involved, we had never been questioned before, but just short of a week ago, we were contacted by the Coeur d'Alene Press," Lawrence Dolezal said on the "Today" show.

"I guess it was part of some investigative reporting that was being done and somehow they got wind of us as her parents as a possibility, so they contacted us to see if we were, in fact, her parents," Lawrence Dolezal said. "We taught our children, as we raised all six of them, tell the truth, always be honest. So we weren't going to lie; we told the truth: Rachel is our birth daughter."

## Civil Rights Group Liked And Respected Her

The NAACP national president, Cornell William Brooks, spoke in an interview on Monday with the Times. The disgraced former chapter leader was widely liked and respected in Spokane, he said. There is "a great deal of disappointment and pain now."

Brooks also insisted that "racial identity is not a qualifying or disqualifying characteristic for leadership or membership within the NAACP. It's just not something that's a criterion. ... It would be surprising to me that it even comes up."

What is important is the organization's "institutional integrity," Brooks told the Times. "Having credibility in terms of truth-telling is critically important."

When asked about the fact that Dolezal lied about her identity, Brooks said, "No. Lying is not consistent with our values."

Ed Prince is the executive director of the Washington State Commission on African American Affairs. He said the outrage over the Dolezal case "goes to the heart of white privilege. An African-American can never wake up and say, 'I'm gonna make my hair blond, put on white makeup and go through my day as a white person.'"
