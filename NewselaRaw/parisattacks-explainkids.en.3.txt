BOSTON, Mass. — On Friday night, gunmen launched several attacks in Paris. It is the capital city of France. Hundreds of people were killed and hurt.

Now, schools and parents around the world are wondering what to say to children. They also are not sure how to say it. Some wonder if they should talk about the attacks at all.

Many schools held moments of silence to honor the hundreds of people who were killed or hurt. Some schools openly talked about terrorism and the Paris attacks. Teachers of younger children often did not talk about it at all. They wanted to protect the children from what happened.

Sindy Garcia is a teacher at George Washington Carver Middle School in Miami, Florida. Garcia's class had a moment of silence. Then she played a video that teaches students about the attacks.

## Students Talk About Their Feelings

Afterward, some students asked what Islamic State is. It is a violent group. It said its fighters carried out the attacks. Islamic State wants to start its own country under Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. The Islamic State is also called ISIS.

Garcia's students also asked why the group wanted to attack France.

Garcia said she gave them just enough information so they knew what happened.

Lycée Français is a French school in New York City. Each grade there talked about the news separately. They also talked about their feelings.

Elisabeth King is with the school. She said it is important for teachers to listen to the children and make them less worried.

## French Newspaper Is Just For Kids

In Paris, children went to school on Monday as usual. In one school, a teacher told a class of 7-year-old children to sit close together on the floor. She explained there were attackers. Then she said there were more and more police coming to protect people.

Liberation is a French newspaper. It published a special children's newspaper on Monday.

Donna Quan is in charge of education for schools in Toronto, Canada. Quan gave suggestions to help teachers and parents talk about the attack. She said that children should be able to talk about their worries. Adults should also ask them questions about how they feel.

Quan said it is normal for children to try to understand what happened. Adults should ask children to share their ideas. Then, they can help children figure out what they know and what they are guessing about.

## Keep Hatred From Starting, Official Urges

Experts say parents should not talk about the attacks with children younger than 6. For older children, parents should watch the news as a family. Then, they should discuss it, said Dr. Steven Berkowitz. He is an expert on children and teens at the University of Pennsylvania.

Berkowitz said parents may feel afraid. However, they should be careful and not pass their own fears to their children.

In the United States, each school decides on its own how to teach about the news. In other countries, government officials may decide that.

Stefania Giannini is the head of education for Italy. She asked schools and universities to pause for a minute of silence. Giannini also said they should spend at least an hour talking about the attacks with students.

Giannini said the attacks might stir up hatred. Some kids might decide that they dislike people from other countries. The attackers' families originally came from North Africa and the Middle East.

Teachers must help students not have these thoughts. Today, it is more important than ever, she said.
