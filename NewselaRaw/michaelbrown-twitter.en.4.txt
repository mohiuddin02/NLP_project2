ATLANTA â€” Last weekend 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri. He might have struggled with the police. His death has sparked riots in Ferguson.

There were news reports that used a photo of him taken from his Twitter account. It made him seem threatening.

Now some people are fighting back against the types of photos the news reports showed.

They argue that most of his photos show a different side. On Twitter, there are photos of him smiling and laughing at his high school graduation. He was going to start college on Monday.

They have used the hashtag "#iftheygunnedmedown." It has been trending around Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

## Pictures May Not Tell A Whole Story

Alexis Nwaiwu, a 19-year-old at Georgia State University, didn't post at first. Then Nwaiwu saw something that made her mad.

She saw a photo of Brown put below one of James Holmes. Holmes shot and killed several people in a Colorado movie theater.

Someone posted the photo of Brown in a red Nike tank top holding up a peace sign. The headline read: "Police: Michael Brown Struggled With Officer Before Shooting."

Above that was a photo of Holmes, wearing a tie. The headline was: "Theater Shooting Suspect Was Brilliant Science Student."

She said Holmes, who is white, was shown as a smart student. In real life, he was a murderer. Michael Brown, she said, was shown as a thug because he held up a peace sign.

Nwaiwu posted a picture of herself laughing at a party, holding up two peace signs. Next to it is a smiling photo of Nwaiwu in her high school graduation robe.

"The one at the party with a peace sign portrays my generation," she said. "But don't get it confused. I am in college. I am a cheerleader and I make good grades. But the media will always show one side of you."

## So Many People Have Responded With Posts

Brown's death comes nearly 2 1/2 years after the shooting of Trayvon Martin. He was another black teenager without a weapon who was shot and killed.

Newer events have also led to the Michael Brown protests. Eric Garner died after police in New York City held him around the neck last month. It was caught on video.

Al Tompkins teaches journalism. He posted online that the hashtag forces people to think about how photos are viewed.

One photo can't tell everything about someone, Tompkins said. An arrest photo could be a person "at the worst moment of his or her life. A wedding photo could be that same person at the best moment of his or her life."

Since it started, "#iftheygunnedmedown" has been used on Twitter more than 158,000 times. Many people posted similar photos.

Eric Deggans wrote a book on race and media. He said social media give people a voice.

"With social media, we get to tell our story," Deggans said. People can put up a blog post or Tweet that shows how they feel, and it reaches millions of people.
