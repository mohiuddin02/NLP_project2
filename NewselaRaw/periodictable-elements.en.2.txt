The periodic table is getting a little bit longer, thanks to the addition of four new elements.

The discoveries of elements 113, 115, 117 and 118 were confirmed last week by an international scientific group. The group makes sure that the newly discovered elements are real and deserve a permanent spot on the periodic table. The periodic table is a chart listing all the elements. It hangs in science classrooms around the world.

Elements, which cannot be separated into smaller substances, make up all matter. Atoms are the building blocks that make up elements. At the center of each atom is a nucleus made of small particles called protons and neutrons. Nuclei is the plural of nucleus. 

The new elements are known as super-heavy elements because the nuclei of their atoms are so enormous. Element 118, for example, is the heaviest element to date, with 118 protons and 176 neutrons.

Most elements are found in nature. Huge, super-heavy elements are not normally found in nature, and it can take years to make them in special laboratories.

## Not Found In Nature

"Probably the only other place where they might exist in a short period of time could be a supernova," said scientist Dawn Shaughnessy. In a supernova "you have so much energy and so many particles that are really heavily concentrated," Shaughnessy is the lead researcher for the Heavy Element Group at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The group had a part in three of the discoveries.

Super-heavy elements are also highly unstable. They exist for just a fraction of a second before they begin to decay, or break down.

Scientists never observe unstable elements directly. Rather, they know they briefly existed because they are able to measure what is left when they decay.

The heaviest known elements are made by smashing two particles together and hoping they will stick. It's a game of chance with extremely long odds. Scientists first create a target out of a carefully chosen atom with a particular number of protons and neutrons. The process can take months. 

## A Matching Game

Then they purify it and blast it with another special atom. They use an atom that they think has the best chance of recombining with the target.

"It's really hard to smash two things together and get them to stick," Shaughnessy said. "There is so much positive charge — they want to repel each other."

It takes several months to try this smashing experiment roughly 10 quintillion times (10 followed by 18 zeros). If just one of those attempts works, the experiment is considered a success.

"And we're not always successful," Shaughnessy said. At most, it will work about three times in 10 quintillion tries, she said.

There are only a few laboratories around the world equipped to do this work. The experiments generate so much information that supercomputers are required to search through it all and find signs of a successful mash-up.

## Scientists At Work All Over World

Elements 115, 117 and 118 were created in Russia at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. Scientists from Lawrence Livermore worked on all three discoveries. The association that created element 117 also included researchers from a laboratory in Tennessee and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

The international chemistry group credited a Japanese group with the discovery of element 113\. They are the first Asian scientists to find a new element.

Until now, these elements have been known by the generic Latin names ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium. Their confirmation paves the way for them to get permanent names. Traditionally, that honor falls to the researchers who first found them.

## From 116 To Livermorium

The team from Lawrence Livermore and their Russian teammates had previously named element 116 Livermorium in honor of the Northern California lab. No word on what 115, 117 and 118 might be called.

With last week's announcement, 26 elements have been added to the periodic table since 1940\. Shaughnessy said her team isn't done yet.

The scientists will continue trying to make heavier elements until there are just so many protons that they won't stick together.

"These super-heavy elements help us understand how the nucleus functions and redefines our ideas of matter and how it behaves," she said. They are studying "what the extreme limits of matter might be."
