WASHINGTON â€” Bees around the country are in danger. There is not enough for them to eat. President Barack Obama has stepped in to help. He has a plan to save the bees. The plan will protect their habitats. This is where they live and get food.

Bees may be small, but they are important. They do more than buzz and sting. They also help make plants grow. Bees spend their lives pollinating. Pollination is how pollen is spread from plant to plant. When bees fly, they carry pollen and seeds with them. They drop the pollen as they fly. This helps plants grow in new places.

Bees pollinate many different types of food. They help grow fruits and vegetables and nuts. Bees do not just help humans. Cows, grizzly bears and birds also get their food from bees. We all need bees to help grow the food we eat.

## Bees Are In Danger

But the number of bees has been shrinking. Humans are to blame. Humans are cutting down the plants where bees live. Bees need plenty of plants to eat. When humans build homes or cut down plants, they ruin the habitats of animals. More bees were lost over the last year than in 2013.

Bees face many problems. Another danger is the use of pesticides. Pesticides are chemicals that can kill bees. The chemicals are sprayed on plants by farmers. The chemicals keep away bugs that eat plants. When bees eat the plants, they also eat the chemicals. Some people want to make these chemicals against the law.

One company is helping Obama's bee program. W. Atlee Burpee has given 1 million packets of seeds to the program for free. The government will send the seeds to homes across America. It wants Americans to plant the seeds in their yards. Soon, more plants and flowers could grow. Then, the bees that we need to grow our food will have more of their own.
