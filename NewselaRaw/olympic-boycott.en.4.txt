WASHINGTON â€” On Wednesday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina upset many in the sporting world. He suggested that maybe the United States shouldn't go to the 2014 Winter Olympic Games.

The Olympics take place in a different city and country every two years. In 2014 they will be in Sochi, Russia. Countries from all over the world have been invited to send their athletes to the competition.

Graham argued that Russia has been behaving badly. For that reason, the United States might want to protest by not going to the games. Such a protest is called a boycott.

"I love the Olympics," Graham said. "But I hate what the Russian government is doing throughout the world."

## Annoyed With Russia

Russia is doing several things that has angered the U.S. government. One is that it has been helping the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Assad is battling rebels who are trying to get rid of him. The U.S. government would like to see him pushed out. Russia has been giving weapons to Assad.

Another is that the Russians have let Edward Snowden stay in their country. Snowden is an American who gave away secrets about how the U.S. government spies on people in the country and overseas. The U.S. government wants to arrest Snowden, but Russia has refused to hand him over.

The U.S. Olympic Committee decides if athletes can go to the Olympics. The committee announced it is strongly against Graham's idea. The White House does not seem to support the idea either. Nor do most politicians.

But the Olympics are no stranger to boycotts. The 1980 Olympic Games took place in Moscow. That year, the United States and 64 other countries refused to send athletes to the games. Moscow is the capital of Russia, which was then called the Soviet Union.

At the time, the United States was very unfriendly to the Soviet Union. The two countries were still in the middle of what is known as the Cold War. This was not really a war, because the United States and the Soviet Union were not fighting. But there were still very bad relations between the two countries.

## Annoyed With Senator

Patrick Sandusky is part of the U.S. Olympic Committee. He said the boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games did not help solve any of the U.S.'s problems with Russia.  But it did rob hundreds of American athletes of the chance of a lifetime.

One of those athletes was swimmer Ron Neugent. Neugent had been training for an entire year. He lost his big chance when President Jimmy Carter announced that the United States wouldn't go to the Moscow Olympics. The boycott was to protest against the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union.

"I'm an American. I understand that our country has to do some things" to take a stand, Neugent said on Wednesday. "But I am also a human being." Athletes, he said, are only good enough to take part in the Olympic Games for a short time. If they miss one chance, they probably won't get another.

Neugent trained hard for the 1984 games in Los Angeles. But he was no longer in top shape. He lost his chance to compete for his country.

The same thing happened to Renaldo Nehemiah. He was the world-record holder in the 110-meter hurdles. In 1980, he had to stay home. After that, he was never able to reach the games.

"Punishing athletes because the government can't resolve its issues isn't right," he said. "Sports have nothing to do with politics."
