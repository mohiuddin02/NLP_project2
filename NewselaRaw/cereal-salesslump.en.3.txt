Just ask General Mills, the biggest seller of cereal in the United States. On Wednesday morning, the company announced that its cereal sales have dropped again. It was the sixth straight time it has reported lower cereal sales.

Cereal is just not as important a part of breakfast as it once was. It has been crowded out by other choices, such as yogurt, snack bars and breakfast sandwiches. Cereal sales hit their peak in 2009, but since then they have been dropping. They are expected to continue falling until at least 2020.

## Rice Krispies Down, Muesli Up

Some breakfast cereals are still pretty popular, however.

Take Cheerios, which is made by General Mills. Sales of Cheerios may not be growing, but they have remained strong and steady. General Mills sold nearly $1 billion worth of the cereal last year. Honey Nut Cheerios has been the best-selling type of Cheerios for years now.

Americans also still seem to love a few of the especially sugary cereals. Frosted Flakes is now the second best-selling cereal brand in this country. Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Lucky Charms remain popular too.

Other cereals have not done so well. Wheaties was once popular, but has been slipping for at least 10 years. Last year, the brand had only $17 million in sales. Corn Pops is also no longer popular. In 2014, the brand had only $88 million in sales. Rice Krispies, too, has seen its sales fall steeply.

People have still been buying up healthy cereals, though. Muesli is doing the best of all the healthier brands. It is a mix of oats and grains, fruits, seeds and nuts. It is the only type of cereal with steadily growing sales. Over the past nine years, sales of Muesli have climbed each year. Kashi has also had strong sales since the mid-2000s, although it has slipped recently.

## Sweet Sales For Sugary Cereals

People have not stopped buying extra-sugary cereals. Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charms and Froot Loops have all seen sales grow steeply since 2005. They have become more popular as other brands have struggled.

Shoppers seem to flip back and forth when they choose cereals. Sometimes they go for the healthy choice. Other times, they pick an unhealthy sugary cereal as a special treat.

The cereals that are selling the least are the ones in the middle: They are not that healthy, but not sweet enough to feel like a treat.

Some cereal brands are holding steady or even growing. However, overall cereal sales are dropping.

There is one big reason for the drop: Busy American families do not have much time in the morning. They are looking for food they can grab as they rush out the door, such as snack bars.

In addition, families do not eat breakfast together as much as they used to. TV ads still show families gathered around the breakfast table eating cereal together. Today, that sight is just not as common in real life as it used to be.
