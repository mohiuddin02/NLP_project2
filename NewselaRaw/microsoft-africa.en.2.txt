SEATTLE, Wash. â€” Anand Mariappan is a software expert who works at Microsoft. He spends his days at work building data-analysis tools designed for people like him. That is, office workers who are used to high-resolution computer monitors, quick Internet and the comforts of a modern office building.

But in January, the 31-year-old software developer spent three weeks working hard to help a different kind of client: new companies trying to launch in Kampala, Uganda.

In Africa, Mariappan had to shift his focus and priorities. Things that were important in his regular work in Seattle were not as important to his customers in Africa. Things like making sure an app would operate smoothly on the iPhone did not have quite the same importance as making sure software could just work. Internet regularly shuts down in Africa, which creates a new challenge for people working in technology.

## Different Resources, Different Needs

"Here, you have so many resources. Engineering talent, easily available Internet," Mariappan said. "In developed countries, you don't consider some of those factors."

Mariappan's trip to Africa was part of Microsoft's MySkills4Afrika initiative. The program has been around for two years. So far, MySkills4Afrika has sent about 400 Microsoft employees to the country for two- to three-week projects. During their time abroad, staff work closely with customers around Africa countries to share their particular skills, from software development to marketing.

The initiative serves a few different purposes. It is in part a business-development effort, helping to increase Microsoft's role in the global technological space. It is a way for employees to learn leadership skills through working with news types of customers in different settings. It also helps Microsoft's brand as a company. Microsoft says that the program is designed to increase the technological potential of the companies and government agencies in Africa. It also improves Microsoft's reputation and expands the number of clients the company in Africa.

## "Not A Philanthropy, Not A Charity"

"It's not philanthropy, it is not a charity," said Fernando de Sousa, Microsoft's human resources chief for the Middle East and Africa and the program's founding manager. De Sousa said Microsoft invests in Africa to support economic development.

Microsoft's work in Africa started in South Africa, which has long been the continent's largest and most advanced economy. Many other U.S. companies also target investments in South Africa.

De Sousa joined Microsoft in South Africa in 1992 and he was on the team in 2005 that helped develop an important strategy for Africa. The project focused on how technology could help fulfill the United Nations' development goals for the continent. The U.N.'s goals were aimed at improving the economy and state of Africa. Party because of this strategy, in 2013 Microsoft announced a three-year MySkills4Afrika initiative.

"In the background there was the understanding that we needed to think about Africa in a different way," said de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique.

Like most major international aid programs, the initiative has not run perfectly. While some projects have succeeded, others have flopped. In the program's early days, Microsoft pushed African customers to adopt a low-cost, Windows-powered smartphone. According Winnie Karanu, a program manager with Microsoft in Kenya, Africa, the attempt "did not go so well." To make matters more challenging, during the time Microsoft was pushing the African smartphone, it was falling far behind Google and Apple as a leader in the smartphone industry. It could not keep up with either company anywhere in the world.

## "But I Learned A Lot"

But even with those setbacks, Microsoft has made a positive impact in Africa. The company has launched successful training programs, internships for youth, and the MySkills4Afrika program.

Mariappan's work in Uganda has focused on teaching others about Power BI, which is Microsoft's new tool that helps customers analyze different types of data. He spent time teaching companies how to use information about sales from farm goods to make better business decisions. He also helped a startup company build mobile-payment tools.

"My goal was to teach," he said. "But I learned a lot."

Eileen Chou, a manager in Microsoft's information technology support group, had the opportunity to participate in the program as well. She spent three weeks in Kenya last October, where she worked with a few other Microsoft employees to train the Kenya Red Cross' IT department. They focused on improving the ways that employees work with technology. They also helped Africans become familiar using Microsoft software.

Chou said that while working in Africa, the team realized that companies all over the world face similar challenges during their work. "You always feel like you never have enough people to do everything; you always wear multiple hats," she said.

"We all would do it again in a heartbeat," Chou added.
