KINGSTON, Jamaica â€” The deep oceans span more than half the globe and their frigid depths have long been known to contain vast, untapped deposits of prized minerals. These treasures of the abyss, however, have always been out of reach to miners.

But now, the era of deep seabed mining appears to be dawning. It is fueled by technological advances in robotics and dwindling resources on land. There is rising demand for copper, cobalt, gold and the rare-earth elements vital in manufacturing smartphones and other high-tech products. And that is causing a rush to explore the dark seafloor thousands of feet beneath the waves.

With the Jamaica-based International Seabed Authority (ISA) issuing exploration contracts, alarmed conservationists are warning that the deep ocean's fragile biodiversity must be protected. They also say not nearly enough is known about the risks of extracting minerals from seabeds.

## U.N. Group Responsible For Regulation

"The pace of activity has increased dramatically over the last five years," said Michael Lodge, deputy secretary-general of ISA. The group is an obscure branch of the United Nations (U.N.) that acts as the global "administrator" of the deep seafloor. The group is also responsible for regulating this new mining frontier. "We're seeing the private sector invest in a big way," said Lodge.

The U.N. agency oversees seabeds outside the exclusive territorial waters of individual countries. So far, it has issued 27 exploration contracts, the large majority of them since 2011. The 15-year contracts allow for mineral prospecting on more than 390,000 square miles of seabed in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

Governments and private companies have been moving rapidly to stake claims and analyze deposits. They're moving so quickly that some experts predict commercial deep-sea mining could start within the next five years. The process utilizes robots equipped with cameras and sonar sensors to collect the crushed minerals and send them through pipes up to ships.

During a recent gathering in Jamaica of representatives from nearly 170 member states, ISA started drafting a framework to regulate commercial utilization of seafloor metals and minerals.

## Scientists Want To Set Protected Areas

In a July 9 article in the journal Science, a group of international scientists urged ISA to temporarily halt authorization of new mining contracts. The group said it first wants to establish "marine protected areas" around areas that are targeted for mining.

"We owe it to future generations to ensure that we think before we act," said Matthew Gianni, co-founder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition. "(We need to) gain a thorough understanding of the potential impacts of mining in the deep sea before any mining is permitted."

But despite the warnings, in recent days ISA authorized its latest exploration contract. A permit was issued in the Pacific to China Minmetals Corp. China now has the most permits from ISA, with four.

ISA was launched in 1994 and operates under an international agreement called the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. The only major marine power that has not ratified the convention is the United States, where lawmakers have argued it could intrude on the country's economic and military independence.

## Exploration Licenses Granted In Pacific

The U.S. government has granted exploration licenses in the Pacific to Lockheed Martin Corp. The military technology company has also partnered with the United Kingdom by setting up a deep-sea mining branch there.

So far, most of ISA's contracts have been issued for a sprawling area of the Pacific Ocean off Mexico and the U.S. At depths of 13,000 to nearly 20,000 feet, it is known to be rich in copper, cobalt, manganese and significant concentrations of rare-earth elements. As part of an environmental plan, ISA has set aside nine areas in this zone, prohibiting them to contractors.

Other coveted exploration areas are found in the Western Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. ISA estimates that one site could provide up to 25 percent of the annual global market for cobalt.

"The concentrations of minerals that you find in the seabed are very much richer than what's left on land," ISA's Lodge said. "So demand is only going to increase."

## Ecologist Sees Risks, Urges Caution

Douglas McCauley is an ecologist and conservation biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He believes seabed mining and other ocean-based industrial activities indicate that mankind is on the cusp of launching a "marine industrial revolution."

McCauley said current proposals for the oceans over the next several decades "look uncomfortably similar to what we did to land in the 1700s and 1800s." He added that the beginning of land-based industrialization was associated with a rise in animal extinctions.

But there are basic things humanity can do to approach seabed mining intelligently, he said. First, learn what biodiversity is down there before we mine. Second, go slowly on exploitation contracts and study the impacts of this mining as it is happening. Third, set up systems of protected areas before, not after, mining starts.

"The terrestrial industrial revolution happened before we had the tools to manage goals for development and goals for sustaining biodiversity," he said. "You can't really blame people in the 1700s for the damage they did to the environment. But we certainly are to blame if we don't do seabed mining properly."
