<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140602_Europe_royals.jpg" />MADRID — Spain's King Juan Carlos I told his country Monday he will give up his throne to his son. "A new generation demands, with justice, the leading role," the king said.

He said the younger generation deserves to take over. He called it "one with new energy" and willing to make the changes that Spain needs.

Juan Carlos said his son Felipe is responsible and well-prepared. Felipe "has the sense of responsibility necessary to become head of state and launch a new stage of hope," Juan Carlos said.

Juan Carlos once said that he wanted to be remembered as an "honest king who did his duty."

All signs show that he will do just that. But there have also been clouds for the king, who has reigned since 1975. More than other European kings, he has had to fight for his popularity.

## Called Franco's Puppet

Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, on Jan. 5, 1938. He was the son of Don Juan of Bourbon and Battenberg. The Bourbon family was overthrown in 1931. Dictator Francisco Franco became the sole ruler of Spain after a civil war.

Franco decided that, after his death, the country should have a king. He picked Juan Carlos, who was 10 at the time and returned to a homeland he did not know.

Juan Carlos went to school at military colleges and the University of Madrid. But he was not a popular choice. People thought he would be Franco's puppet and do whatever Franco told him to do. Juan Carlos was once attacked with tomatoes when touring Spain. When he was crowned, people did not pay much attention.

Still, Juan Carlos won the hearts of Spaniards by fighting for democracy. He supported the democratic heads of Spanish government. In 1981, he helped defeat an attempted takeover of Spain's government by members of the army.

Of all the European modern kings or queens, he may have had the greatest effect on his country's history.

## "Earn Your Crown"

"You have to earn your crown every day," Juan Carlos told his son Felipe.

Juan Carlos lived a low-key lifestyle in the Zarzuela Palace. The palace is not much bigger than a large home.

Juan Carlos had a friendly and easy-going personality. He created an exceptionally informal monarchy. He loved sports and fast cars, and had a good sense of humor.

His relaxed style was balanced by his more formal wife, Greek-born Queen Sofia. Their three children — Prince Felipe and Princesses Elena and Cristina — are also popular.

The press was thankful for the democratic freedoms. They partly saw the freedoms as the work of the king. So, at first they protected the royal family. They did not publicize their mistakes.

But recently the press stopped protecting the king. In 2012, news about an expensive hunting expedition to Africa appeared in Spain's newspapers. The elephant hunting trip took place in the middle of a financial crisis. Nearly one-quarter of  Spanish workers lost their jobs. Juan Carlos apologized.

## Popular Through It All

But earlier this year, his daughter, Cristina, was charged with cheating on her taxes and other financial crimes.

Their were also questions about how much money the royal family was given by the government. Earlier this year, they were given salaries.

Nor was Juan Carlo's role as king always appreciated. Groups in several regions in Spain want to separate from Spain and form their own independent countries. The groups have long called Juan Carlos a symbol of a country to which they do not want to belong.

Health problems also might have played a role in Monday's decision. But even as they became worse, the king insisted he would not be forced off the throne.

But through it all, the king remained popular and was called a role model for other European royals. He was said to know something that every royal family should remember — that kings are not born, but made by the people.
