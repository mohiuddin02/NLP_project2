LONDON, England — Drones are suddenly everywhere. The pilotless aircraft have been used in disaster zones in Haiti and the Philippines. They have been suggested as a new way to deliver packages. They show up in the plots of American TV shows like "24" and "Homeland." The once secret technology now seems to be very much out in the open.

Drones will soon become even more common. In both the United States and Europe, they will soon be allowed to fly almost anywhere. It is more important than ever to quickly identify the serious problems they might cause.

## Those Nosy Drones

One main thing that makes drones both very useful and a possible threat is that they can gather all sorts of information. Much of the time that information can be gathered without a person even knowing.

Most drones are already equipped with powerful cameras that offer a detailed view of their surroundings. Manufacturers are experimenting with drones that carry so-called thermal cameras. Such cameras pick up body heat, allowing for night vision and the detection of hidden people. Manufacturers are also working on drones that can recognize individual people's faces.

Meanwhile, drones are becoming smaller and smaller. They can get into spaces that normally would not be reachable. They can peek through windows, fly into buildings and sit undetected in corners or other small spaces. Their size and silence means they could potentially be used for spying or sabotage. Terrorists could use them to gather information or to mount attacks. Ordinary people could use them to spy on neighbors, family members or the general public.

## Many Questions, Few Answers

The price of drones is dropping quickly, too. A basic model already costs no more than a few hundred dollars. Soon, almost anyone will be able to afford one.

Something must be done now to help prevent the harm drones can cause. Yet the best approach to take is still not clear.

Simply banning drones is not the answer. Doing that would rob society of the many benefits they have to offer. There are many dangerous, dirty or dull jobs they are perfectly suited for. Plus drones are much cheaper to operate than manned aircraft.

Some uses of drones are clearly helpful and unlikely to cause serious problems. For example, few people would object to their use in search-and-rescue operations. However, other ways of using them clearly could lead to serious violations of people's rights, among other problems.

## Laws Need To Match Drone Use

Drone operators need to be sure they are using drones in a way that does not interfere with anyone's rights. Government agencies should publish guidelines on proper and acceptable drone use.

Drone manufacturers need to play their part as well. Among other things, they should help users — especially private citizens — understand how to operate their products within the bounds of the law. Serial numbers should be included on all drones, so individual drones are traceable.

Various laws ban the collecting and storing of personal information without permission. Such laws were written for other kinds of technology but should be applied to drones as well.

There is an urgent need to regulate drone use. The rights of citizens must be protected now, before drones become an even bigger part of everyday life.
