WASHINGTON â€” Most students on big yellow school buses are getting a free ride. The money that pays for the driver, the bus and the gas to run it comes from tax dollars. People pay taxes to their state. Then the state government gives money to schools.

Some schools say the state is not giving them enough money. Districts are starting to ask parents to pay for school bus service instead.

Dan Domenech says this has been happening since around 2008. Domenech leads the School Superintendents Association. He says money became a problem all over the country at about that time. Schools had to change the way they did things. Instead of cutting school programs, districts started "charging fees for sports events, uniforms, after-school activities, and eventually transportation," he said.

## Bus Fares Add Up

Nationwide, school districts get about half of their money from the state. The other half usually comes from their local government.

State money for education has dropped over the last seven years. At least 30 states are giving school districts less money now than they did before 2008.

The move to charge for bus transportation has angered parents in some communities. It has also worried some school officials about children's safety.

Transportation fees are different in every district. In Colorado, some families pay $150 a year for each child. In parts of Massachusetts, families pay $325 for each student, but no more than $975 for a family. Parents in San Diego County, California, must pay $575 a year for each child, but never more than $1,437, no matter how many children ride.

School districts do not charge if students are disabled and need special transportation. Families that take in foster children are not charged, and homeless students do not have to pay. Some districts offer cheaper or free service for poorer families.

## Traffic Jams Outside Schools

Charging parents for transportation is not a completely new idea. School districts in some states already charged bus fees for students who live very close to their schools. Their families pay for the bus because it is convenient. Families who live farther away usually get free bus rides.

Now school districts are starting to charge for buses no matter where families live. The bus fees might help make up for lost funding, but they are also causing trouble. Parents are complaining about the charges. Many have stopped using the bus service. Some schools are having big problems with traffic jams because so many people have started driving kids to school instead.

Some officials say that bus fees are unfair to students from poorer families. They worry that the high costs might prevent some students from being able to get to school. Families that cannot afford the bus fees also might not have cars.

## Some Parents Pay For Safety

According to Charlie Hood, bus fees affect student safety, too. Hood leads a national group of student transportation leaders. He believes school buses provide top-notch safety. Hood says charging for transportation is a bad idea. He thinks it makes some families choose less safe ways of getting their kids to school.

Safety is one reason some parents support the idea of paying for bus service.

Five years ago, one Colorado school district began a program that charges bus fees. The program uses a GPS system to track students on the bus. Donna Grattino runs the district's transportation program. Grattino said parents were supportive. They liked the way the system helped keep an eye on where kids were. They said it was worth a little extra money for the safety.
