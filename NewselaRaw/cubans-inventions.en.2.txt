MIAMI — In a country that once considered breeding mini-cows, Cubans have become masters of invention and improvisation.

They punch holes in the bottom of a water bottle. And presto, it's a shower head. If they can't find AA batteries for the TV remote control, they use a rubber band to attach a C battery and surf away.

They roast hot dogs and hamburgers on a metal chair. And they repurpose raw eggs to plug leaks. To stop a car's oil pan from dripping, they get out a bar of soap.

"The tendency is to think that Cubans are real smart. But the reality is that there have been so many shortages" it's a shaky economic situation, said Cuban-born Miami designer Ernesto Oroza, who has collected the inventions since the mid-1990s.

## "Resolviendo" (Making Do)

Cubans have been "resolviendo" — loosely translated as "making do" — since shortages of all types began hitting the island in the early 1960s. This was shortly after the U.S. government slapped the first trade sanctions on Cuban leader Fidel Castro's government. The trade sanctions barred U.S. companies from doing business with Cuba. This meant that Cubans couldn't get many goods, from building supplies to car parts, and had to make what they needed out of whatever they happened to have.

The state-controlled media regularly praise the virtues of Cuban cleverness. They featured farmers who build their own windmills and parts for their tractors.

"The revolution injected Cubans with inventiveness to survive the shortages created by the Americans," Oroza said. "And now the Cubans use it to survive the (shortcomings) of the revolution."

The Cuban revolution of 1958 resulted in a much lower standard of living for the Cuban people, shortages of goods and little freedom.

In one of his failed attempts at improvisation, Castro proposed in 1987 breeding cows down to the size of dogs. His idea was that families could keep them in city yards and solve the milk shortage.

## Risky Inventions

Shortages hit crisis levels in the early 1990s after the former Soviet Union halted its annual allowance to the Caribbean island. At the time, the Soviet Union was one of Cuba's few allies and gave Cuba up to $6 million each year. The Cuban economy shrank by 35 percent. Items imported from other countries just about disappeared from store shelves.

Some of the inventions are clearly more than risky.

With gasoline becoming scarce and expensive, some Cubans worked out ways of converting their car motors to natural gas. They put the potentially explosive gas containers in the trunks.

Bare electrical wires connected to cans were used as water heaters for showers. A rusted-out gasoline tank in an old vehicle was replaced by a couple of plastic jugs set dangerously close to the hot motor.

Other inventions were simply ingenious.

An iron turned upside down became a frying pan. Paper clips held up a shower curtain. A 55-gallon drum became a pizza oven. To provide light when the electricity failed, a wick was pushed through a tube of toothpaste and set in a jar of kerosene.

## Making "Rikimbilis"

Part of a car became a system for hanging a TV on a wall. The Cubans even figured out how to recharge batteries that are not supposed to be chargeable.

In the best-known inventions, metal food trays stolen from cafeterias were turned into TV antennas. And basic motorcycles were made from attaching small gasoline motors to bicycles. The Cubans call them "Rikimbilis."

Women used colored classroom chalk for as face powder and shoeshine paste for eye liner. Ground charcoal darkened their hair.

Oroza recalled that in the early years of the revolution, there was even a group designed to promote the improvisations and inventions. It was called the National Association of Innovators and Rationalizers.

Even in 1991, he said, the Cuban military and the Federation of Cuban Women printed a book on "making do." The articles gave instructions on how to make items such as slingshots.

A year later, they published a second book with the ideas for gadgets, work-arounds and herbal medicines that had been sent in by readers. They proudly titled the book "With Our Own Efforts."
