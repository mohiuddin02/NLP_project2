A pair of bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday. The blasts killed three and wounded nearly 200 people. The deadly attack reminded Americans that terrorism can strike close to home.

The explosions took place in a crowd of people who were cheering for the runners. The first blast was followed by another 12 seconds later. The devices sprayed pellets and nails. The victims' injuries included leg wounds, blown eardrums and heavy bleeding.

Emergency workers rushed to help the wounded. Police, firefighters, marathon officials and regular people worked together. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals. Boston is home to several of the world's best hospitals. Doctors were able to save many lives.

One of the victims who died was 8-year-old Martin Richard. He had been watching his father race in the marathon. Another victim was a 29-year-old woman. A female student from China was also killed. Boston hospitals reported that some of the wounded suffered bad leg injuries. More than 180 were hurt.

## Looking For Clues In Pictures And Videos

The FBI vowed to find the bomber. FBI agent-in-charge Rick DesLauriers told reporters that investigators would "go to the end of the Earth" to find the attacker or attackers. DesLauriers asked for the public's help. He asked people to send in their photos and videos of the marathon. The FBI hopes those could provide clues.

On Tuesday, President Barack Obama called the attack a terrorist act. "Anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror," he said.

American civilians have not been victims of terror on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. The New York Times noted that terrorism in the United States is down since the 1970s. The past decade has been especially safe. This is because Sept. 11 led to stricter security and laws.

## Keeping Life Normal

Officials promised they would not let the bombings hurt normal life.

"We want people to come and go. We want you to live your life," said Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis. But he warned that people must remain alert.

Boston is in Massachusetts. Deval Patrick is the governor of the state. He said the attack would not stop Boston's well-loved tradition. "Next year's marathon will be bigger and better," he promised.

Obama praised the runners for their courage. He said many kept running all the way to the hospital to give blood. He also praised police, firefighters, doctors and priests who did anything they could to help.

"What the world saw yesterday in the aftermath of the explosion were stories of heroism and kindness, generosity and love," Obama said.

The president will go to Boston on Thursday. He will be part of a ceremony to honor the victims.

The timing of the attack was cruel. "Marathon Monday" is a special day for the city. Boston invites the world to the marathon. Runners from nearly 100 countries compete.

The 26.2-mile race takes place on a Massachusetts state holiday called Patriots Day. The state celebrates its history as the birthplace of the American Revolution. Schools and offices close.  Many local residents take the time off to watch the race.

After the tragedy, the Boston Bruins canceled a hockey game set for Monday. The Boston Celtics called off a basketball game on Tuesday. Even a day later, the idea of "playing a basketball game didn't feel right to us," said Celtics President Rich Gotham. "Some things are bigger than basketball."

Meanwhile, The Boston Globe reported that several Boston art museums will open their doors for free. They hope to provide some comfort to the heartbroken people of Boston.
