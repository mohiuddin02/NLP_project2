Sebastien de la Cruz hit all the right notes when he sang the "Star Spangled Banner" last week at Game 3 of the National Basketball Association Finals in San Antonio, but his performance was followed by a sour, racism-tinged tempest on social media.

But while the 11-year-old, who was born in San Antonio, was called an illegal immigrant and much worse, the incident also turned into an example of the power of social media to rally to a cause. Many of Sebastien's detractors were shamed into deleting their tweets or removing their accounts in the wake of the public backlash.

Sebastien, who is known as El Charro de Oro â€“ or the boy with the golden voice - sang the National Anthem, a notoriously tricky song, before the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat tipped off. He was dressed in a silver and black mariachi outfit.

## A Tempest On Twitter

Some people did not like the idea of Sebastien singing the anthem, especially not in the Mexican folk music garb, and they took to social-media site Twitter to let their feelings be known. While many of the comments, and some of the twitter accounts, since have been removed, they were captured by another social media site: Tumblr's Public Shaming blog.

"This lil Mexican snuck into the country like 4 hours ago and now he singing the anthem," wrote @A2daO.

"Is this the American National Anthem or the Mexican Hat dance. Get this lil kid out of here," tweeted @A1R_STEVEN.

Several other tweeters were even more vicious.

Sebastien has been singing since he was 5 but gained fame in 2012 after being on NBC's "America's Got Talent" for singing his mariachi ballads with hopes of winning to help his younger brother get surgery for his hearing problem, according to CNN.

## Rising Hispanic Population In U.S.

The young singer was actually emblematic of the population of San Antonio. More than 55 percent of the population is Hispanic and 90 percent of those people identify themselves as Mexican, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. In fact, the NBA Finals is in some ways an example of the growth of the Hispanic population in the United States. In Miami, 65.7 percent of the people are Hispanic, with 53.9 percent of them identifying themselves as being of Cuban heritage, Pew said.

The Hispanic population in the United States grew 2.2 percent in 2012 to about 58 million people and represent about 17 percent of the country, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, making Hispanics the second-largest demographic group in the country behind whites.

The Twitter storm over Sebastien's appearance quickly became national news, with CNN, _USA Today_, and other outlets picking up the story and its aftermath.

Firefighter Andrew Lacey in Georgia probably got more attention than he wanted when he tweeted, "How you singing the anthem lookin like an illegal immigrant," as the _Augusta Chronicle_ newspaper in Georgia reported.

Fire Chief Chris James said the department was aware of the tweet and taking a look at its options, though it did not appear that Lacey was on duty when he tweeted.

The firefighter "will be counseled for sure," James told the newspaper. "What he said by no means is reflective of our attitude. It's completely inappropriate and not acceptable."

## A Social Media Rush To Sebastien's Defense

The Tumblr Public Shaming blog was just one example of social media members rushing to Sebastien's defense and tackling racism head on.

San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro took to Facebook to show his support.

"I'm proud of our young San Antonio superstar (Sebastien) de la Cruz for a spectacular rendition of our national anthem at last night's Spurs game," he wrote. "(Sebastien), don't let a few negative voices get you down. You are a true talent and you represent the best of our nation's future!"

Actress Eva Longoria tweeted: "As a Mexican-American, I am so proud of (Sebastien) De La Cruz, a great symbol of what America is today!"

Even San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who is a man of few words, chimed in. "He's a class act. Way more mature than most his age," Popovich said of the fifth grader at a press conference before Game 4. "And as much as those comments by the idiots sadden you about your country, he makes you feel that the future could be very bright."

## "I'm From San Antonio"

Sebastien himself took on his critics during a news conference on Wednesday.

"My father was actually in the (U.S.) Navy for a really long time," he said. "People don't know; they just assume that I'm just Mexican. But I'm not from Mexico. I'm from San Antonio, born and raised, a true San Antonio Spurs fan," he said.

The public discussion of the reaction to Sebastien's appearance also caused some of his detractors to have second thoughts.

One, @bdub58713, who also goes by the name "THE_GREAT_WHITE" on Twitter, got into a debate with followers and later tweeted: "I am sorry for the racist comment I recently posted during the nba finals game. Due to the comments, I have changed my views."

As for Sebastien, he had the last word. He was invited back to sing the anthem again at Thursday's Game 4. And the publicity surrounding the controversy might also help his career.

On Friday, he tweeted: "My new cd will be available on iTunes by Monday. Called Sentimiento"
