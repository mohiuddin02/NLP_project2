The divers called her Naia, for "water nymph," because they discovered her teenage remains in a dark, underwater cave.

She had been hidden there, in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, for more than 12,000 years — along with the bones of dozens of extinct ice age beasts. Divers quickly spotted her skull as they swept the chamber with flashlights.

"It was a small cranium laying upside-down with a perfect set of teeth and dark eye sockets looking back at us," recalled diver Alberto Nava.

On Thursday, researchers published a formal analysis of Naia's skeletal remains in the journal Science. They called it the oldest, most complete specimen ever discovered in the Americas.

The study authors say that the buck-toothed 15- or 16-year-old girl did not resemble today's [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) — her cheeks were narrow and her forehead very high. However, her mitochondrial DNA reveals she is related to 11 percent of living American Indians.

## Related To Native Americans

That connection in turn helps prove something else: that Native Americans are linked genetically to a population of early humans who inhabited a land now submerged beneath the Bering Sea.

The researchers say the girl was probably very slight and stood just 4 feet, 10 inches tall. Her eyes were wide-set and low, and her nose was broad.

Carbon-dating of her teeth and isotope data from crystals that formed on her bones show that the girl lived 12,000 to 13,000 years ago. Researchers believe she was searching for water when she entered a dark, underground cave and then plummeted 100 feet into the massive chamber now called Hoyo Negro, or black hole.

Unable to escape — her hip bone shattered from the fall — she died in the hole. With her was a menagerie of similarly doomed megafauna, including saber-toothed cats, elephant-like gomphotheres and giant sloths. As the ice age ended and glaciers melted, sea levels rose and slowly filled the chamber with water, sealing it off from humanity.

Naia's remains lay undetected until 2007, when scuba divers first entered the underwater tomb. In it, they discovered a time capsule of Central American life at the end of the ice age.

"It's in many ways like a mini La Brea Tar Pits," study leader James Chatters said of the Hoyo Negro site. "But without the tar and (with) considerably better preservation."

## DNA Detectives Of North America

The study is one among a number of recent genetic findings that shed light on early human habitation of the Americas. Together, these discoveries have radically altered the long and heated debate over how humans came to inhabit the New World.

The source of that debate is major differences of appearance between present-day Native Americans and ancient fossils. Faced with that difference, some archaeologists have argued that the Americas were originally populated by people from Europe as well as Asia.

Within the last 10 years, however, DNA research has suggested that America's early dwellers emerged from a single ancestral population that initially came from Asia. Penned in by vast ice sheets, these people evolved in isolation for thousands of years in a land between Siberia and Alaska that scientists call Beringia. Then, as the glaciers retreated and Beringia began to disappear amid rising seas, the inhabitants spread swiftly through North and South America, scientists say.

Once situated in their new world, these founders, or Paleoamericans, would gradually evolve features that are now associated with Native Americans, according to the study authors. The physical differences that have puzzled researchers for so many years are not the result of separate origins, they argue. Naia's genetic connection to some modern-day Native Americans helps prove that common ancestry.

"Paleoamericans and Native Americans descended from the same homeland," Chatters said.

Paleoarchaeologist John Hoffecker said the paper would help reshape debate on the origins of the first Americans.

## Nuclear DNA "Extremely Fragmented"

"For years archaeologists have been debating this transatlantic thing, and really it's been an enormous distraction," said Hoffecker. "This helps us focus on Beringia, which is what we should have been doing all along."

Archaeologist Michael Waters said he was excited to see what facial reconstructions of the girl's skull would reveal.

"That will be pretty interesting," Waters said. "These early skeletons are so rare we have to really get as much information as we can from them."

Genetic anthropologist Deborah Bolnick, a member of the study team, said researchers were attempting to extract nuclear DNA from the girl's skeleton. That would provide genetic information from both parents, unlike mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by the mother.

Obtaining the nuclear DNA will be challenging, however. It is extremely fragmented, and it's probably contaminated with bacteria, Bolnick said.

The girl's remains are being stored in a laboratory in Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico City.

Initially, researchers hoped to leave the bones in place, which is normal for the preservation of underwater cultural remains.

However, researchers discovered that unauthorized divers were entering the chamber and damaging the girl's bones, study coauthor Pilar Luna Erreguerena said. In March, her skull, jawbone and other bones were removed.

"We were forced to recover five pieces of Naia so far," she said.
