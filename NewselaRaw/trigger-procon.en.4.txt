### PRO: It helps class talks on disturbing topics

NEW YORK — The college classroom is the proper place to discuss possibly disturbing or traumatic topics. "Trigger warnings" don't get in the way of that. In fact, they improve upon it.

Trigger warnings started on the Internet. Originally, they were a way to warn readers about writings that might be traumatic.

The reasoning was that someone who had been attacked, for instance, might want to be warned before reading about an attack. Trigger warnings generally don't anger people in online writings. Some writers use them, but most don't.

Earlier this year, though, college students started pushing for the use of trigger warnings in classes. Their demand made many people angry. Some professors don't like the idea.

As a history professor I discuss difficult material in class. I think it's important to tell students what their rights are.

## "My Own Trigger Warning"

I came up with my own trigger warning. In mine, I tell students that some of them may find some of the material we cover disturbing.

I let students know that I'm open to discussing their feelings about topics during class. I tell them that they are free to step outside briefly if they find anything upsetting. They can also meet me in my office after class.

Recently, I wrote an article on trigger warnings for an online newspaper. Many people found it helpful. Others thought my trigger warning wasn't strong enough.

What did this tell me?

Think at least three things: First, that the discussion of trigger warnings in the classroom is still in its early stages. Teachers should join in the talk about it.

Second, the term trigger warnings may be new. But  many professors are probably already doing something like it.

And third, that even small changes to teaching practice can have a large positive effect in the classroom.

### CON: It might stop class talks on a lot of disturbing topics

MADISON, Wis. — "Trigger warnings" are verbal or written warnings. Many universities have begun to put them in place. Others are considering them. Teachers provide them about material that might trigger trauma in students who have experienced or witnessed upsetting events.

The danger of trauma is that it can lead to mental or emotional problems. Experiencing events like war or being attacked can make students upset by certain topics. When some students read about topics like war or race or sex it can bring up memories. Even reading about a country ruling another country could be hurtful.

Being reminded of trauma can emotionally harm the student. It can make it harder to learn. Trigger warnings might help protect students from re-experiencing the past trauma.

What could be wrong with that? Unfortunately, many problems lie just beneath the surface.

## Too Many Trigger Warnings?

First, it is impossible to determine in advance what deserves a warning. Complaints and court action are possible if professors don't warn of some potentially upsetting material. To avoid that, many teachers would likely warn about large amounts of material. They would do it just to be safe.

Or they could cut parts of the course material to not upset anyone. Small cuts could lead to bigger ones.

Already, trigger warnings have been applied to famous works of literature. "The Great Gatsby" and "The Merchant of Venice" are among them.

"Gatsby?" Really?! What's next? And what if a student refuses to read the flagged material, however important it is to the class?

Another danger: trigger warnings would give more power to the people who run colleges. Many are already too eager to add rules to protect students' feelings. They're more interested in that than the freedom to explore ideas in the classroom.

## The Purpose Of Education

Most important, trigger warnings are against the purpose of education.

Education should teach students about the good and bad that humans cause. Doing so must include matters of good and evil, life and death.

And education must prepare students to be strong enough to handle clashing ideas. It is necessary to a free country. It is part of being a citizen. Trigger warnings treat students as if they are not ready to be citizens.

At the same time, the warnings put teachers in the place of parents.

To deal with upsetting material, leave the matter where it has always been left: to the judgment of professors.

If a trigger warning must be had, place these words atop a university's main webpage: "Education necessarily exposes students to ideas and experiences that are new, challenging, and sometimes painful. To be properly educated, you must learn to handle and welcome such challenges."
