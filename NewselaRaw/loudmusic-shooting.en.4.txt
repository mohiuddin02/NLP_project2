JACKSONVILLE, Fla. â€” People are talking about self-defense and race in Florida again. They are talking about it because of a court case.

The case was about a shooting where a black teenager was killed by a white man.

Michael Dunn is a white 47-year-old software developer. He could face 60 years in prison. He was found guilty Saturday on several counts of attempted murder for shooting into a car full of teenagers. The shooting happened outside a Jacksonville convenience store in 2012.

Jordan Davis was killed in the shooting. He was a black 17-year-old. But the jury couldn't reach a decision on the murder charge against Dunn.

## Two Similar Cases

When someone is accused of a crime, a jury is called. The jury is made up of randomly chosen people. They must decide whether the person is guilty or innocent. In other words, they must decide whether or not the person did what they are accused of.

This jury's decision came seven months after another case about race and self-defense.

In that case, George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin. Like Jordan, Martin was black.

But the decision is far different from the one in the Zimmerman case.

Dunn said he felt his life was in danger when he fired the shots. So did Zimmerman. But the Dunn decision shows the jury had trouble seeing it that way.

The shooting came after an argument over loud music coming from the car that Davis was in. Dunn said he shot at the car. Dunn said he was afraid. He said he thought he saw a shotgun in the car.

## Stand-Your-Ground Law

Legal experts say at least one member of the jury probably believed Dunn. The jury could not agree on the first-degree murder charge.

The jury could have decided that Dunn felt threatened by Davis. But at the same time, they could also have decided that shooting other people in the car went too far, said Kenneth Nunn. He is a law professor at the University of Florida. Nunn said he did not think the evidence backed up that thinking.

Experts said that it's possible the jury was confused. They may have trouble with what the law says about first-degree murder. First-degree murder means the person had to want to kill the other person. It also means that the person was not just acting in the moment.

One law in Florida also confuses the general public. The law is called the "stand-your-ground" defense law. The law was a source of conflict during the Zimmerman case. It also came up in Dunn's case, but less so.

Zimmerman told police he shot Martin only after the African-American teenager attacked him. Martin's family and supporters did not believe him. They said Zimmerman decided Martin could be a criminal because he was black. Zimmerman considers himself to be Hispanic.

Judges in each case gave instructions to the people on the jury. The jurors were told that they should vote that Dunn was guilty if they did not think he needed to back down. In other words, the jurors could decide Dunn had the right to "stand his ground."

The "stand-your-ground" language is part of instructions given to jurors in self-defense cases.

## Dunn Could Face 60 Years

Judge Russell L. Healey could sentence Dunn to 60 years in prison.

But the Florida Supreme Court could lower the sentence. It could decide that separate sentences should not come from one criminal event. It could make the sentence 20 years.

Dunn could be tried again on the first-degree murder charge. But Miami lawyer David Weinstein said the decision to retry Dunn could be complicated. Dunn could agree to a sentence of less than 60 years. To do this, he would have to decide not to appeal. An appeal means asking other judges to rule against the jury's decision. The case would be over if Dunn does not appeal. That could let the Davis family move on.

A sentencing date won't be set until a hearing next month.

Dunn's lawyer said they would appeal the jury's decision.
