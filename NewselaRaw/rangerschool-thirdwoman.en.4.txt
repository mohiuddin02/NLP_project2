COLUMBUS, Ga. â€” Rangers are some of the strongest soldiers in the Army. A soldier must go to special school to become a Ranger. Before, only men were allowed to go. This year, the Army ran a test. They let women into the school for the first time.

Not long ago, Lisa Jaster graduated from Ranger School.

Lisa was not the first woman to finish. Kristen Griest and Shaye Haver graduated two months earlier. Kristen is a captain. Shaye is a first lieutenant.

## Soldier Is Also A Wife, Mom, Engineer

Lisa was the third woman to graduate. Yet her hard work was just as important. She is 37 years old and has two children. Her daughter is 3. Her son turned 7 in August. Lisa missed his birthday. Ranger School usually takes 62 days. It took Lisa 180 days to finish.

Lisa works as an engineer. She lives in Texas. She is in the Army Reserve, and she is a major. Her husband, Allan, is a lieutenant colonel.

Ranger School is very hard. Soldiers get little food and sleep. They train in the woods, mountains and swamps. It helps get them ready for battle.

## School Was Tough But She Was Tougher

Lisa is not a quitter, but one day she almost gave up. Kristen and Shaye moved ahead to the next training. Lisa thought she would move on, too. She had to stay back though. She needed to learn important things before she could go on. She started to cry. She wanted to go home.

Then Lisa pulled out a photo. It was of her children, Zac and Victoria. They were dressed as superheroes. Lisa had come to Ranger School to be their hero. She could not let her kids down.

## Proving That Women Are As Strong As Men

Lisa wanted to show that women are as strong as men.

Lisa's hard work paid off. She finally finished the course. The Army announced Ranger School would now be open to both men and women. The next course starts in November. The Army expects female soldiers to sign up.

Lisa thought she might be treated differently. It did not matter that Lisa is a female. Her teachers only wanted to know if she was tough enough to carry out a mission.
