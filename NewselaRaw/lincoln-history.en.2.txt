WASHINGTON â€” Abraham Lincoln was killed by John Wilkes Booth 150 years ago on April 14. Since then, views of his presidency have changed.

As recent events have shown, some of the problems Lincoln faced in his fight to end slavery are still with us. They remain a part of today's struggles over equality and race.

As the anniversary of his death approached, historians and moviemakers took a fresh look at Lincoln's words and actions.

## Lincoln, Obama Wrestle With Same Troubles

Many of the issues Lincoln grappled with remain as troubling today as they were in his time. Recent events in Ferguson, Missouri, and in North Charleston, South Carolina, demonstrate that the country is still plagued by some of the same racial divisions Lincoln confronted in 1865. In both cities, a white police officer shot an unarmed black man to death.

The election of Barack Obama was supposed to mark an end to many of the country's racial problems. However, some of the same issues that confronted Lincoln have been revisited during Obama's presidency.

"All generations rethink Lincoln," historian Martha Hodes said. "For this generation, it's about rethinking the meaning of freedom in a moment that is decidedly not the post-racial moment some expected with the election and re-election of the nation's first black president."

## Voting Rights For All

The anniversary of Lincoln's assassination will be commemorated in various locations. Ceremonies are planned at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, and at Ford's Theater and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

Hodes said memories of Lincoln are linked to painful current events and to "renewed calls for justice."

Other historians agree, pointing to ongoing political fights over voting rights. Some feel that politicians have used legal tricks to reduce the number of blacks who are able to vote. In his time, Lincoln had to deal with strong resistance to giving blacks equal voting rights.

Lincoln was not murdered because he freed the slaves, historian Michael Burlingame said. He was killed "because on April 11, 1865, he publicly called for black voting rights."

Booth was in the audience for that speech, and vowed then to kill Lincoln, said Burlingame.

## Historians Had Questions

Lincoln should be honored as someone who died in the pursuit of civil rights, Burlingame said. He should be thought of alongside Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers and others who were assassinated for fighting for racial justice.

Lincoln has not always been seen positively, however.

Lincoln was viewed extremely favorably during the 1950s. However, in the years that followed "a big change took place," historian Richard Wightman Fox said.

In the 1960s and 1970s, historians began to question whether Lincoln really cared that much about ending slavery. Perhaps, they said, he had other reasons for wanting to fight against the slave-owning South. Some scholars argued that the Civil War between North and South was really more about money or controlling the country than slaves.

"Opinion about him became entirely less favorable," Fox said.

## Unfulfilled Promises

African-Americans first began to turn away from Lincoln during the Great Depression of the 1930s, historian Edna Greene Medford said. Many people were out of work during those years, and things were particularly hard for blacks.

Lincoln suddenly became a symbol of disappointment and unfulfilled promise for many African-Americans.

"These former slaves recalled what life was supposed to be and what it was not," Medford said. "They were saying, 'Lincoln freed us, but he didn't give us anything but our freedom. We needed land, we needed more opportunity.'"

However, the connection with Lincoln "never totally dies out," Medford said. In 1963, King delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. King talked about liberation and "how people are still suffering" in ways that recalled Lincoln, Medford said.

## Lincoln Struggled With War

Today, many black Americans "understand the complexity of the man," Medford said. They "are understanding more what Lincoln was about, why he did what he did" as a leader in a more openly racist time in American history.

Newly examined letters show that Lincoln was very concerned about the suffering the Civil War caused. James Cornelius, of the Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, said that the president wrote many letters to families of soldiers during the Civil War. They reveal that he "cared deeply, individually, about each man he sent off to war, and possible death."

The letters reflect Lincoln's "understanding of his duty as commander in chief to every soldier," Cornelius said.
