Animal-rights activists say a macaque monkey who took famous selfie photographs should be declared the legal owner of the photos. They do not believe the nature photographer who set up the camera should be able to control the pictures.

The activists are with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA. They have filed a unique lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco, California. It seeks a court order allowing PETA to make sure any money made from the photos is used to benefit the monkey, 6-year-old Naruto. The money could also benefit other crested macaques living in a reserve on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The island, in Asia, has a population of about 17 million.

The photos were taken during a 2011 trip to Sulawesi by British nature photographer David Slater. He has published a book called "Wildlife Personalities" that includes the "monkey selfie" photos.

## Websites Take Advantage Of Copyright Loophole

However, the photos have been widely distributed elsewhere on websites like Wikipedia and other media outlets. They claim that no one actually owns the images because they were taken by an animal, not a person. Slater is exploring legal action against some of those outlets. He said he was "very saddened" by PETA's lawsuit because he considers himself to be a supporter of animal rights.

Last year, the U.S. Copyright Office, which is part of the federal government, updated its policies. It said it would register copyrights, or legal ownership documents, only for works produced by human beings. It specified that works produced by animals, whether a photo taken by a monkey or a painting by an elephant, would not qualify.

However, Jeffrey Kerr, a lawyer with PETA, said the copyright office policy "is only an opinion." He said the copyright law itself does not limit copyrights to only humans.

"Copyright law is clear," he said. "It's not the person who owns the camera, it's the being who took the photograph."

## Setting Up The Shot Vs. Pressing The Button

The lawsuit refers to Slater's own writings about his meeting with the macaques. The lawsuit claims Naruto "authored the monkey selfies" by using Slater's camera.

Slater has been openly upset by the long dispute over the photos. He says the British copyright obtained for the photos by his company should be honored worldwide.

"The facts are that I was the intellect behind the photos, I set the whole thing up," he said in an email. "A monkey only pressed a button of a camera set up on a tripod â€” a tripod I positioned and held throughout the shoot."

Last year, Slater offered copies of a "monkey selfie" photo to people willing to pay only for shipping and handling. He told buyers he would donate $1.70 per order to a charity that protects Sulawesi's macaques.

## Nature Photographer Hoping To Leave Legacy

But Slater also has defended his right to make money from the photos. He has a 5-year-old daughter and would like to use the money to send her to college one day. "I have very little else to offer her," Slater wrote in his e-mail.

PETA has on occasion filed lawsuits that were widely viewed by other legal experts as offering little chance of success. One example is a 2011 lawsuit accusing SeaWorld's parks of keeping five killer whales in conditions that PETA believes go against the U.S. Constitution's ban on slavery. A federal judge dismissed the suit, saying the slavery ban applied only to humans.

Kerr, the lawyer for PETA, said the group "has a very strong case" this time. He said Naruto should be declared the photo's owner.

Joining PETA in the suit is Antje Engelhardt, a primatologist from Germany who has studied the Sulawesi macaques.

## PETA Suit Standing On Wobbly Legs, Legal Experts Say

David Favre is a Michigan State University law professor who often writes about animal rights. He said by email that the copyright question raised by PETA "is a cutting-edge legal question."

"They have a fair argument," he wrote, "but I would have to say it is an uphill battle."

Cheryl Dancey Balough is a Chicago lawyer who specializes in copyright law. She said a key question is whether Slater contributed enough creativity to the selfies to earn him a copyright.

Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who supports animal rights, expressed doubts about the lawsuit.

He said people who care about animals should focus on more important problems, like animals being needlessly killed or taken advantage of.
