SEATTLE — Bill Lokey planted his ax in the crumbly slope and scanned the cavern with his headlamp. Counting all the ups and downs, he had climbed more than 15,000 feet to get here. The grin on his face said it had been worth it.

Lokey was standing in a large cave below the summit of Mount Rainier, a 14,411-foot-high volcano in Washington state. A ceiling of ice arched 40 feet overhead.

Bigger than a ballroom, the chamber faded into darkness at either end. "We called this the Coliseum," Lokey said. He recognized the cave — he had been there before.

In the early 1970s, Lokey and a group of fellow adventurers explored and mapped the ice caves of Mount Rainier. The caves are not widely known and very few have set foot in them, which is understandable given how difficult and dangerous it is to reach them.

## What Lies Beneath

The caves form as heat rises from the volcano's depths and melts the base of the ice cap that fills Rainier's twin craters. More than 5,000 climbers trudge across those craters every year, but few explore what lies beneath their feet.

In the 70s, Lokey and his team mapped more than a mile of passages in the main crater, only a portion of the vast network of caves thought to exist.

Lokey always hoped to return to study the caves in more detail, and this summer, he finally crossed paths with a dream team of experts who shared his passion. Together, they reached the network of caves in August and, remarkably Lokey found himself back in the Coliseum at the age of 67.

The goal of the expedition was to create the most complete picture yet of the other-worldly landscape. Lokey and his team also hoped to find clues about the volcano's future, and — perhaps — the origins of life.

The earliest description of Rainier's summit caves comes from 1870. General Hazard Stevens and Philemon Van Trump reached the top of the crater late in the day on Aug. 17 of that year. With nightfall approaching, the men took shelter inside the caves.

## Early Explorations

Lou Whittaker and his twin brother Jim, pioneers of Northwest mountaineering, ventured into the caves in 1954 but turned back because they were afraid that the fumes in the caves might be toxic. Lou returned in 1970 with a firefighter's breathing apparatus, and after slipping through a small opening on the south side of the crater, became the next adventurer to see inside the summit caves.

Then, in the 1970s, an expedition called Project Crater set out to explore the caves more closely. Lokey and a group of young mountaineers and scientists camped on the summit for weeks at a time. They used tape measures and compasses to make maps of the passages.

The 2014 expedition, led by Forest Service law enforcement agent Eddy Cartaya, had the benefit of much more modern equipment. Lokey's crew was loaded with winter camping gear, satellite phones and enough food and fuel for more than a week.

Lokey, however, chose to stick to gear he was used to from the 1970s. When he set off on a Monday morning in August, he carried 75 pounds on his back.

The first day of the trek was exhausting. It took seven hours for the 15-person team to reach Camp Muir, a cluster of stone huts nearly two miles above sea level. When they got there, a climbing ranger told them a storm was forecast hit late Tuesday or Wednesday.

## A Storm Hits The Mountain

Cartaya and his group decided to leave right away. Their plan was to try to reach the summit on Tuesday, hoping that the storm would hold off until Wednesday. As it turned out, they would not be that lucky.

On Tuesday afternoon, the sky darkened and pellets of snow began to fall.

"We grabbed our packs and ran for the nearest cave entrance," Cartaya said. There, they made camp for the night, much as Stevens and Van Trump had done more than a hundred years earlier.

Eventually, the storm passed and Cartaya and his team started mapping. Using computers, they would later convert the data that they recorded into a three-dimensional image of the caves.

Meanwhile, Lokey and his group retreated to Camp Muir to avoid another dangerous storm. They considered ending their journey there, but the weather started to improve.

At 2 a.m. Friday, they set out again, and thirteen hours later they reached the caves under sunny skies. Now it was the scientists' turn to go to work.

## When Life First Appeared

U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) researcher Matt Bachmann took air samples, hoping that analyzing the air in the cave could provide information about what gases the volcano was releasing. If Mount Rainier were close to erupting, the earliest warning sign could be a change in these gases.

Microbiologist Zoe Harrold, meanwhile, was there to study what tiny forms of life might be living in the caves. Her findings could be useful for understanding the origins of life on earth.

The combination of volcanic heat and gas, frigid water and icy soil is similar to conditions on Earth when the first living things appeared. It is also what scientists expect the environment to be like on Mars, and on Jupiter's moon Europa — two other places in the solar system where life might be possible.

Understanding life in the caves of Mount Rainier could help explain how life emerged on Earth and where else in the solar system it might thrive.

Lokey spent his two days on the summit assisting the researchers and retracing his steps from 40 years ago. "It's just amazing to be here again," he said, before heading down Sunday. As thrilled as he was, though, he wasn't sure he would be back. This had been his toughest Rainier climb.

If he does climb Mount Rainier again, Lokey said, someone else will have to carry the heavy stuff.
