NOME, Alaska â€” Each year teams of dogsleds and their drivers race across Alaska for nearly 1,000 miles. It's called the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The drivers are known as mushers. The mushers are trying to see who can make it to Nome the fastest. It's now down to the last stages.

Meanwhile, Nome is getting ready. It's just a small frontier town of 3,700 people. But it's famous for being the finish line.

On Sunday, city crews moved the finish line into place. The city trucked in snow. They're building a path for the mushers. The teams are traveling across the ice of the Bering Sea.

"Yeah, I know, it's funny to see people dumping snow on a street instead of taking it off the street," said Greg Bill. He's an organizer of the Iditarod. "To really dress it up and make it safe for the dog teams, we have to spread a layer of snow down for them to run on."

## A Tight Race

About 200 volunteers came to Nome to make last-minute preparations.

Bill McCormick of North Carolina volunteered for his first Iditarod in 1998. He's been back every year since.

"I like being part of putting something on," said the retired engineer. His job as a volunteer in Nome is to drug test the dogs. "I enjoy the people. It's like family now."

Jeff King was leading the race on Sunday. He's already won the Iditarod four times. He was ahead of Aliy Zirkle by 20 minutes. The two arrived at the Elim checkpoint shortly before midnight.

Zirkle is a 44-year-old musher from Two Rivers, Alaska. She was in the lead hours before when she arrived at the village of Koyuk.

King rested his 12-dog team at the checkpoint for three hours and 42 minutes. Zirkle chose to let her 11 dogs take a break for three hours and 44 minutes.

## At The Finish Line

King won the race in 2006. He is trying to win five races. If he succeeds, he'll only be the second musher to do so.

Zirkle has come in second place in the last two years. She is trying to become only the third woman to win the race. And she would be the first woman to win since 1990.

Other front-runners include four-time champion Martin Buser. He arrived in Koyuk in third place at 4:20 p.m. Sunday. He was followed 13 minutes later by 2012 Iditarod champion Dallas Seavey.

The racers are expected to begin arriving in Nome no later than Tuesday. They have two more checkpoints before Nome.

Temperatures in Nome hovered slightly above zero Sunday. Skies were clear and sunny.

The colder temperatures were welcomed by fan Nina Cross of Mississippi. She attended the start of the race last year in Anchorage. She fell in love with the event. After that, she decided she needed to see the finish in person, too.

## "Laugh When They Run"

Cross said she remembers as a child reading about the 1925 serum run. A serum is a medicine. In 1925, the medicine was needed to treat diphtheria. Diphtheria is an infection that affects people's nose and throat. It was spreading in the area and making many people sick. Twenty mushers and 150 sled dogs traveled over 600 miles. They delivered a serum to Nome that cured the diphtheria. The mushers and dogs rescued several towns from the outbreak.

Nome was almost a magical place to her. "It never occurred to me that I would get there some day. So, for me to be here is a real event in my life," she said.

And she loves the dogs.

"Any dogs that can laugh when they run, with their tongues hanging out, they got my heart right now," said Cross.

The race began March 2 with 69 teams. As of Sunday, 16 mushers had dropped out. That left 53 teams on the trail. Long stretches of bare and rocky ground made for an icy, dangerous trail in the early part of the race.

The first to reach Nome receives $50,000 and a new truck. The other teams after that win smaller cash prizes.
