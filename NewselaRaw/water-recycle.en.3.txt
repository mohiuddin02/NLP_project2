PLEASANTON, Calif. — Leon Jung knew he would need to do something unusual to save his dying grass.

Recently he found an answer — recycled toilet water. About a month ago, he went to a sewage treatment plant in Pleasanton and hauled home some of its cleaned-up water.

It is safe to use on lawns and bushes, official say. It is also free. People just have to be willing to take it home in tanks, drums, barrels or jugs.

## People Must Use Less Fresh Water

California is in the fourth year of a terrible drought. In April, California Governor Jerry Brown announced that people must reduce their use of fresh water by 25 percent. People are discouraged from using fresh water on their grass or bushes.

The recycled water station in Pleasanton has become very popular with homeowners. Its waste water is helping them fight the drought.

Two other sewer treatment centers have also started started giving away recycled water. Several others are considering it.

## Waste Water Is Popular

"This water is making a huge difference with my landscaping," said Jung, who lives in Dublin, California. "The lawn got pretty brown and dried out last year during the cutbacks. I worry it would die if I didn't give it this extra help."

Jung said he enjoyed designing his own irrigation system. He strapped two empty barrels to the back of his pickup. Then he attached a plastic pipe to suck up the water. An electric motor shoots the water through a garden hose.

Jung aimed a stream of treated sewage water on his lawn. "I had fun coming up with this," he said.

The waste water service is really popular. More than 610 people have signed up for it. In the last few days, more than 50 have joined as the drought continues and the weather becomes hotter.

"Our service is certainly riding a wave of popularity," said Dan Gallagher. He manages the Dublin San Ramon Services District. It is in charge of the recycled water station in Pleasanton. "I'm awed sometimes when I see so many people using our filling station. It takes a lot of work to bring water home, and pump it on your grounds, and then keep doing it again and again."

## Come And Get It!

The recycled water station opened in July. At the time, it had three water faucets, and workers had no idea whether people would use the water. Now the station has eight water faucets. Another eight will be added soon to keep up with the growing demand. Anyone can take the water, and some people drive in from 30 miles away.

Officials know many people think the idea of using recycled toilet water is yucky. They say people are desperate for water, so they ignore where it comes from.

Sue Stephenson works for Dublin San Ramon spokeswoman. She said the water is completely safe to use. The dirty water goes through several extra treatments to clean it.

Still, people must be careful. Before hauling it away, people must promise not to drink it. They also cannot put it in their swimming pools or water pipes.

Many ball fields and golf course are watered with recycled water. Last year, the Pleasanton center became the first to offer the free water to homeowners.

## Water Giveaway Is Off To A Good Start

Bobbi Larson is the executive director for the California Association of Sanitation Agencies. It includes waste water treatment plants. She said other sewer plants should copy the program.

The water crisis in California is so bad that recycled sewer water will not solve it. However, using recycled water saves fresh water. It also shows people the importance of recycling, experts say.

The Dublin San Ramon center gave out 2.3 million gallons of recycled water to homeowners in 2014. In the first three months of this year, it has given away more than 580,000 gallons. There are about 660,000 gallons in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.

"If the drought ends, I suspect most of our customers will stop using our service," said Gallagher, the manager of the water district. He added that the center will probably not close because many people will still be interested in using the recycled water.
