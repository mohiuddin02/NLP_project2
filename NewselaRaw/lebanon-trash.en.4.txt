BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” It is summer in Beirut, Lebanon. Garbage is piling up in the streets. The city stinks.

Lebanon is a country in the Middle East. It is between Europe, Africa and Asia.

The Lebanese government cannot decide what to do with the garbage.

They may not have much time. The main garbage dump closed two weeks ago.

For 10 days, garbage trucks could not collect the trash. They had nowhere to dump it. The smell got really bad. Some people wore masks to cover their mouths and noses. Piles of trash began growing.

## Hot And Stinky Summer

The temperature is getting higher. The garbage is more stinky. People are getting mad.

Paul Abi Rached is the head of the Lebanese Eco Movement. The group tries to protect the nature in Lebanon. He said the garbage is terrible. He thinks the people in charge should quit.

Some people try to get rid of garbage themselves. They are paying truck owners. The owners are picking up their garbage. Truckers are dumping the garbage at night. No one knows where.

People are dumping garbage in rivers. Some people dig pits to bury smelly garbage. Others burn it in the street. A brown cloud is drifting over the city. The cloud is bad for people's health.

## What To Do?

The country does not recycle. That makes the problem worse.

The government does not seem to be in a hurry. It puts off deciding from one meeting to the next. The garbage piles are still growing.

Antoine Samaha lives in Lebanon. His mother has breathing problems. Antoine might take his mother to live in Paris. Paris is in France, far away from Lebanon. The air is cleaner there.
