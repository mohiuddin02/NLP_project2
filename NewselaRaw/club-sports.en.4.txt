Sixteen-year-old Audrey Dimitrew won a spot on a club volleyball team in Virginia. She hoped high school coaches and even college coaches would notice her.

But then her coach did not give her playing time. The coach said she could switch teams. That is what she decided to do. Then the league told her she could not join another team.

So Audrey and her family went to court to complain that the club team was being unfair. In a court, the judge gets to decide who wins the argument.

## Teams Can Cost A Lot Of Money

Audrey said she could miss an important volleyball season this spring. The league said Audrey is just upset about not getting playing time.

Some parents get upset when their children are cut, benched, yelled at by coaches or even fouled too hard. Lately, many of these parents have been turning to courts for help.

Sports teams are getting more competitive. Parents are giving up entire weekends to bring kids to games.

Parents are also spending thousands of dollars to be on travel teams and play in competitive high school programs. Club teams are expensive. The average travel team parent is spending about $2,300 a year. Parents of the top players might spend $20,000 a year or more.

Audrey's mother said the family will spend about $6,000 on her daughter's volleyball this year.

Parents want proof that the money they are spending is paying off. Some are willing to go to courts for help if they do not get this proof.

## She Just Wants To Play

Audrey said she is not sure if she will play volleyball in college. But her family believes the spring season of 10th grade is an important one. It is a chance to work with coaches who can help her get better.

Audrey cannot understand why she is not allowed to join another team.

The problem began after Audrey and about 75 other girls competed for spots on the same team. The coach told Audrey she was the best at her position of setter. She was told she would get playing time.

When the season began, Audrey got practice play with her team. But she was on the bench for the first two games.

The coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team. The coach also said she would not play much for the rest of the season.

The family was disappointed and confused. They paid a lot of money. Now they felt they had not been given what they were promised.

## Taking The Fun Out Of Playing

The coach gave Audrey two choices: She could be a practice player for the team or transfer to a new team in the league. She decided to transfer. Her parents found a team willing to take her.

The league has to OK changes like this. It would not agree to Audrey's request. It said allowing Audrey to make the switch would set a bad example. It said players can switch teams only if they can prove that they have a really difficult problem.

They are not the only parents complaining. A recent study showed that many parents thought youth sports were too expensive and took up too much time. They also said winning was becoming too important, instead of just having fun.

Audrey will not play this season. But her mother said the fight will continue. She thinks it is the right thing to do.
