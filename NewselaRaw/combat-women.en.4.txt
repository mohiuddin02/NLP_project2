American women will soon be able to fight in wars. The military will no longer ban women from combat. A new poll shows most Americans support the change.

Military leaders told of the decision last week. They said that women already risk their lives in war. They have done so for more than 10 years.

About 14 in 100 U.S. troops are female. The military says 152 women have died serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

## Ban Hurts Careers

Women serve in the Army, Marines, Air Force and Navy. But many jobs have been off-limits to women. They were not allowed to drive a tank. They could not work with cannons and rockets. That will soon change. Many of the banned jobs will open up to women this year.

Military women say that the ban hurt their careers. Combat roles lead to better jobs in the military.

Major Mary Jennings Hegar served in the war in Afghanistan. She was rescuing wounded soldiers when her helicopter was attacked. She was shot in the arm and leg. She shot back. She held back the enemy. The wounded were taken safely from the area.

Hegar received the Purple Heart for being injured. She got another medal for heroism and bravery. But Hegar wanted more than medals. She wanted a promotion. The Air Force said she had not really served in combat. They would not let her have a leadership role.

## In War, No One's Safe

Military experts say war is changing. In the past, one army met another on a battlefield. Today, the U.S. military usually faces small groups of fighters. Those fighters plant roadside bombs. They may disguise themselves as civilians. They often attack non-military targets. Soldiers doing any job must be ready to fight at all times. Driving a truck, helping wounded people, or even sorting mail can be dangerous.

Linda Brashears was in the Army. She was injured in Iraq. Brashears said she would not have wanted a combat job. But she thinks other women do.

"A lot of people think we should still be sitting behind a desk," Brashears told USA Today. "But the world is changing."

In fact, not many people do think female troops should only have desk jobs.

Two out of three people in a poll said women should be allowed to fight. Just over one in four said they should not.

Almost one in three people in the poll said allowing women to fight would make the military better. Almost half said it would be the same. Only 15 out of 100 people said that having women in combat would hurt the military.

## Counting Pushups

Why are people against the change? They feel women are not strong enough for combat.

John McCain serves in the Senate. He fought in the Vietnam War. He supports the change. But he said he had some concerns.

"We must keep the same high standards that have made the American military the most feared and admired fighting force in the world," McCain said.

Army Staff Sergeant Jennifer Hunt was hurt when a roadside bomb blew up her vehicle. "Right before the [bomb] went off, it didn't ask me how many pushups or situps I could do," Hunt told The Wall Street Journal.

Troops who fight must pass a fitness test. The New York Times reports that the military does not plan to change the test. Army men and women must do the same number of situps to pass the test. Women can pass with fewer pullups than men. They can pass by running a slower 2-mile run than men.

## What's The Fuss?

Tammy Duckworth serves in Congress. She used to be an Army helicopter pilot. She lost both legs in Iraq. She told National Public Radio that the ban reminds her of the past. She noted that black soldiers once could not serve alongside whites. Japanese-American troops were once put in their own units, too.

"Down the road, we're going to look back â€¦ and say, boy, that was a lot of fuss over nothing," Duckworth said.
