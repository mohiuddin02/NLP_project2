### PRO: We should know everything about what we eat

Health and food safety are scary subjects for Americans. They should be.

Surveys ask Americans what they think. They show Americans are alarmed over what is in their food. Americans are especially worried about genetically modified organisms. They are called GMOs for short.

GMOs are plant or animal products. They have been created by scientists in a lab. They use DNA from bacteria, viruses or other plants and animals. The purpose is to make better seeds. GMO seeds grow more crops. The crops keep away insects. They can also grow in low rainfall.

A survey found that 9 out of 10 Americans want GMOs labeled. It is time to do it. Already, 64 countries require such labels.

## State Fights Over GMO Labels

Two-thirds of Americans think GMOs are unsafe. Millions of Americans are switching. They are starting to buy non-GMO, organic foods and drinks. The products are labeled "organic," "non-GMO" or "natural."

GMO labeling laws were voted on in California, Washington and Oregon. The big food companies like Coca-Cola spent millions of dollars there. They wanted to get voters to change their minds. Chemical companies did, too. Monsanto is the world's largest maker of GMO seeds. It spent millions in those states. The companies won. They stopped the labeling laws.

Vermont, Maine and Connecticut did pass laws. GMO labels are required in those states.

Vermont's GMO labeling law starts in July 2016. Already, food brands are scared. They have to make a choice. One thing they could do is to stop using GMO ingredients in their products. That is exactly what happened in Europe. In 1998, GMO food labels became required in many countries there. Food companies in Europe stopped using GMOs.

Food companies have one other choice. They could add a GMO label on their packages and bottles.

Eight out of every 10 foods in supermarkets contain GMOs. They also contain toxic chemicals. They are sprayed on GMO crops.

## Pesticides Sprayed On Our Food

The World Health Organization of the United Nations (WHO) studies health problems. This year, it looked into Monsanto's Roundup herbicide. It kills weeds. It is made from glyphosate. The WHO said it probably causes cancer.

The WHO's decision caused changes in dozens of countries. Now, many stopped using GMOs in farming.

In the United States, glyphosate herbicide is sprayed on most GMO crops. Corn, wheat, beans and rice are all sprayed with it.

The U.S. government has said that glyphosate can hurt humans. It can damage major organs.

Glyphosate and other pesticides are being sprayed on our food. They prevent insects from eating crops. Chemical fertilizers are added to crops, too. They help crops grow, sure. Yet they pollute the environment, too.

GMO crops are destroying our health. The chemicals added to them make it worse. They also poison our soil, waters and air.

## Congress Looking At New Law

Americans want GMO labeling. Unfortunately, Monsanto and food companies do not want that. Lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are helping them out. They get money from these companies.

Right now, Congress is talking about a new law. It would stop states from putting labels on GMO foods.

The law would also let GMO foods be labeled as "natural." This is wrong.

Americans can help stop this law from passing. Tell Congress you want labels on GMOs.

### CON: We do not need to put GMO on labels

Labeling genetically modified organism (GMO) foods is not about food safety. No humans have ever been harmed by them. GMO foods and regular foods are the same. There is no scientific difference between them.

By the year 2025, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says that two-thirds of the world's people will run low on water. Growing food will become harder.

GMO foods can help save our food supply. They let fields be plowed less. This allows the soil to stay moist. Then plants keep more water.

GMOs help grow much more crops. Right now, 1 person in every 9 does not have enough to eat on this planet. GMO foods can help.

## GMOs Help, Not Hurt, Us

GMO foods help in another way. One study found that they reduced the amount of pesticides by one-third. They also saved money. Pesticides get a bad rap. They do not deserve it. The truth is that there are only tiny amounts of pesticides in the foods you eat. You are totally safe.

As one scientist put it, there are more cancer-causing substances in a cup of coffee than in all the pesticides you eat and drink in a year. That does not mean that coffee will give you cancer. It just means that there are very few pesticides in what we eat and drink.

Farmers grow more food through GMOs. Then the price of our food drops. That is a good thing for people who do not have much money.

It is amazing people are even fighting over GMOs. People have been changing food genes forever. GMO crops are just a newer way of doing it. Natural plant breeding began over 8,000 years ago. Back then, farmers bred plants. They chose the best ones to save for planting in the following year. The corn we eat today, for example, came from that. GMO foods just use modern technology.

GMO foods also help scientists fix problems in crops. GMO crops make foods that keep better. They spoil less. They do not cause allergies. They can even grow medicines in them.

Take the example of Golden Rice. It is a GMO food. It has beta carotene inside it. Also called Vitamin A, it helps to reduce blindness. It even prevents up to 2 million deaths each year in poor countries.

## It Would Cost A Lot Of Money

Labeling GMO products would be expensive. It could also scare away companies. They would spend less money improving GMO technology.

Labels will cost food makers more. That will force them to raise food prices. Many people cannot afford that.

Those who want to buy non-GM foods can buy organic. However, organic foods are not safe. Organic foods are much more likely to be contaminated with microbes. They actually put you more at risk.
