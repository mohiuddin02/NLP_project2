SEATTLE — Some houses have flowers as a centerpiece on the dining room table. Yet in the McConnaughey house, on Whidbey Island in Puget Sound, the table has a robot sitting at its center.

Three teenage girls question whether their robot will be ready for its next challenge. Snacking on guacamole and chips, Hannah, Haley and Annika begin pulling apart the robot.

Something doesn't feel right.

Haley McConnaughey, 14, explains the advanced mathematical equations she did to figure out the dimensions for the blades on the robot's propellers. Older sister Hannah quickly wipes away some guacamole that landed on the robot.

## Underwater Rescue Challenge

The team asks themselves again: Can their underwater robot save a 200-pound diver trapped at sea?

That was the task at hand as they were preparing to leave for the upcoming Black Sea International ROV Competition and Exhibition in Romania — which is the largest underwater robotics competition in Europe. Teams from all over the world will compete to see whose robot can rescue an underwater mannequin diver and defuse an underwater mine. The top three will be taken out to a real shipwreck, where their robots must find and bring back hidden treasure.

"The fact I get to do this before I have my driver's license is crazy," said Hannah, 17, who also was picked to deliver the opening speech at the competition.

The only U.S. team in the competition, they will face high school and college underwater robotic teams from Egypt, India, Iran, Poland, Russia and Romania.

"We went from middle schoolers to representatives of the United States," Haley said.

"It's incredible how much your life can change in three months," said Annika Hustard, who recently joined the team and competed in her first robotics competition in May. The competition in Romania ends on Aug. 20.

## Long Summer Project

The girls have spent their summer working 12- to 14-hour days on their robot.

"This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience," Haley said. "All the things we could do this summer will be here next summer."

Each has a different motivation.

Annika, 13, has been obsessed with math and science since she was in kindergarten.

She wants to be a part of "innovation that can help so many people."

Haley, who learned pre-algebra at 8, said she is fascinated with the ocean.

"I want to be one of the building blocks of ocean exploration," she said. "People say space is the last frontier; actually, the ocean is the last frontier."

Hannah — who was reciting William Shakespeare at the age of 6 — likes to win, at everything.

She aspires to one day be CEO of just about anything.

She wants to end the idea that "girls aren't good at math and science," she said. "We want to give somebody the confidence to try it (robotics) for themselves, even if they don't know anyone else doing it."

## Robot On A Budget

The teens have rebuilt the ROV (remotely operated vehicle) three times within about a month.

With a budget of about $500, their robot is made of donated items and whatever they had lying around.

They use PVC, or plastic pipes, found at any hardware store; an old printer feeder is used as gears; the hand is a comb used to groom horses; the lights are LED strips used to light pools; and a bicycle inner tube, cooking racks and pool "noodles" keep the robot floating.

"To keep costs and time down, you take the things you have and then you adapt them to what you need. That's inventing," said Del Hardesty, 64, a former satellite-communications engineer who advises the team.

The team was supposed to be an after-school neighborhood nerd club, then turned into a winning international underwater robotics team. It formed a few years ago with elementary and middle school children, then started beating high schoolers.

It wasn't easy. Sometimes their robot would die 10 minutes before competition.

"They would go one step forward and three steps back for months," said Ashley McConnaughey, mother of Hannah and Haley.

## Girls Make A Point About Math And Science

At the 2012 MATE ROV Competition, where Hannah and Haley were on the team, the robot blew a fuse, which stopped the team from advancing to the international.

The following year, with renewed focus, the girls went on to win first place in the Pacific Northwest, and 11th in the world.

The girls — who raised the money for their trip to Romania — aren't in it just for themselves. They want to encourage other girls to take an interest in science, engineering and math. They appear at county fairs with their robot.

During a recent appearance, they noticed, "The boys will rip the controller out of your hands, while a lot of the girls were a lot more reticent," Hannah McConnaughey said.

"Everything we are doing proves girls can do exactly what guys can do, and better," Annika said.

The team's outreach has led to about 12 robotic teams forming in the south end of Whidbey Island.

"I think it's extraordinary that you can make so much of a change with a little bit of inspiration, a few friends and a lot of PVC," Annika said.
