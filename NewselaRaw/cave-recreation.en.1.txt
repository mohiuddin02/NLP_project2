PRIVAS, France — In 1994, Jean-Marie Chauvet noticed air whistling out from a crack in the rock in southern France, so he and other explorers went to investigate.

What they found that Sunday still fills Chauvet's voice with wonder: an immense cave covered with prehistoric paintings of horses, mammoths and rhinos. The paintings were so vivid, he says, it felt like the Stone Age artists had just moments ago put down their red ochre paint and walked away.

The discovery of the long-hidden artwork created a sensation, but the site was quickly closed to the public. Just by breathing, tourists could destroy the images.

## It's As If The Paintings Are Fresh

Most modern humans will never get to see the masterpieces in what is known as the Chauvet Cave. Recently, scientists, artists and the French government have spent about $60 million and several years of work to create the next best thing, a near-exact replica of the cave. The replica, which is about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away, includes more than 400 paintings of horses, bears, rhinoceroses and mammoths, handprints and carvings. Experts even recreated stalactite and stalagmite rock formations from the original site, as well as the cool temperatures and thick smell of humidity.

French President Francois Hollande unveiled the site Friday, and it opens to the public later this month.

In an interview, Chauvet described digging through narrow passageways and guiding a flashlight in the blackness until one of his fellow explorers came across "the two lines of red ochre. That's when it started."

"What impressed us," Chauvet said, "was the freshness."

Chauvet said: "The paintings are as if they had just left, these men, these women" who painted them. "And the deeper you go, the more grandiose. It's really an art gallery."

## Like Being Sealed In A Jar

It turned out that the cave paintings had been remarkably well-preserved thanks to a rock fall about 23,000 years ago that concealed the entrance. The drawings were in such perfect condition that some researchers doubted their authenticity.

"This cave wasn't exposed to gusts of violent air," Chauvet said. "It was preserved, like in a jar."

Questions surrounded the exact date of the paintings, now widely believed to be between 30,000 and 37,000 years old. At the time of their discovery, they were the oldest known human cave drawings. Since then, scientists have determined that cave drawings in El Castillo, Spain, were painted at least 40,000 years ago.

Chauvet fought years of legal battles against the French government over rights to the discovery, and is still seeking payments for pictures he took of the cave. Officials with the Culture Ministry were convicted of falsifying documents to make it look like Chauvet was on official duty when he found it. Chauvet, who worked for the ministry, insists he was on vacation at the time.

## Cave Is Protected By UNESCO

Today, the cave is officially called the Pont D'Arc Cavern and does not officially bear the discoverers' names, to Chauvet's dismay.

Authorities say they are putting the public's interest first.

Pascal Terrasse, who is in charge of the replica project, described being the first government official to enter the original cave soon after the discovery. "We understood that we had to quickly protect it, and ensure that it was never opened to the public" to protect it from visitors, he said.

Experts have recorded more than 1,000 images from the walls of the cave, inscribed last year on UNESCO's World Heritage List. UNESCO stands for the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization. German filmmaker Werner Herzog brought the original cave alive in a 3-D film, "Cave of Forgotten Dreams."

The replica of Chauvet's Cave tries to reproduce as much of the original as possible. Millimeter by millimeter, scientists and artists used the same tools and techniques believed to have been used in the Stone Age.

## Bringing Prehistory Alive

It feels strange at first, a bit like an amusement park. But a replica of the 18,000-year-old cave drawings in the Lascaux caves in southwest France draws about 300,000 visitors yearly.

Organizers are hoping for similar crowds at the replica Pont d'Arc Cavern opening this month in this beautiful but little-traveled corner of southeast France.

The next step, Terrasse said, could be "a virtual version, 3-D, something that could move around" — and bring prehistory to the generations of the future.
