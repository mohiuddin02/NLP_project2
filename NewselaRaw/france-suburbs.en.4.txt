PARIS â€” Gunmen killed 12 people in France in January. It was a shocking attack. The gunmen were born in France, but were from immigrant families. The men said they were Muslims. They were angry at cartoons in a paper that showed the Muslim Prophet Muhammad.

People of all colors and races live in France. The French government thinks it knows why many immigrants or people of different religions are angry. They do not feel like they belong.

So the French government is making changes. It plans to steer children away from hateful messages in online videos. The government wants children to learn French values.

## One Moment Of Silence

Prime Minister Manuel Valls worries that the French people are becoming divided. He said this divide could be seen most in the "banlieues." Banlieues are the suburbs outside cities. Many of those outside Paris have housing projects. Some of France's poorest people live there. They or their families may have come from foreign countries. Many are Muslims. The gunmen came from these neighborhoods. Some people in the banlieues may not feel like they are French.

Some children did not want to take part in a moment of silence for those who died. It did not mean they were for the attacks. Many people living outside Paris said they understood how they felt.

"People were killed in the housing projects by police, and there was no minute of silence for them," said Aly Sacko. He is a Muslim. His family is from Africa but he was born in France. He lives in a banlieue where two teenagers were killed in 2005. They were running from police in the projects and were electrocuted in the train station. Their deaths set off protests across the country.

## Teaching About Freedom And Values

The government's new plan is to work with schools. Prime Minister Valls thinks they are important places to spread French ideas like freedom and treating everyone the same.

School teachers will be trained. They will teach students to be better citizens and about what being French means.

Poor families will get more money to help with school costs.

Children will be taught to tell the difference between facts and the messages in videos and articles sent out online by extremist Muslim groups. Some schools will be asked to start their own radio programs and newspapers.

France has tried some of these ideas to deal with the projects before.

Protests first broke out in 1990. The anger continued. In 2005 there were huge protests in the projects. Many people in the projects did not have jobs. Crime was high. It was hard to get to buses and trains to go to work.

Some doctors and postal workers refuse to go into certain projects. Even the police are very careful when going into them.

## Small Improvements

The last president tried to fix the projects in 2008. Students who had dropped out could go to "second-chance schools." There would be help for young men and women wanting to start a company. Or learn to find jobs. More police would be hired.

Then France's government ran low on money. The plan was changed.

Some things improved after the 2005 protests. The buildings in one of the worst projects in Paris were torn down. Nice townhouses were built in their place.

Samir Ouahfi works in a cafe in a project. The 29-year-old had no hope that anything would change.

They talk about everyone being equal and brotherhood, he said. But here in the projects, he added, "there isn't any."
