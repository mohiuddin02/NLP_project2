It waters the farms that grow most of the greens Americans eat. If you eat salads in winter, some of the greens probably came from the city of Yuma.

The government takes care of the river. It built canals to take its water to farms. It built dams on the river to make electricity.

People in seven states get their water from the Colorado River. They need the river. Unfortunately, they cannot depend on the river forever. The area has been hit by a drought. There has not been enough rain or snow for 16 years. Government officials say soon, they will have to cut back the water supply.

## River Takes Water To Farms, Dams, Cities

Few rivers work as hard as the Colorado. It takes water to ranches in Colorado and cities in that state, like Denver. Las Vegas and parts of Nevada get almost all of their water from the river. The Hoover Dam turns its water flow into electricity.

Arizona would suffer the worst if the water is cut back. Cities like Phoenix may have to stop putting up as many new buildings. The farmers in Yuma may not suffer though. The water rules are in their favor.

The drought has everyone talking. People all want the water from the Colorado. Arizona shares its water with six other states. California would not suffer right away. It made a deal with Arizona in 1968. The deal means Arizona cities could get much less water, but Yuma would be fine. Farms in Yuma have the oldest water rights in Arizona. It gives them the right to more water than Phoenix and Tucson.

## Yuma Farmers Worried About The Future

All the talk bothers the farmers in Yuma. They know they have rights to the water but worry that government leaders will not defend them. The farmers feel they have a target on their backs, and they are right, said Tom Buschatzke. He is in charge of water in Arizona.

The farmers say they will not go quietly. Their families were here before the big cities of the Southwest were built.

Mark Smith is a farmer in Yuma. He said the farmers have a right to the water because they grow greens for the whole country.

## Sides Must Work Together To Solve Problem

All sides know they have to work together. Farmers in Yuma say they have cut their water use. The farmers also say the cities were allowed to grow without worrying about how much water they used.

Edward C. Cuming arrived in Yuma in the summer of 1902. He farmed 160 acres with water from the river. The government improved the canals across Yuma during the 1930s. One canal is called the Cuming Canal. The canal still runs directly in front of the fields owned by his grandson, Jim Cuming.

Cuming said farmers were thought of as the good guys when there was plenty of water. Now they are being called villains. Farmers are just using water to grow fruit and vegetables that the whole country needs, Cuming said.
