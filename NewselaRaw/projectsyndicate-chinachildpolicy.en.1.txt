LONDON, England – In the late 1970s, the Chinese government established a one-child policy in order to limit population growth. For almost four decades, families in China were only permitted to have one child. That policy has changed, now that lawmakers passed a law allowing families to have up to two children.

## An Imbalanced Population

The social and economic consequences of the one-child policy have been dramatic. The rule reduced the average fertility rate for families living in cities from about three children per family in 1970 to just over one by 1982. By limiting the number of newborns, the policy has resulted in an imbalanced population, with more old people than young people.  

The question now is whether the country's new policy will undo the effects of the one-child policy. The consequences of the new two-children policy are likely to be just as dramatic, and much more positive.

## An Economic Boost?

The greatest benefits of the two-child policy will take time to appear, but some effects will become apparent soon. One major effect has to do with family spending and the Chinese economy. The new policy will likely lead to an increase in the number of children per household, which in turn will cause families to spend more money. This will mean that less money in China is saved and more is spent, boosting the country's economy.

Currently, the amount of money that is saved in China is unusually high, which some people think has negative economic effects worldwide, because China buys few goods from other countries. Moreover, the fact that Chinese people save so much of their money is a major obstacle for the country's economy. It forces Chinese companies to focus on selling goods to other countries, rather than selling goods and services within the country. The two-child policy could change this if it causes families to start spending more.

## Aging Population Gets Shot Of Youth

The two-child policy will also change the balance of China's aging population. In 1970, 51 percent of people were under the age of 20, but in 2010, thanks in part to the one-child policy, only 27 percent were under 20\. Meanwhile, the share of people aged 60 and up rose from 7 percent to 14 percent.

This has put pressure on today's younger generation, because as more and more elderly people retire, there are not enough working people to support them. For years, parents in China could only have one child. As a result, each adult born under the one-child policy will have to support two parents, without any help from siblings. 

## Bringing Balance To The Labor Force

When the two-child generation becomes middle-aged, its members will each have to support only one elderly person, on average. This will restore some balance to China's population and economy. It will take a few decades, though, for children born under the new policy to start working. In the meantime, the post-1980s one-child generation will be supporting not only the elderly, but also a higher number of young people.

Although this will undoubtedly be tough for the one-child generation, increased spending will have immediate positive effects on the economy. Families with two children will have little choice but to spend much more than families with only one child. Economists can estimate how big a difference a second child makes by looking at how much money families with twins spent in recent years.

##  Piggy Banks To Slim Down? 

Under the one-child law, some mothers ended up with two children instead of one when they gave birth to twins. In 2009, families who lived in cities and had twins saved 13 percent of their incomes, on average. In contrast, one-child families in cities saved an average of 21 percent of their incomes. In other words, having a second child meant that the parents of twins saved less of their money and spent more of it.

The added spending will undoubtedly affect some parts of the economy more than others. At first, the surge in the number of children will mean higher sales of children's books, toys, and bicycles. As that generation ages, demand for housing, life insurance, and medications will increase substantially.

## Paying For School

One of the biggest impacts of the new policy will be spending on education. According to a 2009 survey of families living in cities, a one-child household in China spends an average of 11 percent of its total income on education, whereas a household with twins spends 17 percent. As the number of households with two children increases, this change alone could increase spending significantly.

There is, however, a catch. Having more children also means that families are likely to spend less per child on education. Most Chinese families under the old policy focused all of their resources on a single child. Having two children forces families to divide their resources, so the new two-child policy may mean that kids will start growing up with less support from their parents, on average. Indeed, the average twin in China receives far less support after age 15 than the average only child, creating large differences in education outcomes.

Nonetheless, China's shift to a two-child policy is badly needed. Not only will it achieve the long-term goal of balancing the country's aging population, but it will also lead to increased spending, giving the economy a major boost.
