ROME — Crews have pulled the cruise ship Costa Concordia from the rocks off the Italian island where it sank. The shipped had been wrecked upon the rocks for the last 20 months. It is set to be removed from the shoreline by mid-2014, experts said Tuesday.

The operation to straighten the 300-meter, 114,000-ton ship took 19 hours. Engineers had hoped it could be done in 10 to 12 hours. But getting it right was more important that doing it fast. The ship is longer than three football fields and weighs more than 28,000 elephants.

"I am relieved and I am a bit tired. I will have a beer and go to sleep. I am sending a kiss to my wife," the South African-born Nick Sloane said as he emerged from the barge from which he commanded the operation. He is in charge of pulling the wreck out of the sea.

The body of the ship was lifted using steel cables and tanks. They were attached to the side that was above water. The tanks were filled with water. They weight of the tanks helped pull up the wreck.

## Next, Refloating The Ship

Engineers planned to inspect the muddy brown side that came out of the water. It was badly misshapen. The idea is to attach tanks on that side. Then the tanks will be filled with air to help the ship float again.

Once it is floating, the Concordia was expected to be towed to a port to be taken apart. Franco Porcellacchia is an engineer overseeing the operations. He works for Costa Crociere, the company that owns the ship. He was sure it could all be done in the first half of next year. Work cannot be done faster because it is difficult to operate during the winter.

Straightening the Concordia was a major engineering project. The risk was that the rusting hull could snap or sink entirely. Then the ship could not be saved, or salvaged. The waters surrounding the wreck could have been badly polluted. It would have been a disaster.

"It could not have gone any better," Porcellacchia said. Italian Civil Protection agency chief Franco Gabrielli attacked people who thought the worst would happen. Some thought a lot of sewage would have been released from the ship.

Instead, poisonous liquids were not released. Fuel was removed from the Concordia two months after its shipwreck. Still, leftover fuel, chemicals and rotting food were thought to have dirtied the seawater inside the body of the ship.

## Sirens Blare As Ship Righted

Salvage team members hugged as the straightening was completed. Sirens in the port of Giglio blared in celebration. Giglio is a tiny port city where the Concordia ran aground.

All those working on the rescue "are a great (source) of Italian pride," Prime Minister Enrico Letta wrote on Twitter. He invited Gabrielli and others for a meeting in Rome.

The sinking of the Concordia has been a national shame. It was blamed on the irresponsible behavior of its Italian captain, Francesco Schettino. The image of the half-sunken ship was also associated with the state of the country. Italy has had bad money problems.

Insurers for Costa are paying for the salvage operation, which is the first of its kind. The cost is estimated at more than $800 million. More than 500 people from 26 nations are working on salvaging the ship. Costa is an Italian unit of Carnival, a U.S.-based cruise line company.

The Concordia crashed against a reef on Jan. 12, 2012. Thirty-two of the 4,229 people on board died and two victims — an Indian waiter and an Italian passenger — are still missing. Rescuers were expected to board the vessel to look for their remains.

## Captain Had Abandoned His Ship

Schettino is being tried for serious crimes. He was due to next appear in court on Sept. 23.

The disgraced captain is accused of having taken the ship dangerously close to the shore to perform a stunt. He also is accused of badly mishandling the emergency on the night of the disaster. He left the Concordia before all passengers had been evacuated.

Four other crew members and a Costa Crociere boss were given jail terms ranging from 18 to 34 months. But they do not have to serve the sentences. They agreed to admit to their crimes. Costa Crociere was fined $1.33 million in another plea deal in April.
