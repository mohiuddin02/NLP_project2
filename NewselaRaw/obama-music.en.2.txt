WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Barack Obama can be a pretty soulful guy. He has sung Al Green's 1972 hit "Let's Stay Together," and led a church group through the hymn "Amazing Grace." He has even tweeted his Spotify music playlist.

The president and his wife, Michelle, also have prominently featured such R&B and soul talent as Patti LaBelle and B.B. King during state dinners and music history events. These musicians have even been featured during the annual Easter Egg Roll.

The latest episode of the television series "In Performance at the White House" celebrated the history of American music. It included performances by Queen Latifah, Smokey Robinson, Usher, Trombone Shorty, and Esperanza Spalding, among others. The program will be on public television stations on Jan. 8.

## President, First Lady Want To Support Hard-Working Artists

Spalding landed on the first lady's Spotify music playlist. Stevie Wonder and Nina Simone are included on the president's list. Spalding is a Grammy Award-winning jazz singer and bass player. She said the variety of musicians who have performed at the White House sends a message that everyone is included at what the Obamas have called the "People's House."

She said the Obamas want "to really support artists who are working hard — not just in their craft — but communicating about the issues of our time," said Spalding. She is an advocate for human rights issues at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Since 2002, it has held enemy fighters from the war in Afghanistan. Very few have been charged with a crime or appeared in court.

Spalding said the Obamas believe that "just because you're not famous, doesn't mean you're not important. Everybody that is committed to their art" is an important part of American music. Spalding has trained student musicians at a White House workshop.

## White House Staffers Approve The List

Dalton Delan is an executive producer for "In Performance at the White House." WETA, a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) station, produces the series. He said that for the most part, the station chooses artists based on the show's theme. Staff members at the White House approve the list.

Delan said he can suggest a show, but the Obamas have to want to come and see it.

He also talked with White House official Deesha Dyer on the best hip-hop artists. She suggested female rap pioneer MC Lyte.

## Obamas Have Broad Musical Tastes

The Obamas' musical tastes are reflected in White House entertainment over the years. They include "Queen of hip hop and soul" Mary J. Blige, R&B singer John Legend and jazz pianist Herbie Hancock. They have all entertained heads of foreign governments at Obama state dinners.

Pop superstar Beyonce is another favorite of both the president and first lady. She sang at an inauguration ball after Obama was sworn in as president in 2009 and at a state dinner for the Mexican president in 2010. She also performed the national anthem at Obama's second inauguration ceremony in 2013.

"Queen of Soul" Aretha Franklin has also appeared at several presidential events. She sang "My Country 'Tis of Thee" at Obama's first inauguration ceremony in 2009. Earlier this year, Franklin performed at a White House concert celebrating gospel music from African-American churches. She also put in a surprise appearance at the Justice Department to help bid farewell to Obama's good friend, Attorney General Eric Holder, when he left office.

## Main Goal Is Pleasing The President, First Lady

Desiree Rogers was the first Obama social secretary, and she had the job of organizing dinners and other events at the White House. She said a combination of factors go into choosing entertainment for White House events. Rogers would consider the first lady's input, the president's favorites and suggestions from White House staff members.

For state dinners, Rogers said the White House considers the country being honored. She said a main goal is to always keep in mind the tastes of the president and first lady "to ensure that it is someone they might enjoy." The Obamas also enjoy showcasing talented American performers from different backgrounds.

## Different Presidents, Different Choices

Lea Berman was a social secretary for President George W. Bush. She said each president's staff chooses entertainers differently.

"Sometimes the Bushes would have suggestions of people they wanted to invite to perform," Berman said. Other times, "I would come up with a few names for Mrs. Bush to consider for an event, and she would choose one."

Berman said many times it's a matter of which performers are available.

Frequently, entertainers cannot appear at an event because they are already performing somewhere else that day.
