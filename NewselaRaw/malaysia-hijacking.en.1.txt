KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — The Malaysian jetliner that has been missing for more than a week was diverted from its path on purpose. A Malaysian leader said in a statement on Saturday that the plane continued flying for more than six hours after cutting off contact with the ground. Now, investigators believe that the plane could have gone as far northwest as Kazakhstan or into the southern end of the Indian Ocean.

Prime Minister Najib Razak's statement confirmed days of rising speculation that the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 to Beijing was not an accident. It also refocused the investigation into the flight's 12-person crew and 227 passengers.

"Clearly the search for MH370 has entered a new phase," Najib said at a news conference.

Najib stressed that investigators were looking into all possibilities as to why the Boeing 777 ended up so far away from its original flight path. He said authorities could not confirm whether it was a hijacking. Earlier Saturday, a Malaysian official said the plane had been hijacked, but he added that investigators hadn't found a motive and no demands had been made known.

## Plane's Turn To West

"In view of this latest development, the Malaysian authorities have refocused their investigation into the crew and passengers on board," Najib told reporters.

Police on Saturday went to the Kuala Lumpur homes of both the pilot and co-pilot of the missing plane.

Experts have previously said that whoever disabled the plane's communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience. One possibility they have raised was that one of the pilots wanted to commit suicide.

The plane departed for an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing at 12:40 a.m. on March 8. Its communications with civilian air controllers were cut off at about 1:20 a.m., and the jet disappeared. It is now one of the most puzzling mysteries in modern aviation history.

China, where many of the passengers were from, expressed irritation over what it described as Malaysia's foot-dragging in releasing information about the search.

Investigators are now fairly certain that one of the plane's communications systems — the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System — was disabled before the aircraft reached the east coast of Malaysia, Najib said. Shortly afterward, someone on board switched off the aircraft's transponder. The transponder would allow the pilot to communicate with civilian air traffic controllers.

Najib confirmed that Malaysian air force defense radar picked up traces of the plane turning back to the west. It crossed over Peninsular Malaysia into the northern stretches of the Strait of Malacca. Authorities previously had said this radar data could not be verified.

Although the aircraft was flying virtually blind to air traffic controllers at this point, onboard equipment continued to send "pings" to satellites.

## Time Of Last Contact Changed

The prime minister said the last confirmed signal between the plane and a satellite came at 8:11 a.m. — 7 hours and 31 minutes after takeoff. This was more than five hours later than the previous time given by Malaysian authorities as the possible last contact.

Airline officials have said the plane had enough fuel to fly for up to about eight hours.

"The investigations team is making further calculations which will indicate how far the aircraft may have flown after this last point of contact," Najib said.

He said authorities had determined that the plane's last communication with a satellite was in one of two possible arcs, or "corridors." There was one near northern Thailand through to the border of the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern one from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.

If the plane took the northern route, it could have taken the plane through China, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan — which hosts U.S. military bases — and Central Asia. If it did this, it is unclear how it might have gone undetected. The region is also home to extremist Islamic groups, unstable governments and remote, sparsely populated areas.

Flying south would have put the plane over the Indian Ocean. The ocean is 12,762 feet deep on average and thousands of miles from land.

Britain-based aviation security expert Chris Yates thought it was highly unlikely the plane took the northern route across land in Asia. Military aircraft from those countries would have tracked the plane, he said.

Najib said search efforts in the South China Sea, where the plane first lost contact, had ended.

## 14 Countries Involved In Search

Indian officials said navy ships supported by planes and helicopters scoured Andaman Sea islands for a third day on Saturday. Still, they had no success in finding evidence of the missing jet.

Two-thirds of the plane's passengers were Chinese, and China's government has been under pressure to give relatives firm news of the aircraft's fate.

The Chinese government's Xinhua News Agency said the Malaysian information was "painfully belated" — or slow. It was resulting in wasted efforts and straining the nerves of relatives, the agency added.

Najib said he understood the need for families to receive information, but that his government wanted to release only fully corroborated reports. He said his country has been sharing information with international investigators, even when it meant placing "national security concerns" second to the search. U.S., British and Malaysian air safety investigators have been on the ground in Malaysia to assist with the investigation.

In the Chinese capital, relatives of passengers who have anxiously awaited news at a hotel near Beijing's airport said they felt deceived. They thought they should have been told about the plane's last signal earlier.

Malaysian police have already said they are looking at the mental state, family life and connections of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27. Both have been described as respectable, community-minded men.

Fourteen countries are involved in the search for the plane, using 43 ships and 58 aircraft.
