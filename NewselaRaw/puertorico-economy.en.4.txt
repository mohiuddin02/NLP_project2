SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico â€” Yessenia Puente lives in Puerto Rico. It is her home. But she does not like living there anymore.

The schools are not safe for her three children. She does not make enough money to send them to safer schools. Half the time, she has no water at home. It has not rained enough in Puerto Rico. People are only allowed to use a little water.

## Time To Move

The leaders of Puerto Rico said people had to pay more money for things. That is why Yessenia decided to move.

A truck came to her home. It picked up her things.

"With everything happening now, I decided it's time to go," said Yessenia.

Many other people are saying goodbye to Puerto Rico. They will start new lives somewhere else.

Puerto Rico is a large island in the Caribbean Sea. People there speak Spanish and use U.S. dollars. It is part of the United States, but it is not a state. Puerto Rican people are allowed to live in any U.S. state they want. Yessenia decided to move to Florida.

## Big Money Problems

Puerto Rico is poor. It has borrowed lots of money. The money was used to pay for things like buildings and roads. It does not have enough money to pay everyone back.

Puerto Rico's leaders say they cannot fix the money problems. They are trying to come up with answers.

President Barack Obama says he will not give Puerto Rico the money it needs. Other leaders in Washington want to help.

Some people who live in Puerto Rico are trying to fix the money problems. They are trying to find answers. It is not easy.
