ROCK HILL, S.C. — On Wednesday, a judge tossed out the 54-year-old convictions of nine South Carolina black men. Known as the Friendship 9, the men had challenged Jim Crow laws. The laws segregated — or separated — blacks and whites, and kept blacks out of many public places. The "crime" the Friendship 9 had been convicted of was the simple act of sitting down at a whites-only lunch counter. Their form of peaceful protest was known as a sit-in.

The judge's ruling came following an emotional hearing before a packed courtroom.

"We cannot rewrite history, but we can right history," Judge Mark Hayes said as he handed down his ruling. In response, those in court clapped and cheered.

Prosecutor Kevin Brackett apologized to the men — eight of whom were in court. The ninth has died.

"Sometimes you just have to say you're sorry," Brackett said. Saying that the court had been wrong 54 years ago, the prosecutor offered his "heartfelt apologies for what happened in 1961."

## Demonstrators Followed Their Lead

The Friendship 9's protest came during the height of the civil rights movement, which sought equal rights for African-Americans. All nine men were convicted of trespassing and protesting at McCrory variety store in Rock Hill.

After they were arrested, the men refused to pay bail. They argued that the money would go to the town government, which would make Rock Hill's leaders stronger and help keep segregation in place. Inspired by their courage, demonstrators across the South adopted their "jail not bail" technique and filled jail cells. The media attention helped turn scattered protests into a nationwide movement.

The Friendship 9 included eight students from Rock Hill's Friendship Junior College. They were W.T. "Dub" Massey, Willie McCleod, Robert McCullough, Clarence Graham, James Wells, David Williamson Jr., John Gaines and Mack Workman. The other member of the group was activist and organizer Thomas Gaither. It was he who had encouraged the students to challenge the town's Jim Crow laws, which kept blacks out of many restaurants.

A year earlier, a sit-in at a segregated lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, had helped energize the nation's civil rights movement. However, change was slow to come to Rock Hill. In February 1961, the men decided to challenge matters by getting arrested for ordering lunch at McCrory's variety store. All were convicted of trespassing and disturbing the peace.

## Bringing The Community Together

Author Kim Johnson has written a book on the Friendship 9, titled "No Fear For Freedom: The Story of the Friendship 9." Last year, she went to Kevin Brackett, the chief law officer for York and Union counties, to see what could be done to clear the men's records.

"This is an opportunity for us to bring the community together," Johnson said before the ruling. Having the men's records cleared "essentially says that it should have never happened in the first place."

Brackett's request to a Rock Hill judge came too late for McCullough, who died in 2006. However, some of the others returned to town before the hearing to reflect on their experience.

## A Return To The Counter

The men's names are engraved on the stools at the counter of the restaurant on Main Street, now called the Old Town Bistro, and a plaque outside marks the spot where they were arrested. Official and personal apologies have been offered to the men over the years.

In 2009, a white man named Elwin Wilson, who had tried to pull one of the protesters from a stool nearly 50 years earlier, returned to the same counter. Wilson met with some of the Friendship 9, who forgave him.
