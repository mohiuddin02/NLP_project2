WASHINGTON â€” A top businessman at General Motors said technology that could lead to driverless cars is improving. But, people will still need to drive cars for many years.

Mike Robinson is a vice president at GM. He told a group of government officials that for the "foreseeable future" drivers will still need to be "in control."

People think driverless vehicles will take them places without them doing anything, said Robinson. "These types of driverless systems are a significant distance into the future."

The government called the hearing to discuss new technologies in the cars. Many people believe that self-driving vehicles could be here soon. And they have concerns about their safety. The group noted that Google has made driverless cars. Google has driven hundreds of thousands of miles in them with no accidents. However, Google hasn't said if it plans to sell self-driving vehicles.

## Automatic Braking In Some Cars

Carlos Ghosn is the CEO of Nissan Motors. He has said he wants the company to produce a driverless vehicle that families can afford by 2020.

As the Congressional group noted in a report, some cars already do things automatically. Cars are already around that have with automatic brakes or that can park themselves. As these technologies are more common, drivers will need to control the vehicles less.

Someday, vehicles will navigate the road without help from humans. By using electronic sensors and cameras, cars can react to markers on lanes and curbs. Vehicles could move more smoothly. Cars can keep an even distance between vehicles. The traffic system could become safer and less backed-up with cars. People might be able to spend less on fuel.

This is technology that is going to help people, said Robinson.

Earlier this year, the government's traffic safety division said it would look into self-driving vehicles. It is targeting "connected-vehicle technology." The new technology lets self-driving cars "talk" to each other with wireless radio signals. They can send information to each other about what speed they are going and when they change lanes.

## Will People Buy Them?

Some people may not like the experience of self-driving vehicles. Will customers buy expensive automobiles that don't need drivers to do much?

Robinson said some self-driving technology could happen soon. For instance, tools to help a vehicle automatically stay in the lanes could be here in less than 10 years. Congress should keep letting automakers develop new things for customers, he said. That will lead to better cars.

And he said it shouldn't let each states develop their own laws for these new vehicles. That would make for confusing rules.

Kirk Steudle runs Michigan's transit department. He said there is a need to speed up testing across the country and not go one state at a time.

Last week, Michigan took steps to allow for testing of driverless cars on public roads. Some other states have taken the same steps.

GM's Robinson said the car company isn't thinking about what to charge for the cars at this point.

"We're not looking at what we're going to price 10 years from now. We're looking at what we do today that can add value," he said.

As the government looks into driverless cars, it will have to make sure the technology is safe.

The first big news about driverless cars is the new changes in technology. But, the next big news would be if one of these technologies doesn't work properly.
