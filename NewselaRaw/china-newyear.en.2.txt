BEIJING — For many Americans, Chinese New Year conjures up images of colorful parades and fireworks in Chinatowns across the United States.

But in China, "bittersweet" is the word the government-controlled media often use to describe the Lunar New Year festival, which starts Friday. This is the Year of the Horse.

The occasion is when Chinese workers are expected to return to their home villages. It's a holiday of sharing time and gifts with family and friends. Chinese New Year has become a very busy time of travel across the world's most populated country. Hundreds of millions have moved from rural areas to cities in recent decades.

When they return home, some call it "the world's largest human migration."

## Train Tickets And Gift Giving

During the New Year's festivities — known as "Spring Festival" in China — government officials estimate people will make 3.6 billion trips. As of late December, more than 154 million train tickets had been sold for the 40-day period that surrounds the Lunar New Year.

For the past week, train stations in Beijing have been mobbed. Until a few days ago, subways were crowded with passengers carrying bags and gifts. On a subway last Saturday, a woman with luggage dropped a box of kiwis she was carrying. As the fruits rolled around the car, several passengers were kind enough to pick them up and return them to her.

Airports also are busy, but with a different class of customer. They're heavily used by wealthy Chinese who are returning home or spending the week in warm-weather resorts, such as Sanya in southern China and Bali in Indonesia. Passengers will make about 42 million air trips during the 40-day period, according to China's aviation agency.

For weeks in China, newspapers have published reports about the strain of the holiday. Obtaining train tickets is a hassle. Anxiety abounds about what gifts to take. For the young unwed, there will be unavoidable questions about why they haven't yet married. For those who don't or can't return home, there'll be the guilt they bear for not following through on tradition.

Earlier this month, a Chinese woman in Guangdong province was so upset with her long-lost son that she purchased a front-page ad in the Chinese Melbourne Daily. The newspaper is published in Australia, where the son is living. She urged him to visit for the holiday.

"We hope you will come home for Lunar New Year," read the ad. "Dad and Mom will never again pressure you to marry."

## Pi Village's Migrant Workers

Relying on Chinese media for reports about Spring Festival can be tricky. A story in the China Daily reported that 40 percent of Chinese migrant workers surveyed said they wouldn't return home for the holiday this year.

Of those who said they wouldn't return, nearly half said they were embarrassed because they'd earned too little money in 2013. The survey was taken of 13,156 migrant workers nationwide by job-hunting site daguu.com.

It was an astounding finding. Beijing is reportedly home to 8 million migrant workers, more than a third of its population. Most of them are young men from neighboring or far-away provinces. They moved to Beijing to take factory or service jobs, often living in run-down and crowded conditions.

The survey's findings couldn't easily be checked out. A well-known migrant community called Pi Village sits in northwestern Beijing. Nearly everyone there, it seemed, was traveling or had plans to.

One man estimated that 90 percent of the migrant workers in Pi Village had already left. He believed that many of the rest would be leaving soon.

This was backed up by a trio of young migrants: Wang Cun Biao, Wang Cun Xin and Wang Cun Bing. All three hailed from the same village in Henan province. Each said he was getting ready to travel there the next day on an eight-hour train ride. Like many in China, they'd stand the whole way, having saved money by getting cheap tickets instead of reserving seats.

## Some Staying Home For The Holiday

Only two people a reporter spoke to said they wouldn't be returning home.

One was Luque Ming, who was shopping with his wife and son in a clothing store along Pi Village's retail street. His immediate family is here. He planned to spend Spring Festival eating his favorite foods, watching television and relaxing.

"For Spring Festival, we like to buy new clothes for the new year," Luque said.

The other was a young woman from Sichuan province who said she wasn't going home because her employer hadn't paid her. When she was asked for her name and details for a news story, she got nervous and walked away. But there was something believable about what she'd said.

A day earlier, Chinese officials reported that they were working on efforts to help migrant workers receive the wages they were owed. The recovered wages could help migrants return home for Spring Festival. Pressure on stingy and crooked bosses had recovered 10.9 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) in unpaid wages for more than 1.5 million workers across the country, according to the Chinese government.

In China, there's a popular song with a line that goes: "No matter if you have money or not, you should return home for Spring Festival."

It's a nice thought, but for millions of workers here, returning home depends on getting paid.
