Mike Huckabee announced that he is running for president of the United States.

Huckabee spoke at his boyhood home of Hope, Arkansas. He is a former governor of Arkansas, a television host and a preacher. Huckabee is the sixth Republican candidate for president. Republicans are people who are against President Obama's Democratic group.

On Monday, Dr. Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina announced they also want to become president. They joined three Republican senators who already declared they are candidates. These are Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida.

Huckabee faces several problems, though. There are many people who want to become U.S. president. These other candidates want to get votes from the same people as Huckabee.

## He Will Need A Lot Of Money

Huckabee, 59, is a favorite of Christian voters with traditional values. In 2008, he had many loyal supporters. In this race for 2016, there is more competition. He has more rivals, who are also stronger candidates. Many of them are also popular with Christian voters. Huckabee has not been an elected official for more than eight years. Many people still know who he is because he hosts a Fox News television show.

His rivals are also better at raising money. Fundraising is a skill Huckabee lacked in the 2008 campaign. Back then, he raised just $16 million. Meantime, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney had more than $100 million to spend.

In 2008, Huckabee was not considered to be a serious White House winner. He did better than experts thought. The reason? There were not many solid candidates from which to choose.

Bob Vander Plaats said that choosing a candidate is like shopping for a new car. Vander Plaats is the president of a Christian group in Iowa. "People are going to want to ... sit inside all the new cars, look at all the new candidates," Vander Plaats said. In 2008, he worked for Huckabee's campaign in Iowa. Now, he does not know whom he will support.

## "He Is Their Guy"

Vander Plaats said that Huckabee hopes that his supporters will consider the other candidates. Then, Huckabee hopes, they will return and vote for him.

A study was not so sure that would happen. It found that just over half of Republican voters said they could see themselves voting for Huckabee. There was much more support for other candidates.

Huckabee's old supporters remain devoted to him.

"It's kind of like first love," said Craig Robinson. He created the Iowa Republican website. Robinson said that Huckabee's supporters are not the type to be interested in another candidate. "Mike Huckabee is their guy."

## There Are Always Complainers

Some people complained that Huckabee does not always follow the Republican group's position. He supported some tax increases when he was governor. Republicans want fewer taxes. He also changed his mind on whether people from other countries should stay in the United States. He used to think the United States should not do business with Cuba. Now, he does.

The other candidates are likely to use these issues against Huckabee.

"The field is so strong this time," Sam Clovis. He is a professor and a former radio host. "It's going to be extremely difficult for Huckabee."
