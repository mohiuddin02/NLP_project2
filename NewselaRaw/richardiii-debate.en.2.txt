England's King Richard III died in battle more than five centuries ago. On Thursday, his remains will be re-buried with great ceremony at Leicester Cathedral.

The fate of Richard III's remains has dominated newspaper headlines in Britain for several years. The king's bones were dug up from under a Leicester parking lot in 2012, and positively identified as his a year later.

## "My Kingdom For A Horse"

Richard III was slain in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth Field. His killing was immortalized by the great playwright William Shakespeare. In Shakespeare's play "Richard III," the cornered king senses his own doom. Seeking to escape his killers, he cries out: "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse." But Richard never escaped on a trusted steed and was, instead, cut down by the soldiers of his rival, Henry Tudor.

Examination of Richard III's remains revealed that his death was particularly brutal: his body was battered and pierced in many places, from his head to his hips.

His reburial in a new tomb in Leicester's cathedral will finally let Richard III rest in peace and dignity. However, it will not end the longstanding debate over his reign.

Before he was king, Richard III was a loyal supporter of his brother, Edward IV. Upon Edward's death, however, Richard seized the crown from his brother's 12-year-old son, Edward V. Both Edward V and his brother were then housed at the Tower of London, the state prison. Later, both boys disappeared without explanation.

## Was He Really A Villain?

Many believe that Richard III murdered his two young nephews, to keep either from ever becoming king. His alleged crime colors Richard's reputation to this day.

In the centuries since his death, Richard III has been seen as an evil villain guilty of the worst crimes. Shakespeare played a big part in making his bad reputation permanent, by presenting him as thoroughly villainous.

Richard III's defenders point to the lack of any proof that he was responsible for the deaths of the two princes. They argue that the last thing England needed at the time was a child king. They also claim that Richard introduced important reforms during his brief two-year reign. These include an early form of legal aid that was made available to those who could not afford lawyers.

## A Brutal Man In Brutal Times?

Phil Stone is chairman of the Richard III Society, which seeks to overturn the king's bad reputation. "The achievements of his short reign have been overshadowed by historical myths and Shakespeare's monster," he said. Richard III's achievements, he added, "were real and had lasting impact."

Whether or not Richard III murdered his nephews, he was most likely a brutal man, as most powerful men in his time were. He was another warlord in an age of warlords.

In Richard III's world political power was won on the battlefield, said Cardinal Vincent Nichols, archbishop of Westminster. It was achieved and maintained by "a willingness to employ the use of force, at times with astonishing brutality."

Richard III was probably more like a figure from the world of "Game of Thrones" than the sort of just king most would admire these days. Despite all the expected pomp and ceremony, his reburial will not change that.
