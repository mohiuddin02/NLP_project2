Suspects have been detained in connection with a diamond robbery that happened a few months ago at Brussels International Airport in Brussels, Belgium.  Police arrested 31 people in three different countries .

## Straight Out of a Movie

In February, a plane was at the Brussels International Airport. Passengers were taking their seats. Cargo was being loaded into the back of the jet. Several of the final packages contained diamonds.

Just then, two black vehicles drove through onto the runway. The cars stopped next to the plane. Eight men carrying machine guns got out of their cars. They were wearing police uniforms and facemasks. They pointed their guns at the crew and ordered them to open the cargo compartment.

The crew followed orders. The men stole 120 packages of diamonds, valued at $50 million. They put the packages into their cars and sped away.

The entire robbery took less than three minutes. By the time police officers were called, the robbers had vanished. No one was hurt. Passengers on the plane did not know what had happened. They only found out about the crime when their flight was cancelled.

One of the cars used during the robbery was found soon after the incident. It had been lit on fire and didn't have anyone in it. The other car was not found. Police started looking for the robbers right away.

It took officials almost three months to find the suspects involved with the crime. When captured, police also found diamonds and more than $100,000 cash.

## Dark Side Of The Diamond Industry

Some say diamonds are a girl's best friend, or a symbol of love and commitment. But there's a dark side to the diamond trade, and it's not just about daring runway robberies.

Sierra Leone is a poor African country rich in diamonds. During its civil war, illegal diamond mining was very common. Many children and adults were forced by warlords to mine for diamonds. They got very low wages. The diamonds were sold to merchants and transferred to stores in places like Paris and New York City. They were then sold at very high prices.

In 2003, the United Nations made a promise called the Kimberley Process to end buying and selling of illegal diamonds. The Kimberley Process is an agreement between countries to only buy and sell diamonds from legal sources. The Process has a certification that guarantees diamonds are legal to buy and sell.

But some people are finding problems with this Process. They worry that diamonds bought and sold are coming from unknown sources or that the miners are not being fairly paid.

## Diamond Heist History

The heist in Brussels may have shocked the world, but it is not the first time thieves have tried to steal diamonds. Many of them have gotten away, too.

One of the largest heists happened in February 2005 at the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, a city in the Netherlands. Two men pretending to be airline flight attendants drove a stolen truck onto the runway and stole millions of dollars worth of diamonds from another truck parked nearby. The men escaped and have never been found.

In February 2003, a group of men at the Antwerp World Diamond Centre in Antwerp, Belgium, pretended they were diamond merchants and broke into a vault and stole diamonds. They were caught a few days later when a sandwich was found on the side of the road containing the thief's fingerprints.  Antwerp is where most of the world's rough diamonds are cut into sparkling jewels.

In 2008 in Italy, a woman complained to police that she was hearing loud drilling noises near her home. Police did not pay attention to her comments. A few days later, it was found that jewel thieves had drilled a tunnel underneath a jewelry store. One morning, they popped up from the hole. They then tied up the staff and stole $20 million in jewelry. They were never caught.
