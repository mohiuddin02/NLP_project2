Rinehart noticed brownish, sunken areas on his orchards' apples and peaches about five years ago and thought the fruit was low in calcium. But spraying the fruit with calcium didn't help.

When University of Maryland researchers cut open his fruit and examined it, it became clear that the problem was something much more damaging and unpredictable: stink bugs.

Rinehart owns Rinehart Orchards in Maryland. He said stink bugs damage 10 to 20 percent of his crop every year.

"They are a major, major issue in our orchards," Rinehart said. It's changed how they choose to spray chemical pesticides on fruit to keep away bugs. "It's nothing that you can take lightly."

## Sucking Sugar From Fruit

The stink bug is an invasive species introduced to North America in the late 1990s. Damage caused by the bugs was particularly severe in 2010 and 2011. Some Maryland growers like Rinehart are still dealing with stink bug-related damage, which, he said, can decrease the worth of a fruit by 90 percent. But others have seen damage ease.

Stink bugs damage crops when they when pierce fruit with their mouths and suck sugar out. Although the damage has decreased since 2010 and 2011, there's no reason to believe the insect is in any permanent state of decline, said Gerry Brust. He is an expert in pest management at the University of Maryland.

"That's what insect populations do. It goes up, down," he said.

Even extreme environmental conditions are not enough to cause any long-term decline in the state's stink bug population. So the record low temperatures in many parts of the nation this winter are not solving the problem.

Stink bugs can escape the cold by living in dead or rotting trees, rock outcroppings or buildings, said Donald Weber, who studies bugs for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

"They're perfectly capable of surviving the winter," Weber said. "A lot of them are in pretty sheltered areas, so they're well equipped to survive even the recent cold snap that we had."

## Stink Bugs On The March

The insects have not just survived, though; they have expanded to more than 40 states. They have also reached parts of Canada and Europe, Weber said.

Rinehart said he has to aggressively scout for stink bug damage. If he finds significant damage, he can spray a repellent. The spray is safe for the produce but also repels insects that help the fruit. Pesticides are only a short-term solution, Weber said.

Guy Moore, of Maryland's Larriland Farm, said that stink bugs brought devastating damage in 2010 and 2011. But they did not cause significant damage after that.

USDA researchers take samples of apples and peaches from his farm and have been able to help monitor the stink bug population and spot damage. Moore hopes the stink bugs will be less of a nuisance in the future.

University of Maryland workers said different parts of the state have experienced periods of bad damage at different times: fall 2013 in Central Maryland, 2011 in Dorchester County and across the state in 2010 and 2011.

Stink bugs have been in North America for a brief period of time. Therefore, researchers still do not know much about their population changes, Weber said.

"We've only had a few years; there's a lot of other things that can happen," he said. "We had a big cold snap this year; maybe that does nothing to them. We just don't know. The safe bet is they're not going away, and they're going to be a distinct and significant pest problem in the mid-Atlantic states for a while."

## Predators To The Rescue?

Some predators are slowly starting to recognize stink bugs as possible prey, Weber said. Researchers are considering introducing natural enemies to feed on the non-native stink bugs.

Identifying and deploying natural enemies could take a long time. Introducing a stink bug predator could take three to five years and would require the approval of scientists from all three North American countries, Weber said.

There will likely be a plan to introduce tiny wasps as predators of stink bugs within a year, Weber said. The wasps lay their eggs on other insects' eggs. Then the newly hatched wasps eat the eggs of their prey — including stink bugs.

Chemists have also copied the stink bug's pheromones, or scent, Weber said. The pheromone could allow growers to draw the insects away from produce.

But for now, growers will have to continue to use short-term measures like pesticides to minimize damage.

"In this business, you are at the mercy of nature. Stink bugs are something that have definitely added to that and added in a very strong way," Rinehart said. "Yeah, stink bugs are a bummer, man."
