SEATTLE â€” Talking is hard for Chance Mair. He cannot always tell people what he is feeling. Sometimes he is not sure what other people are feeling.

Mair has a condition called Asperger's syndrome. This affects his brain. It makes his thinking different from most people's.

## Top Of The Class

Mair was feeling happy the other night. He was at his school, Marysville Arts and Technology High. The school's 50 other 12th-graders were there too.

Mair and the others had just finished high school. They were graduating. It was time to leave high school and move on to the next thing in their lives.

Mair was not just another graduating student. He was the best student in his year. He was picked to say some words to all the other students.

Talking in front of a room full of people is hard for anyone. It is really hard for someone with Asperger's. Still, Mair knew he could do it.

## "I Didn't Want To Tell People"

Most people at school did not know Mair has Asperger's.

"I didn't want to tell people," he said. "But now that I'm graduating, I don't want to hold it back. I want people to know me for who I really am."

Mair grew up in Marysville, Washington. For years he did not talk much. When he wanted to play with other children, he did not know what to say.

Mair sometimes feels very worried when he has to talk. He gets really scared. But he worked. He learned to get much better at talking to people.

## Bowling And Math Help

One thing that helped was bowling. Mair began bowling when he was five.

Mair feels happy when he is bowling. "He loves it," his father Derek Mair said.

Mair loves math too. He is very good at it.

"I can count better than I can talk sometimes," he said.

## His Talk Is A Hit

Mair's graduation talk was a big hit.

Everyone has their own problems, Mair said. We cannot let them stop us.

There will always be people who say "No we can't," he said. We should not listen to them.

Everyone cheered loudly after Mair finished talking. They were all proud of him. Asperger's could not keep Chance Mair down.
