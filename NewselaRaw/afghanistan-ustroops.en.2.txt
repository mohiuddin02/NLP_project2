WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Barack Obama has announced new military plans that call for keeping nearly 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan through most of next year. He added that there would still be 5,500 U.S. troops in the war-torn country by the time he leaves office in 2017. The president made the announcement from the White House on Thursday.

The announcement cast aside the president's promise to end the war next year. Indeed, it ensures the conflict will be inherited by the next president.

Obama called the new war plan a "modest but meaningful" continuation of the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan. The president said he knows Americans are weary of the lengthy conflict. However, he added, he is "firmly convinced we should make this extra effort."

## Military Has Been Making Its Case For Months

Military leaders have argued for months that the Afghans needed additional assistance from the United States to beat back a revived Taliban. Before being toppled from power by U.S.-led forces in 2001, the Taliban controlled all of Afghanistan. They imposed a very harsh interpretation of Islam on the country. The Taliban is now fighting to regain control of Afghanistan.

On Thursday, Obama said that while Afghan government forces have made progress in their fight against the Taliban, the situation remains unstable. Without U.S. help, the gains of the last 14 years could be lost.

Under the newly announced plan, the current force of 9,800 troops will remain in Afghanistan through most of next year. U.S. presence will then be drawn down to 5,500 troops in 2017. The pace of the troop withdrawal is still to be determined and will depend on the military situation.

It will be up to the next president to decide how to proceed from there. Whoever it is, that person will be the third U.S. commander in chief to oversee the war.

## Decision Could Change Course Of Presidential Race

Until now, Afghanistan has barely been an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, which is in full swing. However, Obama's announcement could force the candidates to outline their own plans for the war.

The president's new plan gives U.S. military commanders everything they had asked for. It approves the highest number of U.S. troops requested by commanders. It also gives commanders a great deal of flexibility in deciding how to use those troops, and when to begin troop withdrawals.

The second part of the U.S. mission is training and assisting Afghan government forces. Afghan forces are now in charge of combat operations but could lose control of the situation without U.S. help. American forces will be based in Kabul and at Bagram Air Field, as well as at bases in Jalalabad and Kandahar.

Whoever becomes president next will likely inherit active U.S. military missions in two countries Obama promised to withdraw from: Iraq and Afghanistan.

## Troops Pulled From Iraq In 2011 Forced To Return

The president did withdraw most U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011. At the time he called the withdrawal a promise kept to a war-weary America. However, the rise of the Islamic State group drew the U.S. military back into Iraq last year. The Islamic State — also known as ISIS — is currently trying to impose its own very extreme brand of Islam on Iraq and other countries in the region. The group is considered to be even more extreme, and more violent, than the Taliban.

U.S forces in Iraq are now training and assisting local government forces and launching airstrikes. Obama has said that campaign will also likely last beyond his term in office.

On Thursday, Obama insisted he was not disappointed in not fulfilling his pledge to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan before he leaves office. A changed situation in Afghanistan makes the new military plans necessary, he said.

The president's decision was reinforced when Taliban fighters in Afghanistan took control of the key northern city of Kunduz late last month. The Taliban's seizure of the city led to a drawn-out battle between Taliban fighters and Afghan government forces. The United States lent support to government forces with a series of airstrikes.

## Islamic State, Taliban Increase Threat To Stability

U.S. commanders are not only worried about a revived Taliban. They also have expressed concern about Islamic State fighters moving into Afghanistan and gaining new followers from within the Taliban.

Officials said discussions on staying in Afghanistan longer began in March of this year. The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General John Campbell, recently presented Obama with several possible military plans. All called for keeping more U.S. troops in Afghanistan than was originally planned. All were based on what he felt it would take to minimize the chances of losing more ground and to keep the Afghan army strong.

Several U.S. allies have said they support the idea of extending the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan. U.S. government officials would not say if any of those countries has offered to provide help.
