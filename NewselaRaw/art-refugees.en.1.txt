DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Inside the gallery, artworks by Syrian artists drew auction bids from collectors. Outside on the street, the artists traded the latest gossip from Syria and checked their smartphones for news from the Middle Eastern country's civil war.

Such is the divided life of a cadre of Syrian artists brought to Dubai by their gallery. They are able to continue their work in safety, but remain deeply connected to Syria and influenced by the bloodshed they left behind.

The Syrian refugee diaspora — now at 2 million and growing — has fanned out across the region and beyond for more than two years. It ranges from inhabitants of tent camps in Jordan to others trying to rebuild their lives in cities such as Beirut and Istanbul.

But for those fleeing Syria, the Gulf states present a contradiction: Though deeply involved in the war as some of the strongest backers of the Syrian rebels, they are holding firm to tight entry controls that effectively block most refugees.

## Saving Syria's Artists From War

The auction Monday in Dubai's evolving art district — tucked inside an industrial zone of warehouses and businesses — served as a window into a small but forward-looking effort. With no end in sight to the civil war that has already claimed more than 100,000 lives, the goal is to save part of Syria's artistic community.

"It's a tragedy what is happening there now, but it would be an even bigger tragedy if all this art and culture that Syria has so much of would be lost," said gallery owner Hisham Samawi. Samawi's Ayyam Gallery moved from Damascus to Dubai in late 2011 as the Arab Spring rebellion widened.

"For us,'" he added, "the artists are part of our family. We had to do it. It was for us and for them."

Step by step for nearly two years, the gallery's operators moved 15 artists and their families to Dubai, hiring them as employees so they could obtain visas. Meanwhile, Ayyam crews managed to ship about 3,000 paintings, sculptures and other pieces as fighting intensified in the Syrian capital.

Among those under the gallery's wings in Dubai is Tammam Azzam, one of the rising stars in Syria's revolution-inspired art world. A Damascus-born painter, Azzam has shifted to prints and multimedia work in order to draw attention to the horrors of the conflict.

One piece, "Freedom Graffiti," superimposed the golden-hued sensuality of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece "The Kiss" over a shattered and bullet-scarred apartment wall near Homs. The image became an Internet sensation with hundreds of thousands of views and established the 33-year-old Azzam as one of the artistic voices of the civil war.

## "People Dying Every Day, Every Minute"

Another piece done since his arrival in Dubai is "Syrian Olympics," a digital print of stick-figure stencils in the shape of Olympic event logos. Shooters aim like snipers at runners.

A signed copy sold for $12,000 at the auction, which was attended by more than 300 people. A copy of "Freedom Graffiti" brought in $6,000.

"I have to do something for the people there," said Azzam. "I want to do anything to send any message to people around the world about what happened in my country: People dying every day, every minute, and nobody can stop that."

Azzam struggles with the frustrating feeling that "art doesn't make sense" in the middle of a war.

But conflict has always been an incubator for creativity. For example, there are 18th-century political cartoons commenting on the American and French revolutions, or works inspired by the 1930s Spanish Civil War, such as Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso)'s powerful "Guernica." And now, the Web-driven protest art of Middle East uprisings.

In Iran, songs, videos and artwork flowed onto the Internet following the disputed 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Iran's art community rallied around the imaginary candidacy of comic book heroine "Zahra" during this June's election.

Since 2011, dozens of prominent exhibitions have showcased the work of Arab Spring artists. Among those featured was Egyptian Ahmed Basiony. He was killed during clashes in Cairo in the final days of Hosni Mubarak's rule.

## Getting Other Artists Out

Street battles this summer in Turkey stirred a kind of mass performance art. Anti-government protesters mimicked the "Standing Man" sentinel of choreographer Erdem Gunduz, who stood motionless amid the fighting around Istanbul's Taksim Square.

"The artists are paramount, so we had to get them out," said gallery owner Samawi. "There was no question about it. It wasn't like: We'll go find other artists. These are our artists. We believe in them and believe they have a voice."

According to Samawi, there are plans to try to bring other Syrian artists out of the country. But these efforts are made more complicated by the deepening battles and the increasing lockdown in Damascus over threats of possible U.S.-led military action.

"It's a good thing we started when we did," said Samawi, "because it becomes more and more difficult as every month passes."

The artist Azzam said he has friends watching his abandoned studio in Damascus.

"But who knows if it will be there when I return," he said. "And who knows when I can return."
