MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis. â€” Jerry Witt fought in the Vietnam War years ago. Two friends saved his life.

Jerry's friends were not like the other soldiers. They were dogs named Skip and Satan. Skip was part German shepherd. He was also part collie. Satan was a black Labrador retriever.

Skip and Satan were not pets. They had an important job to do. They used their strong senses, like smell, to help soldiers.

The Army treated Skip and Satan like soldiers. Jerry was their partner. This kind of partner is called a handler. The Army gave the dogs tattoos. The tattoos were in each dog's ear. The tattoo was like a name tag a soldier has.

## A Fan Club

Dogs have helped soldiers for many years. They find missing people. They sniff for bombs. They help soldiers feel better when they get hurt.

These Army dogs have their own fan club. It is called War Dogs.

Club members give talks about Army dogs. They show their dogs in parades. They even raised money to put up a statue.

Fighting in another country takes a lot of supplies. Sometimes the Army cannot bring all the supplies back. The Army left supplies in Vietnam. The Army left dogs, too. The handlers of the dogs were mad.

## Dogs Come Home

Jerry says treating dogs like old tools is wrong. "These dogs, they were like people," he said.

The handlers decided to make a change. They wanted to bring the Army dogs home. They asked Congress for help.

In 1992, Congress made a new rule. Now the Army brings all of its dogs home. The dogs are treated like true soldiers.
