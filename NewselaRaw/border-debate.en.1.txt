Last summer, a huge number of unaccompanied children were stopped trying to cross the border into the United States. In October, the number of children was down 40 percent over the previous October, the U.S Customs and Border Protection announced Friday.

Meanwhile, the nation appears to be gearing up for another battle over immigration issues.

President Barack Obama has said he will issue an executive order changing some immigration policies. The executive order will let him bypass congressional approval of the changes. Among the proposals being considered is action that would protect more than 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation. Republicans have vowed to fight the president. They argue that an executive order would poison relations with the new Congress, which will begin in January.

In elections earlier this month, the Republican Party won control over both houses of Congress. Currently, Republicans control the House of Representatives and the Democrats control the Senate.

## Should They Stay Or Go?

Over the summer, the huge number of children and their families that illegally crossed the border inflamed the political debate over illegal immigration. More than 11 million people live in the United States without government permission. In general, Democrats have argued that they should be allowed to stay. Republicans insist on first tightening border security to prevent people from crossing into the United States illegally.

The latest figures show that the number of children caught at the border on their own fell about 40 percent in October 2014 from October 2013. Last October, 4,181 unaccompanied children were stopped at the border, compared with 2,529 last month, the border agency said.

The number of families who were stopped at the border trying to enter the country fell about 10 percent, from 2,414 to 2,163, the agency said.

## Reverse Of Huge Summer Numbers

The numbers are organized by the year beginning Oct. 1, so it is too soon to make any annual comparisons, but the decrease is part of a continuing trend, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said last month.

"Over the last 15 years, the number of apprehensions on our Southwest border — a major indicator of total attempts to cross the border illegally — has declined significantly," Johnson said. Now, it is at its lowest level since the 1970s, he added.

Johnson said an unusually high number of unaccompanied children and others crossed the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley last summer. They were searching for family members and a better life in this country. "We responded aggressively to this spike," Johnson said, "and, in fact, now the numbers of unaccompanied children crossing into the Rio Grande Valley are at the lowest they've been in almost two years."

## Immigration Debate Rages

Johnson said the drop in illegal crossings was due to several factors. Hundreds of border patrol agents were moved to the Rio Grande Valley, where most of the crossings took place. The valley is located at the southern tip of Texas along the border with Mexico.The government stepped up its efforts to shut down criminal groups that took people across the border illegally. The government also added more flights to send people back Central America, increased public awareness campaigns in Central America and persuaded Mexican officials to stop immigrants from crossing Mexico to the United States. Most of the illegal immigrants entering the United States came from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in Central America.

The seriousness of the immigration debate was highlighted Friday during a news conference. Obama, traveling in Asia, spoke about the immigration reform bill that would have allowed at least some of the 11 million people in the country illegally to stay and begin the path to citizenship. The bill was passed by the Senate but was never brought to a vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

"I indicated to Speaker (John) Boehner several months ago that if, in fact, Congress failed to act, I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better," Obama said, "And that's going to happen. That's going to happen before the end of the year."

## President's Pledge Is Criticized

Republicans have loudly criticized Obama's pledge to issue an executive order to let the illegal immigrant stay.

"We're going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path. This is the wrong way to govern. This is exactly what the American people said on Election Day they didn't want," Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, said Thursday. "And so, all the options are on the table."

Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is the new Senate majority leader. He said an executive order by Obama on immigration would "poison the well" as far as the new Republican majority in the Senate was concerned.

Another proposal being considered by Obama is extending deportation protections to parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for years. Another option is expanding a program that protects young immigrants from being deported.
