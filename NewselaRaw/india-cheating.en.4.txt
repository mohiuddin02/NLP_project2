MUMBAI, India â€” A voice on the phone is selling a device for cheating on tests. No one will suspect anything, the voice said. The device, he said, has never failed.

The device costs about $40. Minutes later the seller texts. He is offering a lower price.

That's the price to cheat on one of India's tests. For students, the test is all-important. It is the ticket into the country's best colleges, universities and postgraduate programs.

Anil, a college student in southern India, was selling a tiny wireless earpiece. It is barely bigger than the head of a pin. The earpiece receives a signal from a cellphone. During exams, he sends pictures of the test questions to a friend at home. The friend sends back answers over the phone.

"There's no way anyone can even make out you using the device," Anil says. He sells three or four a week on eBay to high school and college students. "I've never had any problems. You just need to have some confidence and a good friend who can help you out during the exams."

## Pressure For Good Scores

The national tests for 10th- and 12th-graders are called board exams. Good scores determine who will get into the best schools. Pressure from parents to do well can be overpowering, students say.

Even for those not attending college, the tests are important. They are used for entering job training programs. These programs can secure a good future for many poor students.

Education officials say they are trying to stop cheating. But it is like trying to stop a flood.

In northern India, inspectors caught two students cheating. The inspectors were then attacked by home-made bombs.

At a test center, inspectors caught school workers writing answers to an exam on a blackboard. The workers tried to toss the evidence out the window.

Some schools have installed cameras to videotape testing rooms. They have posted armed police officers at entrances. They use devices to block cellphone calls.

## Few Out Of Millions Cheat

Still, India's elections "are likely to be freer and fairer than the exams." This is according to writer Mridula Chari.

Teachers and school officials say that millions of students take the board exams each year. Few of them cheat.

But that still leaves a lot of students who do cheat. For rule-breakers, low-tech methods remain popular. Students hide cheat sheets in socks. They copy neighbors' answers. They scribble notes on walls. Tests are often sold by school workers.

Sometimes, just one adult watches a group of students during a test.

"For the major part of the exam, he was not present in the class," one student said of an adult. "There was open passing of information, noise and even discussions. I remember (checking) most of my answers with my friends."

Schools are trying to stop the cheating. But they have had mixed success. In Mumbai, officials said that installing cameras reduced cheating. But students in at least one school broke the cameras by throwing rocks at them.

## "It Will Be A Headache"

In the state of Bengal, police stood guard outside test centers. People still tossed cheat sheets into the exam rooms.

"One hundred percent, we can stop this problem," Lakshmikant Pande said. He is head of the board of education in the western state of Maharashtra. "If we continue these types of efforts over two or three years, surely we can stop this."

Teachers doubt the cheating will stop. Principals often do not report cheating. Principals do not want other people to know that students cheat at their schools. Also, teachers do not want to get involved. Cheating cases can go on for years.

About 10 years ago, the son of an Indian Railways official hired a train conductor to take an exam for him. They were caught. The student was reported.

Yet the case still remains before the police. The teacher who caught the cheat has to appear at least once a year in court.

"We learned a lesson from that," English teacher Akhil Bhosle said. "If we register a case, it will be a headache for us."
