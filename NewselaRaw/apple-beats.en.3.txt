CUPERTINO, Calif. â€” Apple just bought Beats Electronics for $3 billion. The purchase will give the Apple more swagger and music-picking expertise.

Beats Electronics is a headphone and music-streaming company. It was founded by rapper Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine. Iovine is a leader in the music business. He was one of the first businessmen to get into hip-hop culture.

The deal between Apple and Beats was announced Wednesday, nearly three weeks after rumors that the two companies were first reported. It's by far the most expensive purchase in Apple's 38-year history. It's a price that the company is willing to pay to defend its iTunes store from competition.

The price consists of $2.6 billion in cash and $400 million in Apple stock. The deal is expected to close before October.

## The Combination Will Make Even More Money

Beats is already making money. It took in $1.1 billion last year. It will boost Apple's earnings starting in October, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview.

Iovine, 61, and Dre, 49, were the important to the deal. They began working with Apple in the early days of its iTunes store. Now they will have important roles in Apple's music divisions.

"We have known these guys forever," Cook said of Iovine and Dre. "We've dated, we've gone steady and now we are getting married. This relationship started a decade ago, so we know there is an incredible cultural fit. These two guys have a very rare set of skills. It's like finding a particular grain of sand on the beach. It's that rare."

Cook indicated Beats' music streaming service was the main selling point in the deal. However, the headphone line also is expected to continue growing, too.

## Digital Music Is In For A Ride

Iovine thinks most technology companies are dumb when it comes to culture. But he thinks Apple will help Beats to realize its goals. Beats is determined to improve the sound of digital music. It also dreams of creating playlists specifically for each subscriber.

"To complete our dream, we needed a company like (Apple)," Iovine said. "We couldn't finish this on our own."

Other music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify have been growing in popularity. But this has meant lower sales of songs and albums. iTunes was on top of that business for the past 10 years. U.S. sales of downloaded songs fell last year to $2.8 billion. Meanwhile, streaming music made $1.4 billion.

Apple broke into streaming with the launch of iTunes Radio last September. Unfortunately, the service has not been as popular as the company expected.

ITunes Radio has 40 million listeners. It will continue as a free service with ads. Meanwhile, Beats Music will try to tap into the more than 800 million iTunes accounts to sell more subscriptions to its customized service. Beats Music currently has more than 250,000 subscribers, Cook said. That's well below the more than Spotify's 10 million paying customers.

## A Game-Changing Boost

Apple is counting on Beats to boost its image with teenagers and younger adults. It's trying to remain a leader in digital music.

"Apple suddenly has regained its cool," said Doug Morris. Morris runs Sony Music. He was one of the first people in the music business to support iTunes. In fact, it was because Iovine told him to. That was more than ten years ago.

Beats was founded in 2008 by Dr. Dre, and Iovine. Dre's real name is Andre Young. Iovine worked in the music business for a long time. Now Beats dominates the luxury headphone market. Its equipment is also a big seller in Apple's stores.

Morris thinks Cook is making a smart move. He thinks it will help make Apple a true leader in the music business.

"It's a game changer because Jimmy is that kind of guy who can change a game," Morris said. "He really knows how to build the bridge between music and technology."

Iovine has visited Apple on a regular basis. He said he has no worries about joining Apple. "We can roller-skate in the halls here. Dre and I have been working together for 22 years. We are not about to go somewhere where we are going to fall."

Dre was calmer on Wednesday than he was in a video posted online. It showed him celebrating becoming hip-hop's first billionaire. "To be able to do something that could potentially change the world, I'm thrilled," he said Wednesday.
