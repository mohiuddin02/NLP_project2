SAVANNAH, Mo. — It's no wonder pet lovers and animal rescue groups beat a path to Gary Silverglat's door.

About 13 years ago, Silverglat began Angels Vet Expresscare to treat animals for the rescue group he and his wife started. Now Angels Vet treats 100,000 animals annually. Caring for so many animals lets it charge much less for medical care than regular vet clinics.

Angels Vet has also captured the attention of veterinarians around the country. They are eager to learn how Silverglat runs the clinic.

"The secret is volume," Silverglat said. "But the clinic was founded on the premise that no animal should fail to receive care services because the expense is too high."

## Americans Spend Billions On Pet Care

It is no surprise Angels Vet Expresscare has such a huge following. People love their pets, and vet care in the United States is big business. According to the American Pet Products Association, Americans spent $15 billion on veterinary care in 2014.

The most basic vet procedure is spaying or neutering pet cats or dogs so they can not have kittens or puppies. The average price for that in the Midwest is $20 to $45\. Something more serious, like the treatment of a heartworm infection, can cost $180 to $350\. Heartworms are long worms that can lodge in an animal's heart or lungs. A heartworm infection can cause serious problems.

At Angels Vet, the cost to spay a cat, vaccinate it and deworm it is $67\. For major surgery, the clinic charges just one-tenth the price of a regular veterinary clinic, Silverglat said.

## Clinic Helps Dogs In Prison Program

Kathy Turner of Cameron, Missouri, works for a state prison program. It gives some people who have committed crimes the opportunity to train rescue dogs. Turner takes the dogs to Silverglat's clinic.

"If it weren't for Angels Vet Expresscare, we wouldn't have a program," she said. "In fact, we don't have enough dogs in Cameron for the program, so we bring in dogs from around the state that would ordinarily be" killed.

The clinic's low fees help families who are struggling to pay for vet expenses, said Jenny Hays. She works for BluePearl Veterinary Partners in Overland Park, Kansas. The vet practice sends some pet owners to Angels Vet.

Angel Vet gives animals medical care even if their owners don't have much money, Hays said.

## Founder Spends Millions Of His Own Money

Building Angels Vet did not come easy for Silverglat. He estimates that he has put several million dollars of his own money into it over 13 years. He does not make much money from it.

Silverglat is not a veterinarian. But he has what he calls "a natural passion for animals."

When he and his wife, Lisa, moved to the area more than 30 years ago, they saw a tremendous number of abandoned animals. Silverglat decided that he and his wife needed to take action. Silverglat and his wife started an animal rescue organization.

"We kept a lot of the abandoned animals at first, but then we realized we couldn't keep 27 animals and we needed to start a business to fix this," he said.

## Treatment Saves More Animals Than Adoption

They figured out that they could save even more animals with a low-cost vet clinic.

Angels Vet operates with five full-time veterinarians, two part-time veterinarians and 30 other workers. It also has a handful of volunteers who help out for free.

Angels Vet Expresscare sees about 60,000 pets each year. It also treats 40,000 rescue animals. Many of them are treated for free because the clinic wants to improve animal welfare in the region, according to dvm360\. It is a national veterinary magazine.

On any given day, Silverglat said, there are about 50 cars in the clinic's parking lot. They belong to wealthy people and poor people.

Silverglat said his way of running the clinic is not easy. To make it work, it takes much money and partnerships within the community. Angels Vet also gets discounts on medicines for animals. "But in the end, we figured we could do more for the animals by treating them rather than holding them."
