About 7,000 years ago or more, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru. Their lives revolved around fishing from the rich Pacific waters. Yet, lying just behind them farther inland was a uniquely dry, arid desert — the Atacama.

The Chinchorro were unique in many ways, but perhaps most of all in their burial practices. They created the oldest known mummies on Earth, beating the Egyptians by several thousand years. The Chinchorro's mummies were first discovered in the Atacama desert in 1917.

Compared with the Egyptians, the Chinchorro mummified their dead in a truly equal fashion. "Whereas the Egyptians considered only kings and other exalted citizens worthy of mummification, the Chinchorro accorded everyone in the community, regardless of age or status, this sacred rite," wrote Bernardo Arriaza, an expert on the mummies.

## Mummies Are Aging

Since then, hundreds of mummies have been unearthed, with more still in the ground being uncovered regularly. But lately, a problem has arisen. The specimens — more than 100 are held at a museum of the Universidad de Tarapacá in Arica, Chile — have started to degrade. "The tissue change is reflected in the appearance of dark and bright spots," Marcela Sepulveda, an archaeologist at the Universidad de Tarapacá, explained in an email.

Indoors, the change has been slow, but outdoors, mummies are being discovered already damaged, Sepulveda said. "When you excavate mummies you can see that degradation is already there," she said. And the suspected reason? A changing climate.

The Earth is slowly getting warmer and storm and weather patterns are changing. Scientists blame some of these changes on humans burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal.

## Deterioration In The Last Decade

Arica is often referred to as the driest place on Earth — but locals say that is changing. According to Sepulveda, the city has seen increases in rain and humidity lately. "Everybody say(s) that here," she said. Indeed, weather historian Christopher Burt wrote about Arica in 2013, noting that despite its famous reputation for dryness, weather records from 1971 to 2000 suggest it has been somewhat wetter than usual.

This may not be a change that can be definitively blamed on global climate change caused by humans, cautioned Ralph Mitchell, a Harvard University microbiologist. But it is a change nonetheless. "Our colleagues in northern Chile say it's terribly obvious that the place is foggy a lot more than it ever was," Mitchell said. He teamed up with the Chilean researchers to figure out what was ailing the mummies.

Mitchell noted that many of the mummies found in the 1980s had no problems until 10 years ago, "when they started to deteriorate." That alone suggests climate may be a factor in what's happening.

## Other Relics Are Also Vulnerable

So Mitchell and two Harvard colleagues collaborated with Sepulveda and one of her colleagues to try to figure out what was going on. They aimed to find out if climate change was in fact the reason for mummy decay. If so, they wanted to determine what it would mean for better preserving these unique, ancient objects. Their theory was that more airborne moisture had enabled bacteria to start to chow down on the centuries-old relics.

They studied samples of mummy skin and dried pig skin in various conditions. They examined which microbes were living on and in the skin. The result, Mitchell said, was the finding that bacteria were taking advantage of a more humid environment to "use the skin as a nutrient and start to break it down." These were common skin bacteria, among others, which had been enabled by a particular set of environmental conditions.

The decaying of the Chinchorro mummies illustrates just how vulnerable many irreplaceable cultural artifacts and World Heritage sites may be to a changing climate — human-caused or not. It's something that the United Nations (U.N.) has thought about for some time. Its department UNESCO names certain places as World Heritage sites because of their importance to nature or culture. A 2007 report from the U.N. agency said that "the impacts of climate change are affecting many World Heritage properties and are likely to affect many more, both natural and cultural, in the years ahead."

## Whether Frozen Or Desert, Change Is Coming

The U.S. Agency for International Development is also concerned about how climate change might affect World Heritage sites, and it highlights an example that on a physical level sounds similar to what appears to be happening in Arica. "Buildings in the rare medieval city of Leh in Ladakh, India, were constructed in a high altitude desert environment and are ill suited to current increases in precipitation," it noted.

Several years ago, Archaeology magazine listed yet another related example. It said that the frozen burial mounds of Scythian warlords (called "kurgans"), preserved in permafrost near Siberia, can be destabilized by Arctic thawing. In this case, it was ice, rather than desert, that had preserved remains intact for a magnificently long time. A change in climate can once again mean an irreplaceable loss of artifacts and ruins as the ice preserving them melts.

Harvard's Mitchell, meanwhile, said he suspects another possible climate heritage victim: outdoor marble statues. "Historic marbles in the outdoor environment are at risk from climate change," he said.

## Now, The Consequences

So while we may not know exactly what is happening in Arica, Chile — or whether it should be attributed to human-caused global warming — the fact is that damage to historical artifacts and World Heritage sites is an expected consequence of climate change in general. And how could it be otherwise? Many of these sites have been remarkably preserved precisely because of the fact that they have been climatically unperturbed.

Alter that, and, along with many other consequences, the world could lose some of its history.
