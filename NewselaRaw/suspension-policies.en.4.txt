DALLAS, Texas â€” Ahmed Mohamed is 14. He is a student in Texas.

Ahmed is very good at building things. He made his own clock.

Ahmed brought the clock to school. He wanted to show it to people.

The clock got Ahmed in big trouble. His teacher thought it was a bomb. She thought it might blow up.

## It Was A Clock, Not A Bomb

Ahmed told her it was only a clock. She did not believe him.

Then police came to the school. They took Ahmed away.

Pretty soon the police figured out that Ahmed had not done anything wrong. It really was just a clock. He was not trying to hurt or frighten anyone.

Ahmed's school suspended him anyway. He was forced to stay home for three days.

Many people think the school treated Ahmed very badly.

## Tough Rules At Many Schools

Things happened that way because Ahmed's school has tough rules. The rules say what must happen when a student misbehaves.

Students at Ahmed's school are punished quickly. Sometimes they have to stay home from school. Sometimes they are kicked out for good.

Most schools used to have rules like that. Now many think such rules are a bad idea.

Many schools are starting to use new rules.

## Now Schools Try Talking First

The new rules are very different. When students misbehave they are not punished right away. Teachers or other grownups try to find out what is bothering them.

Sometimes teachers realize students were not misbehaving at all. They see they had the wrong idea.

The old rules said students who got into fights had to be suspended. They had to stay home from school. Sometimes the police were called.

## Students Try To Work Out Own Problems

With the new rules things are very different. Students who fight are not suspended right away. They talk with a teacher or another grownup.

The students say why they were fighting. Then, everyone tries to work out their problems.

The new way of doing things seems to work well. Far fewer students have to be punished.

Maybe if Ahmed's school used the new rules, things would have turned out differently. He might not have gotten in trouble at all.
