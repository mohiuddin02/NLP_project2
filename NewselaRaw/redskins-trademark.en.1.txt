WASHINGTON — A federal trademark board, which protects companies from having other companies steal their names and symbols, passed a ruling on Wednesday. The board ruled that the Washington Redskins nickname insults and demeans [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American).

In addition, it said that the team's trademark protections — its legal rights to the name — should be canceled. In other words, the Redskins won't have the right to tell other companies or teams that they cannot use their name or logo. The board's decision applies new financial and political pressure on the team to change its name.

The ruling from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was 2-1 for a case that has been working its way through legal channels for more than 20 years. It doesn't force the team to abandon the name. However, it comes at a time of increasing criticism of team owner Dan Snyder. Political, religious and sports figures have all said it's time for a change.

## Redskins Say Not So Fast

The Redskins quickly announced that they will appeal, or argue that the ruling was unjust, and the ending of trademark protections will be on hold while the matter makes its way through the courts. That process could take years.

It was the second time the board had issued an opinion on the case. In 2003, a similar ruling from 1999 was overturned on a technicality.

"We've seen this story before," Redskins attorney Bob Raskopf said. "And just like last time, today's ruling will have no effect at all on the team's ownership of and right to use the Redskins name and logo. We are confident we will prevail once again."

The ruling involves six uses of the "Redskins" name trademarked by the team from 1967 to 1990. If it stands, it would mean the team can continue to use the name, but it would lose much of its ability to protect the financial interests connected to it. If others printed the name on sweatshirts or other clothing without permission, it would become more difficult to go after them.

Courts overturned the board's previous ruling in part because the plaintiffs waited too long to voice their opposition after the original trademarks were issued. The case was relaunched in 2006 by a younger group of Native Americans who had recently become adults and therefore would not have been able to file a case earlier. The hearing was held in March of last year.

## Growing Criticism From Many Corners

The chorus of critics against the use of the name has grown over the past year.

On Saturday, a major section of the United Church of Christ voted to urge its 40,000 members to boycott the Redskins — that is, to not attend their games or buy their merchandise. Half of the U.S. Senate recently wrote letters to the NFL urging a change, one of the letters stating that "racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports." D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray suggested Wednesday the name will almost certainly have to change if the team ever wants to build a new stadium in the city.

Snyder, who has vowed repeatedly never to change the name, declined to comment. Redskins players have mostly avoided the topic, aware of a potential conflict because they are employed by the team.

"Our job as players is to focus on what we can on this field day-in and day-out and let the legal people take care of that stuff," quarterback Robert Griffin III said. "And when it's the right time, then we can voice whatever it is we know about the situation."

The Redskins have responded to critics by creating an Original Americans Foundation to give financial support to Native American tribes. Suzan Shown Harjo, a lead figure in the trademark case, said the foundation was simply trying to sway public opinion. She likened what it was doing to bribery.

Supporters of a name change quickly hailed the decision.

"It is just a matter of time," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, until Snyder "is forced to do the right thing."
