BEIJING — A little yellow submarine will be the final part of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Investigators looking for the Boeing 777 that disappeared in March have put away locating devices and are about to call off searches for surface debris. The small robotic sub will be scanning the ocean in a large area, bigger than the city of Los Angeles.

Technicians on the Australian ship Ocean Shield were set to start using the underwater robotic vehicle in the Indian Ocean Monday afternoon. They planned to send it 2.8 miles underwater down to the seabed and use its side-scanning sonar arrays to look for wreckage from the plane.

"It is time to go underwater," Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said, announcing the new phase of operations. He is coordinating the search from Perth, Australia.

Unless the robot submarine, called a "Bluefin-21," gets lucky, the process could take a while: The U.S. Navy, which loaned the sub to the search team, said mapping the area where the plane most likely disappeared could take six weeks to two months.

## Surveying Area With Sonar, Then Camera

The 16-foot, 1,650-pound sub moves at a walking pace and will be searching an area of about 600 square miles. Houston said the first day's work would cover about 15 square miles.

"The whole key on these searches is you have to be methodical and persistent, and they can take quite a bit of time," said David Kelly. He is president and chief executive of Bluefin Robotics, the Quincy, Massachusette, company that makes the vessel.

The Bluefin-21 operates on a 24-hour cycle. It takes two hours each way to get to the seafloor and back and can search for 16 hours. Once it surfaces, it requires four hours to download the information it gathered and prepare the machine for its next dive.

It hovers about 150 feet above the ocean floor as it scans a half-mile-wide swath. While it's combing through the pitch-black waters, the Bluefin-21 uses sonar to gather data that will yield a high-resolution, 3-D map of the seafloor.

If something promising is detected, the sonar can be swapped out for high-definition cameras. When the cameras are being used, the sub hovers just 15 feet off the seafloor. It takes a series of overlapping pictures that provide a compound image.

## Sub Below, Crew Above On Ship

The depth at which the Bluefin-21 will work — 2.8 miles — is hard even for oceanographers to fathom.  It is just as deep as the height of Mount Whitney in California, the tallest mountain in the 48 U.S. states between Canada and Mexico..

While the robotic sub does its duties, search crews aboard the Ocean Shield and other vessels will have no idea whether it has found anything. It relays basic information such as depth and power remaining, but Kelly said the connection is spotty and at a "low bandwidth."

"You give it a track and it goes," said Charitha Pattiaratchi, a professor of oceanography at the University of Western Australia. "It doesn't transfer any (images) or anything while it's down there."

The decision to deploy the Bluefin-21 came on day 38 of the search for the plane. It vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. Searchers operating more than 1,300 miles off the western coast of Australia had waited to deploy the sub. They were hoping to further narrow the search area based on acoustic signals transmitted by beacons on the plane's two black boxes. The black boxes are used in the event of an accident to help determine the cause.

## Calling Off Ocean Surface Search

On four occasions, a pinger locator towed by the Ocean Shield picked up transmissions from what investigators strongly suspect were one or both of the black boxes. But there have been no new transmissions in the last six days. It appears investigators have concluded that the batteries on those devices — which are supposed to last 30 days — have run out.

Meanwhile, Houston indicated that the so-far unsuccessful search for debris on the ocean surface would probably be called off in the next two to three days. The lookouts scanning the waters from the air and from ships would return home.

"The chances of any floating material being recovered have greatly diminished," Houston said. "It will be appropriate for Australia and its partners to decide the way ahead later this week."

It's a "tough call to make," said Van Gurley, a retired U.S. Navy captain and senior manager at Metron Inc. Metron helped locate the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 after it crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.

"I'm of the opinion that if they haven't found surface debris field by now, they're not going to. Then it becomes almost a political decision: At what point do you suspend that operation? Given that you haven't found anything on the ocean bottom yet, and the families are eager for new information," Gurley said.

"It sounds like Angus Houston said some words to prepare everybody that they're going to, in a couple days, shut down all the air and surface search operations," he added.
