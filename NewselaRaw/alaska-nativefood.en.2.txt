ANCHORAGE, Alaska — First it was musk ox stew. Then the Alaska nursing home cooked musk ox meatloaf for the elderly Inupiat residents.

The response by the people who live at the nursing home and their visiting family members was immediate. "'It was the bomb!'" is how the home administrator Val Kreil recalled one young relative describing it. "You don't hear that every day about meatloaf."

The nursing home is located in Kotzebue, a busy city in northwest Alaska. It is adding traditional foods donated by hunters to the regular menu. This practice has been gaining interest nationally under a new federal law.

## Traditional Foods Are Welcome Menu Additions

The law that passed last year was largely modeled after an Alaska law. It allows approved donations to nursing homes, child nutrition programs and other places where care is provided. These include programs and facilities run by Native American tribes and tribal groups.

Traditional foods that can be bought, such as corn and bison, are already served in some facilities. The new law will allow a wider selection of foods to be purchased. Some of these will include game such as venison, moose and caribou.

"It opens doors for our tribes and their citizens to continue having access to traditional foods," said Leslie Wheelock. She is director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's office of tribal relations. The USDA is a government department that makes food safety rules. "It eases the way, I think, tremendously."

The Birds Springs chapter of the Navajo Nation in Arizona is developing a 20-bed nursing home. It is expected to open next year. The tribe hopes the menu will include elk and deer, along with other familiar foods like squash and beans from Navajo farmers.

Thomas Walker is a planner with the chapter. "We owe it to our elders to get them what their lifestyles are accustomed to, and what they respond to," he said.

## Local Meat Processing Plant Helps Out

Under Alaska's law, other groups have served traditional foods in their facilities over the years, said Lorinda Lhotka. She is with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). The DEC is a government department that protects Alaska's nature.  

In Kotzebue, however, a new plant just down the road will help the nursing home achieve its goal. The plant processes and stores the meat of animals donated by local hunters. This partnership with the 18-bed nursing home is unique for the time being.

Both facilities are run by the Maniilaq Association, a tribal health care group. 

The first meat processed was from a musk ox that had been hunted and donated by the state. The residents got their first taste in early September. Until then, they had to wait for monthly family potlucks to enjoy the food they grew up hunting and eating. The weather is so cold in Alaska, people cannot always farm. Many of these elder Inupiats had to hunt or fish for their food. Not only are their bodies used to eating meat, but hunting is an important part of their culture. 

## Musk Ox And Caribou Stew? Yes, Please!

Most recently, the plant processed caribou meat for the nursing home. The nursing home is named Utugganaat Inaat, which is Inupiat for "a place for elders." Some of the meat went into caribou stew with potatoes.

"It was wonderful," 80-year-old resident Mary Reed said. "I haven't had it in a while."

Before the plant could open in July, Maniilaq officials had to work through a puzzle of rules set by different government agencies.

First, Maniilaq officials figured they had to get USDA approval. As it turned out, the USDA did not have food safety rules for handling donated moose and caribou meat, just buffalo, bison and elk. It turned out that Alaska did have rules in place for handling those kinds of meat safely.

## Local Meat Can Save Money

Maniilaq officials said it is too early to determine how much money can be saved by accepting donated meats.

Getting food shipped to Alaska is expensive because parts of the state are so remote. It costs up to $100 to purchase a 40-pound case of ground beef, plus 78 cents a pound to fly it from the big city of Anchorage. Using ground musk ox or other donated meat instead is expected to help save money, officials said.

The joy that elders receive from eating their favorite traditional foods is the real payoff for some.

Many Western foods are picked at or left on plates. However, traditional meals tend to be gobbled up, Cyrus Harris said. As a Maniilaq employee, he hunts for the needs of elders.

"It makes a huge difference," Harris said.
