Steep and uneven, dome-shaped Morro Rock rises 576 feet above the shore of California's coast. The rocky mound is an attractive site for climbers and a sacred one for two Native American tribes.

Though its beauty is undisputed, its status as a sacred place has led to a dispute between the tribes. For more than a decade, the groups have been fighting over the rights to Morro Rock.

The Salinan Indians say the landmark may be climbed only on certain dates, according to what the heavens allow. The Northern Chumash tribe believes it should never be tread upon, only appreciated from afar.

The feud turned into a legal debate last December when the tiny Northern Chumash Tribal Council filed a document in court arguing that the Salinan Tribe should not be allowed to climb Moro Rock. They maintained it was a registered Chumash Nation sacred site.

## Sacred To Both

According to Chumash tradition, the rock was called Lisamu, and positioned at the mouth of a magnificent estuary. Its placement held significance to the tribal members.

"Lisamu is alive with life that needs to be protected and honored, not trampled upon," the tribal council has written.

The Salinans' traditions are a little different. They believe the rock was called Lesamo and located where the Falcon of ancient legend killed the serpent Teleekatapelta.

On a recent gray morning, Fred Collins, a member of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, stood at the base of the rock and looked skyward as a peregrine falcon glided over the jagged peaks.

"This is a rookery for unbelievable birds," Collins said. "And it's a migratory path for so many. Aside from the sacred issues, why would you want to interfere with that?"

## Atop The Mountain

Morro Rock has been a state historic landmark and peregrine falcon preserve since 1968. Though hiking is off limits for the public, the Salinans have been climbing it since about 2000, when an elder from the tribe sought a permit to conduct rituals atop the volcanic mass. The permit was approved.

The California Department of Parks and Recreation allows "reasonable requests for religious practices to take place on state park property," Joe Mette said in 2002. Mette is the former district superintendent for the department.

Since the state approved the request, the Salinan Indians are allowed to climb the rock for religious ceremonies twice a year, during the summer and winter solstices.

Elder John Burch, who applied for the Salinan permit, practices a traditional ritual atop the mountain that has been passed down for generations. He will sit alone at the top in blackness and starlight and enter an altered state, asking for spiritual guidance. He finishes the night of prayer feeling as if he is "floating on air."

Photographs of past climbs show tribal members carrying backpacks as they scramble up brush-covered boulders to forge a trail along the jagged incline.

## Chumash: We Weren't Asked

The rock's rugged landscape makes for a tough climb. In the past, climbers have had to be rescued after failed attempts to reach the top. Last month, three 15-year-old boys who were trying to scale the east face had to be saved, and 10 days later, another climber who got stuck part of the way up needed assistance.

The Northern Chumash Tribal Council maintains that it was never consulted about the arrangement. They feel they should been part of the conversation since their 35 members were directly affected by the action, accordingly to the tribe's attorney, Dennis J. Balsamo.

Under California state law, the parks department is required to consult with Native American tribes when their sacred sites are affected by projects or policies.

The Chumash are trying hard to disprove that the Salinans have claim to the site. As further evidence, they have gone as far as saying the historic boundary between the two tribes rests some 40 miles to the north at Ragged Point in Monterey County. To support their claim, they cited research by anthropologist Robert O. Gibson.

"There is no historic or religious connection between the ancient Salinan People and Morro Rock," Balsamo wrote.

## "It's A Magical Place"

The Chumash don't mind if other tribes gather for ceremonies at the base of the rock, Collins said. It is the climbing they have a problem with.

"Morro Rock has such a great presence along our coast," Collins said. "Fishermen and people of old times always viewed Morro Rock as a landmark in the ocean with special energies. It's a magical place."

Morro Rock is one of the Nine Sisters, a row of volcanic mounds stretching a dozen miles from San Luis Obispo, California, to the sea. Others are larger, but Morro Rock rests at the water's edge.

If the climbing controversy isn't resolved by the time the summer solstice rolls around in June, Balsamo said, the Chumash tribe may be forced to seek a court order to stop the Salinans from ascending the rock.

"We hope we can come to a resolution on this issue in a positive way," Collins said. "But we're willing to stand up and not get kicked around."
