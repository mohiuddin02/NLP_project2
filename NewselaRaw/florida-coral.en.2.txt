WASHINGTON — South Florida's coral reefs are a natural wonder. They are huge and beautiful underwater structures made out of limestone deposited by tiny animals called coral polyps. Thousands of kinds of fish, as well as other kinds of animals and plants, call them home.

And the reefs bring in a lot of money to the area too — as much as $6 billion — because they are popular with divers, boaters and fishermen.

The reefs were formed over thousands of years. They took shape as free-swimming coral larvae attached themselves to submerged ridges in warm, shallow waters.

But for many years all has not been well with South Florida's reefs. They have suffered serious damage and disease.

Now, at last, they appear to be recovering.

## Recent Study Raises Hopes

In recent years, the area's reefs have been spared from major storms and ship groundings. This has allowed them to survive and even grow offshore.

A study released this month brought more good news: Coral reefs may be able to adapt to warmer sea temperatures. This is significant because [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) is making sea temperatures go up.

But, scientists said, reefs can only take a limited degree of gradual warming. Carbon emissions must be reduced to keep water temperatures from getting too high.

Carbon emissions are anything that raises the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They are a major type of so-called greenhouse gasses. Greenhouse gasses cause what is known as the greenhouse effect, which is making global temperatures gradually rise.

Still, the study is raising hopes that Florida's reefs will survive.

Florida is a low-lying state just above sea level. And it is home to 84 percent of the nation's reefs. This makes it especially threatened by sea-level rise and global warming. It also makes it a perfect place to check on the progress of conservation.

## Still, Extra Help Needed

"We haven't had a large crash in the population of corals. And we have seen some good signs that the [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) — staghorn coral — continues to be abundant and may even be increasing in abundance in some places," said conservationist Richard Dodge. "So that's the good news."

But, he added, "The bad news is: There are still some coral diseases out there. We still worry about bleaching, which appears to be caused by warmer water temperatures. But we are lucky in South Florida to avoid a lot of hurricanes and tropical storms lately." Such storms, Dodge said, can cause major damage to reefs.

The reef recovery also has been helped by improved sewage systems. These prevent polluted water from seeping into the ocean. Greater public awareness has also led boaters to avoid dropping anchors on the fragile reefs. And moving ship anchorages farther offshore has prevented damaging ship groundings.

People now realize, conservationist Chris Bergh said, that they need to take better care of coral reefs. And reefs will need extra help to get them through "a stressful time, as the climate continues to change."

"We have hit bottom and are ever so slowly seeing some recovery," he said. "There are a lot of big and expensive things that still need to be done, and I guess the most expensive of all is getting a handle on the root causes of climate change." And that essentially means, Bergh said, getting a handle on greenhouse gas emissions.

## Environmental And Economic Mission

To help restore damaged reefs, scientists are growing baby corals in indoor nurseries. Once grown, they are transplanted offshore.

The struggle to preserve reefs has turned into an economic as well as an environmental mission. This is because of their importance for recreation and tourism.

Studies in 2000 and 2004 found that reefs along the southeast Florida coast generated $6 billion of economic activity. They also supported 71,000 jobs.

"It's probably a lot more than that by now," said diving shop owner Jeff Torode. "Without reefs, you don't have fish. Without fish, you don't have divers, you don't have snorkelers." And without reefs "you don't have something to protect those shorelines. For me to be in business, it's in my best interest to protect the coral reefs."

Reefs are a big draw to tourists and their spending money.

"There's no doubt that if we destroy those beautiful reefs, there will be some significant economic impact," said tourism expert Abraham Pizam. "It's an important element that should be preserved for generations to come."
