CHICAGO â€” Nik Wallenda is a tightrope walker. He is not like the tightrope walkers at the circus. The wires that Wallenda walks across often go between buildings, hundreds of feet above the ground. There are no nets to catch him if he falls. Sometimes he walks on wires with his eyes closed.

Last Sunday, millions of people saw Wallenda break a world record. He walked across a wire between two huge buildings in Chicago. The buildings were Marina City's west tower and the Leo Burnett Building. The wire was about 500 feet above the ground. Not only that, it sloped upward at a 19-degree angle.

Mathematicians measure steepness with angles. A 0-degree angle is a flat line. A 90-degree angle is a line that goes straight up. Wallenda said that his tightrope went up at a 19-degree angle.

Wallenda was not just walking on a rope in the wind. He was also walking uphill.

## Class Double-Checks The Numbers

According to the Guinness World Records people, Wallenda's balancing act was the highest "uphill" tightrope walk ever.

After the tightrope act, a class of 10th- and 11th-grade math students at Hinsdale South High School in Illinois took a closer look. Their math did not match Wallenda's.

The mystery began on Monday, the day after Wallenda set his record. Math teacher Linda Korbus gave her class a fun project. She asked students to figure out the angle of Wallenda's tightrope for themselves.

The students used information supplied by the Discovery Channel, which sponsored Wallenda's walk. They knew Marina City was 588 feet tall, and the Leo Burnett Building was 671 feet tall. They also knew that Wallenda walked a total of 454 feet. So what was the angle? How steep was Wallenda's walk?

## And The Answer Is ...

They came to an answer: 10.5 degrees. However, Wallenda's team said the angle was supposed to be steeper. They said he walked up an angle of 19 degrees.

Korbus said that she was surprised. She expected the class to arrive at the same answer as the Wallenda team.

Korbus pulled out her own pencil to do the math herself. She got the same answer as her students. Based on the numbers, the tightrope could not have been 19 degrees.

She and her students were confused. Was there some added height that they did not know about? Was Wallenda's team wrong?

As it turned out, the explanation was slightly more complicated.

## Last-Minute Fixes Messes With Math

Korbus' math class did not consider that tightropes are not straight. Because of gravity, tightrope wires dip in the middle, like a U. This means that the steepness of Wallenda's wire was different in different places. The wire was curved. After sagging in the middle, the wire curved upward, increasing in steepness.

Small wires were also attached to Wallenda's tightrope to keep it from moving. Along with gravity, these wires pulled down on the middle of a tightrope. As a result, they made the second half of the walk steeper.

Wallenda and his team decided to tighten these supporting wires at the last minute. This pulled the middle of the tightrope down even more. This last-minute change made the wire more curved.

With all these things affecting the steepness of the tightrope, Korbus' class project turned out to be unexpectedly tricky. The angle of the wire was different at certain points along the way. Korbus' students' answer of 10.5 degrees was correct, but only if the wire was a straight line.

In addition to setting a world record for the highest incline tightrope walk, Wallenda also set a world record for the highest blindfolded tightrope walk.
