NEW YORK — When the ALS Association began using its now-famous ice bucket challenge, it didn't have big hopes. It was simply trying out a fun way to raise money for the fight against Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, ALS affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. In many cases, it causes death within three to five years.

As it turned out, the ice bucket campaign has been incredibly successful. Indeed, the campaign's success has been so enormous that it is making other charitable organizations rethink their own tactics. Many are now trying to come up with other ways to connect with a younger generation of possible donors.

Since July 29, the ALS Association has raised more than $53.3 million from 1.1 million new donors. The ice bucket challenge is now one of the most successful fundraising campaigns in history. It has gone viral — that is, knowledge of it has spread rapidly, from person to person, on the Internet.

Thousands of people have posted videos of themselves getting buckets of ice water dumped over their heads. They challenge others to do the same — or to donate money to the ALS Association. Many well-known people have taken part, including Taylor Swift and Oprah Winfrey.

## It's OK To Be Silly

Business school professor Brian Mittendorf is an expert on raising money. The ice bucket challenge, he says, has shown it's OK to be silly for a good cause.

"Normally the model is to find people who are passionate about a cause and then ask for donations or to educate people and then seek out donations. (The ice bucket challenge is) something that's fun that people can do ... people are taking part in it and then taking the info and donating," Mittendorf said.

The viral nature of the effort surprised even the ALS Association.

"This level of unprecedented giving is (something) I don't think this country has seen before outside of a disaster or emergency," said ALS Association spokeswoman Carrie Munk. "We had no idea it would get to this point."

Who should get credit for making this a viral sensation depends on whom you ask. Some say it began taking off earlier this month when friends of a 29-year-old Boston man with ALS did a group challenge.

## Making Icy Waves

The campaign's success has also demonstrated that the average Joe or Jane can make waves. The ice bucket challenge, Munk said, shows "the power of individuals" to "really make a difference."

Lucretia Gilbert is the director of the Pink Agenda, which raises money for breast cancer research. She believes the runaway success of the ice bucket challenge will make other charities try new approaches. More than anything else, she said, it will encourage them to get creative on so-called social media. The term social media refers to websites and apps that encourage people to share and communicate. Examples include Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

The ice bucket challenge, Gilbert said, is "a very simple thing and that's kind of the beauty of it. Everyone can do this challenge."

Employing technology for fundraising campaigns is not new, of course. Back in 1966, when the Muscular Dystrophy Association held its first Labor Day weekend telethon, the idea of using television to raise money was a novel idea. Since then, the association's annual telethon has become one of the most enduring fundraising campaigns. Last year, it raised $59.6 million in contributions.

One of the greatest challenges for fundraisers, though, is asking the same people for money year after year. Some believe that successful social media campaigns could solve that problem.

## Pie-In-The-Face Next?

Mindy Bailey works for JDRF, a foundation that raises money to fight Type 1 diabetes. People, she said, want to come up with an idea that will fuel donations to her foundation.

"We have had a lot of people reach out to us and say, 'Hey, we're going to do the ice bucket challenge,'" Bailey said. "Recently we had a woman say, 'I'm thinking of doing a pie-in-your-face idea.' The wheels have been turning."

However, not everyone is a fan of the public approach of the ice bucket challenge.

"I just think it seems hokey and far too gimmicky and a hot trend and part of the whole 'me' culture of 'Oh look at me — pay attention to me,'" said Cameron Mitchell of New York. "The charity part seems like an afterthought."

## It Got People Talking

Some even argue that it's wasteful to dump water, even for a cause. They say that is especially true in places like California, where there is a drought.

The California Water Board has weighed in on the subject.

"People should always use good judgment whenever they use water while we're in a drought. On the other hand, we understand that this is a charitable event," said Water Board official George N. Kostyroko.

Annoyed, impressed or otherwise, people are talking about the ice bucket challenge. Even if they don't donate, Munk says, the campaign has raised public awareness, a major goal of the organization.

Just a few years ago, she said, only about 50 percent of Americans knew what ALS is.

"We're really looking forward" to seeing how much that changes, she said.
