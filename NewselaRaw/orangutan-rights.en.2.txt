For the first time anywhere, an ape has received the same basic rights as a human. The rights were granted to a female orangutan living at the Buenos Aires Zoo in Argentina. An Argentine court ruled in her favor on Dec. 18, 2014.

The ruling will change forever the life of the orangutan. It may also boost the relatively new movement to set other animals free.

The orangutan is named Sandra. In Argentina, at least, Sandra now has the right to life, liberty and freedom from harm.

"The ruling was historic because before, a nonhuman primate like Sandra was considered an object," said Andrés Gil Dominguez. He is with the Association of Professional Lawyers for Animal Rights in Argentina. The group filed the legal papers for Sandra, claiming that she had been unfairly denied her freedom.

## Group Filed Habeas Corpus

The court's decision will lead to a search for a home for Sandra outside the zoo's cages where she has lived for the last 20 years. She had been born in captivity in Germany in 1986. The Argentine justice system will now put together a committee of experts. They will try to find a sanctuary or another home for Sandra, as long as the aging orangutan is healthy enough to travel.

Sandra's case began when a group filed habeas corpus for her in November. Habeas corpus is a Latin term. It is used in legal cases in which lawyers believe someone has been unfairly imprisoned. It asks for the prisoner to be brought to court. It failed at first. However, it was later heard by an appeals court which decided in her favor.

Interest in freeing Sandra began in 2012 when the staff at the Buenos Aires Zoo, led by zoologist Claudio Bertonatti, thought of sending the ape to a sanctuary. They never took any action, however.

Sandra's case will likely energize other legal efforts for other animals—in particular, 17 chimpanzees in zoos throughout Argentina.  "Considering that they are very close to human primates, it is an absurdity that they are still in captivity in prison," says primatologist Aldo Giúdice of the University of Buenos Aires. A primate is a member of the group of animals that includes humans, apes and monkeys.

## Other Court Cases May Come

Before Sandra's case, other legal claims were filed for zoo primates in Argentina. Outside of Argentina, there was a case in 2005 for a chimpanzee named Suiça in a zoo in San Salvador, Brazil. Suiça died before the case could be judged. In 2012, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) tried to use the U.S. Constitution's 13th Amendment, which ended slavery, to gain freedom for orcas, also known as killer whales.

In 2013, the Nonhuman Rights Project made legal claims on behalf of four chimpanzees in New York state. They were rejected, but the group said it is appealing the decision.

"With our claims, we are looking for imprisoned nonhuman animals to be returned to their natural environment," said Steven Wise, president of the organization. The group counts Jane Goodall as a member. Goodall is famous for studying primate behavior in the wild.

The growing support for freeing animals comes out of 40 years of primate research. "Studies such as those by Dian Fossey, Jane Goodall and other scientists helped to position the great apes as people," Giúdice said.

Scientific research, he added, has shown that the apes are able to feel, suffer and think, and see themselves as individuals. He said humans cannot allow them to "suffer in prison."
