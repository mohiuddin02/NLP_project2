DHARAMSALA, India — Gonpo Tso was born a princess, but her story is anything but a fairy tale.

As a young girl, she dressed in fur robes and lived in a castle in a Tibetan village. Her palace had a room large enough to hold one thousand Buddhist monks.

Then one night in 1958, when she was 7 years old, everything changed. The Chinese government's army showed up at the castle and forced her family to leave.

Her father, a Tibetan king, was summoned to a meeting. Chinese officials ordered Gonpo, her mother and sister, into a car and drove them away from the lands that the family had ruled for generations.

## What Was Once Mei Kingdom

Gonpo has spent the years since trying to find herself and remain connected to her Tibetan culture, but it has not been easy. She has lost almost everyone she ever loved.

"When people hear I am the daughter of a king, they imagine I must be really spoiled, but they don't know what I have experienced," Gonpo says.

Now in her early 60s, Gonpo looks nothing like a princess. She is shy and slow to open up about her past.

"I try not to talk about it because it makes me sad," she apologizes.

Gonpo is the heir to the Mei kingdom, which until the mid-20th century was centered in Aba, a mostly Tibetan city in China's Sichuan province. The kingdom no longer exists.

Until the 1950s, the area was ruled by Gonpo's family and her father was the king.

The king reported neither to the Tibetan government nor to Chinese authorities. The people of his kingdom considered themselves to be independent.

## Enter The Cultural Revolution

In 1949, China invaded central Tibet. Knowing just how powerful the Chinese military government was, Gonpo's father instructed his people to not resist the Chinese, and for several years Gonpo's family stayed in Aba.

Later, Chinese officials forced him to give up his power and removed his family from their home. The family was sent to live in Chengdu, a city in China, while the rest of the villagers back in Aba starved as the Chinese took over. Things were fine for Gonpo and her family at first. They attended an elite school and her father was given a job in the Chinese government. However, the family's situation was soon to change.

In 1966, the Chinese government launched the Cultural Revolution. China's communist government owned all of the nation's property and controlled how people bought and sold things. The government went after people who it thought disagreed with the Cultural Revolution. Gonpa's parents sent her away for safety, dropping her off at the train, giving her a bag of candies for the ride.

She would never see them again. Soon afterward, her mother disappeared and her father drowned.

## Finding A New Life

In 1968, Gonpo was sent to work on a farm 2,000 miles away from Chengdu.

Her work was physically demanding. Some days she had to walk 10 miles. The one bright spot on the farm was a handsome young Chinese man who had been exiled as well and was living on the farm. Over the years, they fell in love and eventually married.

Gonpo and her husband were allowed to leave the compound and settle in his hometown in eastern China. Gonpo went to college and got a job teaching music and Chinese in elementary school. She had two daughters and settled into a quiet life, her colleagues completely unaware of her history.

Everything changed, however, when someone discovered her identity and reported her to the Chinese government. Her family was moved into a fancy apartment and Gonpo received special treatment from the Chinese government.

## There Was Always Something Missing

Gonpo was not unhappy in China but she was missing something. She was allowed in 1984 to visit Aba. There was much destruction and she wept. Gonpa felt her Tibertan culture slipping away. She decided to go to India, the birthplace of Buddhism — the religion of Tibetans — and the home of the Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama.

When Gonpo left for India in 1989, she took her older daughter, then 10, but left her husband and 9-year-old in China with promises to return after a few months. Once there, she started Tibetan lessons and was welcomed with open arms by the Dalai Lama, who asked her to serve in the local government.

Once Gonpo settled in, she was not eager to return to China. The months stretched into years and Gonpo did not see her husband and younger daughter again until 2005, when they came to visit her in Dharamsala, India.

As the only living child of the Mei King, she felt a duty to stay.

She knew it made her husband sad, however she said that he understood that "the issue of Tibet was bigger than family things."

Gonpa is a familiar figure in Dharamsala, where everybody now addresses her by her title: princess.
