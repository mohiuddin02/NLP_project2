MIAMI — At 15,000 feet deep, the wreck of the El Faro sits in one of the least explored places on Earth. The ship rests in a lonely ocean grave as deep as the Rocky Mountains are tall. This is a place with no light, crushing pressure, temperatures just above freezing and little life beyond microbes, giant worms and strange tube-eyed fish.

Even the most advanced submarine cannot venture this deep.

In such daunting conditions, federal investigators have turned to a sophisticated unmanned submersible as they search for clues to why the ship sank. The El Faro went down off the Bahamas during Hurricane Joaquin. The submersible is a vehicle that can go deep underwater and can be operated remotely from the surface.

## Deep Dive With A Robotic Vehicle

The type of submersible investigators are using is known as a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV. It is equipped with cameras to survey the ship's hull and robotic arms to cut cables and grab important evidence, like the ship's black box.

First developed by the U.S. Navy, the boxy ROV may be the last best hope for unraveling the El Faro's fateful voyage. Investigators hope to determine exactly why it sank last month within minutes of a final distress call, killing all 33 crew members.

The ROV is "very capable, but very complex to operate," said Justin Manley, an ocean engineer. Manley piloted the same ROV, called a CURV 21, for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a government agency, when it mapped the Titanic, perhaps the most famous shipwreck in history.

## Why The Black Box Matters

After sonar detected the El Faro resting upright on the ocean floor, the U.S. Navy ship Apache deployed the deep-diving robotic vehicle to document the ship's condition and locate the black box, called a voyage data recorder.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the federal agency investigating the El Faro shipwreck, has so far released little information about its findings. The NTSB did report that the ROV has inspected the left and right sides of the vessel, and that the bridge, which contains the crucial recorder, is no longer attached to the ship.

Finding the recorder is critical. In addition to navigation data, it contains audio that could let investigators, and families, hear what the crew said during the ship's last moments. Efforts to track its "pinger" signal across a 260-square-mile search area have so far failed.

There is also a possibility of recovering something that may bring some measure of comfort to families — bodies of the crew that went down with the ship.

"It's a strange world of reality that has hit these families," said John Moore, the attorney who is representing the families of two crew members. "They would like to have closure. I think recovering their loved ones is a step in that direction."

But the chances of that happening are remote. NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said investigators do not plan on trying to enter the vessel. In addition, search teams have not yet located the bridge of the ship, where the captain and some of the crew would have been stationed during the El Faro's battle with Joaquin.

So far, good weather has allowed the crew manning the CURV 21 to work around-the-clock, Knudson said. However, forecasts for stormy weather and rough seas may hamper the search, which Knudson initially expected would take 15 days.

## CURV 21 Pilot Needs Patience

Capable of diving to 20,000 feet, the CURV 21 is the latest model of the cable-operated vehicle developed by the Navy. Fewer than 50 exist, Manley said. They have increasingly been used to try to unravel the mysteries of deep sea wrecks, including the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that crashed in the Indian Ocean in 2014 and a U.S. Air Force F-16 that plunged into the North Pacific six years ago.

The CURV 21 can withstand the harsh conditions of the Abyssopelagic zone near the ocean's bottom. But this ROV can still be a bear to pilot. Manley compared it to standing atop the Empire State building and using a camera the size of a yo-yo, dangled from a string.

"It can be incredibly frustrating," he said.

## Deficient Ship Or Act Of Nature?

Investigators will probably start by sweeping the outside of the ship, something called "mowing the lawn." They will use this tactic to look for clues about the hull's condition when the El Faro sank.

Ships as big as the El Faro — at 790 feet, it is twice the length of a football field — often have airtight compartments. Such giant ships are designed to float, even if water starts leaking into one or more compartments.

In his final message from the ship, Captain Michael Davidson reported that the ship had lost propulsion and a hatch had blown open. The open hatch allowed water to enter one compartment. Davidson, who knew he was approaching a worsening hurricane and told his bosses that he planned to sail south of the storm, likely would have secured all the hatches.

"In this case, you have a crew that is well-trained judging from their maritime backgrounds and licensing," Moore, the attorney, said, pointing out the crew's seafaring backgrounds. "All evidence points to the ship itself as having deficiencies."

The ship may have suffered some damage when it landed on the ocean floor. But Moore said an expert should be able to determine whether damage occurred from impact or on the surface as the ship drifted powerless within 35 miles of Joaquin's eye.

Investigators may also try to determine the condition of the ship's life rafts or locate a life boat that remains missing. Moore believes video taken of the wreck might also help explain why three different distress signals sounded at once.

"That effectively means all three were in contact with sea water at the same time," he said. "It's not like weather or rain. They're in the ocean at that point."

> UPDATE: Crews working to find the black box for the El Faro were unsuccessful in finding the black box and recovering any of the bodies. And the search has since been called off.
