Some people are not kind to animals. They hit or kick their pets. They do not give them enough food. What they do is against the law. Police can arrest them. They might go to jail. Then the animals are taken from their homes.

For a long time Chicago had a problem with the animals. Chicago is a city in the state of Illinois. The animals had no place to go if their owners went to jail. So the animals were in jail too.

People called it dog jail. Judges and courts did not care for these pets the right way.

## A Plan To Help The Dogs

Court cases move slowly. The animals would sometimes be in jail for years. Most dogs were put to sleep when the owner's case ended. The vets who killed the dogs made sure they died fast. They were not in pain.

People who fight for animal rights in Chicago were angry. They said this was unfair. Then they came up with a plan. They worked with a group called Safe Humane Chicago. The group started the Court Case Dogs program in 2010. It helped to get the animals out of cages.

## Happy, Healthy Dogs Again

The program works with the dogs to make them healthy. It helps dogs in many ways. It finds new homes for them. There is even a picture book about some of the dogs.

The program is the first like it in the United States.

Only 2 out of every 10 dogs in jail used to get out alive. Now 7 out of 10 dogs live. So far the program has taken care of 760 dogs.

Cynthia Bathurst runs Safe Humane Chicago. "These are the dogs everyone should care about," she says.
