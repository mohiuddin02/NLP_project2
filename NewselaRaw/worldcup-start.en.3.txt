SAO PAULO — Brazil last hosted the World Cup in 1950. Brazilians have waited 64 years for the World Cup to return. Now it's back in their home country.

"Tudo bem" — all good — as the Brazilians like to say.

Well, just about.

The country that sees itself as the soul of football, which is called soccer in the U.S., kicked off one of the most troubled World Cups ever. On the one hand, the nation erupted in excitement. On the other, harmful tear gas drifted from small protests across Brazil.

Some Brazilians are angry about World Cup spending of $11.5 billion in a nation with tens of millions of poor. A good showing by the Brazilian team could relieve much — but not all — of that anger.

## Protests Across Brazil

A few hundred protesters gathered in scattered demonstrations in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Brasilia and Belo Horizonte. Police kept them under control. It wasn't close to the chaos that accompanied last year's Confederations Cup tournament. During that soccer tournament, hundreds of thousands took to the streets of Brazil.

After a funky opening ceremony featuring J-Lo in low-cut sparkling green, Brazil's beloved national team took to the field. The star-studded Brazilians were not great in their opening match. But they made a solid start. The goal is a sixth world title.

The country roared to life Thursday with a joyous 3-1 win for the home team in a stadium barely readied on time for the first of 64 matches in 12 cities. The next month will consume planet _futebol_. It will also showcase Brazil's growth as a world power, problems and all.

Brazil played Croatia first. The Croatians were tough, but didn't win.

## Put Through The Wringer

The game had everything true fans love — passion, drama, spectacle and goals. Brazilian fans call themselves "torcidas" — coming from the Portuguese word "to twist." The word symbolizes how football puts them through the wringer. This match watched by millions around the world certainly did that.

"I'm very emotional, happy, and happy that it's over," said spectator Ricieri Garbelini, visibly drained. "I was nervous for five minutes at the beginning, and at the end."

Brazil made a nightmare start. Brazilian defender Marcelo looked stunned when he scored an own-goal that gave Croatia a 1-0 lead after just 11 minutes. The crowd of 62,103 wailed and grown men watching in bars let out howls of despairing laughter. Even with all the promises from government officials that Brazil would be ready, there were problems at the stadium: The lighting failed in one corner, flickering off and on.

The mood lifted when Neymar lived up to his hype as the team's biggest star. He scored in the 29th minute to tie the game for Brazil . An ear-splitting roar was unleashed from the crowd and across the nation.

## Cheers And Boos

The love-hate relationship Brazilians have developed with this World Cup was on display. The crowd made hairs stand on end with its moving interpretation of the national anthem. But then they started chanting against unpopular Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. There were also boos for FIFA, the governing organization of football.

Neymar scored his second goal from the penalty spot in the 71st minute. Neymar thrust his arms in the air and the nation did likewise. Oscar got the third in the 90th minute.

But the party wasn't all fun-loving. In Sao Paulo, more than 300 protesters gathered along a highway leading to the stadium. Police fired canisters of tear gas and stun grenades to push them back.

"I'm totally against the Cup," said protester and university student Tameres Mota. "We're in a country where the money doesn't go to the community, and meanwhile we see all these millions spent on stadiums."
