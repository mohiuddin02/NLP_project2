WASHINGTON — It's an old story: A team of explorers braves unknown dangers to settle a wild frontier, and then — almost as quickly — bureaucrats tie things up with red tape, a nickname for government regulations.

This time, the frontier is outer space. And the regulators are from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which licenses commercial-rocket launches in addition to monitoring the airlines.

The FAA has so far been limited by one major loophole: Once a spacecraft reaches orbit, it is largely free of regulation.

But that could change soon.

## Space Regulations Are Few

This past week, FAA officials and space lawyers began seriously discussing rules of the road for outer space. The focus was on such things as mining rights and safety practices.

There have been some broad guidelines issued in the past. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, for example, prohibits nations from claiming the moon. But space regulations have been few and far between. In part that's because few countries — let alone private companies — have had the ability to put people or products into orbit.

But the commercial space industry has grown rapidly in recent years.

In 2012, the California company SpaceX became the first commercial-rocket company to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. And space tourism companies are kicking into high gear too: Both Virgin Galactic and XCOR Aerospace, for example, may fly passengers to suborbital space for the first time later this year.

Those efforts have caught the attention of Congress, the administration and industry. There is now an increasing focus on how to ensure that people and property stay safe in space.

The various new proposals address a broad range of concerns. There are, for example, attempts to figure out how to limit the amount of dangerous "space junk" shed by spacecraft. There are also efforts to find a way to coordinate traffic in Earth's orbit.

## Some Seek Space Rules

There will likely soon be more "commercial-transportation vehicles" in space, FAA administrator George Nield said this week. "It is time to consider closing the current regulatory and safety gap between launch and re-entry."

Nield was speaking to House members as part of a hearing on regulating the space industry.

Of particular interest is the law that largely bars the FAA from restricting commercial efforts to launch humans into space. This is due to be phased out next year.

The purpose of the law, according to congressional documents, was to ensure that "the FAA would not overregulate the industry before it had the opportunity to grow."

U.S. Rep. Steven Palazzo, a Republican from Mississippi, argued Tuesday that the law is still needed.

Palazzo is chairman of the House space subcommittee. He said he fears what would happen "if the FAA begins trampling on these companies with regulations." We might not, he said, ever see "the promise of commercial human spaceflight realized."

But some in the space industry said a few more rules would be a good thing.

## "Old Laws Of The Sea" In Space?

Regulation is unavoidable, said Mike Gold, a top executive with Bigelow Aerospace of Nevada, which builds inflatable space dwellings. "The question is who should be doing the regulating?"

With the FAA sidelined, the task of crafting regulations for space travel increasingly could fall to NASA. That would not be a good thing, said Gold, who leads an FAA advisory panel.

"NASA is not a regulatory agency and has no desire to become one. The FAA, by contrast, is a regulatory agency and would be best-suited," he said.

One driving force for regulations is pressure from insurance companies.

Lawyer Brian Mitchell, who represents aerospace insurers, said new standards would help insurers operate. Regulation would allow them to better understand the dangers of spaceflight and adjust accordingly.

"They are in the business of risk," he said. "If there are no rules of the road up in space, how are you going to find anyone liable for anything" if something goes wrong?

Adding to the complexity is the lack of past legal cases dealing with space. Space law is not an area in which the courts have been active, either in the United States or internationally. Because of that, Boeing lawyer Russ McMurry said regulators and lawyers might consider looking at laws once written for wooden ships.

Some of the "old laws of the sea" perhaps could be applied to space, he said. "Maybe we should go back and look at the way we dealt with that."
