BEIJING, China â€” Much of Africa's wild elephant population has been killed off over the last 10 years. The main cause is ivory poaching, in which elephants are slaughtered for their valuable tusks. Elephants are nearly extinct. What will it take to save these amazing creatures?

Wildlife organizations have become very focused on the question since China and the United States agreed to stop ivory selling in both countries.

Many welcomed the announcement by the White House on Sept. 25. Yet they wondered about the exact terms of the ban and how soon it will happen. Another concern is loopholes, which are ways to get around a law. If these openings are found, ivory could continue to be sold.

## Poaching For Tusks Rises In Africa

"In 2009, when China legalized the import of (some) ivory, poaching started to go up dramatically across Africa," said Peter Knights, the executive director of WildAid. Knights hopes that making it unlawful to buy ivory will reduce poaching.

The Chinese middle and upper classes are fond of ivory jewelry, art products and ornamental carvings made of ivory. This demand could drive many countries' wild elephant populations to extinction, experts say. Tens of thousands of elephants are killed every year for their tusks, according to the Born Free Foundation, a wildlife organization. People in China buy the most ivory in the world. The United States ranks second.

China has signed the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES. This international treaty was designed to protect species from extinction due to the wildlife trade. In 1989, the convention declared the African elephant an endangered species. International commercial trade in elephant tusks was banned.

Yet in 2008, CITES made an exception. The organization permitted China to purchase 62 tons of ivory stored in Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. China imported the ivory in 2009. Each year, China's government gives some of it to its carving factories.

## Ivory Art Popular In China

China's demand for ivory has exploded in recent years. The country's middle class has grown, as more Chinese are making more money. Some want to spend their new money on ivory. The price of raw elephant tusks more than doubled from 2010 to 2014, according to the nonprofit group Save the Elephants.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama had several meetings to reach the agreement. Afterward, the White House made an announcement. It said the United States and China had committed to stop ivory importing and exporting. Importing ivory from hunting trophies, or elephants that have been hunted and killed for sport, will also be illegal very soon.

The two countries will cooperate in sharing information and will have joint training and "public education on combating wildlife trafficking," the statement said. They would create better "international law enforcement cooperation in this field." The White House did not say when the new plan would start.

The announcement was also made in China.

## Some Ivory Trade Likely To Continue

Experts say that the ban will close some important loopholes, but probably will not stop the ivory trade completely.

"It is definitely a step in the right direction," said Grace Gabriel. She is director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare in Asia. "This is something that we have been trying to do for maybe a decade, to get this issue to the highest level of government, for President Xi Jinping to realize how damaging (the ivory trade) is to China's international reputation, and the role that China has been playing in this crisis.

"What this needs to have is a concrete implementation plan. The way I see it is, in the market in China, the illegal ivory trade has long eclipsed the legal trade."

The nonprofit group Environmental Investigation Agency estimates that as much as 90 percent of mainland China's ivory is from smuggled tusks.

## Hong Kong A Weak Link For Smuggling

China gives licenses to some ivory sellers to sell older ivory. But, Gabriel said, the licensed ivory sellers often buy smuggled, poached ivory. In 2013, a court in the southeastern province of Fujian sentenced a licensed ivory dealer to 15 years in prison for illegally importing 7.7 tons of ivory into China.

Because the law is so unclear, people don't know what is legal and illegal, Gabriel said. "Some places you buy are legal, some places are illegal. And everybody is so confused," she added.

Experts say that one possible snag is the lack of a similar ban in Hong Kong. The bustling port city is technically controlled by Beijing but maintains an independent legal system. It is a notoriously weak link in the international enforcement of wildlife laws.

In May, Beijing took and destroyed 1,500 pounds of poached ivory carvings. The illegal ivory had made it into Chinese stores. That act marked the third time the country had destroyed smuggled ivory in a year and a half. International environmental groups praised the effort. Hong Kong began destroying a 28-ton stockpile of ivory in the spring.
