BALTIMORE — Laura Smith-Velazquez has been dreaming of going to space since the first time she looked into a telescope as an 8-year-old. She grew up watching "Star Trek" and imagined herself commanding a starship.

Every year she tries for a shot at NASA's astronaut program, with no luck.

But now, Smith-Velazquez's chances of getting to space may have improved. A Dutch organization called Mars One selected the 38-year-old engineer as one of 100 semi-finalists chosen for a mission to establish a permanent colony on Mars by 2025. Her husband, Matthew Velazquez, also applied for the one-way mission, but did not make the first cut. Smith-Velazquez said she is prepared to leave him behind.

When they applied for the program in August 2013, the couple agreed that they would either go to Mars together or neither of them would go. But Velazquez, a 43-year-old aerospace engineer, said that "fell by the wayside" when he was left out of the first cut from 200,000 applicants down to 1,000.

"Do you demand that you continue to have a wife on this planet, or do you let your wife do something she's always wanted to do?" he said. "You have to be supportive of that."

## Digging Deep Into The Applicant Pile

Mars One says it is looking for astronauts who are curious, adaptable, trusting, creative, resourceful and capable of bouncing back from hardships. Candidates must also be at least 18 years old and physically capable. The extensive application process required a lengthy written application, submitting a video, studying of 40 pages of technical information about Mars and a video chat interview.

Smith-Velazquez was interviewed by Dr. Norbert Kraft, Mars One's chief medical officer — whom she called "a legend in astronaut selection" for NASA. Dr. Kraft asked Smith-Velazquez whether she would come back from Mars, if that were possible, and why. She quickly answered with a firm no, "because the people you go with become your family."

Despite her commitment, Smith-Velazquez said she isn't sure why she has advanced so far in the selection process. She is used to confined spaces and zooming through the air — she has a pilot's license and designs interfaces that pilots use to control aircraft. Smith-Velazquez suggested that her Cherokee background and ability to get along with others might also have helped her to stand out.

Still, Smith-Velazquez recognizes that, even if she makes the final cut, her chances of ending up on Mars are quite slim. Many view the Mars One mission as nothing more than a publicity stunt, particularly since the Dutch space scientist who devised it plans to pay for the project by making a reality TV show out of it.

## Packing A Spaceship Carry-On With Supplies

Organizations including NASA and the Planetary Society — a group that promotes the exploration of space — will not even comment on it, while famous scientists like Neil DeGrasse Tyson have questioned its short time frame.

"To get to Mars you need rockets. You need spaceships," said John M. Logsdon, a professor at George Washington University who studies space policy. "None of that exists."

The planet also presents would-be explorers with difficult engineering challenges. Mars' atmosphere is one-hundredth the density of Earth's, preventing oceans from being able to form on its surface. It also radiates heat away so effectively that temperatures drop from a comfortable 50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the sunshine to 100 degrees below zero at night.

"How do you pack in enough supplies and figure out how to generate your own supplies — air, heat and oxygen — when you get there?" said Frank Summers, an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. "That's the major problem to solve."

## An Ambitious Timeline

A study by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that Mars One needs to reconsider some elements of its plans to keep settlers alive. While Mars One plans to use existing technology to accomplish the mission, the report found some new technology is needed. For example, a plan to pull water out of the Mars soil might not work, the report found.

The report also estimated that a plan to draw oxygen from crops inside the colony and pump nitrogen from tanks into the air would leave the first settlers unable to breathe within 68 days.

Mars One admits that the mission is an incredibly ambitious undertaking that will require constant efforts to prevent delays and failures. The plan, developed in 2011, calls for sending rovers and cargo to Mars ahead of four-person crews.

The first major milestone in the project's timeline would be a 2018 demonstration mission to prove that Mars One has the technology required to support humans on Mars. A rover mission would follow in 2020 to select the best location for settlement. The rover mission would also need to prepare the surface for the arrival of cargo missions, set to begin in 2022.

The rover would set up the six cargo units and get the site up and running in time for the arrival of the first crew, set to launch some time in 2024 and land seven months later, likely in 2025.

## "Willing To Take That Risk"

Clearly, an endeavor of this scale won't be cheap. Mars One estimates it will cost $6 billion just to get its first crew to Mars, though the MIT report suggested it likely will be higher. MIT scientists estimated that the rockets needed to get the supplies and astronauts to the planet would cost $4.5 billion alone.

Mars One plans to raise money through sponsorships, partnerships, sales of TV broadcast rights, investments from wealthy individuals, and crowdfunding. So far, Mars One has struggled to find financial support.

Despite the many challenges, Mars One supporters like Smith-Velazquez insist the mission is worth attempting. Smith-Velazquez points out that, just as the "space race" of the 1950s and 1960s seemed to stretch science, if humans do not strive to reach Mars, it won't happen. The scrutiny can only improve preparations for dealing with the planet's inhospitable environment, she added.

"Yeah, there's a lot of risk, but there's a lot of risk no matter what you do," she said. "I'm willing to take that risk."
