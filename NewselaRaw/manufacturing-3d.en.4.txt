EAST HARTFORD, Conn. â€” Pratt &amp; Whitney makes airplane engines. It has made parts for a long time by taking steel or another material and molding it or carving it or melting it.

Now, it just hits the "print" button.

But it is not using a printer like the one you use at home or at school. There is no ink or paper.

Pratt and other companies use 3-D printers. The machines use lasers to heat pieces of plastic or metal to build up solid parts, layer by layer. They can build almost anything.

Airplane makers like Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE Aviation are using the printers to make parts for their latest engines. The printers let their employees come up with parts they could not have made in the past. The companies also save money.

## Making A Part In One Step

The printing is also called additive manufacturing. It sounds complicated. But think of it like building something with Lego blocks. You put small pieces together it make something larger.

The old way of making things is called subtractive manufacturing. It works the opposite way. You start out with a block of material, and chip away until you get your engine part. It's sort of like turning a block of marble into a statue.

The fact that 3-D printing can be used in a jet engine is a good sign.

Pratt put more than 24 3-D-printed parts on its latest engine, said Thomas Prete. He runs the company's engineering department.

Pratt can now make a part in one step. It used to take a lot longer. Five or 10 pieces had to be put together. They had to be heated. That took lots of steps and cost more money.

But 3-D printing does something even more important. Now the people who create engines can do things that would have been impossible before, Prete said.

## A "Floating Factory" For The Military

The Army and Navy like the printers, too. They like being able to print supplies with just a machine and materials. That could make an aircraft carrier a "floating factory."

Some of the 25 parts Pratt prints are simple. Others are more advanced. Those go in part of the engine that gets very hot and works very hard.

To work in a jet engine, the parts must be perfectly made. They also cannot cost too much to make.

Now Pratt needs to be able to print 3-D parts fast enough to keep up with normal manufacturing.

Another company, GE Aviation, bought a 3-D printing firm in November. GE said that it would be 3-D printing a part on one of its engines.

The 3-D printing industry was a $2.2 billion business in 2012, one report said. By 2021,  the industry is expected to be worth $10.1 billion.

Putting parts into jet engines shows that companies have figured out how to make the materials and the printing work.

## A 3-D-Printed Pork Chop

Computers are fast enough and materials are good enough so 3-D printing reached the point where important parts can be made with the press of a button. This means the military is close to using 3-D printers as a mobile factory.

Lt. Cmdr. Michael Llenza of the U.S. Navy wrote in May about the  possibilities for 3-D printed products. Those include vehicles, parts, ammunition, shelters, artificial limbs and food. Yes, a 3-D-printed pork chop.
