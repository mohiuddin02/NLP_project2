WASHINGTON â€” Republicans and Democrats fought for control of the House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday. The Republican Party already had control of the House of Representatives. After the election, Republicans took control of the Senate as well.

The Senate and the House both make up the legislative branch of the government, called Congress. They sometimes work with the president to make laws for the country. Sometimes, Congress also works against the president to make sure he does not use too much power.

Voters have been disappointed with Democratic President Barack Obama, leading many to vote for Republicans in the election. For the last two years of Obama's presidency, both the Senate and the House will be run by Republicans.

## Control Of Congress

Republicans won seats in the Senate that were previously held by Democrats. They had victories in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia, giving Republicans control of the Senate for the first time since 2007.

The Republican Party also held onto the House of Representatives and looked to add as many as 12 more Republicans to the House, which contains 435 representatives. The increase in Republicans in the House would give the party the most control they have had since 1949.

## Voters Fed Up

The results showed just how frustrated voters were with the current government, especially President Obama. Many voters believe that the country's government is going in the wrong direction. They think that switching to a Republican government from a Democratic one will make a difference.

Democrats tried to stop Republicans from taking over Congress by winning more spots for themselves. Still, they could not persuade voters.

In Kentucky's Senate election, Republican leader Mitch McConnell easily beat Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. The Democrats wanted a win in Georgia, but Michelle Nunn lost to Republican businessman David Perdue.

In Kansas, Democrats appeared to be counting on Greg Orman. He was an independent who ran neither as a Democrat nor a Republican, against Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican. Democratic Vice President Joe Biden voiced his support of Orman earlier on Tuesday but it wasn't enough. Roberts won the seat in the Senate.

Democrats did keep their control of New Hampshire. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen won the race against Scott Brown. Brown used to be a senator in Massachusetts.

In Louisiana, the election was not yet clear. Three popular people were running in the southern state. Because the votes were split three ways, it is still not known who the winner will be. There will be a second election next month so the state can decide between Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu and Republican Representative Bill Cassidy.

## Republicans Take The Night

Still, the night belonged to the Republican Party. Kentucky Senator McConnell spoke to his supporters.

"Tonight, Kentuckians said we can do better as a nation," McConnell said in his victory speech in Louisville. "Tonight, they said we can have real change in Washington. Real change, and that's just what I intend to deliver."

Democrats were defending 21 Senate seats. Republicans had 15 that they could have lost. There are 100 seats in the Senate, but every two years about one-third of the Senate members must run for re-election. This is so people can vote new people into the Senate if they do not like the person who was in power before.

Seven of the Democratic spaces were in states that voted for a Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, in 2012. The states included Arkansas, Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia.

In the election for the House of Representatives, the Democrats lost even more control. Two Democratic representatives lost their seats to Republicans.
