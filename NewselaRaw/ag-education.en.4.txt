ST. LOUIS â€” New high school programs are teaching teenagers about agriculture. It goes much beyond having to work only with cows and plows.

The new agriculture courses are becoming very popular. That's good news because the number of farms in the United States has been falling for many years.

The courses are being offered mostly throughout the U.S. Midwest, a region where agriculture has been a tradition.

Most teenagers taking the classes are thinking about one day working with crops, natural resources and city forestry. The courses help the students prepare for future careers in agriculture.

That is important because tens of thousands of jobs are opening up each year in the field. Almost half of them go to people who studied agriculture in college.

The students are lucky: There are not enough people with degrees in agriculture.

## Agriculture Education Is Important

Future Farmers of America (FFA), a national group that supports agriculture education among young people, is also growing. FFA has about 580,000 members. That is almost double the amount it had 30 years ago.

Rebecca Goodman is an FFA member. She has little to do with farms.

The 18-year-old is the president of her school's FFA. She has lived in Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana, since she was 3. Goodman had never been to a farm before joining the FFA. The only animals she is used to are cats and dogs.

She planted a small garden once. But "the only thing that grew out of it were weeds," she says.

Goodman would like to work one day with nature conservation. The agricultural sciences program at Beech Grove School helped her make that choice.

## It All Started Here

The Beech Grove's Applied Life Sciences Academy opened in November 2012. The Academy is a place where students can learn about animals and plants closely. Classes include animal, plant and soil sciences. It also offers an introduction course on agriculture.

Programs like Beech Grove's Academy have increased in the past couple of years. Seven high schools in Kansas and four in Nebraska added similar programs in the past school year. Illinois added another 10.

Missouri has one of the highest number of agriculture programs in the region, a total of 311. The state added seven more schools since 2011.

Back in Indiana, another 13 programs like the Beech Grove Academy have been added since 2010. It has four teachers for almost 500 students. The state government helps to fund for the Academy. It gives the Academy an allowance for each student in the program.

## We Can All Use New Skills

Chris Kaufman is an agriculture professional who helped set up Beech Grove's program. He explained that the Academy is about teaching how almost everything around students is related to animals, plants and food. The students then can use their new skills in their lives and careers.

That happened to Goodman. She said she did not really know what to do with her future before she joined the Academy.

The program "helped me find my way," she said.
