LOS ANGELES — Advanced Placement (AP) classes are tough courses. They teach college-level material. Students who pass the test at the end of the class can get college credit.

Schools used to think the advanced classes were just for top students. That thinking has changed. Now more and more schools say that any student should have a chance to take AP classes. But the change has brought problems.

The case of Alex Wong is one example. He is a junior at Mark Keppel High School near Los Angeles. He is working hard to get into a top college. He has earned nearly straight A's in hard classes. He took a summer program at Stanford University.

But his school switched how it assigns places in AP classes this year. It will no longer let just the top students into the classes. It will let any student ask for a spot. Then, the school will pick from those students at random. More students would have a shot at the classes that way. Alex wanted to get into three classes. At first, he got into none.

## Unprepared For Tough Classes?

Parents became angry when their children did not get into AP courses. Students even started a Facebook group to trade classes.

"IM DESPERATE ILL GIVE YOU FREE FOOD," student Kirk Hum posted.

Miracle Vitangcol is a junior at Downtown Magnets High School in Los Angeles. She has average grades and test scores. But Vitangcol is failing her AP U.S. history class. But she said she plans to stick it out. The class is teaching her how to make use of her time, take good notes and keep trying, she said.

"I'm struggling to adjust," Vitangcol said. "But I keep telling myself, 'It's OK. You can do it. Just push yourself.'"

Some people worry that too many unprepared students are being pushed into AP classes. They also worry that teachers are making the classes easier.

Michael Petrilli works at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute. The Institute focuses on education. He said giving more students a shot at the classes is generally a good thing. But "we need to make sure we're not watering down the experience for the high achievers," he added.

## Choosing Students By Chance Criticized

The College Board runs the AP program. It wants schools to open classes to more types of students. It said the effort has generally been successful. About 2.1 million students took AP tests last year. That is twice as many as 10 years ago. But the failure rate is up only a bit, officials said.

Most students at Downtown Magnets High School are poor. The school offers 15 different AP courses. Six out of 10 students pass the exams. The entire Los Angeles school district's average pass rate is only 4 in 10.

Teachers are one reason, said Lynda McGee. She is the school's college counselor and AP coordinator. Daniel Jocz's AP U.S. history class is an example. About 90 percent of students pass the exam. The national rate is about 54 percent.

Jocz recently taught a lesson on trade and banking. It could have been dull. But Jocz included music clips from Bruce Springsteen and Queen. He added amusing facts about the Erie Canal. Jocz pointed out information likely to appear on the AP exam. He also had students work in groups on an AP-type essay question.

Jocz sees both good and bad in letting all students take AP classes. "The good thing is giving people the chance to challenge themselves … but some kids are not ready, and are we setting them up for failure?" he said.

Some Keppel parents whose children were shut out of AP classes say they support the goal of AP classes for all. But they do not like choosing students for the classes by chance.

"It's a delicate balancing act," Shelly Tan said. Her son failed to get into an AP biology class. He had already done the summer work during a family vacation. "Yes, you want to give all kids opportunity — but not at the expense of kids who can do the honors work."
