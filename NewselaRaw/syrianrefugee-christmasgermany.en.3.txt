ZWICKAU, Germany — Music and the smell of cookies and candles float through the air at a Christmas market in Germany. Four young people wander around the market together. They are different from other people there.

They are the Habashieh family. The Habashiehs moved to Germany because their home country, Syria, was no longer safe. Syria is located in the Middle East, and is in the middle of a war. Many people, like the Habashiehs, have left Syria to find a better life somewhere else. 

The Habashiehs are refugees who fled Syria. Refugees are people who escaped a country because it was unsafe for them and are trying to settle in someplace new. There are many refugees in Germany, because Syria is not a safe country to live in. A violent group called the Islamic State is trying to control the area. It wants to start a country under its kind of Islamic law. Its fighters have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. 

## Family's Journey Was Dangerous

Life in Germany is safer but it has not always been easy for the Habashieh family. Khawla Kareem, the head of the family, was so unhappy there at first. The family was living in a cramped shelter with many other people. Her kids had no school to go to. They lived in fear of being attacked because they are Syrian. 

Today, she is happy in Germany. The family now has a small apartment that they can decorate and make their own. 

The Habashiehs' journey to get to Germany from Syria has not been easy. They had to risk their lives to make it to where they are today.

All that feels like a bad dream now.

The family is settling into their new life in Germany. In fact, they all take German classes at a school. Reem, the oldest daughter, is a teacher's assistant.  

## Some Germans Dislike Refugees

Not all refugees are as lucky as the Habashiehs have been. There are nearly 1 million refugees in Germany. Most of them are still stuck in overcrowded shelters. It can take months for refugees to be allowed to stay in Germany. They have to meet with the government. They must answer many questions. There are other challenges, too. Fights between different refugee groups are common. There are worries about safety for women and children.  

Meanwhile, the mood in Germany toward refugees is changing. At first, Germans welcomed refugees. Now, many people are growing angry. Germans are unhappy about outsiders moving into their country. Some of the refugee shelters that were being built have been burned down. Some shelters have even been attacked. Also, the police and other people who work with the refugees are tired. 

Even though it has been hard, the Habashiehs are trying to make the most of their life in Germany. They hope to one day to live in a big city, like Berlin. They lived in Berlin for their first two weeks in Germany. There were more Syrians there.

"Our big dream is still Berlin," Reem says.
