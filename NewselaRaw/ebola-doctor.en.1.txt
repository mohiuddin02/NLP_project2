WORCESTER, Mass. â€” One year ago, Dr. Rick Sacra was given a second chance at life.

On September 25, 2014, the 52-year-old Massachusetts physician was discharged from an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital. He had been successfully treated for the deadly virus Ebola and was completely cured.

Sacra had contracted Ebola while delivering babies in a Christian mission hospital in Liberia, a country in West Africa. Rushed back to the United States, he spent three weeks suffering through fevers, vomiting, diarrhea and aches.

## He's Now 100 Percent Recovered

Sacra says his religious faith gave him peace during his treatment for the disease, even though he knew full well that he might not make it.

"Of course I knew that I might die," he said this week, reflecting on the ordeal. "It made me very aware of how grateful I am for every day I'm given."

Other than an eye problem that nagged him until late January, Sacra says he is now "100 percent" recovered and is feeling fine.

Most West African Ebola survivors are not as lucky as he is, Sacra added. Many still deal with serious health complications and the anguish of losing loved ones. Often, they are shunned when they return to their battered communities, where many people view them with suspicion and fear.

## Doctor Says He Has No Regrets

Sacra says he does not regret a thing, and he would do it all over again if he had to. "Some risks are worth taking," he says. "Even if I had died due to Ebola last year, I would not have changed what I did."

Sacra has wasted little time resuming the medical mission work he has done for the greater part of his adult life.

Now immune to Ebola, Sacra has returned to Liberia three times so far this year. Notably, he was the first of America's handful of Ebola survivors to return to West Africa last January.

In April and then again in July, Sacra returned to the Liberian mission hospital where he has worked, off and on, for about 20 years.

Sacra plans to go back to the hospital, which is located just outside the capital city of Monrovia, in November. He says the need for able health care workers is just as great now as it was during the height of last year's Ebola epidemic, which has claimed more than 11,000 lives.

## Liberia Is Ebola-Free, But Not Free Of Medical Troubles

Many Liberians who stayed away from hospitals at the peak of the epidemic are just starting to return with other serious ailments such as heart disease and AIDS, he says. The rush of new patients is pushing already strained health care facilities beyond capacity.

Just weeks ago, Liberia was declared "Ebola-free" for the second time this year. Neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea, however, continue to see a small trickle of new Ebola cases each week, signs that the virus has been controlled but not completely wiped out.

Sacra has no plans to stop his trips back to Liberia, which he travels to four times a year.

"When Liberia is on its feet again and it doesn't need help anymore, I'll probably move on to someplace else," he said. "But as long as the needs are there and I can make a difference, I think I ought to keep doing it."
