STOCKHOLM, Sweden â€” Last week, police closed a camp of Roma people.

The Roma are also known as Gypsies. The word Gypsies is a mean word. The Roma are treated badly in many places.

The camp was in Malmo, a city in the country of Sweden. The camp had no toilets, electricity or running water. As months went by it became worse and worse. Trash piled up. Neighbors complained about terrible smells.

Finally, government officials said the camp was dangerous to live in. Police forced the Roma to leave. They also threw out protesters who wanted the Roma to stay.

## Asking For Money On Streets

Sweden has very few poor people. It is a very rich country. Sweden has worked hard to end poverty, said Martin Valfridsson. He works for the Swedish government. Sweden has not seen such poor people in 100 years.

Now there are people on street corners asking for money. Many of them are Roma. They came to Sweden from other countries, like Romania and Bulgaria. A very long time ago, the Roma came to Europe from the country of India.

Valfridsson said the Roma started coming to Sweden in 2012. Many more Roma came last year.

## Roma Travel Far, Find Little Help

In Sweden, the Roma mostly look after themselves. Sweden does not give them much help. The Roma only get help if they have an emergency. They are allowed to sleep and eat at homeless shelters for a few days. The government also helps them to go back home.

Maria Carmen is 38 years old and has six children. She is from Romania and came to Sweden two weeks ago. She slept in a park. Her clothes smelled bad.

Carmen heard that it was easy to beg for money in Sweden. She has not gotten any, though.

## Anger And Worry

Some Swedes are angry at the Roma. Beggars have been attacked on the street. Other Swedes feel bad for them. Still, even people who feel bad for the Roma are worried about the dirtiness of the Roma camps.

Sweden asked Romania and Bulgaria to help. With help, the Roma will not need to leave their countries.

Valfridsson is the government worker. He said Swedes should want the Roma to get help in their own countries. Swedes should not give them money on the street, he said.
