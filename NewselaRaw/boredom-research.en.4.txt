No one likes being bored. But maybe boredom itself isn't that boring. It turns out there's a lot more to it than experts thought.

A new study of students in Germany reveals that there are five different kinds of boredom. That's one more than scientists had expected.

The newly discovered kind is called "apathetic boredom." It seems it's quite common among high school students.

And boredom isn't just boring. It can be dangerous too â€” either for the person who is bored, or for the people around him or her. For instance, people who are bored are more likely to smoke, drink or use drugs. Kids who are bored are more likely to drop out of school and get into trouble. Boredom can also lead to health problems.

## Studying Bored Students

But boredom hadn't been studied very much before.

So Thomas Goetz and a group of other scientists decided it was high time to study boredom. They put together two groups of students: 63 college students and 80 high-schoolers.

The scientists gave each student a device. It beeped six times during the day. At the beep, students wrote out what they were doing and how they felt about it.

Goetz's team didn't set out to find a new kind of boredom. Scientists then believed there were only four kinds.

The least serious is a relaxing and slightly pleasant kind of boredom. This kind leads to daydreaming.

The most serious kind is so bad it makes people leave places where they are bored. It also makes them avoid people they find boring, like teachers.

## Rating Boredom 1 To 5

The devices first asked students what they were doing. Were they in the middle of a serious activity? That is, were they attending a class or studying for a test? Or were they doing something else? Say, eating, napping or doing something fun?

Students were then asked how they felt about what they were doing. If they felt bored, they rated their feelings of boredom from 1 to 5.

Turns out the life of a student can be very boring.

The college students were bored more than a quarter of the time. Life was even more dull for the high school students, about 40 percent of the time.

College students reported that just over half of their boring experiences happened during a serious activity. For high school students, the number was higher: two-thirds of their boring experiences happened while they were in class or studying.

There may be a simple reason for the difference: College students have more freedom to stop doing things that bore them.

## A Troubling New Boredom

The big surprise for the scientists was finding a fifth type of boredom: apathetic boredom. One-tenth of all boredom among the college students was apathetic boredom. For high-schoolers, more than a third of all boredom was apathetic boredom.

This was troubling. Students found apathetic boredom to be the most unpleasant form of boredom. But they were far less likely to do anything about it.

The scientists say this form of boredom is related to a serious mental health problem: depression. It can lead to or add to feelings of sadness and hopelessness. It can be dangerous for the people who are feeling it, Goetz said.

The scientists hope to continue their studies of boredom. They plan to study younger students, as well as adults at work. But Goetz said he didn't expect any more boring surprises.

"I don't think that there are more than the five types of boredom," he said.
