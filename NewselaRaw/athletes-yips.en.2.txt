The ball was only 5 feet from the hole, but when golfer Chey Castro raised his putter for what should have been a clean shot, his hand shook. He missed the putt that would have won him $180 at the tournament.

"I know I'm good, and I know I can make these putts," says Castro in a call from his Arizona home. "I used to always make them and never had an issue."

Castro is among those experienced golfers who have the yips. The name might make the condition sound minor, but the yips can ruin a professional athlete's career.

For golfers, it's an uncontrollable shaking that occurs in the hands right before the club hits the ball, says Dr. Debbie Crews. She is a sports psychologist who works with the Arizona State University women's golf team and is a researcher in the professional golf management program. Crews has helped Castro and others treat the yips.

She recently spoke in Dallas about the brain science behind golf and the yips.

## Yips Most Often Affect Golfers

The yips affect many kinds of athletes, including cricket and baseball players. Even piano players can get the yips. However, the condition is most closely associated with golfers. Tiger Woods' poor game at the recent Phoenix Open led some fellow players to speculate that the great golfer himself has it.

Around 40 percent of golfers will experience the yips at some point in their career, says Crews. In the past, most golfers refused to admit they had it. Today, scientists like Crews are trying to understand what causes the yips, as well as how to treat it.

Scientists separate the yips into two types. One is neurological, a physical problem related to the nerves and the brain. The other is psychological, something that is not physical and is in the player's mind.

A small number of golfers who come down with the yips have focal dystonia, a problem in the brain that causes involuntary muscle tensing, says Crews. For most, there's nothing neurologically wrong. This is what makes the yips so mysterious. Except for the shaking itself, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with these golfers.

## Condition Can Come And Go

Some golfers have the yips only under certain conditions, for example, if they're playing a game with thousands of dollars depending on a single putt. Others might have it on and off for a few months. For some, it might happen all the time.

Castro first experienced the yips more than 10 years ago. He had played golf since he was 6 and was especially active in high school, but when he went to college, he stopped playing so frequently. That's when he first experienced the yips.

Castro, 37, says the reason is a lack of confidence. In high school, he was practicing every day. Now, he just plays for fun several times a week and the lack of practice makes him less confident when he attempts even the simplest putt.

"When I just play with some buddies, I play the best," says Castro. "But when it's for a tournament ... I kind of sometimes put too much pressure and mess it up."

## Anxiety Can Make It Worse

Anxiety doesn't cause the yips, Crews says, but it can make the problem worse. Crews helped ease Castro's anxiety through a variety of exercises. She had him focus his attention past the ball and make minor position adjustments in his setup.

Crews also suspects that making slight hand and feet adjustments can rewire the brain to avoid the yips.

When a golfer putts, his or her brain relies on a model, or template. The template is created to determine what signal is sent to which muscles to tell them what to do. With the yips, this template stops working.

"Just that small change in hand position and it seems like there's an adjustment and a detour in the brain," says Crews.

## There's No One Perfect Way

This is similar to a treatment for focal dystonia when writing. Place paper on the desk, and people with focal dystonia can't write. Place it on the wall, though, and all of a sudden, they can.

"People think they've got to do this one perfect motion this one way, but that's not true," Crews says. "There are many ways."

Even after working with Crews, Castro still struggles with the yips. He's not alone. Some golfers come out of treatment completely cured, while others are not so lucky.

Castro loves the game, so he doesn't let the yips keep him off the course.

It's not fun, "but what do you do?" he says. "I'm not one to get too frustrated."
