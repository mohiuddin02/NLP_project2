RIYADH  - On Thursday a group of Saudi women's rights activists posted online photographs and video clips of themselves driving. The women were risking arrest by defying their country's ban on female drivers.

Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world where women are still not allowed to drive. But debate about the ban is becoming increasingly public. On Tuesday, a female member of the powerful Shoura Council, which advises the government, proposed ending the ban.

There is no law on the books that prevents women from driving in the kingdom. However, women cannot apply for driver's licenses. Women who do get behind the wheel have been arrested. Typically, they've been charged with disrupting public order or engaging in political protest.

The recently uploaded photos and footage showed various women driving on busy streets in the capital city of Riyadh. One clip showed a woman driving in the traditional veil, with only her eyes showing. Passing motorists slowed and gave her a thumbs-up sign.

## "How People Think Has Changed"

One of the women was stopped by police. She was taken to a police station, activists said. It was not immediately clear whether she would face further action.

Another female activist said that uploading the video clips and photographs was the first part of a two-stage campaign designed to change attitudes.

In the second stage, women with international driving licenses will be asked to get behind the wheel on Oct. 26.

"To drive with a license should not be against the law," she said. Many Saudis have become more open to the idea of women driving, she added.

"The authorities, the country, how people think has changed," she said.

## Ban Supporters Worry About Morals

Supporters of the ban include powerful religious figures. They argue that allowing women to drive will encourage men and women to mix too freely in public. Many in Saudi Arabia consider it indecent for women to talk with men they aren't related to.

Those who oppose the ban say it means families have to employ expensive private drivers. Not being able to drive makes it difficult for women to work or carry out many other daily tasks, too.

They also point out that Saudi women living outside of cities frequently drive without being stopped by the police.

The Shoura Council must now decide whether to accept its female member's proposal. If it does, it will submit it to the government's transport ministry.

The councilwoman's proposal was widely reported in the Saudi press. In a show of support, some newspapers published opinion pieces arguing that women should be allowed to drive.
