SAN PEDRO de MACORIS, Dominican Republic â€” The streets are winding, dusty and chaotic. Honking cars and buzzing scooters cram the roads. Wandering through this town, you'd never know this coastal city is a huge center for baseball, a mecca that attracts people from all over.

But past the one-room concrete buildings with old paint, and beyond the roads littered with garbage and stray dogs, a sprawling park emerges. Kids there crowd around the old baseball fields, shouting in Spanish. The sounds of baseball are everywhere as bats crack and balls thud into leather gloves.

Among these young ballplayers is Richard Paulino, who stood along the first-base line. Paulino is muscular and a bit taller than his teammates.

"I want to play in the major leagues, of course," he said, his face curving into a smile to show braces. "I am passionate about the game. I am focused."

## "Tremendously Important"

Can Paulino reach his goal? He's certainly in the right country to find out.

The Dominican Republic plays an important role in America's baseball culture. The country develops and delivers more players to the major leagues than any other nation besides the United States. Kids from the Dominican Republic are four times more likely to reach the major leagues than their American peers. Dominicans make up between 25 and 40 percent of the players in the minor leagues.

"The Dominican's tremendously important and that's why we just opened a brand-new office down there," said Kim Ng, Major League Baseball's (MLB) senior vice president in charge of international operations.

The sport thrives here because of the talent. Kids regularly drop out of high school to play. The environment and culture around the game also helps. Money pumps in from the United States, thanks to major league teams and private investors who open academies. Independent Dominican baseball scouts, known locally as buscones, also train players.

"They depend on each other for survival and they depend on each other to flourish," said Alan Klein, a professor at Northeastern University who has written books on Dominican baseball. "So, who's controlling the game? There's no clear answer. It's a new system."

The sport also provides an important opportunity for kids to escape the financial struggles in the Dominican Republic, where more than a third live in poverty. The baseball economy also affects more than just the players. The sport provides jobs for landscapers who care for fields, cooks and housekeepers, even real estate agents hired by teams to find housing for baseball prospects.

## To Make It Big As A Ballplayer

There is too much money at stake for this growth the slow down, considering that 20 players from the Dominican Republic who now play for the MLB were paid a combined $105 million in MLB salaries. All major league clubs operate academies year-round to train up-and-coming players. Scouts are sent to find them.

The growth of Dominican baseball reflects the diversity of foreigners playing in the United States. The Latino player population in the big leagues has steadily increased and now makes up about 27 percent of all players, according to the Society for American Baseball Research.

By 2013, there were 510 Dominican player signings, an increase from 432 a decade before. The combined bonuses for player signings jumped from $13.7 million to $61.5 million during that same time period.

Numbers alone aren't the only evidence of how baseball dominates a big part of the Dominican's culture.

People here insist that there are many opportunities for athletes to make it big as a ballplayer. There are player showcases, a large number of academies, and local pro leagues.

"It's a lot easier than when I used to play," said Moises Alou, a former Chicago Cubs player who is now the general manager of a Dominican team. "Everybody now plays baseball. There's a lot of programs and tryouts and there's a lot of teams competing to sign the best players available. Everyone wants to be the next Pedro Martinez and the next Sammy Sosa."

## "Baseball Is Life"

On a recent afternoon in the Dominican Republic, nearly 10,000 people packed into Estadio Tetelo Vargas, a concrete stadium in the town of San Pedro.

Kids wearing local teams' uniforms shouted in Spanish as they tried to get a view of the action. Some climbed over the stadium's walls and perched atop the dugout to watch. Above them, in an air-conditioned press box, scouts from professional teams checked out players as they consulted their cellphones.

The fans at the game were less interested in the teams themselves. They were there instead to watch baseball.

"In the Dominican, there's not a lot of ways for you to go in life," said a general manager for one of the teams. "Baseball is life."

Just before the first pitch, Richard Paulino walked into the stadium with his friends. He pushed through the crowds. He passed the girls selling popcorn out of a plastic garbage tub and the woman selling soda from a shoebox.

He was asked by a reporter if he was going to take the field.

He smiled. "Someday."
