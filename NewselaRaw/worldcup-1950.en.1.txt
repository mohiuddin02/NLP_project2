The U.S. national soccer team came to the World Cup in Brazil after months of hype and fanfare.

There was much discussion about the lineup, a three-game send-off series, and even the ESPN film crew following the team around.

Things were very different 64 years ago, when Walter Bahr and his U.S. teammates took off for Brazil. Bahr, a former Penn State soccer coach, is one of two surviving members of the 1950 U.S. soccer team. That year was the last time Brazil hosted the sport's global showcase.

There was little attention paid when the team left for Brazil, and no more when it returned.

Today, soccer appears to be finding a solid place in the American sports landscape. Back in Bahr's playing days, though, the sport was generally confined to ethnic neighborhoods within major cities.

## Expectations Were Low

So when the team for the 1950 World Cup was announced, it wasn't exactly big news across the country.

The team had a hard task ahead of it, facing a tough series of games against Spain, England and Chile, all top-level teams.

It wasn't realistic to think this group of part-time players from across the country could defeat some of the world's best. The main goal, really, was just to not get embarrassed by one of the European powerhouses.

It didn't take long for the U.S. team to do much better than expected.

Just 17 minutes into his team's World Cup opener against Spain, Gino Pariani put the Americans ahead, 1-0.

Bahr and his teammates held on to that lead for 64 minutes, until Spain scored three times in the final nine minutes to take a 3-1 win. Still, the game proved that the United States might just be able to play with these European teams.

## Still More Games To Play

Heading into the second game against England, Bahr said there wasn't much talk among the team about what might happen.

Coach Bill Jeffrey's "main comment was, 'Look, we're the underdogs, but the score's 0-0 when we start. We all can play — give it your best shot, let's see what happens,'" Bahr recalled. "He never mentioned once about winning the game, but he never mentioned that we were being led to slaughter."

In truth, it would have been foolish to think the United States could beat the mighty English. This was England's first appearance in the World Cup, but it was considered one of the favorites to challenge host Brazil for the title.

Despite the surprisingly hard-fought loss against Spain, it had only been two years since the United States was embarrassed in the 1948 Olympics. There, it lost 9-0 to Italy.

"When the game was played, we were 500-to-1 odds," Bahr said. "No one expected us to do anything."

But, like Jeffrey said, the match had to start 0-0 and, improbably, it remained 0-0 for most of the first half.

England had some good chances to score but was denied by American goalkeeper Frank Borghi.

In the 38th minute, Bahr took a throw-in from Ed McIlvenny and fired a shot at goal from about 25 yards out. Seconds later, Joe Gaetjens leapt forward and headed the ball.

Gaetjens hit just enough of it to change the ball's path and catch English goalkeeper Bert Williams off-guard. Just like that, the Americans, almost impossibly, had a 1-0 lead over the British.

England controlled the ball throughout much of the rest of the game and almost scored many times. When the final whistle sounded, however, the scoreboard still read 1-0 — in favor of the United States.

"Possession doesn't count — the goal counts, and we got the goal," Bahr said.

## It's Good To Be The Underdog

If there's a reason Bahr can recite the details of that game so well, it's that he has to do it frequently — about once every four years.

"Each time there's a World Cup that gets played, that game gets more attention. When we won that game, some of the papers didn't report it," he said.

Some papers just assumed the 1-0 U.S. win was a misprint. Despite the historic result, the victory hardly inspired a soccer revolution in the United States.

When the players came home after having pulled off one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history, they were hardly greeted as returning heroes.

"We couldn't even get the whole team on one flight," Bahr, 87, said. "We came back on three separate days and my wife was the only one at the airport that met me."

Even though the 23 players in Brazil now have support that Bahr never had, there might be some common ground.

As with the 1950 team, most experts peg this U.S. team as underdogs in all its upcoming matches.

Bahr, however, thinks this 2014 U.S. team could benefit from not being the favorite.

"Maybe that's to their favor," he said. "As a player, you don't like to play teams where they're the underdog — it doesn't sit right to you."

He added, "England was a big favorite and we were the underdog. Sometimes the underdog wins."
