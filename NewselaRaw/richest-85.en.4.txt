Add up all the money they have combined. Now take the world's richest 85 people. Add up their fortunes. The two sums are equal. That equation is in a new report from a British charity. The purpose of the report is to show how the gap between rich and poor is growing.

The report was written by Oxfam. It is a charity focused on helping poor people around the world. Oxfam's report says that the world's poorest 3.55 billion people are living on the same amount of money as the richest 85 people. In other words: Just one of those 85 people has as much money as about 42 million of the world's poorest. That's as many people as there are in Canada, Kentucky and Kansas, put together.

The report came out right before The World Economic Forum starts on Wednesday. The timing is important. The forum is when many leaders from around the world gather in Switzerland. They talk about education, business and politics.

Oxfam's website said there is a gap in wealth between the richest and poorest. It said that gap is hurting democracy.

## Rich Getting Much More Rich

More money has gone to fewer people over the past 25 years, the website said. The very richest people have about $110 trillion. That's 65 times the money that the poorest half of the world has.

The report says 210 people became billionaires last year. Now there are around 1,400 billionaires in the world.

In 2008, the world had a crisis where a lot of people lost their savings, homes or jobs. The report said that the crisis hurt the world's poor. But it helped the world's rich. They made lots of money after the crisis.

Rich Americans are especially growing richer. In fact, there are only two places where the rich were not growing richer than the rest of the people in their countries. Those countries were Colombia and the Netherlands.

The report said that in the United States, China and Portugal, the very wealthiest grew their portion of wealth by more than two times.

Oxfam is asking countries to take steps so that the inequality doesn't get any worse. It wants countries to be careful with the laws they make. When there is growth and less unfairness, the report said, the rules of business work to help the middle classes and the poor. But when only the rich are making money, the rules start bending to help only the rich, the report said.
