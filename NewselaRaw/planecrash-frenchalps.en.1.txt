The pilots of the Germanwings plane sent out no distress call and had lost radio contact, France's aviation authority said. It is a mystery why the Airbus A320 crashed mid-flight after an unexplained eight-minute dive as it flew from Barcelona, Spain, to Duesseldorf, Germany.

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a black box had been located at the crash site and "will be immediately investigated." He did not say whether it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder.

The crash left officials and families across Europe in a state of shock. Sobbing, grieving relatives at airports in both cities were led away by airport workers and crisis counselors.

## Too Soon To Speculate On The Cause

"The crash of the German plane with more than 140 people on board is a shock that plunges us in Germany, the French and the Spanish into deep sorrow," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Merkel told reporters in Berlin that authorities still do not know much beyond the basic information about the flight and could not speculate on the cause of the crash.

"All that will be investigated thoroughly," Merkel said, adding that she planned to travel to the region Wednesday.

In Washington, the White House said American officials were in contact with their French, Spanish and German counterparts.

U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said there was no indication that terrorism was involved in the crash.

## Photos Are Grim

Photos of the crash site from a French newspaper showed scattered black flecks across a mountain and several larger airplane body sections with windows. France's prime minister said a helicopter crew that landed briefly in the area saw no signs of life.

"No one can access the site from the ground," said Gilbert Sauvan, a lawmaker and president of the general council, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.

Germanwings said Flight 9525 carried 144 passengers, including two babies, and six crew members. Officials believe that 67 German nationals were on board, including 16 high school students on an exchange program from the German town of Haltern. Dutch officials said one Dutch citizen was killed.

## Plane's Sudden, Steep Descent

The plane left Barcelona Airport at 10:01 a.m. It reached cruising height of 38,000 feet and suddenly went into an eight-minute descent, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann told reporters in Cologne.

Eric Heraud of the French Civil Aviation Authority said the plane lost radio contact at 10:30 a.m., but "never declared a distress alert itself."

The plane crashed at an altitude of about 2,000 meters (6,550 feet), at Meolans-Revels, near the popular ski resort of Pra Loup. The site is 700 kilometers (430 miles) south-southeast of Paris.

"It was a deafening noise. I thought it was an avalanche, although it sounded slightly different. It was short noise and lasted just a few seconds," said Sandrine Boisse, the president of the Pra Loup tourism office.

Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told French television that he expected "an extremely long and extremely difficult" search-and-rescue operation because of how difficult it will be to get to the crash site. The weather in the area worsened Tuesday afternoon, with a chilly rain falling.

## Many Questions To Answer

Winkelmann said the pilot had more than 10 years of experience working for Germanwings and Lufthansa. Germanwings is a lower-cost unit of Lufthansa, Germany's biggest airline, and flies mostly to European cities.

"We cannot say at the moment why our colleague went into the descent, and so quickly and without previously consulting air traffic control," Stefan-Kenan Scheib said. He is  Germanwings' director of flight operations.

The aircraft was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991 and had been flown 58,300 hours in about 46,700 flights, Airbus said. The plane last underwent a routine check in Germany on Monday, and its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013.

Pierre Polizzi, the owner of a campground near the crash site, said he heard the plane making strange noises shortly before it crashed.

"At 11:30, I heard a series of loud noises in the air. There are often fighter jets flying over, so I thought it sounded just like that. I looked outside, but I couldn't see any fighter planes," he said. "The noise I heard was long, like eight seconds, as if the plane was going more slowly than a military plane. There was another long noise after about 30 seconds."

## Plane Has Had A Good Safety Record

Polizzi said the plane crashed about 5 to 8 kilometers (3 to 11 miles) from his place, which is closed for the season.

"It's going to be very difficult to get there. The mountain is snowy and very hostile," he said.

In a live briefing in Paris, French President Francois Hollande called the crash "a tragedy on our soil."

The last time a passenger jet crashed in France was the 2000 Concorde accident, which left 113 dead — 109 in the plane and four on the ground.

The A320 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation. The single-aisle, twin-engine jet is used to connect cities between one and five hours apart. The A320 is built to fly up to 39,000 feet but it can begin to experience problems as low as 37,000 feet, depending on temperature and weight, including fuel, cargo and passengers.

Worldwide, 3,606 A320s are in operation, according to Airbus.

The A320 family also has a good safety record, with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs, according to a Boeing safety analysis.
