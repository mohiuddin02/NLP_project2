The research plane was sent to study how lower sea ice levels could affect the weather.

Scientists are trying to explain why an increasing number of tropical storms seem to be taking strange paths. The flights revealed important information.

Nick Bond is a scientist at the University of Washington. He was a passenger on the plane during its first Arctic mission.

Flying out of Alaska, Bond and other scientists studied polar ice levels in the seas of the Arctic. At times the plane flew well north of the Arctic Circle.

"While we couldn't have spit on the North Pole, it wasn't that far away," Bond said.

## "Tremendous Amount Of Heat"

Scientists like Bond went to the Arctic to study heat. Specifically they want to determine how much heat is released into the atmosphere when Arctic ice builds up in autumn.

Bond said the faster the Arctic ice builds up, the more heat is released into the atmosphere.

"We could see and feel the tremendous amount of heat coming out of the ocean," Bond said. "That's what it takes to make ice, to lose heat like crazy."

That heat release is believed to shift the jet stream to the south. A jet stream is a fast-moving, high altitude river of air.

Shifting the jet stream south might be causing some serious weather changes. Scientists think the shift to the south might be slowing down or even stalling tropical systems before they can re-curve east and out to sea.

Kevin Wood is also a scientist at the University of Washington. He was aboard the hurricane hunter. He said the Arctic heat release also might help cause other serious and sometimes dangerous weather, such as flooding or severe snowstorms.

"That's far from proven," he said. "But it's one of things we're interested in understanding better."

## Superstorm Sandy Surged North, Not East

But scientists really hope the sensors on board the plane might help them better understand Superstorm Sandy. That storm plowed into the U.S. East Coast last year.

Bond said that the unusual path Sandy took last year was definitely due to changes happening in weather circulation worldwide. Those changes, he said, might be related to changes in the Arctic.

In October 2012, Sandy emerged in the Caribbean as a tropical storm. It then grew into a hurricane. At first, Sandy began to head on a path that would have taken it out into the Atlantic Ocean.

But instead, Sandy curved northwest toward the New Jersey coastline and crashed into a winter system. Sandy was then downgraded to a post-tropical system.

But when Sandy hit much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states, it didn't feel like a post-tropical system. Instead it felt and acted like a very powerful, destructive storm.

Some other hurricanes that have aimed north instead of heading east in recent years include Earl, Irene and Ophelia.

## From Sea Ice Thickness To Solar Heating

The flight study helped scientists' understanding of Arctic heat and hurricane paths. It also shed light onto why polar ice in the Arctic is melting and causing sea levels all over the world to rise, which is serious for low-lying parts of Florida.

Equipped with more sensors than a fleet of satellites, the plane collected a wide range of information from sea ice thickness to solar heating. Much as they do when investigating tropical storms, scientists dropped scientific instruments out of the plane to better understand the atmosphere. The instruments measure temperature, wind direction and air pressure.

Scientists praised the hurricane hunter's versatility.

"You can liken it to a weather station on steroids; you can take it anywhere," Bond said. "It allows unique measurements that you can't get any other way."

The hurricane hunter is normally based in Florida. One reason the plane made the Arctic trip was because the hurricane season in the Atlantic had been unusually slow.

The scientists hope next year's season will be as calm so they can hop another flight over the Arctic.

"We know we obtained data that was unique and important," Bond said. "We're greedy, and we want more."
