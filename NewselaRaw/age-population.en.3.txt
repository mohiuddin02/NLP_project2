In fact, it is happening so fast that most countries are not ready to support the growing numbers of old people, according to a study from the United Nations and an elder rights group.

The report ranks the social and economic well-being of elders in 91 countries. Sweden comes out on top. Afghanistan is last. People who fight for the elderly have been warnings about this for years. They have been saying that nations are simply not working quickly enough to prepare for a population that is aging faster than ever before.

The report backs them up. By the year 2050 there will be more people older than 60 than children younger than 15, something that has never happened before.

Truong Tien Thao is 65 and runs a small tea shop on the sidewalk near his home in Hanoi, Vietnam. He is very aware that he, like millions of others, is hitting old age without a safety net.

## No Rest For The Elderly

He wishes he could retire, but he and his 61-year-old wife depend on the $50 a month they earn from the shop. So every day, Thao rises early to open the stall at 6 a.m. He works until 2 p.m. Then his wife takes over until closing.

"People at my age should have a rest, but I still have to work to make our ends meet," he says. He and his wife have no insurance. They do not have guaranteed retirement money coming in. "I'm scared of thinking of being sick — I don't know how I can pay for the medical care."

Aging is an issue across the world. The report shows that the fastest aging countries are developing ones. Those include Jordan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Vietnam. All ranked in the bottom half of the index.

The Global AgeWatch Index (www.globalagewatch.org) was created by elder advocacy group HelpAge International and the U.N. Population Fund. One of its goals is to provide international information about global aging. The index puts together information from several global agencies. Income, health, education, employment and how countries treat their old people are analyzed.

The index was welcomed by elder rights supporters. They have long complained that a lack of information has hurt their attempts to raise the problem with governments.

"Unless you measure something, it doesn't really exist in the minds of decision-makers," said John Beard of the World Health Organization.

## Living Longer But Not Better

The report fits into an increasingly involved picture of aging and what it means to the world. On the one hand, the fact that people are living longer shows health care and nutrition are getting better. On the other, older people still aren't guaranteed income, health care and housing in many countries.

Afghanistan offers no pension to those not in the government. A pension gives you money when you are retired. Life expectancy is 59 years for men and 61 for women. The global average is 68 for men and 72 for women, according to the U.N.

So Abdul Wasay struggles. The retired cook and blacksmith is 75. He spends most of his day trying to sell toothbrushes and toothpaste on a busy street corner in Kabul's main market. He makes just $6 a day. He can only afford to buy meat twice a month. His family relies mainly on potatoes and curried vegetables.

"It's difficult because my knees are weak and I can't really stand for a long time," he says. "But what can I do? It's even harder in winter, but I can't afford treatment."

He wants to stop working in three years, but is not sure his children can support him. He says many older people cannot find work because they are not strong enough to do day labor. Some resort to begging.

"You have to keep working no matter how old you are — no one is rich enough to stop," he says. "Life is very difficult."

## Rich Or Poor Country, Elderly Face Challenges

The report found that wealthy nations are in general better prepared for aging than poorer ones. Sweden makes the top of the list because of its social support, education and health coverage. Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada are next. The United States comes in eighth.

Marianne Blomberg is an 80-year-old who lives in Stockholm. She praises Sweden's health care.

But aging has challenges even in an elder-friendly country like Sweden. The Swedish government has suggested people continue working beyond 65. Blomberg says that is okay, but should not be required. The country also cut taxes sharply for working Swedes but only a little for retirees.

"I go to lectures and museums and the theater and those kinds of things, but I probably have to stop that soon because it gets terribly expensive," she says. "If you want to be active like me, it is hard. But to sit home and stare at the walls doesn't cost anything."
