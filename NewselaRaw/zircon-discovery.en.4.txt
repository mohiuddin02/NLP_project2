An important discovery was made on a sheep ranch in Australia. Scientists found a crystal much smaller than a grain of rice. The tiny mineral is the oldest piece of the Earth's crust to be discovered. The crystal was found stuck in sandstone. It's called a zircon crystal. This zircon crystal is 4.4 billion years old. Its age helps scientists understand how and when our planet was formed.

At one time, the Earth was a superhot ball of liquid rock. Then it formed a solid surface, called a crust. Once its crust hardened, Earth became able to support life. The zircon's age proves that the earth had hardened by 4.4 billion years ago.

Studying the zircon can explain how life came together on our planet. It can also help the space program. Scientists believe it will teach us what to look for on other planets.

"One of the main goals of the space program is to understand if there's life elsewhere in the universe," said John Valley, a professor. He led the study of the zircon.

## "As Far As We Can Go"

The first evidence of life has been fought over. Some scientists think that the earliest evidence of life is about 3.8 billion years old. It is from a rock found in Greenland. However, other scientists note that no fossils were found in the Greenland rock. Instead, they think that the earliest life is from 3.5 billion years ago. Bacteria from then was fossilized and found in rocks in Australia.

That's a difference of 300 million years between the rocks in Greenland and Australia.

However, nobody is questioning the age of the zircon just found.

Valley and his team have shown "beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this grain is that old," said Samuel Bowring. He's an expert in the early history of the Earth.

Jim Mattinson is a professor of earth science. He said zircons have been found before that were about the same age as the one just found. But, scientists doubted the earlier discoveries.

The new study puts an end to those doubts, Mattinson said. "We're really getting back as far as we can go."

## Learning More About Early Earth

The study used a new way of proving the crystal's age. The scientists looked at the elements in the zircon. Zircon crystals are made up mainly of the elements zirconium, silicon and oxygen. Small amounts of uranium also appear in zircon.

The uranium breaks down at a set speed. Then it forms into lead. Because of this, scientists can calculate the zircon's age. They can do that by measuring the lead and any leftover uranium.

The zircon's age gives clues on the early period of the Earth's history. Scientists believe that a huge asteroid once hit the Earth. The crash vaporized the Earth's mantle and crust, two of the Earth's three areas. The first area is the superhot core at the Earth's center. The core is surrounded by the mantle â€” the thick, middle layer of the earth. The crust is the top layer, on which we live.

Dust from the asteroid crash blended together. It formed the moon.

The enormous energy from the crash reshaped the surfaces of the Earth and moon. The heat of the crash turned their rock into oceans of liquid. Both the Earth and moon later cooled. Zircon was one of the minerals that formed when the planet cooled.

Minerals were also formed as far back as zircon. Yet, what makes zircon so valuable to scientists is its ability to last for so long. Zircon is a very hard mineral with a stable chemistry. That makes it able to survive very hot or very cool temperatures.

"We like to say that zircons are forever," Valley said.
