The legal case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin has made its way back to the Supreme Court. The court sent it back down to a lower court in 2013. Now the Supreme Court has chosen to hear the case once again, and will try to decide if it is constitutional for colleges to consider race when selecting students to admit.

The case began when white student Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas, saying it had denied her admission because of her race. Fisher claimed she had been passed over in favor of a less qualified black student. She blamed affirmative action policies that require the admission of a certain percent of nonwhite students, and said such policies should be struck down.

## Questioning The Mismatch Theory

One striking development as the court began considering the case was Justice Antonin Scalia's reference to the mismatch theory: that affirmative action places black students in schools that are "too fast" for them, leading to a mismatch between their true qualifications and the schools they attend. Justice Scalia, along with other conservatives, continues to present this theory as fact even though it has been called into serious question.

At the core of this argument is the idea that affirmative-action admissions policies give preference to students of color even though they are less qualified, as evidenced by lower pre-college test scores and grades. The fact that achievement gaps persist in college is often cited as proof that this idea is correct. In other words, if black students with lower SAT scores than their white peers also receive worse grades in college and more often switch out of harder majors, then surely they were less college-ready to begin with. However, the assumption that lower grades indicate lower ability ignores a large piece of the puzzle: the psychological stress faced by many minority students.

## Stress And Stereotypes

It can be challenging to separate these two explanations — psychological environment versus lower ability — because they both can be linked to the same results: lower scores and a greater tendency to switch out of "harder" majors. However, science may provide an answer. In the experiments that we (and many others) conduct, we can measure the impact certain kinds of stress have on students' academic achievement by observing what happens when those factors are removed.  

One psychological strain faced by students of color is stereotype threat. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified or false image of a particular group of people. Decades of research have shown that widespread stereotypes of certain groups as less intelligent often lead students from these groups to worry that they will be seen as less qualified. This threat is stressful. It can undermine these students' learning, performance, and engagement.

## Reducing Bias

When we give students exercises designed to reduce stereotype threat, we see their school performance and engagement increase. They earn better test scores and grades. Some large-scale studies indicate that reducing stereotype threat can lead to the equivalent of about a 62 point increase on the SAT. Moreover, recent research of ours shows that students who have been given such exercises are also more likely to continue taking classes in difficult majors.

Another factor to consider is the expectation of many black and Latino students that they will be treated differently than white students. This expectation is not without cause: bias still exists today in the education system. For example, black grade school students face harsher disciplinary action and receive less warmth from teachers than their white peers. When students observe such differences, they may come to expect rejection from their professors. Such expectations can undermine their trust, feelings of belonging, and motivation in school, and — in turn — their performance.

## Promoting Trust

To combat these effects, we and other researchers have given black students exercises that promote trust in educators or foster feelings of belonging at school. For example, students may read testimonies from older students explaining that instructors' critical feedback is not of of racial bias, but is intended to help them meet high expectations. Such exercises reduce the academic achievement gap between these black students and their white peers 40 to 50 percent. Moreover, these effects tend to strengthen over time: Three years after the belonging exercise, the grade gap between treated black and white students had closed by 79 percent.

If these modest exercises can have such a powerful effect on the performance of students of color, it cannot be simply a lack of ability or preparation holding such students back. Instead, it is likely that test scores and grades underestimate the ability of students of color. They may instead reflect the psychological stress such students experience.

## Easing The Load

To put it another way: Let's imagine that we strap a 15-pound weight to a runner's back during her qualifying race. She will run slower than she otherwise would have. The lazy solution — the "mismatch" solution — would be to keep the weight on her back and assign the runner to a slower heat where she might be able to win, despite the extra weight. Most would probably agree, however, that the real solution is to remove the weight and assign the runner to the faster heat that matches her true ability level.

Affirmative action takes one very important step: It increases the chances that students of color will be accepted to schools that match their true ability level, despite their lower test scores. However, this is only part of the solution. We also need to remove the weight, so that racial academic achievement gaps do not persist once minority students are admitted to top colleges and universities. 

To make progress in racial equality in higher education, the Supreme Court must uphold affirmative action. Teachers and scientists must also continue to find ways to make colleges more supportive. Only then will students of color be able to reach their full potential.
