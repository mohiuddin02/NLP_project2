LOS ANGELES — Four ping-pong balls are proudly displayed in the Los Angeles Clippers' practice gym. The black numbers printed on the balls read 5-3-6-10. That was the winning combination from the 2009 NBA draft lottery.

Winning that lottery did not give the Clippers a big pile of money. It meant they got the first pick of all the newest basketball players coming into the NBA. They chose Blake Griffin, the young star who has helped the Clippers get their team back on track.

Now it's draft season all over again. The NBA's 14 teams will soon find out the order they will use to take turns picking new players in next month's 2015 draft.

## No More Coin Toss

Back in the 1960s, the teams that lost the most games got to pick their new players first. There was just one twist. The worst teams from each conference had a coin toss to see who would get the very first pick.

Then in 1984, Houston started losing games on purpose to give themselves a better chance of getting that year's top pick. To prevent the same thing from happening the following year, the NBA switched over to a lottery system. Officials drew envelopes with the teams' names inside them to determine the draft order.

Many people were frustrated that the new lottery system did not give the lowest-performing teams the best shot at the most talented players. Other people said it was too easy for someone to cheat by making one of the envelopes stand out from the others. The envelope system only lasted a few years.

## Random Number Combinations

The NBA lottery has since become a more complicated process. The organization now relies on ping-pong balls to keep the draft fair for all 14 teams.

Before the drawing begins, each team gets a list of number combinations — sort of like bingo cards. To balance things out, the worst teams get the longest list of number combinations. That gives them better chances of winning the first overall pick.

For example, Minnesota had the NBA's worst record this year, so they will get a list of 250 number combinations. This gives them a 1 in 4 chance of winning the number 1 pick. New York finished next to last, so they will have 199 combinations for a 1 in 5 chance of winning. The chance of winning a top pick goes down for the other teams.

## Next Number Up!

On lottery night, numbered ping-pong balls spin around in a machine for 20 seconds. Then the balls are drawn out one at a time. Whichever team has the matching number combination wins the top pick.

The four balls go back into the drum and the process is repeated to determine the selection order for the other teams.

The ping-pong ball system gives losing teams more chances to improve, but still creates plenty of surprises. Teams that are given the longest list of combinations hardly ever win the very first pick.

"There's no format that's perfect, but this is as close as you're going to get," Orlando Magic Executive Pat Williams said. "I think the league has found the best system at this point."

Williams says the event is guaranteed to be entertaining. He has won the number 1 pick three times, making him the most successful participant in the lottery's 30-year history. "It's a dramatic evening, particularly if there is an absolutely great player in the draft" he said.

## The Drawing Is Done In Secret

The private ping-pong ball drawing will take place in a hotel conference room more than an hour before the results are announced on television. Staff members from all 14 teams will attend along with NBA executives and news reporters.

Nobody can leave the ping-pong ball room until the TV broadcast is complete. Everyone has to give up their cellphones, computers and other devices before they go into the drawing. The NBA has to make sure the results stay secret until the TV show is over.

Lakers' team publicist John Black was in the private room for last year's ping-pong ball drawing. He says things got tense when another team unexpectedly jumped ahead of the Lakers.

"It was interesting, but it was a little bit frustrating," Black said. Big things were happening to the Lakers, but he couldn't tell the team's owners or the manager.

Black believes it is only natural to want to share that information right away. Still, he promises to keep this year's results a secret, even if it feels a bit "weird."
