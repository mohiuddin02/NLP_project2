A 400,000-year-old leg bone was found in a cold, damp Spanish cave called the "Pit of Bones." Most old bones found in Europe are from the Neanderthals. They're an ancient relative of humans that died off thousands of years ago.

But this bone isn't from a Neanderthal. It seems to be from another old relative called the Denisovans. But we don't know much about them. They lived thousands of miles away in Siberia, a very cold area of Asia that's now part of Russia.

Modern humans are Homo sapiens. They don't come from Neanderthals or Denisovans, say scientists. But, they did live at the same time and had children together.

All three groups came from a common ancestor, Homo erectus.

## A Mysterious Link

About 30,000 years ago, the other groups all died off. That left only us, the Homo sapiens.

The scientists can't explain the link between an early European and another population in Asia.

"This really raises more questions than it answers really," said German scientist Svante Paabo. "It's a big surprise."

Paabo and his partners made the discovery. They looked at the bone's DNA to find out who it came from.

The DNA they decoded is the oldest material ever recovered from an early human. It beats the last record by roughly 300,000 years. It was taken from cell mitochondria. They are tiny structures that make energy for the cell. It contains far less information than DNA from a cell nucleus. A cell's nucleus is the control center of the cell.

But, since mitochondria doesn't fall apart quickly, it is easier to study in ancient remains.

## Related To Both Groups?

The bone might have belonged to a group that was related to both Neanderthals and Denisovans. Neanderthals might have gotten different mitochondrial DNA after the two groups split off.

Or, maybe this group had children with something much older, like Homo erectus. And maybe it got its mitochondrial DNA from them.

Answers to this mystery may come out if the team is able to get nuclear DNA from cells in the bone. Paabo said scientists are already working on it.

But the scientists don't know that it will be a success.

Ancient DNA has been very difficult to figure out. There are at least two reasons why. First, DNA break down into smaller pieces over time, which makes it tricky to understand.

The second problem is that the DNA of the scientists and lab workers can get mixed up with DNA from the bone. It can be confusing to know which is which.

## Much Is Unknown About Denisovans

Older DNA samples have been gotten from other animals. Scientists recently put together the DNA of a 700,000-year-old horse. But it was found in freezing conditions, which helped keep the bones preserved. Human remains haven't been found in such cold places.

In the case of the leg bone, some things helped Paabo's team out. Cool, wet conditions within the cave, as well as new technology, made it easier. Alongside the leg were the remains of 28 other individuals.

Bone remains of European Neanderthals have allowed scientists to describe their appearance in detail. This is not the case with Denisovans, however. All that's been found from them is a piece of bone from a child's finger and two teeth, which were discovered in the mountains of Siberia.

We know quite well what Neanderthals looked like. They were bigger than modern humans. They had more muscles and were probably more used to living in a rough and cold climate, Paabo said.

"What's fascinating about the Denisovans is we know next to nothing about how they looked," he said. We have their DNA, "and we have two teeth, and those teeth are huge. The only thing we can say is they must have been very big, or at least had big mouths."

Even though there are questions about the bone, the discovery has been seen by scientists as a huge leap forward.

"This is positively exciting," said Andrea Manica, a scientist at the University of Cambridge in England. It means that much older remains can be explored with genetics.
