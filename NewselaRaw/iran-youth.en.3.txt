TEHRAN, Iran â€” Iran and the United States haven't been talking since 1979. That's when the Islamic Revolution in Iran took place. They threw out their Shah, who had been supported by the U.S. Young Iranians took over the U.S. Embassy for a year.

Recently, [Iran](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) and the U.S. began talking again. Iran agreed to slow work on its nuclear program. Some feared the program would allow Iran to make powerful weapons. In exchange, Iran will be able to trade with other countries again. They had been under trade restrictions. The restrictions make it hard for Iranians to buy many kinds of goods.

The  agreement may bring about more peaceful relations. But some of Iran's most religious leaders continued to warn that the West was deceitful. They said it was trying to hurt Iran.

Things are different for young people in Tehran. In the capital city chants against the United States sound out of date.

## Back Into The World

"In art, in fashion, in cinema and in our daily lifestyle, we copycat American culture," said Sarah. She owns a cafe in Tehran. "There is a big difference between the approved culture and the reality of urban lifestyles in big cities like Tehran."

Not everyone in Iran has the same view of the West. Time passing, satellite television, and the Internet have changed things. The fact that travel is easier has also helped lower anger since the days of 1979. Plus, more than half the population was not even born when the revolution took place.

In June, President Hassan Rouhani easily won the election. He promised to reach out to Iran's old enemies. He spoke to people's desire to bring Iran back into the world community. He began to work at ending the trade bans.

Many young Iranians would fit right in in London or New York. They gather in the small coffeehouses that have opened up recently. For the coffee drinkers, "Death to USA!" is an old-sounding chant. But it is the cherished motto of some very religious Iranians.

"I wear jeans and I eat fake American fast food," said Sasan, 26. He was sitting in a cafe near Revolution Square. "The Islamic revolutionary culture has not influenced our tastes. In fact, our parents' generation has failed to instill revolutionary values to us."

## Talking At A Cafe

Many younger Iranians don't celebrate the storming of the U.S. Embassy. They see them as mistakes that started years of bad feelings and poor trade. The events were considered symbolic of the revolution for a long time.

"It was a blunder that my father's generation committed," said Amirali, 26, another person at the cafe. "Why should we suffer for their mistake?"

Some here can't wait for an end to trade restrictions which have made daily life in Iran so hard.

"My marketing professor was saying that if the United States and Iran" start trading again, Iranians will rush to by U.S. products, said Sasan. He is an engineer enrolled in a marketing course. "I believe this 100 percent."

Some people make money by selling Western goods illegally in Iran. Young Iranians think those people are the ones who don't want to see peace between the West and Iran.

Alireza Qajar, 36, imports plastics for a living. "This whole 'Death to USA' business is serving the interests of those who make a good living as middlemen," he said as he ate pancakes in a cafe.
