BEIJING â€” China is planning to change its controversial one-child law, which is exciting news for Luo Yuannan who has a 2-year-old son and wants another child. Like many modern Chinese women, Luo is hoping for a girl.

"I was amazed," said Luo, 31, who lives in the southern city of Shenzhen. "I always wanted to have a second child and now I will get the chance."

If things go as planned, a second child for Luo could be part of a baby boomlet for China. On Friday, the Chinese Communist Party, which controls the country's government, announced that it would ease the one-child policy. Couples in which either partner is an only child will now be allowed to have a second baby. Previously, exceptions were made if both parents were only children.

Population experts believe the change will benefit about 10 million couples, including Luo and her husband. She is an only child, but he is not.

## No Baby Boom Expected

Certainly the stock markets are anticipating the pitter-patter of little feet. On Monday, the first trading day since the announcement Friday night, shares of toy, milk powder and baby goods manufacturers were up sharply. Shares of Hailun Piano Co., whose instruments are used by Chinese children, also jumped.

Despite the excitement, population experts are not expecting a full-fledged baby boom.

"Symbolically, it is a turning point, but I don't think the numbers will be that large," said population expert Wang Feng.

Wang expects the 16 million annual births to increase by 1 to 2 million. He bases his estimates on studies of couples already permitted to have second children. No more than half of those couples chose to have a second child.

"I am so busy with one child. I can't imagine taking care of two children," said Feng Zhilan, a 32-year-old saleswoman who was coming out of a Beijing children's hospital with her son. "And I'm spending about $490 to $655 a month on him for kindergarten, clothes, activities. It is not possible."

## Chinese Birthrate Has Plunged

Zhao Mei, 30, who has a 15-month-old daughter, said she and her husband had been planning to have a second child all along. But they were figuring they would have to save up the money to pay fines, which run up to $50,000. The fines were for having a second baby without permission.

"Now it's legal," she said. "This is much better."

The one-child policy was introduced in 1979 to rein in population growth in a nation that now has 1.3 billion people. Since then, the Communist Party has allowed countless exceptions to the rules. Ethnic minorities, rural couples whose first child is a girl, and couples with a disabled child have all been allowed to have a second baby. However, the actual law has not been changed in a major way at the national level for years.

The Chinese birthrate has plunged to 1.18 births per woman. This is considered too low, because there will not be enough working young people to support older people who no longer work.

Perhaps no Chinese policy has been as unpopular as the limit on family size.

## "Renewal Of The Chinese Nation"

On Tuesday, government scholar Zhang Yansheng spoke mournfully about his daughter's loneliness as a young girl. She had grown up as an only child in a Beijing apartment compound with few other children.

"I feel we could have provided her with a better life. That is a regret I hope we will make up (for) in the future," said Zhang. "We came to this moment when the one-child policy had to be adjusted for the economy, society and for the renewal of the Chinese nation."

Exactly how the change in the policy will be phased in remains vague. Local governments have control over the issue in China.

"Each province, city or district should make a specific timetable based on local conditions," Wang Peian, a government official, said.
