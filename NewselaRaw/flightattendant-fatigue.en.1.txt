Henry Lund was beat after a long day as a flight attendant when he arrived at his Anchorage, Alaska, hotel desperate to sleep before a 4 a.m. wake-up call for the trip back to Minneapolis-St. Paul. He remembers taking a sleeping pill — maybe two.

The return trip last summer would end his long career at Delta and Northwest airlines.

Lund, 49, says he has no memory of the incident that got him fired: shoving and berating another flight attendant.

His experience illustrates a broader problem for the nation's flight attendants. While they share responsibility with pilots for passenger safety, they work with less rest than foreign flight attendants and can rely more on sleeping pills than pilots do.

## Too Tired To Do The Job?

Flight attendants exhausted from long hours and little rest have forgotten to engage or disarm emergency chutes, failed to properly stow baggage and carry out other safety duties. The federal government says the risk of mishaps may have increased as airlines cut rest periods to save money.

"They're showing up to work impaired," said Peter Roma, who works as a researcher. Roma studied sleep deprivation and fatigue among flight attendants for the Federal Aviation Administration.

The hazards of fatigue appear in flight attendants' own words in dozens of voluntary reports to the FAA.

"If there were an evacuation, I doubted my abilities," wrote one about the effects of working 12 hours without a break. "I also felt like an endangerment to my passengers."

Another injured a foot after she was struck by full coffee pots she forgot to secure. "This occurred because I was very tired," the flight attendant wrote. "I did not sleep well the night prior … constantly watching the clock in anticipation of my early wake-up call."

"None of us (was) alert enough to have been able to efficiently respond to an aircraft emergency," said another.

## Rest Periods For Flight Attendants Got Shorter

There has been plenty of concern about tired pilots. The FAA in 2011 toughened its rules for pilot rest after investigators determined that pilots in the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in New York were  impaired by fatigue.

The FAA set a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots prior to duty, effective next January.

But the government has paid less attention to flight attendants, even though the FAA calls them "safety professionals" and the first line of defense in an emergency.

"These are not just cocktail waitresses, for God's sakes," said Jim Oberstar, a former congressman from Minnesota. "If the flight attendant has to get you out of that plane in 90 seconds, they have to be alert, at their top performance. They can't be run down," said Oberstar, who is now a transportation consultant in Washington, D.C.

One aviation expert thinks the government should make flight attendant rest requirements more like those of pilots.

"Why would we not want to keep fatigue managed to the same degree?" asked John Cox, a longtime airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. "The stresses are different, but the days are equally long or longer."

In Minneapolis, rest times for many former Northwest Airlines flight attendants shortened after the company was taken over by Delta. "Our duty days have gotten two to three hours longer in a lot of cases," said flight attendant Julianna Helminski.

The FAA typically requires at least nine hours' rest, though it can be cut to eight hours on occasion.

## Flight Attendants Get Too Little Rest, Studies Show

FAA studies were conducted from 2008 through 2012 by its Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. Surveying thousands of flight attendants, they focused on sleep patterns of a representative 200 working on domestic and international flights. They revealed that:

—U.S. flight attendants catch fewer than six hours' sleep a day on average on domestic routes. They get fewer than five hours' sleep on international layovers.

—Sleep requirements declined during the recession. Airlines routinely scheduled flight crews "up to the regulation limits," the FAA researchers wrote. The change "could increase the likelihood of … fatigue-related mishaps."

—Four of every 10 flight attendants studied relied on sleeping pills of some kind during layovers.

The routine is familiar to an American Airlines flight attendant who flies between Miami, the Dominican Republic and Panama and says he often works 14-hour days with a 10-hour layover twice a week.

"By the time you close that door behind you at the hotel, it's usually 9:30 or 10 o'clock," he said, with a wake-up call at 6:30 the next morning.

"The first thing I do when I get to the hotel is take my Ambien because it takes a good hour to kick in," he said, referring to one of the more popular prescription sleeping pills. "I can't sleep without it."

On short sleep, he said, he'll sometimes fail to ensure that carry-ons are stowed in overhead bins. He asked for anonymity for fear that his airline would fire him.

Under FAA rules, airline pilots "are generally prohibited from using prescription or over-the-counter medications for sleep," a spokesman said. But the government lets airlines decide rules on the use of sleep aids by flight attendants.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration label warns that Ambien and other sleep aids with the ingredient Zolpidem have been linked to rare but "serious side effects." Those side effects can include "more outgoing or aggressive behavior than normal, confusion, agitation."

## Bad Side Effects From Sleeping Pill?

That described the behavior attributed to Lund on his final flight from Anchorage to Minneapolis-St. Paul. A memo from his personnel file said other attendants and passengers saw Lund shoving a colleague during boarding and calling him a jerk.

Lund said that he didn't recall pushing the colleague and that any problems were "Ambien-induced," wrote a supervisor.

Lund's reported behavior was out of character for the 14-year veteran, said Tim Oyler, a former Northwest manager who oversaw flight attendants. "He was known as an excellent flight attendant. … I was shocked when I heard."
