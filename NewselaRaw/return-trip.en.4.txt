Humans are good at many things, but measuring time is not one of them. Our sense of how much time has passed depends on different things in our lives. Sometimes we think much less time has passed than really has.

One example is called the "return-trip effect." Sometimes we will go somewhere and then when we head back home, that trip feels shorter. Yet this is not really the case.

Some people studied the "return-trip effect" and say travelers really feel it.

## Movie Test Of Time

A new study by scientists used two groups of people. Both groups watched a 20-minute movie showing a man walking around a city. People in both groups were asked to say every time they thought three minutes had passed. The scientists then showed a second movie to the groups.

The groups saw different second movies. The first group watched a man walk to one place. Then he took the same road back home. The second group watched a man take two different trips. All of the trips took the same amount of time.

The study said the two groups did well at telling time during the experiment. Both groups knew when three minutes had gone by. Then they were asked about the trips after the study was over. This time the two groups gave different answers.

## Two Groups, Two Trips, Different Answers

The first group said the man's trip back home was shorter. The second group saw the man take two different trips. They thought both trips were about the same.

Scientists have an idea why this was. They think it may depend on if you already know a route. They might have thought this because he took the same way home. You see things that you saw before, and that makes it go faster.

Yet, people don't have the "return-trip effect" on trips they take often, like to work. This is because they already know the route. They already know how long it will take.

## Go Ride A Bike

There is also a study that found different results. In 2011, scientists asked people to ride a bike to a fair. They split the group in half after they arrived. One group rode home on the same road they took there. The other group took a different way back. This way home was the same length back as the first group. Both groups said they felt the "return-trip effect."

Why did both groups feel the same effect? Scientists think maybe they expected the ride there to be short. Then it turned out to be longer than they thought. On the way home, their brains made them expect a really long ride. Yet it was not really that long, so they felt the "return-trip effect."

In the end, the "return-trip effect" is caused by many things. Some of these things are still unknown.
