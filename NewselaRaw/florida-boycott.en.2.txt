ENGLEWOOD, N.J. — Gerald Marion has spent his whole life fighting fires, not racial injustice.

The Englewood resident rose through the ranks to become the city's second black fire chief, earning a reputation as a calm, steadfast advocate for his department who stayed out of the political fray.

But Marion reached a breaking point over the case of George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. who followed Martin, an unarmed black teenager. The two got in a fight and Zimmerman shot Martin, who died of his wound. A six-woman Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty in the death.

After the jury's decision came out, the fire chief stepped into the debate about race and justice. He asked the City Council to do no business with companies in Florida and other states with stand-your-ground laws. The laws say people are not legally required to try to run away before defending themselves if they believe someone is trying to kill or seriously harm them.

"I've never been an activist," the 46-year-old said. "I'm fed up. It should not be a law that you get to murder because you're uncomfortable."

## Putting Pressure On Florida

Marion said stand-your-ground laws hurt blacks more than other races. Especially when police and others assume black youths are criminals, while white youths get the benefit of the doubt.

"We read the news every day and you're always coming across a story … an African-American gets shot because the shooter was threatened by their presence or the shooter was reacting to a stereotype," he said. "It could be me. It could be my son. It could be my nephew."

Marion may be the first public official in Bergen County, if not New Jersey, to ask a local government to shun Florida businesses in the wake of the verdict. But he is not the only one calling for a boycott of the Sunshine State. There is a widespread desire to pressure Florida business leaders to lean on state lawmakers to get rid of the self-defense law.

Singer Stevie Wonder said he would no longer perform in Florida or other states with stand-your-ground laws. More than 10,000 people have signed a series of online petitions on Moveon.org calling for a Florida boycott. Social media users on Twitter have encouraged rejecting Florida products with hash tags such as #boycottflorida and #notflorida.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is considering a boycott of the state, said Anthony Cureton, president of the Bergen County chapter. Cureton is an Englewood police officer who grew up with Marion. He said he understood the fire chief's frustration and what is driving his actions.

"I share the same position," Cureton said. "He has belief in this. He doesn't hold back when there's something he's passionate about. I stand with him on that point."

## "Not One Taxpayer Dollar"

At the City Council meeting, Marion said the Fire Department would "not spend one taxpayer dollar" on equipment made in Florida. The department has for years purchased its trucks and much of its equipment from E-ONE, a company based in Ocala, Fla.

He said his predecessors bought trucks and equipment from the company so that the fleet would have uniform equipment. But he said companies in New York and Wisconsin sell quality fire apparatus as well as trucks, which cost $350,000 to $750,000. The chief told council members that the boycott would allow him to "sleep with a clear conscience."

"I don't want to be a target anymore," he said. "And I want someone to help. And that has to start with us."

But Marion and other officials who agree with his stand may not be able to help. Legally, they are not allowed to boycott a state's companies when accepting bids for goods and services.

New Jersey's law does not allow favoring one company over another when the towns are seeking goods and services, said Bill Dressel, the executive director of the New Jersey association of cities.

"Local governments must follow state law," he said.

## Disgust Over Stand-Your-Ground

Dressel said state lawmakers could alter the law. They did years ago in banning purchases from South Africa when it was under apartheid, a system that separated blacks and whites. Those laws were overturned two decades ago by a movement led by Nelson Mandela.

Englewood has just one current contract with a Florida-based company. It was hired in May to put together an online list of vacant properties. The company was the only one that applied to do the project, City Manager Timothy Dacey said in an email.

Englewood City Councilman Eugene Skurnick said he would support a Florida boycott. He added he would like to see a wider boycott of towns and cities in New Jersey and other states where there have been racially controversial fatal shootings.

Councilman Marc Forman used strong language in expressing his disgust of stand-your-ground. He described the laws as "an abomination." But he wasn't sure a boycott was the right course of action.

"I mean, we are the United States," he said, "and Florida is not the only state with stand-your-ground laws."
