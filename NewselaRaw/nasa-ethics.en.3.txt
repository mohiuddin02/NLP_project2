LOS ANGELES â€” Astronauts on long space voyages face many health dangers. Bone loss and vision problems are just a couple of risks they take.

To help NASA make decisions about dealing with the risks, the space agency asked the Institute of Medicine to develop a set of guidelines. The results were released Wednesday in a report.

Long spaceflights will likely put crews at some risk, according to the report. Missions may include long stays on the International Space Station and trips to explore an asteroid, or even Mars. Some of these dangers are known. Other dangers cannot be even be imagined yet.

The space agency knows that astronauts are at risk for radiation sickness and blurred vision during long space voyages. Long periods of time spent in zero gravity can cause bone loss. Solar storms have their own risks.

## Big Risk Of Radiation

Radiation in deep space is considered one of the biggest problems in long-term space travel. It comes from the energy in space and can cause serious health problems, including cancer. On Earth, there are limits to how much radiation a person can safely experience.

Also, what happens to a person's state of mind when cooped up for long periods of time on board a spacecraft?

The reports says the space agency should try to reduce risks to astronauts as much as possible. NASA should make sure that the risks are worth it. More good than harm must come out of missions. NASA should also be open about what's going on and let astronauts know what risks they face. Act responsibly, the experts said, and don't try to hide anything.

Long-term space travel could take astronauts past the current radiation safety limits. And this creates a problem for NASA. In 2011, NASA sent the rover, Curiosity, to explore Mars. It took Curiosity more than eight months to get there. A study tracked Curiosity's radiation levels on its way to Mars.

It found that astronauts may get more radiation on the round-trip journey to Mars than is safe. This means scientists may have to figure out how to make the trip shorter or better protect the astronauts. Another option, according to a scientist, would be to change how much radiation is considered safe.

## What To Do

So what does NASA do? Lower the current rules? Change the radiation limit for long-distance space travel? No go, the report said.

Relaxing the safety rules would not be good.

NASA might allow special cases, the committee said. But there should be very few special cases. NASA should also follow the guidelines, the report said.

The agency should offer lifetime health care for its astronauts. Also, different astronauts may have different levels of risk. NASA should steadily observe the astronauts. NASA should also collect health information about them.

In spaceflight, there always has been great risk, the authors pointed out. And there will always continue to be great risk.

From the beginning, spaceflight has pushed the bounds of health and safety risks, they wrote.
