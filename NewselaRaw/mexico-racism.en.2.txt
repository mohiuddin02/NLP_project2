MEXICO CITY â€” Look through the magazines that feature the activities of Mexico's wealthy classes and there's one thing you rarely find: dark-skinned people.

No matter that nearly two-thirds of Mexicans consider themselves moreno, the Spanish word for dark.

Mexico has strong laws barring discrimination based on skin color or ethnicity. But the practices of public relations firms and news media lag behind. Their work promotes the idea that light skin is desirable and dark skin unappealing.

The issue surfaced this month. A casting call for a television spot for Mexico's largest airline stated flatly that it wanted "no one dark." The ad sparked outrage on social media and, ultimately, embarrassed apologies.

## Aggressive Ad: "NO ONE DARK"

"I'd never seen anything that aggressive and that clear, all in capital letters: 'NO ONE DARK,' " said Tamara de Anda, a magazine editor. "I decided to go with it."

Her tweets elicited apologies from both Aeromexico and the Catatonia public relations firm. Catatonia blamed a modeling agency that issued the casting call.

De Anda wrote up her feelings on her popular blog, Crisis of the 30s. She said the incident was part of a far larger phenomenon. A majority of the population is being pushed aside. "I've been swallowing Mexican advertising for 30 years of my life, 11,000 days," she wrote.

Apart from government pronouncements and "folkloric" tourism campaigns, she said, it's as if "dark-skinned people don't exist."

It might seem like a harsh judgment. After all, Mexican tourism campaigns promote the nation's multicultural history and its history as a home of the Aztec and Mayan empires. The nation of 118 million people includes 15.7 million who consider themselves indigenous, or native to the region. Moreover, an estimated 450,000 Afro-Mexicans live mostly along the coasts.

## Gulf Between Law And Practice

Legislators amended Mexico's constitution in 2001 to bar all forms of discrimination. They set up the National Council to Prevent Discrimination. Twenty-two of Mexico's 32 states, including the federal district, now have anti-discrimination laws on the books. The nation has signed more than two dozen international treaties and conventions banning unfair treatment.

But the distance between law and practice is substantial, said Mario Arriagada Cuadriello, a doctoral candidate at the London School of Economics. He is an editor at Nexos, a leading cultural and political magazine.

Arriagada published an article in this month's issue about widespread discrimination in Mexico. He received a flurry of responses.

"People wrote to say that if you are light-skinned, you get better treatment in restaurants," he said. One person told him about an exclusive area of the capital where treatment of dark-skinned Mexicans is especially harsh. Residents of this area ask that their dark-skinned domestic servants not walk in the common gardens "because it is anti-aesthetic and makes the areas ugly."

Jose Vasconcelos is one of Mexico's most prominent intellectuals from the early 20th century. He held up the mestizo as part of a superior "cosmic race" with greater spiritual values. Mestizo is a person of mixed Indian and European blood.

Following the Mexican Revolution that began in 1910, the government embraced the mestizo as an ideal. Images of dark-skinned Mexicans appeared on items such as lottery tickets. By midcentury, things changed. The then-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party adopted images of more European-looking Mexicans wearing Indian clothing. This was an apparent effort to win over the upper class. Yet people of all color filled the Congress, and still do.

## Treated As A Class Apart

At the end of the century, Mexico had accepted global norms against discrimination. Yet kiosks sagged with society magazines, such as Caras, Central and Clase. Published by some of the nation's biggest tycoons, these magazines celebrate the light-skinned moneyed classes, a distinct minority.

Indigenous Mexicans rarely appear in media and are treated as a class apart. The discrimination is closely tied to economic conditions.

"The Indian is only accepted if he is decorative, wearing his traditional costume," de Anda said. But if they are shown in jeans and a jacket, people think he will rob them, she said. On playgrounds and sidewalks, a fighting insult is to describe someone in racial terms as a dark indigenous person.

The government conducted a survey on discrimination in 2010. Only 13 percent of Mexicans considered themselves light-skinned or blonde while 64.6 percent said they were "dark." The rest described themselves as anywhere from "cinnamon," "chocolate," "brown," "yellow," "a little tanned" to "black."

Arriagada flipped through a copy of Clase. The magazine-style insert is an addition to the El Universal newspaper. Clase's pages are filled with photos of prominent families during their beach holidays, at weddings or celebrating social events.

"Look," he said of all the light-skinned people portrayed in its pages, "it's like Norway."
