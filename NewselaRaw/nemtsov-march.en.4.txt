MOSCOW â€” Thousands of people marched through the streets of Moscow in Russia on Sunday. They had come to honor Boris Nemtsov, a politician.

Nemtsov was known for speaking out against the Russian government. He was a leader in the Russian opposition, which disagrees with Russia's government and President Vladimir Putin. He was killed by a shooter on Friday.

The marchers were mostly silent. Many of them carried flowers. Some tied black ribbons to railings.

Some of the people who supported Nemtsov say Putin was responsible for the shooting. The Russian government says these claims are not true.

## Opposed The Government

One of the issues Nemtsov disagreed with Putin about was the fighting in Ukraine.

The nearby country used to be ruled by the same government as Russia. Both countries used to be part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union broke up more than 20 years ago.

Now, some people in eastern Ukraine want to be a part of Russia again. Many others in western Ukraine disagree, and hated being under Soviet rule.

Some say Putin has helped the pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine. The Russian government has given them money and helped them fight the Ukrainian government.

In 2011 and 2012, there were big protests against President Putin. Since then, the government has put some of the protesters in jail and forced some of them to move out of the country.

Now, Putin's popularity in Russia is strong. Last year, 4 out of 5 Russians said they supported the president.

Nemtsov was among the few protest leaders who refused to give in. His courage made him a hero to those who oppose the government.

## Fighting In Ukraine

Still, not many people believe that Nemtsov's death will lead to big changes in Russia. Most Russians get their news from television, protesters say. The government controls television news programs. As a result, most people believe what the government wants them to.

About 30,000 people attended Sunday's march. Many carried Russian flags. Some carried signs that read "I am not afraid." There was a huge pile of flowers at the spot where Nemtsov was killed.

Nemtsov was shot just before midnight on Friday. He was killed near the Kremlin, where Russia's president lives.

Nemtsov was working on a report at the time he died. He believed it proved that Russian soldiers were actually fighting in Ukraine. The Russian government claims no Russian soldiers are now in Ukraine. They say only pro-Russia rebels are fighting Ukraine's government.

No one has been arrested for Nemtsov's death. Investigators said they are looking into several possible reasons for the shooting.

## Will People Take Action?

Protesters hope Nemtsov's death will inspire people to take action.

"I hope we won't get scared," said protest leader Ilya Yashin. The protesters should "continue what Boris was doing," he said.

Putin supporters have suggested several explanations for Nemtsov's death. One idea is that the United States or a Western European country was responsible. The killing was meant to turn the Russian people against Putin, they say.

The United States has said it has no information on who shot Nemtsov.

Many protesters do not believe Nemtsov's killing will bring about any real change. Too many people believe what they hear on television, they say.

"From my experience, trying to convince people isn't possible," said Mikhail Trofimenko. "I think things will only get worse."

He held up a painting of the Russian flag with four bullet holes in it. The holes stood for the four times Nemtsov was shot.
