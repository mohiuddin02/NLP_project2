In the rings of ancient and gnarled trees, a team of scientists has found evidence of a period of constant warmth and wetness in Mongolia between 1211 and 1225. This was the exact time that Genghis Khan rose to power, on his way to building the Mongol Empire.

A coincidence? They think not.

Mongolia is an area traditionally known for its cold and dry climate. The unusual stretch of mild temperatures and heavy rain would have made the grasslands in the Mongolian steppe more productive, the researchers say. The abundant grass would in turn increase the number of animals that could graze and live off it.

Members of Genghis Khan's army reportedly had five horses apiece. Having so many horses allowed them to swiftly conquer an enormous area because they were able to switch horses when one got tired. Khan's army also traveled with a herd of livestock that provided them with food. At its height, the Mongol Empire stretched from eastern Asia to eastern Europe, as well as parts of northern India and the Mideast.

## "Grass Was The Power Of The Day"

"I think of it as nature set the table, and Genghis Khan came to eat," said Amy Hessl, a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University. "He didn't have to come eat, and he didn't have to eat the way he did, but the table was set." She added, "It was a matter of whether or not the culture and the people capitalized on that."

Hessl's co-researcher, Neil Pederson of Columbia University, put it this way: "Grass was the power of the day."

The story of the unusual wet period in Mongolian history was written in scores of ancient Siberian pine trees. Pederson and Hessl first discovered them unexpectedly during a research trip in 2010. The trees were growing on a nearly soil-less lava field in central Mongolia that was dotted with horse skeletons. The researchers said that because the trees are severely in need of water, they are especially affected by changes in the weather.

On that first trip, the two scientists took core samples from about a dozen trees. When they got them back to the lab, they discovered by looking at the rings inside the trees that some of those samples dated back more than 1,000 years. They also found evidence of a climate story that they couldn't ignore. For a small stretch of time, some of the rings were visibly thicker.

## A Lucky Change In Climate

"I was just excited that we had wood from the time of (Genghis) Khan," Pederson said. "And it was really the trees saying 'look how wide our rings are right here.'"

Pederson and Hessl returned to the site two years later to sample more trees. Those samples confirmed the initial findings: The spread of the Mongolian empire happened along with what the trees recorded as a warmer and wetter climate than usual.

In interviews, Pederson and Hessl said there was still more work to be done to absolutely link the what the trees show with human events. They are working with experts from different fields of science and history. They're hoping to find more evidence of how the lucky change in climate may have contributed to the making of the largest empire in history.

"There are still a lot of unknowns out there," Pederson said. "The climate information in the trees is just one little piece of the puzzle."
