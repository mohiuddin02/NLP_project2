SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. â€” There have never been clocks in baseball. But, for the first time in 150 years, that could change.

Football has a play clock, and basketball has a shot clock. Now, Major League Baseball (MLB) is currently testing new clock rules in the Arizona Fall League (AFL), a minor league run by the MLB.

For now, baseball is the only major sport without any time limits. It could soon have a pitch clock, a pitching-change clock, and an inning-break clock. Umpires could charge pitchers with automatic balls and batters with automatic strikes. The rule changes are intended to speed up the game and make it more attractive to younger viewers.

Frank Kremblas, a manager in the AFL, said major league baseball games are usually the slowest. The AFL was changing its rules just as an experiment, he added.

## What's Taking So Long?

Baseball games have gotten longer in recent years. The time of an average game has increased from 2 hours, 23 minutes in 1950 to more than three hours this season.

Games aren't just getting longer, they're getting slower, too. Teams averaged 5.14 runs per game in 2000, the highest total since 1936. Since then scoring has declined, settling at 4.07 runs per game this year. Strikeouts have steadily increased for the entire previous century and especially in the past 10 seasons.

If fewer runs are scored and fewer balls hit, what's taking so long?

Teams now try to see more pitches when they bat and use more pitchers on defense. New video reviews added dead time. Pitchers and hitters are slowing the game as well, by fussing with equipment and taking practice swings.

MLB has a system that tracks every pitch thrown in games. Using the time of each pitch, officials can calculate the pace for each pitcher or hitter.

## 20 Seconds For A Pitch

The fastest pitchers, like Mark Buehrle of the Toronto Blue Jays and Doug Fister of the Washington Nationals, take about 18 seconds between pitches. Edinson Volquez of the Pittsburgh Pirates averaged 25.3 seconds between pitches, the fourth-slowest time this year.

Batters are guilty of slowing the game down, too. Hanley Ramirez of the Los Angeles Dodgers took a major league-leading 28.1 seconds between pitches. His teammate Yasiel Puig took 26.7 seconds, which tied for third. Dodgers games took an average of 3 hours, 14 seconds this season.

The AFL experimental clock rules were announced in early October to address these problems. MLB officials want to take away lessons from the fall league to speed up the pace of play.

The biggest change is the pitch clock. Pitchers must deliver the ball within 20 seconds or be charged with an automatic ball. Batters must keep at least one foot in the batter's box during their at-bat, with certain exceptions.

You can only step out if you foul a pitch off or if you swing, said Josh Bell, a player in the fall league.

## Watching The Clock

Pitchers have to deliver the first pitch of an inning within 2 minutes, 5 seconds after the end of the previous inning and batters must be in the batter's box within 1:45. Pitchers will be charged with a ball if they take too long, while batters will take an automatic strike if they take too long.

Pitching changes can take no longer than 2:30. Teams are also limited to three timeouts and can issue an intentional walk merely by saying so rather than throwing four intentional balls.

"Really, it's kind of a lot of time," Tyler Glasnow, a fall league pitcher, said.

The rules are enforced at Salt River Fields, the only AFL ballpark outfitted with the clocks. There are five digital clocks that count down the various times. There are two in each dugout, two behind home plate and one on the wall in left-center field. The clocks behind home plate line up with the first and third basemen's view of the strike zone so they don't distract pitchers.

Just having the clocks on the field changed the game, Bell said.

"You're trying to pick up the ball, the lights are flashing right behind," he said. "It's definitely a little bit different."

## Shorter Isn't Always Better

Pitcher Mark Appel committed two violations on Oct. 14. First, he stepped off the mound as the runner on first faked toward second base. Later, he also exceeded the between-innings time limit after warm-up throws wound up off-target. Both times, he was charged with an automatic ball.

"I don't think the pitch clock saves that much time with runners on," Appel told MLB.com, adding that the clock rules were "very different."

So far, however, the rules seem to work. Through Oct. 24, nine-inning games under the new rules averaged 2 hours, 20 minutes, while nine-inning games without clock rules averaged 2:49. The average fall league game took 2:51 in 2013.

Whether the experimental rules move to the major leagues, and to what extent, remains unclear. The game can only speed up so much, and shorter isn't always better, some say.

Said Pittsburgh Pirates manager Clint Hurdle in September: "If it's all about a clock, go watch another sport."
