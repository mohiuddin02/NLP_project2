According to a new report, young women in the workplace are now very close to earning as much as men with similar jobs. But what remains to be seen is whether motherhood will slow their progress. It did for women before them.

The report was issued by the Pew Research Center. As of last year, Pew found, women workers ages 25 to 34 were making 93 percent of what men of the same ages earned. This was much closer to a workplace where men and women make the same amounts. In earlier generations, men made a lot more.

Between 1980 and 2012, the pay gap between men and women has gradually narrowed for American workers. During that time, wages rose for women and dropped for young men.

Only 15 percent of young women said they had suffered workplace discrimination because of their gender (that is, their sex). Female millennials — women ages 18 to 32 — are now as likely as men to have asked their bosses for a promotion or a raise. This was not true for generations of women before them.

## "Will They Slide Behind?"

Yet most young women — 75 percent — believe that more change is needed before men and women are equal at work, the Pew survey showed. Almost 3 out of 5 say that it is easier for men to get top jobs in business and government. Nearly two-thirds fear that having children will hold them back in the workplace.

"I don't think I've been held back because of my gender," said 25-year-old Alexandria Manson, who designs images and graphics.

But in all kinds of other fields, "I can definitely see there are way more executive men than there are women." And this, she said, is "not because of their ability."

Millennials have reason to worry: Earlier generations of young women also seemed to be narrowing the gender gap in wages. But then they started to slip as they got older, and many started juggling motherhood with jobs.

In 1995, for instance, women in their late 20s and early 30s earned 85 percent as much as men with similar jobs. But by 2012, when those same women were in their 40s and 50s, things had changed. By then they were only making 76 percent as much as men their age.

"The question mark is, what will happen to millennials 10 or 15 years into their career?" said Pew researcher Kim Parker. "Will they slide behind?"

## Balancing Work And Children

Among Americans of all ages, there are big differences between mothers and fathers. Mothers are almost three times as likely to have quit their jobs at some point to care for a child or other family member. Mothers are also more likely to reduce their hours or take time off for family.

"Nowadays, a childless woman may be able to work every bit as much as her male counterpart," professor Barbara Risman said. "What's holding people back is when they become parents." This is true not only for mothers, she said, but also for fathers "who take equal or primary responsibility for raising children."

Still, when it comes to working parents with children younger than 18, there are big gender differences. Mothers are three times as likely as fathers to have their careers hurt by parenthood.

When Kylie Anderson worked in the entertainment business, she noticed other women struggling to balance work and children. None seemed to breeze through it, said Anderson.

The 22-year-old concluded that working as a parent would be difficult for her career. "Having a child," she said, "would be game over, at least for a while."

There is also another big difference among millennials: Women are still less likely than men to aspire to becoming the boss. And that gap persists even though most millennial women are as focused on their careers as men, if not more so.

"I get frustrated with my friends because they don't aspire," said 30-year-old Jordan Boldt. "It's like we grow up thinking that we can't go far."
