DONETSK, Russiaâ€” Tatiana Poludnitsina has nothing. All her belongings and papers were burned when her home in Ukraine was bombed last month.

With the help of strangers, Poludnitsina crossed the border into Russia. She now lives in a refugee camp outside the small border town of Donetsk.

"I have nothing anymore, nowhere to go, no apartment," Poludnitsina said.

Her story is shared by tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees here. They had to leave their homes because their cities were becoming war zones.

## Camps Are Only Temporary

Pro-Russia rebels have been fighting against Ukraine's government for months. They have taken control of cities across eastern Ukraine. They want part of Ukraine to join Russia. The rebels speak Russian and receive support and weapons from the Russian government.

About 814,000 Ukrainians have entered Russia since the beginning of the year, according to the United Nations. Most of them seem to be Russian-speaking or have family ties to Russia.

The Russian government has opened four refugee camps to provide for Ukrainians crossing the border. The camp near Donetsk is one of them.

Many refugees left the camps to stay with friends or relatives. Some have rented apartments. Most the people who remain in the camps do not have passports or official papers. The papers would let them perhaps move on to other countries or settle in Russia.

## The Waiting Is Difficult

As the refugees wait in the camps, flies swarm inside the stuffy tents. On some days, the temperature soars to nearly 90 degrees. Wooden-board walkways crisscross the sand and dirt between the shelters. The heat and wind make it nearly impossible to stay clean.

"We wash our hair with cold water," refugee Yevgenia Melikyan said. She arrived at the camp in early August with her 76-year-old father and teenage son and daughter. "Mothers heat the water to bathe their children."

There are no books, no television, no Internet. Youngsters play in the dirt. Many are frightened by loud noises.

"There's not a day that we don't hear explosions," Melikyan said.

Meals include porridge mixed with stewed canned meat. Poludnitsina said she wished she could have a hot dog.

Melikyan said her family left Luhansk after food became hard to find and the water was shut off. Most nights the family huddled in the basement of their home. They were terrified by the sound of gunfire and bombs.

## Blaming The Governments

Many of the refugees in Russia blame their situation on the Ukrainian government and other leaders, like President Barack Obama, who support it.

Refugees here defended the pro-Russia fighters. They claimed the rebels were ordinary citizens protecting the lives of Russians in Ukraine. They thanked the Russian government and its president, Vladimir Putin.

Ukraine blames Putin for backing the rebels.

Poludnitsina complained that America and Ukraine did not take in any refugees or give them help. "It's only Russia that's helping us," said Poludnitsina, who wants to become a Russian citizen.

More than 250,000 Ukrainian refugees have asked to stay in Russia.

Many Russian citizens have stepped forward to help them.

In the Russian town of Rostov-on-Don, about 100 miles south of Donetsk, Anatoly Kotlyarov started sheltering friends four months ago. Word spread and soon even strangers were being sent to him.

Kotlyarov helped establish a volunteer group that provides emergency help to refugees. The group gives out baby food, diapers and other goods. It also has helped 5,000 refugees move to different parts of Russia, Kotlyarov said.

## Waiting For What Comes Next

On a recent afternoon at Rostov's train station, dozens of refugees curled up in chairs or slept on the floor. They waited for trains to take them to towns across Russia.

Marina Dolgopolova, 29, was preparing for her Sept. 12 wedding when her home in Ukraine was bombed. Dolgopolova said that she and her fiance sold their wedding rings to pay for bus tickets to Rostov.

She arrived with a pair of jeans, two T-shirts and a laptop computer.

The young couple was headed to a town 650 miles from their home, where they do not know anyone.

But that doesn't matter, Dolgopolova said. "The main thing is to find a job and somewhere safe to live."
