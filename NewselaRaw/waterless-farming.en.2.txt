Farmers in California's Central Valley are rediscovering dry farming, a way of growing crops that was used for centuries. The method is as simple as it is risky.

Dry farming relies solely on rainwater to keep crops growing throughout a dry season. Used for centuries in the Mediterranean region to grow crops like olives and grapes, the practice is not for the faint of heart. One dry winter can ruin a harvest and put an huge dent in a farmer's wallet.

"Dry farming would be a hard life because you're at the whim of the rains," said Jay Lund, a scientist at the University of California-Davis. "It would have to be a fairly small-scale farm, and in some cases, it would be a good road to poverty."

Yet dry farming has its believers. Many are small farmers and winemakers who either lack a good water supply or believe that dry farming produces better-tasting fruits and vegetables.

"I think people are interested in the idea," said David Runsten of the Community Alliance with Family Farmers. Runsten recently promoted dry farming to a group of California farmers. "We're promoting it because we think it makes for better wine," he said.

## It Saves A Lot Of Water

But making sure the farms can keep going is also an issue. Runsten pointed to a study that found that one vineyard in California's Napa Valley saved roughly 64,000 gallons of water per acre through dry farming each year.

"We're pumping a bunch of groundwater to produce cheap wine in California right now," Runsten said. "I don't know if that's sustainable."

A new study warned that water from the Central Valley aquifer, the large storage of underground water farmers use for irrigation, was being used up too fast. This was happening even when wet years followed dry ones.

Nearly half a million acres of land is devoted to wine grapes in California. That is more than 780 square miles - more space than Los Angeles and New York combined. Of those, about 2,000 acres are dry-farmed; the rest are drip-irrigated, Runsten said. Because dry-farmed fruits and vegetables need more space between each tree, it can be costly to operate. But such spacing means roots spread out farther. This results in healthier trees and vines as well as more intense flavor, said Jeff Maine, a California farmer. He said he saw the superiority of dry-farmed fruit when he dry-farmed a 100-year-old heirloom apricot orchard between 2003 and 2010.

"The dry-farmed stuff has a whole different flavor," said Maine, who co-owns the farm Good Humus Produce, with wife Anne. "People really respond to the traditional aspects of it."

## Apricots "Worth Any Price"

The popularity of Maine's apricots was not lost on Sacramento Food Co-op general manager Paul Cultrera, whose California store sold the apricots. "Annie and Jeff's apricots are worth any price," Cultrera said. "They're that good, and that much better than whatever others we sell."

The store expects to sell potatoes and tomatoes that come from farms using the dry-farm method, said Kerri Williams, produce manager at the store. The store sold the tomatoes last year and will offer them again in late summer.

"The tomatoes were very popular. Once people tasted them, they didn't care what they cost," Williams said.

Typically, dry-farmed fruit grows much smaller than fruit from irrigated farms. The farms also produce less fruit per acre.  "There is no way to get around the fact that you're trading size and plumpness for flavor," Maine said.

"You still find that people buy with their eyes," he said "unless you can get the message to them with marketing, before they get to the point of purchase."

## Rotating Crops To Preserve Water

One California farmer who still dry-farms today is Fritz Durst. He grows garbanzo beans, wheat, safflower and other crops.

"There is no irrigation here, only rainwater in this area," said Durst. His family has farmed for five generations. Durst's farm gets between 8 and 30 inches of rainfall each year. "What we've done is we've adapted to the rainfall," he said. He has learned to follow certain crops because of the limited water.

To preserve the rainwater, Durst uses the residue from past crops to trap moisture. That moisture, however small, keeps his crops alive throughout the dry season.

Durst also farms irrigated crops. He said he understands why farmers avoid dry farming. But he believes irrigation comes with its own burdens. "Believe me, no one irrigates for fun, because when you irrigate it costs you money."

Maine said he would love to give dry farming another chance. "I'd have to find the right place for something like a rare fruit, or a sustainable fruit," he said. "Raising something with all those nice concepts rolled into one orchard? That would be fun."
