MIAMI, Fla. â€” President Barack Obama spoke about climate change during his first visit to the Florida Everglades Wednesday. He said the global threat is putting the national park in danger.

Before his speech, the president and park rangers walked the Anhinga Trail, the national park's most popular tourist stop. They passed baby alligators and a pair of black vultures. The birds are famous for eating the rubber off visitors' vehicles.

Obama said he could think of "no better place" to spend Earth Day than the River of Grass, as the Everglades is called.

But his decision to give the speech in South Florida clearly had another purpose. Voters will elect the next president in 18 months. The Republican candidates for president, including one from Florida, doubt whether climate change is man-made. However, important scientific research says that climate change is mainly caused by pollution from fuels like oil and gas. Climate change is also called global warming because these emissions are causing the Earth to slowly become hotter.

## "Can No Longer Be Denied"

In his speech, the president also took a verbal shot at Florida Governor Rick Scott. The Republican governor has been criticized for ordering state workers not to use the term "climate change."

"Climate change can no longer be denied," Obama said. It "cannot be edited out of the conversation." Scott has denied that state workers were told not to use the term. He also turned down an invitation to join Obama in the Everglades.

The president was also in South Florida to speak about his role in solving environmental problems. His government has limited the pollution which causes climate change. It also spent $2.2 billion on a project to save the Everglades.

Obama was expected to speak about new environmental efforts in four areas of the country. One of them is Southwest Florida. The National Park Service also will make Marjory Stoneman Douglas' cottage a national monument. Douglas inspired people to restore the Everglades with her nonfiction book, "Everglades: River of Grass."

Obama's decision to speak about climate change could influence the presidential campaign. It may pressure Republican candidates to openly discuss the subject. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has announced he will run for president.

## Restoring The Everglades

Josh Earnest is Obama's spokesman. He said Obama's speech was intended to start a debate on the issue. He said that the Republicans who deny climate change harm the people that they were elected to represent.

On Tuesday, Governor Scott called on the federal government to give Florida the $58 million it promised to restore the Everglades. The White House admits that the government has owed the money since before Obama took office. Florida is spending $1.9 billion to save the Everglades, nearly a billion dollars more than the federal government.

"President Obama needs to live up to his commitment on the Everglades," Scott said. He added that important parts of the project have been delayed for more than a year because of the lack of money.

Earnest suggested that Scott ask the Republican-controlled Congress to give Florida the money. Congress is in charge of giving out money. The Republicans are opposed to Obama's political group, the Democrats.

## Florida's Wetlands In Danger

Obama's visit comes at a critical time for the Everglades.

Last November, Florida residents voted to buy land to save the Everglades. Yet state lawmakers did not want to spend the money to buy about 46,000 acres.

This week, scientists announced new research that showed even more dramatic changes could occur as a result of climate change. The United Nations group predicts increases in temperature, sea level and ocean salt. This puts the Everglades, which is partially underwater, in danger.

Mangrove forests along the Everglade's coast protect it against storms and floods. As climate change becomes worse, the trees could disappear, studies found. Studies also predict that soil will become more salty. As this happens, ocean water will flood into the Everglades, making it even smaller. The Everglades wetlands, which provides much of South Florida's freshwater, are already half their original size.

Evelyn Gaiser is an ecologist at Florida International University. She was invited to meet with Obama after his speech. Gaiser said the public is finally recognizing the effects of climate change. What is happening in the Everglades has made more people take notice. She said the Everglades could be an example for other places endangered by climate change around the world.
