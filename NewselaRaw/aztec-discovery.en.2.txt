MEXICO CITY, Mexico — A Mexican archaeologist said his team has found an important passageway at Mexico City's Templo Mayor. The tunnel-like passage apparently leads to two sealed chambers below the religious temple. It is the newest finding in the search for the still undiscovered tomb of an Aztec ruler.

The Aztecs were a civilization in Mesoamerica. They had a powerful empire that controlled much of what is now Mexico and Central America.

The Aztecs ruled between 1325 and 1521. They are believed to have cremated, or burned, the remains of their leaders during their rule. However, the final resting place of the cremains, or cremated remains, has never been found. Experts said the new discovery is significant.

## Gold And Bones

The National Institute of Anthropology and History is a Mexican government department that researches Mexican history. They announced recently that a team had discovered a 27-foot-long (8.4-meter) tunnel. The team was led by archaeologist Leonardo Lopez Lujan. The tunnel leads into the center of a circular platform. It was used for religious ceremonies. Dead rulers were believed to have been cremated at the site. Writings by Spanish explorers in the 1500s said that rulers were burned there.

The mouth of the tunnel was sealed by a 3-ton slab of rock. When experts lifted it in 2013, they found somewhat disturbing artifacts in a hollow space.

Gold ornaments and the bones of eagles and infants were found in an offering box. Two skulls of children between 5 and 7 years old were found. The skulls had the first three vertebrae, suggesting they might have been decapitated. The kind of stone knives used in human sacrifices were also found, as well as a hand, and bones from two feet.

## Spanish Conquest Collided With Aztec Empire

One researcher found signs that a passageway appeared to lead deeper into the ceremonial platform. The platform was known as the Cuauhxicalco (pronounced kwow-she-KAL-koh). Written accounts from after the 1521 Spanish conquest indicated that rulers' remains were burned at this location. The Spanish conquest is what eventually brought an end to the Aztec Empire. 

The passageway is about 18 inches (45 centimeters) wide and 5 feet (1.5 meters) high.

"Once the rocks and dirt were dug out, we saw that it led directly into the heart of the Cuauhxicalco," Lopez Lujan said.  At the end of the passageway, there are two sealed entrances, he continued.

The passageway was re-filled for about two years because work was going on at one of the entry points to the ruins.

With that work almost finished, Lopez Lujan intends to start digging again in 2016.

## What Secrets Lie Beyond The Doors?

He hopes to go into the passageway and find out what is behind the two sealed doors, he writes. The theory is that there will be containers holding the remains of Aztec rulers. However, they could be wrong, he continued. 

It would make sense for rulers' remains to be kept at this location. The Templo Mayor site was the most significant temple system in the Aztec capital, known as Tenochtitlan. However, Mexican archaeologists have been searching for the tombs with little luck for years.

In 2007, archaeologists used ground-penetrating radar and found underground chambers. They were located directly below a huge stone block carved with an image of Tlaltecuhtli (tlahl-tay-KOO-tlee), the Aztec god of the earth. At the time, Lopez Lujan suspected an emperor's tomb might lie beneath, but such a tomb was not found.

Any artifacts linked to an emperor would bring great pride to Mexico. The country has tried unsuccessfully to recover Aztec artifacts from other museums, including the Ethnology Museum in Austria.

## Cautiously Hopeful

Lopez Lujan is being cautious. He says the presence of graves at the end of the newly found passageway is simply a theory.

Lopez Lujan and his team guess that behind the entrances they will find two small chambers. The chambers might hold the remains of some rulers of Tenochtitlan, like Moctezuma I and his descendants, Axayacatl and Tízoc, he says. 

Moctezuma I, the second Aztec emperor, ruled from about 1440 to 1469. Moctezuma II came after him. Moctezuma II was the emperor who first went up against Hernan Cortes, the Spanish explorer. Cortes led the expedition into Mexico that defeated Moctezuma II. The Aztec Empire fell shortly afterward.
