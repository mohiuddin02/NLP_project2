It is a way to help Clinton connect with younger voters. So far, her famous friends have not changed the thoughts of younger voters. Many students like Bernie Sanders better. Sanders is a 74-year-old senator from Vermont. 

Sanders and Clinton both want to run for president of the United States. First they will have to win the vote from the Democratic group. 

## A Tight Race In Iowa

There are two main political groups in the United States. They are the Republican and Democratic group. Each group will choose one candidate. Sanders and Clinton are both Democrats competing against one another.

The state of Iowa is holding a caucus on Feb. 1. The caucus is a political event that shows how people in Iowa will vote. Both Republicans and Democrats have their own caucus. The winners in the caucus will get much attention. They are not winning the election though. Other voters will think more about the winning candidates and may vote for them later.

Both Sanders and Clinton want young voters. Young people can make a difference in close elections. Clinton and Sanders are locked in a close race in Iowa. Clinton is winning most of the country. Sanders is winning most young voters, like students.

"Bernie appeals more to my cool," said Alex Bare. Bare is a 19-year-old student at the University of Iowa. Bare plans to vote for Sanders. However, he came to see Demi Lovato for the free concert on Thursday.

## Many "Feel The Bern"

Erin Kelleher is a student at the University of Iowa. She is still deciding between Clinton and Sanders. Kelleher said the Lovato show would not change her vote because she does not care about famous people.

Sanders has some famous friends, too. Actress Susan Sarandon and actor Justin Long have been at Sanders events. Hip-hop artist Killer Mike has also shown support for Sanders. The bands Foster the People and Vampire Weekend support Sanders, too. Many students like Sanders even without help from famous people. 

Students are not against Clinton, but most like Sanders better. Sanders wants to make college free, and students like that. Students even like his rolled-up sleeves and grumpy grandpa attitude.

Most of all, students love his slogan: "Feel the Bern."

## Youths Can Sway Elections

"Bernie gets me stoked," said Ian Wold, a student at the University of Iowa. He plans to vote for Sanders in the Iowa caucus.

President Barack Obama won with the support of young people. Their votes have become more important. They can make a huge difference in who wins in a close race. Support from young voters make candidates look stronger and popular.

Many students like Sanders. Still, some students at the concert like Clinton. Austin Graber is a student who said he thought Clinton was "the most qualified." Lauren Ellbogen said she would be working for Clinton at the caucuses. Ellbogen said she did not think Sanders was "realistic" and that his ideas are not likely to happen.

Many students said the Lovato concert was a good move for Clinton. Not all of them were convinced. Jen Moulton is a student who prefers Sanders. Moulton said the concert was "kind of cool, but it comes off like she's trying really hard."
