SAN JOSE, Calif. — Firefighters finally began to get a handle on the massive Rim Fire near Yosemite National Park, but not before the blaze destroyed one popular San Francisco Bay Area family camp and the costs to fight the fire reached tens of millions of dollars.

Berkeley officials said the fire incinerated the city's popular high Sierra camp on Aug. 25. San Jose canceled the rest of its season just miles away, after the blaze scorched about a dozen cabins.

News of the destruction brought the fire home for generations of Bay Area campgoers.

"Our family is feeling pretty devastated because we have so many happy memories there, and it was a place we always look forward to returning," said David Kojan. He is one of many Berkeley natives who cherished visits with his wife and two young sons to the Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp just west of Yosemite.

## Fire's Cost Tops $20 million

The Rim Fire had grown to about 160,000 acres late on Aug. 26, creeping within a mile of the source of the Hetch Hetchy water system, after eating up another 27,000 acres over 36 hours. However, the one encouraging sign was that the blaze had spread twice as quickly the week before. The fire containment on Monday tripled to 20 percent.

Still, the stubborn fire became the biggest active wildfire in the United States, and the 11th-largest in the state's recorded history dating back 81 years.

As the cost of the fire topped $20 million, President Barack Obama pledged federal resources in a call to Gov. Jerry Brown. Brown visited Monday with some of the firefighters battling the biggest of California's nearly dozen major wildfires burning from Eureka in the north to Los Angeles in the south, stretching resources amid peak wildfire season. Brown said "the firefighters have a real challenge on their hands" but promised to "get it done" with the money and manpower available.

"Whatever it takes, I'm going to make sure the resources are deployed," Brown said at a news conference in Tuolumne.

The Rim Fire moved within a mile of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite on Monday. The reservoir is the source of water for 2.6 million Bay Area residents and businesses. Most of the infrastructure is fire-resistant, such as underground steel pipes and the concrete O'Shaughnessy Dam. But officials remained concerned that ash will dirty the water.

## Constant Air Drops Pay Off

Still, the reservoir is already just about full. Crews have built up several months of back-up water supply, said Charles Sheehan, a spokesman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. The utility also sped up its transfer of water from Yosemite to other reservoirs in hopes of building up an even bigger supply.

The fire has not affected water quality yet, Sheehan said. But if it does get contaminated and the back-up supply is exhausted, the utility can buy water from other agencies such as the Santa Clara Valley Water District and the East Bay Municipal Utility District.

"There would be no change in water quality and no interruption in service," Sheehan said. It was unclear how buying extra water could affect customers' water bills, he said.

Containment of the Rim Fire surged as the dirt lines dug by firefighters around the perimeter and constant air drops of water and retardant finally started to pay off.

"Slowly but surely, we are making progress," said Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant.

But it was too late to save the city-run Berkeley Tuolumne camp just west of Yosemite, which first opened 91 years ago for $1 a day and 60 cents for children. Famed architect Bernard Maybeck was one of the locals dispatched to the area to finish the site, according to news reports of the time.

## "Heartbroken" Over Camp's Destruction

The fire burned most of the 80 buildings, including 72 tent cabins, city spokesman Matthai Chakko said.

Crews were able to save many historical items such as documents and photographs, but it was of little comfort to local families.

Stephanie Agnew, a Berkeley resident who started going to the camp six years ago when her son was 3, said her family was "heartbroken."

"How do you ever get back what you had there?" Agnew said Monday. "It was in the most beautiful setting."

The San Jose-run Family Camp east of Groveland, a neighbor of the Berkeley camp, saw 14 of its 67 tents destroyed. On Monday, the city canceled the rest of its camping season, which was set to last through October. Two ATVs, water well infrastructure and one out-building were also reduced to ashes.

Last week, crews evacuated 110 Berkeley high school students and staff who were staying at the 47-acre San Jose camp. But crews expect to rebuild and open in time for the next season in April, said San Jose Parks Superintendent Art Catbagan — as long as the fire cooperates. He said workers are constantly dousing spot fires there, some of which have reignited 20 minutes after being extinguished.

## "The Fire Has Moved Away"

"We believe that the worst of it is done because the fire has moved away," Catbagan said.

Over the last week, the San Francisco-based Jewish summer camp, Camp Tawonga, and the city of San Francisco-run Camp Mather were also evacuated.

The Rim Fire continued to threaten 4,500 homes in rural Tuolumne County after destroying 23 structures since the fire started on Aug. 17. A small section of the Yosemite back country on the western edge of the park has also burned, but tourist destinations remained open.

About 3,700 firefighters, including crews from the Bay Area, were battling the blaze, which resulted in two injuries and sent smoke to drift as far away as Lake Tahoe and Reno. The cause of the fire was still under investigation.
