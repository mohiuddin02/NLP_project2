DHAKA, Bangladesh — Mukhta Mollah smooths the red material and pushes it through a sewing machine. She is in Bangladesh, an Asian country next to India, making women's shirts that will be sent to America. She works six days a week in this hot and sweaty factory. Each workday is eight hours or more.

Today, like every day, she will try to make 1,000 shirts.

More than 350 seamstresses, women sewing clothes, sit in rows in this huge factory. Bright lights buzz and blink overhead. Huge loud fans push around the hot air, which smells like new clothes.

It takes Mollah less than 30 seconds to complete her part of the shirt. A helper piles the shirts into a bin to take to the next station. Mollah has gotten used to the hard factory work.

## Harsh Working Conditions

Mollah knows that she won't get rich; she sends nearly half of her $20-a-week paycheck home to her family. But she's grateful that her small salary has allowed her to escape her home village. Her schoolgirl friends are still stuck there.

All of them were married before age 16. All have children of their own. All have moved in with their husbands' families and must get permission from their mothers-in-law to leave the house.

"For them, it's a cage," said Mollah, 19. "My life is much better than theirs because they have no freedom. When I go back to my village and see my friends, they ask me, 'Can you take us with you?'"

Bangladesh's clothing factories have been known to treat their workers badly. The factories can even be deadly. An eight-story factory collapsed last April, crushing more than 1,100 workers. Six months earlier, a factory fire killed 112 people who could not escape because their bosses had locked the doors to keep them working.

Workers in Bangladesh face terrible conditions — often working 80 hours a week and fearing terrible accidents. But the work is still a good opportunity for women in this poor, traditional Muslim society. There is not much else for them to do.

About 5,600 factories in Bangladesh have more than 4 million workers; almost all of them are female.

## Proud Of Their Apartment

The factory jobs allow teenage girls to become adults with some independence, said Sajeda Amin, a New York sociologist who studies the clothing factories. Still, she added, it's not as good as getting a college education.

Recently, workers have protested in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. In response, the factories paid their workers more. Now, they must pay workers $68 a month, or 33 cents an hour. But the clothing workers still need more rights, their supporters say.

It's lunchtime, and Mollah leaves the factory with most of the other 350 workers for the hourlong break. She meets up with the three other young women she lives with.

Their two-bedroom apartment is two blocks away. The four women all live in one small room. Two sleep on a double bed, and two sleep on a pad on the concrete floor. Every other week they switch sleeping places. They all split the rent, which is $45 a month.

The apartment is tiny and very simple, but Mollah and her roommates are proud of it. Even though road dust always blows in through the windows, they work hard to keep the apartment clean.

## "I Make My Own Decisions"

Kanchi Hazi, the most outgoing roommate, said the apartment is luxurious compared to her home village. There, she shared a small house with her parents, six sisters and two brothers.

The 24-year-old left her home village seven years ago to take this factory job. She sews pockets on blouses and works as many hours as she can get.

"I like it here." she said. "I make my own decisions. I can earn money and help my family."

By working extra hours, she can make $78 a month. She sends half of it home to help her poor family.

Every few months, she rides the bus for three hours to visit her family. Some villagers support her decision to work. They say she is making good money and helping her family. Others scold her, saying that it is not proper for a young single woman to work alongside men.

But when she steps off the bus, younger village girls dance around her. "They see me as a role model," Hazi said. "I can do whatever I want. I can enjoy myself. I have freedom."
