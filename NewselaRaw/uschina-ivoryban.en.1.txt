BEIJING, China â€” What will it take to save the nearly extinct elephant population?

Wildlife organizations have doubled down on the question since Sept. 25. On that date, the White House announced that China and the United States had agreed to ban commercial ivory sales in both countries.

Many have welcomed the announcement. Yet they have raised questions about the exact terms of the ban and the timeline for implementation. Another concern is loopholes, or ways around a law. These openings could continue to enable the trade.

"In 2009, when China legalized the import of (some) ivory, poaching started to go up dramatically across Africa," said Peter Knights, the executive director of WildAid. "What we think is that the sales ban will hopefully have an equal effect in reducing that poaching."

## Thousands Killed For Their Tusks

The Chinese middle and upper classes' fondness for ivory jewelry, art products and ornamental carvings could drive many countries' wild elephant populations to extinction, experts say. Tens of thousands of elephants are killed every year for their tusks, according to the Born Free Foundation, a wildlife organization. Mainland China is widely considered to be the world's biggest ivory consumer. The United States ranks second.

China signed the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES. This international treaty protects species from extinction due to the wildlife trade. In 1989, the convention declared the African elephant an endangered species. International commercial trade in elephant tusks was essentially banned.

Yet in 2008, CITES made an exception. It permitted China to purchase 62 tons of stockpiled ivory from Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. China then imported the ivory in 2009. Each year, the Chinese government releases a certain amount to carving factories to which it has given licenses.

## Ivory Demand Jumps In China

China's demand for ivory has exploded in recent years. The increase is due to the country's growing middle class as China's economy has expanded. The wholesale price of raw elephant tusks more than doubled from 2010 to 2014, according to the nonprofit group Save the Elephants.

After a series of meetings between Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama, the White House made the announcement last month. "The United States and China commit to enact nearly complete bans on ivory import and export, including significant and timely restrictions on the import of ivory as hunting trophies, and to take significant and timely steps to halt the domestic commercial trade of ivory," the White House announced at the time.

The two countries will cooperate in "joint training, technical exchanges, information sharing, and public education on combating wildlife trafficking, and enhance international law enforcement cooperation in this field," the White House statement said. No timeline for implementation was given.

Chinese state media widely reported the announcement, without providing further details.

## Ban "A Step In The Right Direction"

Experts predict that the ban will close some important loopholes, but probably will fall short of completely eliminating the trade.

"I feel this is a political decision, but it is definitely a step in the right direction," said Grace Gabriel, director of the Asia office of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. "This is something that we have been trying to do for maybe a decade, to get this issue to the highest level of government, for President Xi Jinping to realize how damaging (the ivory trade) is to China's international reputation, and the role that China has been playing in this crisis.

"What this needs to have is a concrete implementation plan. The way I see it is, in the market in China, the illegal ivory trade has long eclipsed the legal trade."

The nonprofit group Environmental Investigation Agency estimates that as much as 90 percent of mainland China's ivory is from smuggled tusks.

## Legal Sales Hide Smuggled Ivory

Gabriel said that licensed ivory sellers often use legal products to "launder" smuggled, poached ivory. In 2013, a court in the southeastern province of Fujian sentenced a licensed ivory dealer to 15 years in prison for illegally importing 7.7 tons of ivory into China over a six-month period in 2011.

Because the law is so unclear, people do not know what is legal and illegal, Gabriel said. "Some places you buy are legal, some places are illegal. And everybody is so confused," he added.

Experts say that one potential snag is the lack of a similar ban in Hong Kong. The bustling port city is technically controlled by Beijing but maintains an independent legal system. It is a notoriously weak link in the international enforcement of wildlife laws.

In May, Beijing destroyed 1,500 pounds of confiscated elephant tusks and ivory carvings. That act marked the third time China had destroyed smuggled ivory in a year and a half. International environmental groups praised the effort. Hong Kong began destroying a 28-ton stockpile of confiscated ivory in the spring.
