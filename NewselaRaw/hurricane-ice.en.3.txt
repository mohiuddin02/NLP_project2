Between Oct. 21 and Nov. 6 the plane went on eight flights over the Arctic. The Arctic is located in the northernmost part of earth. The plane was sent to study the large pieces of ice in the area that may be changing the way hurricanes move in the Atlantic Ocean.

The flights revealed important information that might help explain why more storms are taking strange paths.

Nick Bond is a scientist at the University of Washington. He was a passenger on the plane.

Bond and other scientists studied ice located in the cold Arctic seas.

## Making Ice Creates Heat

They wanted to find out how much heat is being released from the ice and into the atmosphere during the fall season.

Bond said the faster the Arctic ice builds up, the more heat is released into the atmosphere.

"We could see and feel the tremendous amount of heat coming out of the ocean," Bond said. "That's what it takes to make ice, to lose heat like crazy."

That heat release is believed to have changed the movement of the jet stream to the south. A jet stream is a fast-moving river of air high up in the sky.

Scientists think that the jet stream's move south might be causing some serious weather changes. The shift might be slowing down storms. A storm has a chance to move in a different direction if it slows down. That movement can mean serious problems for coastal areas of the country.

Kevin Wood is also a scientist at the University of Washington. He was aboard the hurricane hunter too. He said the Arctic heat release also might help cause other serious weather, such as flooding or severe snowstorms.

"That's far from proven," he said. "But it's one of the things we're interested in understanding better."

## Superstorm Sandy's Strange Path

Scientists are hoping that the Arctic research flights will help them better understand Superstorm Sandy. That storm plowed into the U.S. East Coast last year.

Bond said that the unusual path Sandy took last year was due to changes happening in the world's weather pattern. Those changes might be related to changes in the Arctic.

Sandy started in the Caribbean as a tropical storm. It then became a hurricane. At first, Sandy was heading on a path east, and away from land.

But instead, Sandy curved north toward the states of New Jersey and New York. It then crashed into a winter weather system. At that point, Sandy was downgraded to a post-tropical system.

But when Sandy hit the East Coast it didn't feel like a post-tropical system. Instead, it felt and acted like a very powerful, destructive storm.

Some other hurricanes have gone north instead of heading east in the past few years. They include hurricanes Earl, Irene and Ophelia.

## Hurricane Helper

The flights by the hurricane hunter helped scientists' understanding of Arctic heat and hurricane paths. It also helped them understand better why ice in the Arctic is melting faster. The melting of the ice is one of the main reasons for the sea water level rise. Sea levels rising is a serious problem for states like Florida, which are low and close to sea level.

The plane collected a wide range of information about sea ice thickness. Scientists were able to drop scientific instruments out of the plane and into the Arctic to better understand the atmosphere. The instruments measure temperature, wind direction and pressure.

The hurricane hunter is normally based in Florida. One reason the plane made the Arctic trip was because the hurricane season in the Atlantic had been unusually weak.

The scientists hope next year's season will be as calm. They want to take another flight over the Arctic.

Bond says they got information that was important and special. But "we're greedy, and we want more."
