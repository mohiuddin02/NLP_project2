Scientists say that human brains are unique and cannot be categorized as just male or female, although there are differences. 

Researchers looked at data from more than 100 studies and found differences in areas of the brain that control language, memory, emotion and behavior.

In the same 2014 report in the Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews journal, scientists noted that male brains are also built differently than female brains. The volume of a man's brain is about 8 to 13 percent greater than that of a woman. 

## Sizing Up Brains' Differences

Scientists wanted to find out if those physical differences translated into cognitive differences. Cognition is the process of knowing or perceiving. Psychobiologist Daphna Joel of Tel Aviv University in Israel led the team of researchers. They looked at detailed brain scans of more than 1,400 men and women but could not find any patterns that set men and women apart. Scientists looked at different types of scans, different parts of the brain and different groups of people. 

"Although there are sex and gender differences in brain structure, brains do not fall into two classes, one typical of males and the other typical of females," the team said. 

## Unique But Still Similar

The scientists published another study recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific journal. In it they wrote, "Each brain is a unique mosaic of features, some of which may be more common in females compared with males, others may be more common in males compared with females." The scientists also said that they found some common features in both male and female brains.

To figure out more, the team did more research, searching for examples of brain elements that were either clearly male or clearly female. They looked for measurements that appeared to go one way for men and another way for women, without much common ground. After identifying the elements, researchers looked to see whether women always tended to have one version of the element and men tended to have another.

The first thing that the scientists did was to measure the volume of gray matter in the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI is a scan that records detailed sectional images inside the body. 

## More Testing Did Not Change Results

The scientists assembled a test group made up of 112 men and 169 women between the ages of 18 and 79. On their scans, researchers examined 116 separate parts of the brain. Then they looked closely at 10 parts of the brain that showed the greatest difference between men and women. In each case, the scans were divided into three categories, male, female and somewhere in the middle.

Of the test group, only 6 percent consistently showed up as male or female in all 10 parts of the brain. Thirty-five percent showed up as having male traits in some parts and female traits in others.

The scientists then repeated the study with different cutoffs for being most male and most female. The outcome remained the same whether they used a cutoff of 10 percent, 20 percent or 50 percent male or female. Brains with both male and female features far outnumbered brains that were just male or female.

Next, the researchers ran brain scans that measured the thickness of gray matter in the outer layer of the cerebrum, which is responsible for the body's movements and five senses. They also looked at connections between different parts of the brain and other features. Still, they found that consistently male or consistently female brains were rare, and brains with features related to both were common.

## Youth, College Students Showed Same Overlap

Joel and her team then applied the same method to two large studies of American teens done by major universities. The studies interviewed youths to see how their social environments — friends, family, school, neighborhood — led to their behaviors as teens. Then the university scientists looked at how the choices they made as teens led to their health and achievements as young adults. 

First, the scientists looked at 570 participants in a study called the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context. They found that only 1.8 percent of them scored consistently male or consistently female, compared with 59 percent who showed a combination of both.  

The difference was even greater in the second study. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health focused on a group of 4,860 teenagers. Less than 1 percent scored just male or female, and 70 percent who showed qualities of both genders.

Finally, the scientists took a closer look at older students. They asked 263 college students about activities that are often attributed to one gender over another, such as watching talk shows on television or playing video games. Researchers found that only 1.2 percent of the students could be classified as exclusively male or exclusively female, compared with 55 percent who had traits from both.

Joel and her team concluded that, "This extensive overlap undermines any attempt to distinguish between a male and a female form for specific brain features." The team also pointed out that the results will affect debates on topics such as education designed just for men or women and gender as a social category.
