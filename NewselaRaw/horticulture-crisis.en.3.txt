PHILADELPHIA â€” In December, six horticulture experts wrote a letter. They warned that their field, the study of plants, is in trouble.

The six are among the country's most respected plant people. They wrote to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, and growers of everything from almonds to onions to zucchini.

In the letter, they warned that something must be done soon to get more people into the field. Or else, they said, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science.

"Think of all the careers horticulture is competing against," said Paul B. Redman, the head of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa. People need to be shown why horticulture is exciting and interesting, he explained. Redman is a strong supporter of a plan outlined in the letter, which called for:

Studying the problem, and coming up with numbers to show the problem really exists;

Coming up with a plan to teach horticulture in schools and in college;

Raising public awareness of why horticulture is important. Telling people about the different kinds of jobs in horticulture.

## Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers And Plants

"We have to come up with a game plan. Period," said Redman, who has been in horticulture for 30 years, but still has to explain to people what that means.

Which may be the first hurdle this effort faces to get people interested in becoming a horticulturist. What is horticulture, anyway?

Horticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers and decorative plants.

But people have misconceptions, says Mary H. Meyer. She is horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota.

They think "it's a guy with a pickup truck and a lawn mower," said Meyer, president of the American Society for Horticultural Science. People also think it's a low-paying job. It requires manual labor and no college degree.

Horticulture offers many other job opportunities, she said, ticking off a few: plant breeding, producing plants in greenhouses and food. Others grow flowers, design landscapes and run nurseries. People can also care for public gardens, parks and sports fields.

The problem isn't only in the United States, as Meyer discovered while teaching in England over the summer: England, the world's horticultural powerhouse, faces the same problems.

Horticulturists in both countries say the problem has been building for years. Partly it's because people have moved from farms to the cities, and they don't feel as connected to the land.

## Getting Hooked On Horticulture

Matthew Bond, 21, studies plant sciences at Cornell University. He found his future the old-fashioned way: He grew up in farm country in Ogdensburg, N.Y., where his father and grandmother were excited about gardening.

Bond has been a leader of a group called the National Junior Horticultural Association since 2009. The group's membership has plummeted from 1,000 in the '60s to half that number 15 years ago to 300 today. He suggests today's heavily scheduled kids have no time for hobbies like gardening. "They don't even go outside," he said.

But Bond said there are good signs. More young people are interested in finding ways to farm in their cities and in organic gardening, or producing food naturally.

A challenge is getting people interested in horticulture early. "Once you do, they're hooked," said Jessica McAtamney, who teaches environmental science and gardening in cities at W.B. Saul High School in Philadelphia.

Hydeia Brown, 17, from Philadelphia's Germantown, could be the poster child for an idealized horticultural future. There would not only be more practitioners, but more diversity, too. She is studying environmental science and wants to work with plants.

"I love science," she said on the phone from Morris Arboretum in Philadelphia. Her class was on a field trip. They were photographing and cataloging the Latin botanical names of pitch pine, American holly, and other trees.

Brown, whose family left their South Carolina farm to move north before she was born, wishes "other kids would come out and experience this. Not a lot of them know about the outdoors. They like electronics and stuff like that."

Douglas C. Needham, education department head at Longwood, said, "I'm passionate about this. I don't want to see the art, science, and craft of horticulture die out."
