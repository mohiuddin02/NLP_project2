Its nickname is the hurricane hunter. It's called that because the WP-3 Orion helps scientists study the powerful storms.

Between Oct. 21 and Nov. 6, Hurricane Hunter went on eight flights over the Arctic. The Arctic is located in the northernmost part of Earth. The plane was sent to study the large pieces of ice in the area.

Nick Bond is a scientist at the University of Washington. He rode on Hurricane Hunter during its first Arctic flight.

Bond and other scientists studied ice in the cold Arctic seas. But the scientists aren't studying cold air. Instead, they are studying heat. They want to know how much heat is being released into the air that surrounds the Earth.

## Jet Stream's Move South

The faster Arctic ice builds up, the more heat is released into the sky. That heat is believed to have changed the movement of the jet stream to the south. A jet stream is a fast-moving river of air high up in the sky.

Scientists think that the jet stream's move south might be causing some serious weather changes. The shift might be slowing down storms.

A storm has a chance to move in a different direction if it is slowed down. That movement can mean serious problems for coastal areas.

Kevin Wood is also a scientist at the University of Washington. He rode on the Hurricane Hunter too.

Wood said that floods and snowstorms might be due to Arctic heat as well.

"That's far from proven," he said. "But it's one of the things we're interested in understanding better."

## Superstorm Sandy's Odd Move

Scientists are hoping that the Hurricane Hunter helps them better understand Superstorm Sandy. That storm plowed into the U.S. East Coast last year.

Bond said that Sandy moved through the sky in an odd way. He said that Sandy's odd movement was definitely due to changes happening in weather patterns across the world.

Those changes might be related to changes in the Arctic.

In October 2012, Sandy grew in the Caribbean as a tropical storm. It then became a hurricane. Initially, Sandy began to move northeast on a path that would have taken it away from land.

But instead, Sandy moved northwest toward New Jersey. It then crashed into a winter weather system. At that point, Sandy had been downgraded to storm that wasn't as strong as a hurricane.

But when Sandy hit much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast U.S., it felt like a hurricane. Sandy was a very strong storm. It damaged land, buildings and houses.

Some other hurricanes have hit the northeast coast of the United States and Canada. They include hurricanes Earl, Irene and Ophelia.

## Arctic Ice Melting

The flight study helped scientists' understanding of Arctic heat and hurricane paths. It also helped scientists understand why ice in the Arctic is melting.

The melting of Arctic ice is one of the reasons why sea waters across the world are rising. Sea waters rising is a serious problem in low-lying lands in Florida.

"We could see and feel the tremendous amount of heat coming out of the ocean," he said. "That's what it takes to make ice, to lose heat like crazy."

The Hurricane Hunter collected a lot of information. Different instruments on the plane allowed scientists to measure temperature, wind direction and pressure.

"You can take it anywhere," Bond said of the plane.

The Hurricane Hunter is normally based in Florida. One reason the plane made the Arctic trip was because the hurricane season in the Atlantic had been unusually slow.

The scientists hope that next year's hurricane season will be just as calm.

Bond said the information they got was important and special. But "we're greedy, and we want more."
