WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Students, parents and teachers have long complained about the amount of time kids spend taking standardized tests. But just how many hours each year is it?

A. Between 10 and 15 hours.

B. Between 20 and 25 hours.

C. Between 30 and 35 hours.

The correct answer is "B," according to a new study of 66 of the nation's big-city school districts by the Council of the Great City Schools. The council is a group of the largest city school districts in the nation.

The study found that the average public school eighth-grader spends about 2.3 percent of classroom time on testing. Between preschool and 12th grade, students took about 112 exams required by the federal government, states or local districts.

## Study Results Don't Include Prep Time

The study analyzed the time spent actually taking the tests. It did not include the classroom hours spent on preparing for tests. It also did not include regular day-to-day classroom quizzes and tests in subjects such as reading, math, science and foreign languages.

In connection with the study's release Saturday, President Barack Obama said schools should limit standardized testing to 2 percent of classroom time. He acknowledged that the government was partly responsible for making schools focus so much on testing. The president said federal officials would work with states, schools and teachers to "make sure that we're not obsessing about testing."

The Obama administration still says annual standardized tests are necessary to make sure that schools are doing good work. Also, testing would continue under the No Child Left Behind Act. The 2002 law was intended to close educational gaps between rich and poor districts. It required annual testing for students in grades 3 through 8. The law also established severe penalties for schools whose test scores did not show enough progress.

Congress is currently discussing changes to No Child Left Behind. The updated law would let states decide how to use test results to deal with bad schools.

## Learning Is "So Much More," President Says

"Learning is about so much more than just filling in the right bubble," Obama said in a video released on Facebook. Many standardized tests require students to mark their answer by filling in an oval.

Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan are meeting Monday with teachers and school officials. They will talk about reducing testing time.

How much testing is too much is hard to answer, said Michael Casserly, the council's executive director. He said the findings supported concerns from teachers and other critics about the tests taking up too much teaching and learning time.

For example, Casserly said the study found plenty of overlap in testing. Some states and school districts required end-of-year tests and end-of-course tests in the same subject.

## Officials Want To Stop "Unnecessary" Tests

He suggested that states and school districts coordinate testing. It "will be an important step in reducing unnecessary assessments," he said.

The council reviewed testing for more than 7 million students last year. They went to schools in about three dozen states.

Over the weekend, the government's Education Department released a "testing action plan." It said too many schools give unnecessary tests.

The department pledged to work with states and schools to find ways to reduce time spent on testing.

## States Help Decide How Scores Affect Teachers

The plan also said the department has changed some of its policies. It now lets states have more of a say in how they use student test results to grade teachers. Some districts determine how teachers are doing partly on their classes' test scores. In some places, even teachers' salary raises have been tied to better test scores.

This past spring, students began taking new tests based on the Common Core standards in reading and math. The standards, which have been adopted by most states, outline what a child should know and be able to do in each grade. About 12 million students in 29 states and the District of Columbia took the tests.

The council also found that the most tests were required in 8th and 10th grades. Preschoolers, kindergartners and first-graders took the fewest tests. Also, 4 in 10 districts reported having to wait two months to four months before getting test results. The lack of timely results meant that teachers began the new school year without knowing whether a student was having a problem.
