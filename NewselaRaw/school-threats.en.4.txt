HARTFORD, Conn. â€” Threats against schools used to be seen as childish jokes. State lawmakers are taking them more seriously. They are making laws with stronger punishments. Lawmakers do not want people to even threaten to harm a school.

Someone recently emailed a threat to the Los Angeles school district. All the schools were closed for the day. The threat closed schools and scared students.

No one knows who sent the email. The district took the threat seriously though.

## Making The Punishments Stronger

Most states already have laws about school threats. The laws make them serious crimes. Some states want stronger punishments, said Michael Dorn. He is in charge of a school safety group. It is called Safe Havens International.

Ed Brooks is a Wisconsin lawmaker. He said there are too many threats against schools. These threats are not children's games. They are serious. They scare students and teachers. Brooks wants to make the punishments worse for some kinds of school threats.

Tony Hwang is a lawmaker in Connecticut. He said Tuesday that he wants to change the state's school threat law. He wants to make the punishment stricter. His own son's high school was locked down in October after a threat.

## Not Childish Pranks Anymore

Hwang is 51 years old. He said when he was a kid, people thought that threats were just childish pranks. He hopes people think differently now.

National School Safety and Security Services is a school safety group. It studied school threats. It looked at five months in 2014. It found the number of threats was way up. In 1 out of 3 schools, students and teachers had to leave the building. Also, about 1 out of 10 threats closed school for at least one day.

Dorn said people who threaten schools have different reasons. Many of them just want to make trouble. He said it is a good idea to charge them with a crime. Then other people are not as likely to threaten schools.
