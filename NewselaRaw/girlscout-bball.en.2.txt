LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” The Girl Scout stands shyly on the edge of a basketball court.

It is a Thursday after school. A bunch of kids are joyfully running around the court. They look like they have just come out from behind locked doors into the fresh air -- and they have.

The court is in the front yard of an apartment building for women and children who are homeless because of domestic violence. The 18 children who live in this building rarely play outside.

This court is their place, where they can run and shout and still be safe. It has been open only a month. Already it is filled every afternoon with kids who can talk about their sadness and share their dreams.

## Doing A Good Turn

"I know, I know," Claire Dundee said with a smile. She is 16 years old. "People say, 'You're still a Girl Scout? Isn't that for second-graders?'"

The Girl Scout is visiting the basketball court because she built it.

She decided to build the court to earn her Girl Scout Gold Award, the group's highest honor.

She raised the money, found the builder and worked with the architect. She even pushed the wheelbarrow. In the beginning, she was scared to phone strangers so she would write down what she wanted to say before every call. By the end, she was telling workers where to pour the concrete.

Claire always knew that a basketball court was not really about basketball.

"For me, it was about bonding, sharing, becoming a family," she said.

## Not A Bookcase But A Basketball Court

Last spring, she met with officials from Door of Hope, which runs the apartments for the homeless families. They gave her ideas about what she could choose for a project like building bookcases or planting bushes. Then one of them threw out a completely crazy idea. If Claire really wanted to help, she could turn one of their building's dusty yards into a basketball court.

"It's a huge need for us to have a space for children to have a safe place to play," said Tim Peters, the head of Door of Hope. "That's such a big thing."

Peters never imagined that the children's space could actually be built by a child. He was worried that a Girl Scout was taking on such a big project.

"A lot of people said I was crazy, but I knew something like that would last forever," she said.

And after all, she thought, how hard could it be? Raise some money to buy a goal and some balls, get a builder to give the concrete, no big deal. She could surely finish it during the summer, right?

"Pretty soon it became obvious that this was going to be overwhelming," she said.

## Fun Makes The Frustration Worthwhile

The project took nearly three weeks and cost about $25,000\. Dundee showed up every day after school to check on everything from making sure the ground was level to pouring concrete. She even pulled weeds and planted bushes.

Finally, on Dec. 22, in a light rain, a dozen kids splashed out to their new court.

"It was my favorite part of the project, seeing the kids fight over the balls and run out there and just start shooting," Dundee said. "I just stood back and watched. It was really something."

## Bouncing A Ball, Finding A Home

The Door of Hope people were even more impressed.

"It's amazing that a kid can have an idea and end up serving other kids in the community," said Nicole Peters. She is with Door of Hope.

On Thursday, Arman, who is 11 years old, ran up and down the small court.

"Before this, I would be in my apartment, bored, doing nothing," Arman said. "Now it's like I'm really home."

On another part of the court, a woman named Susana said she could see the effect on her 11-year-old son, Jonathan.

"I can see a smile on his face, a change in him, he can come downstairs and just play and be a kid," she said. "Who knew a court could be so important?"
