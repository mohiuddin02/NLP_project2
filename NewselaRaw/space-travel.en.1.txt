The early Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit other parts of our galaxy. He said, "Earth is humanity's cradle, but you're not meant to stay in your cradle forever." Since then the idea has been a staple of science fiction, and thus become part of an image of humanity's future. Going to the stars is often regarded as humanity's destiny, even a measure of its success as a species. But in the century since this vision was proposed, we have learned things about the universe and ourselves that suggest moving out into the galaxy might not be humanity's destiny after all.

The problem underlying all the other problems with interstellar travel is the sheer size of the universe. Its size was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars. Tau Ceti, one of the closest stars to us at around 12 light-years away, is 100 billion times farther from Earth than our moon. We can't simply send people over such immense distances in a spaceship, because a spaceship is too impoverished an environment to support humans for the centuries it would take. Instead of a spaceship, we would have to create some kind of space-traveling ark. The ark would need to be big enough to support a community of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological system.

On the other hand, it would have to be small enough to accelerate to a fairly high speed. A smaller ark would shorten the voyagers' time of exposure to radiation in space and to breakdowns in the ark. The bigger the ark is, the proportionally more fuel it would have to carry along to slow itself down on reaching its destination. For that reason and others, smaller is better, but smallness creates problems for resource cycling and ecologic balance. The design needs for bigness and smallness may cross each other, leaving any viable craft in an impossible middle.

## "Space Ark" Inhabitants Would Be Like Lab Animals

Another problem are the possible impacts on our microbiomes. About eighty percent of the DNA in our bodies is not human DNA, but the DNA of a vast array of smaller creatures known as microbes, which as a group together make up a microbiome system in our bodies. That array of living beings has to function in a balance for us to be healthy. The microbiome system co-evolved on Earth in a particular set of physical influences, including Earth's gravity, atmosphere, and chemical make-up. Traveling to the stars means leaving all these influences, and trying to replace them artificially with unknown consequences. Any ark would therefore be an experiment, its inhabitants lab animals. The first generation of the humans aboard might have volunteered to be experimental subjects, but their descendants would not have. These generations of descendants would be born into a set of rooms a trillion times smaller than Earth, with no chance of escape.

Rules would have to be enforced to keep all aspects of the experiment functioning. Reproduction would not be a matter of free choice, as the population in the ark would have to maintain minimum and maximum numbers. Many jobs would be required to keep the ark functioning, so work too would not be a matter of free choice. The ark's social structure would require the establishment of a strict state where everyone follows the rules.

History has shown that people tend to react poorly in rigid states and social systems. Add to these social limitations permanent enclosure, exile from our planetary surface, and the probability of health problems, and the possibility for mental and emotional difficulties seems quite high. Over several generations, it's hard to imagine any such society staying stable.

## It Could Take Centuries

Still, humans are adaptable. It's conceivable that all the problems outlined so far might be solved, and that people enclosed in an ark might cross space successfully to a nearby planetary system. But if so, their problems will have just begun.

Any planetary body the voyagers try to inhabit will be either alive or dead. If there is life, the problems of living in contact with an alien environment could range from harmless to fatal, but will surely require careful investigation. On the other hand, if the planetary body is dead, then the newcomers will have to transform it using only local resources and the power they have brought with them. The process will take centuries, during which time the ark, or its equivalent on the alien planet, would have to continue to function without failures.

## Problems On The Voyage, And Different Problems On Arrival

So, to conclude: an interstellar voyage would present one set of extremely difficult problems, and the arrival in another system, a different set of problems. All the problems together create not an outright impossibility, but a project of extreme difficulty, with very poor chances of success. The unavoidable uncertainties suggest that pursuing the project would require many preconditions before it was undertaken. First, there would need to be a sustainable human civilization on Earth itself to teach us many of the things we would need to know to construct a workable ark. Second, there would need to be a great deal of practice in an ark orbiting our sun, where we could make repairs and study the ark. Third, there would need to be extensive robotic explorations of nearby planetary systems, to see if any are suitable candidates for habitation.

Unless all these steps are taken, humans cannot successfully travel to and inhabit other star systems. The most important step is the first, which is the creation of a sustainable long-term civilization on Earth. If we don't create sustainability on our own world, there is no Planet B.
