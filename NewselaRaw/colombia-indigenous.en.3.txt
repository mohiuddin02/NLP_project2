RIOHACHA, Colombia â€” Elion Uriana is a tribal judge, or palabrero, in Colombia's native Wayuu community. As the leader of a group of goat-herders, he was trying to decide what to do about an arranged marriage that had fallen apart.

The groom's parents had given the bride's family a wedding gift of 60 goats. However, the bride left him just a month after they were married. The bride's parents blamed the groom and said he had mistreated their daughter. The families could not settle the disagreement, so the bride's family had to pay back the goats.

Uriana had helped arrange that marriage as part of his job as palabrero. Young people in the Wayuu community do not get to choose whom they marry. "All our marriages are arranged by the families and the couple has to live by that," Uriana said.

As palabrero, Uriana handles all sorts of important decisions. He resolves disagreements about land, he splits up the area's lumber and he makes sure that members of the group pay each other back when they borrow money. "My duty is to mediate the peaceful resolution of conflicts. The traditional legal system is one thing; we Wayuus have our own."

## Rights Are Important To Native Groups

With 300,000 members, the Wayuu community is the largest of Colombia's 65 native groups. They also inhabit parts of neighboring Venezuela.

Not long ago, most Colombians looked down on palabreros and other Wayuu customs. Now experts on the region's native groups say that the country's attitudes are finally starting to shift. Colombians are gaining a new respect for the Wayuu and other native groups.

Part of the reason for this change is a new law that was passed in 2010. The Language Law was a response to warnings that up to half of Colombia's native sayings would soon be lost unless the government took steps to save them.

Passing the Language Law made a big difference in the country's relationship with its native groups. It showed that preserving Colombia's native customs and languages was important to the entire nation.

That same year, the United Nations honored the palabreros. The tribal judges were recognized as key parts of the world's history. The move highlighted the importance of tribal rights and gave the Wayuu a significant boost.

## Computer Can Track Languages

After the Language Law passed, Colombia's Ministry of Culture started making a list of all the country's native sayings and customs. The ministry also included the languages used by Afro-Colombians and criollos (people with Spanish ancestors).

Moises Medrano, the ministry's director of communities, said the project was the first time local languages had been organized since the 1950s. This time, the ministry used the information to make a new computer program. It teaches users basic phrases in Colombia's 65 native languages.

Medrano says the ministry is trying to start more conversations between people from different backgrounds. The ministry wants to help them appreciate Colombia's amazing diversity of native languages. It also hopes members of the native communities feel more pride in their history.

## The Whole Community Is Proud

To help with those goals, the ministry is making sure students in Wayuu communities learn their native language. There are now a dozen primary schools teaching both Spanish and the Wayuu language.

At one of these schools, first- through eighth-graders from the Wayuu community have teachers who speak both languages. School director Nelson Iguaran says schools like his are essential to preserving the Wayuu way of life. He says they also protect Wayuu students from outside pressures.

Students at these special schools are taught Wayuu customs that remind them that the good of the community is more important than anything else. They also hear interesting stories about their community's history and myths.

Iguaran says that often the Wayuu think less of themselves because of their background. He says that when students learn new Wayuu words and history, they go home and share it with their parents. It makes the whole family proud.
