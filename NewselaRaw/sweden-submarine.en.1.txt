STOCKHOLM — Sweden's biggest submarine hunt is giving countries along the Baltic Sea an uneasy feeling of déjà vu.

Swedish naval ships, helicopters and ground troops combed the waters around the capital of Stockholm on Monday. For four days they have been looking for signs of a foreign submarine. Officials suspect that the craft entered Swedish waters illegally.

It was a scene that recalled the Cold War, when the Soviet Union seemed persistently in a tense standoff with the United States and its Western European allies. The Cold War ended in 1991, when the Soviet Union broke apart and became many separate countries, with Russia as the largest among them.

While Sweden hasn't accused any country specifically — and Russian leaders in Moscow deny involvement — the incident sent a chill through the Baltic Sea region. For many, Russia is the natural suspect. In recent months, Russian forces have been accused of a series of border violations on land, sea and air.

## Baltic States Spooked

"Closely following events in the Swedish territorial waters," Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics wrote on Twitter. The incident, he added, "may become a game changer of the security in the whole Baltic Sea region." Latvia is on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea and to its east lies the Russian border.

Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday. On Sunday, they released a photograph taken at a distance of what they said could be the mystery vessel — a dark speck surrounded by foaming water.

Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said more than 200 people were involved in the operation. However, he stressed that unlike Sweden's submarine hunts in the 1980s, the military wasn't using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.

The search made headline news in countries across the Baltic region including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. All three are former Soviet republics that have been spooked by Russia's intervention in Ukraine. Earlier this year, Russia seized the Crimea region of Ukraine and since then it has continued to back pro-Russia rebels within the country.

## Russian Moves In The Region

Russia justified its intervention in Ukraine by claiming that ethnic Russians in Ukraine were being discriminated against. What has alarmed the Baltic states is that a top Russian official recently made similar claims about their countries. In addition, Russia recently arrested an Estonian security official, who was charged with espionage. It also seized a Lithuanian fishing boat for allegedly entering Russia's territorial waters.

There is now growing fear throughout the Baltics that Russia may attempt some form of intervention in Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania. For its part, Russia denies it has any hostile intentions.

Estonia has stepped up its monitoring of its territorial waters. Its border guard is on the lookout for unusual activities, spokesman Priit Parkna said.

In Lithuania, the events in Sweden sparked concerns over the safety of a floating natural-gas import terminal. The terminal is currently being transported on the Baltic Sea to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda. It will be key to Lithuania's plans to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.

## "Eyes Of Fear See Danger Everywhere"

Meanwhile, Russian media suggested the Swedes were overreacting. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper even speculated that the submarine hunt could be a ploy staged by the Swedish military to boost its defense budget. Sweden's military has had its spending trimmed by the government since the Cold War.

Russia's official government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta questioned whether there was any submarine at all, noting the Swedes hadn't found anything.

"Either Sweden's echo location equipment is working badly or, as the old saying goes, the eyes of fear see danger everywhere," the paper said.

A Russian Defense Ministry official pointed fingers at a Dutch submarine that participated in an exercise with the Swedish navy last week. The unidentified official suggested Sweden should save "taxpayers' money" and ask the Netherlands for an explanation.

The Dutch navy said that its submarine left Sweden on Thursday and had been in Estonia since early Friday. In Sweden, Armed Forces spokesman Philip Simon said the Dutch submarine was not what triggered the Swedish search.

In 1981, a Soviet sub carrying nuclear weapons was stranded off Sweden's southeastern coast. The incident caused an 11-day diplomatic standoff before Swedish authorities allowed the submarine to return home.
