The stirring song, "Glory," is the musical centerpiece of the Oscar-nominated movie "Selma." In the midst of it, rapper Common summarizes how words, melody and a protest merged during the civil rights movement.

"We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through," he raps. "Glory" won best original song at the Academy Awards on Sunday.

The blood of dozens of African-Americans was spilled in the first of three attempted voting rights marches to the Alabama capital of Montgomery from Selma 50 years ago. But as "Glory" suggests, what happened in Selma is hardly in the past.

## "Freedom Is Like Religion"

"The movement is a rhythm to us, freedom is like religion to us," Common raps in "Glory." Then he mentions the '50s civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. He connects Parks with last year's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police slaying of an unarmed African-American resident, Michael Brown.

"… That's why Rosa sat on the bus, that's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up," he raps.

In the months after the outrage stirred by the deaths of Brown and another unarmed African-American, Eric Garner, in New York, singer D'Angelo released his first album in more than 10 years. It was called "Black Messiah." The album included references to the chain of events between Selma and Ferguson.

Songs for the civil-rights movement continue to be written. As Newsweek magazine said in 1964, "History has never known a protest movement so rich in song."

## "A Change Is Gonna Come"

During the '60s, African-American "freedom songs" aimed to motivate protesters to march into harm's way. The songs also spread news of the struggle to a mainstream audience. The gospel, or religious, music of black churches spoke to a better life in heaven. However, soul, R&amp;B and jazz said that the good life — or at least an equal opportunity to live it — could be experienced now. Artists such as Chicago's Curtis Mayfield, Sam Cooke and the Staple Singers crafted a music rooted in gospel but speaking the language of popular culture.

Mayfield wrote and sang on a string of message-oriented records, including "Keep on Pushing" and "People Get Ready." Cooke delivered the yearning "A Change is Gonna Come." There were many other songs.

All this creativity was inspired by pain, struggle and bloodshed. The three Selma marches in 1965 aimed to draw attention to the struggle for black voting rights. They proved to be a turning point in the struggle. Police turned tear gas, dogs and clubs on the unarmed protesters. The ferocity shocked even the president when he learned about it at the White House.

## "He Can Preach It, We Can Sing It"

Pops Staples led the well-known Chicago gospel group the Staples Singers. He saw media coverage of the event, and was horrified. He had become friends with Martin Luther King Jr. Staples and his family had been appearing at Civil Rights rallies with King. What he saw and experienced in the company of King made him political. "If he can preach it, we can sing it," he told the members of his group, which included his daughters Mavis and Cleotha and his son Pervis. After Selma, Pops wrote one of the signature songs of the movement, "Freedom Highway." The song was first performed only a few weeks later in a concert at the New Nazareth Church on Chicago's South Side.

The concert was documented on an album originally issued on Epic Records in 1965. It is being reissued next month. The album is one of the great concert recordings ever.

The recording puts the listener in the front row of the church. After a majestic version of "We Shall Overcome," Pops Staples pauses to introduce his new song. "From that march, word was revealed and a song was composed," he says. His opening guitar music sounds like a trumpet calling citizens to action. Mavis roars: "Made up my mind, and I won't turn around." It's an incredible performance. The people in the church hearing the song for the first time clap along excitedly.

Pops continued writing and singing about the movement until his last days, as his final recording attests. "Don't Lose This," released this week, was recorded with his children in the years before his death in 2000.

On "Sweet Home," Pops and Mavis sing a duet. The struggle they joined in earnest during the '60s shows no sign of ending. "Lord, I wonder will I ever get home?" they sing. Their fatigue changes their voices, but they're still on the freedom highway.
