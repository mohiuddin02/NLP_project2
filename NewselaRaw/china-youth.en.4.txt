SHANGHAI â€” For two days, Rocky had been playing video games in the tiny apartment he shares with three other men in Shanghai. He left only once, to buy food. The games "help me relax," he said. "It helps me escape. I feel so tired."

Rocky is a 32-year-old who graduated from college 10 years ago. In June, he quit his $400-a-month job selling traditional Chinese medicines. Over the past decade, he has had nearly a dozen jobs. His mother lived in a poor village a few hours north of Shanghai by train. She died in May.

"She worked so hard to try to give me everything, and I could never do anything for her," said Rocky. He requested that only his English name be used because he's embarrassed to be poor. "I feel so lost. I am such a loser. There is such a huge gap between my reality and my dreams."

Rocky and people around his age in China are called the post-'80s.  Adults who were born in the 1980s have seen China change quickly in major ways. The biggest changes have to do with money, goods and property. Under China's old system, most property such as land, businesses, farms and homes were owned by the state.

Most Chinese people were poor, but so were their neighbors. They all lived in a similar way. But China turned away from this system. It allowed for more people to own businesses and property. Soon people became more interested in shopping and owning things. A gap began to grow between the haves and have-nots.

## The Post-80s Adrift

The rest of China has worried about the post-'80s and what will become of them. They've been called spoiled, irresponsible, greedy, lazy and confused.

China has long had a rule that families may have only one child. The rule was made to help limit the number of people in China, which has already topped 1.3 billion. Because of the rule, most of the post-'80s have no brothers or sisters.

In May, _the People's Daily_ newspaper called the country's young adults lazy and inactive. The newspaper is known for speaking for the ruling Communist Party. It admitted that young people face many pressures, such as finding jobs, buying homes and taking care of their parents. Still, it blamed them for not doing anything with their lives.

Chinese in their 20s and 30s got angry. It is not their fault they can't make anything of themselves, they complained. They blame programs started by the Communist Party. Many of the programs were planned to control China's growth and development, such as the one-child rule.

"We have four elderly people to take care of and one child to raise. Our children have no access to safe milk or fair education. High real-estate prices make us homeless," said one comment on a Chinese blogging site.

## Hard To Find A Job

The high real estate prices have made it impossible to buy a home. Many 20- and 30-somethings are living together in cramped apartments. In Beijing, thousands of unemployed college graduates live in shabby neighborhoods called "ant villages."

To get married in China, it takes more than just love. A young man must own a home. Otherwise, women will not be interested. Yet most cannot afford an apartment. Many young people must put off saying "I do."

Meanwhile, finding a job is harder than ever. So many educated young people are entering the work force. Companies can pay less because workers are desperate for jobs. The lucky ones who get the job can barely afford their basic needs.

As only children, the post-'80s must take care of their aging parents and grandparents on their own.

Xia Tianyi, 25, works at a university in Shanghai. "Our childhood was very pure and simple," Xia said. "When we grow up, the changes that took place happened overnight. Everybody feels so anxious and doesn't know what to do. We can't escape an environment where everyone talks about money."

## Demand For Change Not Seen

Wang Wei, 27, who works for a local government in Nantong, a coastal city near Shanghai. She spoke of a similar hopelessness.

"I don't think the situation will get better," she said. At night, she works a shift at a Kentucky Fried Chicken. She said she couldn't get a promotion in her government work because she had no family connections. "Opportunities are not really fair for capable people. All we can do is accept the way things are," she said.

Despite the unhappiness, few expect the post-'80s to demand change in China.

"They very much support the government in many ways," said Liu Fengshu. He is the author of a book on China's youth. He said they may protest if it becomes worse than they can stand. "But it is very hard now to say how much young people can bear."
