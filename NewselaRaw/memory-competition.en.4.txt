NEW YORK — Brad Zupp shuffles a deck of playing cards when he wakes up each morning. He has 70 seconds to memorize the order.

Zupp then sets a timer. He grabs another deck. He is about to see how fast he can replicate the order of the shuffled cards.

His fastest time so far: 65 seconds.

He doesn't do anything weird, Zupp says. He performs this drill at least 10 times a day.

Zupp is a competitor in the Memory Championship. What seems normal to him can seem strange to other people.

## Playing Cards, Strange Faces

On a rainy Saturday in March, 65 of them gathered in a Manhattan office tower. It was the 17th USA Memory Championship. This is one of several contests held each year around the world. It went on for nearly eight tense hours.

Competitors scrambled to rearrange playing cards. They had to match names with faces of strangers. Then they had to remember random numbers. They had to memorize a 25-line poem and write it down word for word.

There were dentists, students, nurses, teachers, writers and magicians. They were ages 16 to 50. They seemed to have little in common beyond their love for memorization and their difficult training. This usually involves sitting alone for several hours a day practicing.

Most give visual images to just about everything. Then they create places in their minds to store those pictures. The pictures work to trigger their memory.

## Like Cookie Crumbs

Sue Jin Yang is a nurse in San Francisco. She calls it the cookie crumb method.

"I imagine that I am walking a pathway," said Yang. The 32-year-old was competing in New York. It was her third time.

When Yang needs to remember something, she imagines walking the path. She models it after a familiar place. In her mind, she stops at particular locations to pick up the correct "cookie crumbs" — clues to what she has to remember.

Yang's system gives sounds and letters to numbers. That helps Yang to remember her chosen images. They tend to be famous faces. For example, the number three is associated with "m." The number one is associated with "d."

"So when I am given a digit such as 31, I see actor Matt Damon," Yang said. "Sixty-two is Sean Penn."

## Fantasy Pictures

Images, when tied together, can lead to fantasy-like pictures.

Lance Tschirhart, 25, is a competitor from Texas. He explained how the number 141251213 is embedded in his memory: 141 brings to mind a dart; 251 is an electrical outlet; 213 is a nutmeg.

"So I can imagine throwing a dart into an outlet and sparks shooting out around a nutmeg," Tschirhart said. He was taking a break between drills in the competition.

Other contestants nodded knowingly. The crowd looked baffled.

"You have to use your imagination," Tschirhart said.

The first New York contest, in 1997, drew 18 players. The winner was Tatiana Cooley. She was a secretary who joined the competition minutes before it began.

The competition has changed little, but competitors have become quicker year by year.

## "Start Shuffling!"

In 2009, White had the fastest time for replicating the order of a deck of shuffled cards: 87 seconds. This year, Johnny Briones, a 19-year-old student at Colorado's School of Mines, did it in 60 seconds, a record in the U.S. contest. The world record of 21.19 seconds was set in Germany.

Karen Pinson is the director of the Memory Championship. She led competitors through each drill. She called out orders as she paced back and forth.

"Mental athletes, start shuffling! Three, two, one, go!" Then, "Time is up, mental athletes!"

Competitors sat side by side at long tables. Many wore headphones to silence the noise. They avoided looking at one another or the audience, which by day's end was standing room only.
