ASHEBORO, N.C. — The school board in Randolph County, N.C., voted last week to ban Ralph Ellison's famous book "Invisible Man."

The decision means the book could not sit on the shelves of the county's school libraries. The book was published in 1952. It deals with the challenges of being an African-American man at that time.

But many of the people who live in the county were embarrassed by the vote. Now the board is reconsidering the decision.

The board voted 5-2 to ban the book. The vote came after the mother of an 11th-grader complained. She said that the book was "too much for teenagers."

But people got angry with the board after the vote. They were worried that the ban had shamed the county. So the board backed down. It scheduled a special meeting Wednesday in order to take another look at the ban.

## Ban Makes National Headlines

That only seemed to make people more angry. The county is about 85 miles northeast of Charlotte. The ban made national news. The local newspaper was flooded with 168 reader comments. Practically all of them ridiculed the board's decision.

"The Randolph County Board of Education has now offered itself as the laughingstock of the United States," one reader wrote to the Courier-Tribune. The reader also called the board "dim-witted."

Another reader called the board "lowbred and stupid."

"I think we should be embarrassed," a third reader wrote.

Ray Criscoe is the paper's editor. He says he hasn't published a letter in favor of the ban because he hasn't "received anything that remotely resembles" one. He said he could not recall another issue that prompted as much reader response.

## Banned Books Week

The board's timing could not have been worse. This week is the American Library Association's annual Banned Books Week. The event celebrates the freedom to read. The association and the Kids' Right to Read Project sent letters to the board. They urged that the ban be lifted.

The book was published in 1952. It is considered one of the greatest books of the 20th century. It looks at how racism affects people. The unnamed narrator says he is invisible "simply because people refuse to see me."

At the main county library here, 23 people were on a waiting list to check out "Invisible Man." Many were talking about the ban.

"Embarrassed? Of course I am," Pat Dillard said as she made her weekly library visit. "I'm embarrassed not just for our county, but for our entire state. We're going backwards."

Shakema Steele, an Asheboro 10th-grader, said of the ban: "That's just not right. That book is timeless. How can they ban it based on one person's complaint?"

School board Chairman Tommy McDonald voted to ban the book. He said it was "a hard read."

## Too Much For Teenagers?

The book was one of three that juniors at Randleman High School could choose for summer reading. Kimiyutta Parson, the mother of a junior, sent the board a letter against "Invisible Man."

"This book is filthier, too much for teenagers," she wrote.

The book includes passages describing violence and other adult topics. But several Courier-Tribune readers pointed out that the Bible contains vivid references to those topics, too.

Evan Smith Rakoff is a Randolph County native and an editor for Poets &amp; Writers magazine. He and journalist Laura Miller persuaded the book's publisher to offer free copies to county high school students. Vintage Books is providing 100 copies of the book.

Banning the book "just doesn't fit the values of the Randolph County I know," Rakoff said.

Russell Perreault, a Vintage spokesman, said the publisher hopes that the attempt to ban the book will make more people want to read it.

## Bound To Be A Best Seller

Most high schools and colleges have included the book in their courses for many years, Randolph County library director Ross Holt said.

Ian Fletcher, a library employee, said he was disturbed, though not surprised, by the board's actions. "They might as well ban the dictionary," he said.

The Courier-Tribune reported that board members were provided copies of the book before the Sept. 16 meeting, but it was not clear whether all members had actually read it.

"I doubt the entire board read the book before they decided to ban it," one reader wrote the newspaper. "No worries. No surer way to elevate a book to the Must Read list of teen readers than to ban it."

## Story Update

ASHEBORO, N.C – The Randolph County school board reversed its ban of "Invisible Man" at a meeting Wednesday night. Members voted 6-1 to return the novel to school bookshelves.

Several said the complaints they got opened their eyes to other viewpoints.

Before Wednesday's vote, board members heard from two teachers. The educators explained how meaningful the novel is to classes. They said that today's students can still relate to the narrator's experiences as a black man in the segregated 1950s.

Board member Tracy Boyle voted for the original ban. He changed his mind Wednesday night. He choked back tears as he said his son had been in combat overseas, "fighting for those freedoms that I'm here passing a vote to take away."

"Is that right of me? No," Boyles said.

Board member Matthew Lambeth said the board had made an honest mistake.

"We've been accused of being ignorant bigots and racists," he said. "That is simply not the case."

Lambeth pointed out that in a democracy, when government does something that people don't like, concerned citizens step forward.

"We should all be proud," he added.
