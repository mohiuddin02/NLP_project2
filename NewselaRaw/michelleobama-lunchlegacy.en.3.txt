WASHINGTON, D.C. — First lady Michelle Obama has spent many years trying to make school lunches healthier. It can be expensive, and not everyone agrees that it is the government's job. Democrats and Republicans have fought many years over the bill.

Now, the lawmakers have finally agreed on a plan for healthier school lunches. 

## A Rare Agreement

Both Republicans and Democrats say they got what wanted in the bill. It is rare for the two main political groups to agree with each other.

The next step for the bill is a vote by the entire Congress. Then, it will be signed into law by the president.

The bill requires schools to serve mostly whole-grain bread. This is healthier than white bread. The bill keeps certain amounts of fruit and vegetables on the menu. It keeps salty junk foods away from school lunches.

## First Lady's Long Fight

The deal keeps most of the nutrition guidelines that the first lady wanted. She has been fighting for healthier school lunches since 2008 when her husband became president. Huge food companies have also been fighting for what they want. They lobby by giving money to lawmakers. The companies hope to persuade the lawmakers to write the bill a certain way. They want their food to be less expensive to make.

Republicans have fought the guidelines. They claim the national government is doing too much to control school lunches. They also say the program costs schools too much money. If the food is not tasty, the children will not eat it, these lawmakers say. The School Nutrition Association is a group of food service workers who care about school food programs. It tries to persuade lawmakers to spend money a certain way. The group sided with Republicans.  

## Working Together For A Deal

Senator Pat Roberts is a Republican. Senator Debbie Stabenow is a Democrat. They are both lawmakers who worked together on the deal. The changes make it easier for food companies to sell schools inexpensive food. At the same time, the companies will also need to meet nutrition guidelines.

Other rules were kept in place from earlier guidelines. Schools still need to serve a half-cup of fruit and vegetables with each meal. The government will also pay for meals that are served in summer school. 

## Let's Move! And Eat Healthy Too

The White House has approved the school lunch deal. It has also been praised by groups that do not always agree with each other.  

Michelle Obama has actively looked for ways to fight obesity. Obese people are much heavier than normal. Being too overweight can make people sick and shorten their lives. The government says more than one-third of American grown-ups suffer from obesity. Nearly 1 in 5 children is obese, too. The first lady also has a program called Let's Move! It tries to get kids to exercise more.
