Over millions of years, plants and animals have slowly changed. Scientists study plants and animals to try to piece together the history of these changes.

A new study published in late September helps explain one piece of that history. A group of scientists led by Per Ahlberg completed a study of the history of enamel.

## Study: Enamel First Appeared On Fish Scales

Enamel is found on the outside of teeth. It is thin but very hard, and it helps make teeth strong. Scientists have been studying enamel for years. They have been trying to figure out when and where enamel first appeared in animals. The new study suggests that the enamel first appeared in the scales on fish skin millions of years ago.

Many fish have skin covered with small, overlapping scales. The scales are like teeth in some ways. Sharks are covered in scales called "dermal denticles," or "skin teeth." Dermal denticles are covered in enamel and shaped like tiny teeth.

Some fish have scales that are covered with ganoine. Ganoine is much like the enamel on human teeth. One fish with scales coated in ganoine scales is the North American gar. Ganoine was also on the scales of some ancient fish. Millions of years ago, some of these ancient fish changed into the animals that now live on land.

## Scale Enamel, Tooth Enamel Essentially The Same

The new study took a closer look at ganoine. Ahlberg and his team wanted to know if ganoine was really enamel, or if it was something else that just happened to be like enamel. To answer this question, they looked at the DNA of the fish with ganoine-coated scales. DNA is made up of genes, and is the blueprint that determines how a plant or animal will grow.

The scientists studied the DNA of the gar. They found the genes in its DNA that made the fish's scales. They discovered that these genes made two of the three building blocks of enamel.

According to Ahlberg, this showed that ganoine "was, indeed, enamel."

## Which Came First?

The team then looked at records of ancient fish. They wanted to know how long ganoine has been in fish scales. They examined the Psarolepis from China and the Andreolepis from Sweden, two fish that are over 400 million years old. In both fish, only the scales showed signs of enamel. Neither fish had enamel in their teeth.

Ahlberg believes that this suggests that enamel most likely did not first appear in teeth. It probably first appeared in scales.

Ahlberg and his team plan to continue studying the history of plants and animals. Their new study shows that this history contains many surprises.
