THREE RIVERS, Calif. â€” People come to see bears in Sequoia National Park. It is in the state of California. This year, they might be disappointed. Many bears have left the park. They have come to a nearby town. It is called Three Rivers.

The bears cannot find enough food. There has been very little rain. Food has dried up. Now the bears come to town to find food. They need to fatten up for winter so they can hibernate. That means they sleep through the winter.

## Nice To Meet You, Bear

People in town take pictures of the bears. Sometimes, they get very close to the animals.

Chas Haws met a bear one day. It happened before the sun came up. Chas was going to get something to eat. He saw a bear on the road.

Chas said the bear did not bother him. The bear looked at him and walked away.

"He didn't care about me at all," Chas said.

Most people are very happy to see the bears. They are called black bears, but many of them are brown.

## Hungry Bears Need To Eat

Sometimes at night, people make loud noises. They want the bears to go away. There might be gunshots. People wonder if someone is trying to shoot the bears.

Kathleen McCleary thinks it is true. "I'm upset and sad," she said.

Darrell Fleeman does not believe bears are being shot.

"Where's the proof?" he asked.

Right now, the bears' biggest problem is that they do not have enough food.

David Graber is a scientist. He lives in Three Rivers. David said the bears must eat enough to get fat for the winter.

"If they don't hibernate, they're going to die," David said.
