Welcome to the age of the Internet celebrity. Videos produced by users and shared online are becoming more and more popular, at least with young people.

Teens flock to conventions such as VidCon, an annual gathering of online video enthusiasts. They subscribe in mass numbers to YouTube channels and Vine accounts. Many teens even start their own video blogs.

Meanwhile, adults are mainly sticking to traditional media, like films and television. Defy Media, a digital content company geared toward teens, wanted to find out why Internet videos are so popular with young people.

## It's The Content

In its third annual report, released Tuesday, Defy found that 62 percent of 13-to-24-year-olds watch videos online because digital content makes them feel good about themselves.

Andy Tu is executive vice president of marketing at Defy Media. Based on Defy's study, Tu said that young viewers relate to the makers of online videos. "There's so much evidence that the big reason digital wins isn't just because of technology. It's because the content that's on these platforms is inherently more relatable," he said.

To gather data for the new report, Defy surveyed roughly 1,350 people nationwide, ages 13 to 24, and interviewed 36 people. About 18 of those interviews were in-person in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Minneapolis, and the rest were conducted online.

## TV Gets Pushed Aside

Defy's research suggested that, on average, teens watch 11.3 hours of free online video and 10.8 hours of subscription online video weekly. That is nearly twice the time teens spend watching free online TV shows from broadcast and cable networks (6.4 hours) or for regularly scheduled TV (8.3 hours). In other words, teens tend to spend more time watching YouTube videos, and other online content, than they spend watching TV.

Roughly 69 percent of those surveyed said that online videos include content they want to watch. Sixty-seven percent said they can relate to online content. By comparison, only 56 percent said that TV delivers content they want to watch, and only 41 percent said traditional media has content to which they can relate.

For example, one person Defy interviewed said that she loved singer Nicki Minaj, but that she found it difficult to form a connection with her.

According to Tu, the teenager said: "Nicki Minaj is all about making money and I can't make money so I can't relate to her."

## YouTubers As Role Models?

Tu argued young people's preference for online videos also has to do with how online content is made. "TV is coming from development execs then creators, then producers, and then talent performs that content," he noted. "YouTube has a deeper connection because the content comes from the creator." Viewers, in other words, may find it easier to relate to someone who is making videos from their bedroom than to a professional production team making a TV show.

Many of the teens who were interviewed also said that online video creators were more committed than traditional stars.

"They don't miss a single day and they are dedicated to the craft," Tu said. "Their content is consistent so a lot of the people we interviewed said they could count on them."

Some of the teens who were surveyed consider YouTubers to be their role models. An estimated 32 percent of 13-to-17-year-olds and 26 percent of 18-to-24-year-olds said that they were more likely to look up to a YouTube personality than to a traditional celebrity. Of 18-to-24-year-olds, 52 percent said they feel closer to their favorite YouTubers than they feel to traditional celebrities.

When asked if they could be a YouTube star, more than half of those surveyed said yes. However, when asked if they could be a TV or movie star, only about 40 percent said yes.

## Get Your Selfies Here!

The study also found that YouTube personalities can influence viewers more than traditional stars when it comes to promoting brands. An estimated 63 percent of all respondents said they would try a product or brand recommended by a YouTube personality. Just 48 percent reported that they would try a product or brand recommended by a TV and movie star. These findings indicate that teens may trust online video creators more than traditional celebrities.

Online videos seem to be getting more and more popular. Tu said he was walking around the Grove shopping center in Los Angeles last weekend and spotted an event that featured Vine and YouTube stars.

"There were hordes of people waiting everywhere to get selfies with all this talent," he said. Some onlookers were unimpressed, however. "Everyone at the Grove over the age of 30 was looking at each other like 'What the hell is going on around here?'"

Nevertheless, Tu is confident that online videos will become more mainstream. He suggested that as teens get older, they will keep keep watching online videos. "They are going to continue carrying these viewing habits," he said.
