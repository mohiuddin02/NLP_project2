The report was researched by the anti-poverty charity Oxfam. The study says that the world's poorest 3.55 billion people are living on the same amount of money as the richest 85 people. In other words: Just one of those 85 people has as much money as about 42 million of the world's poor. That's as many people as there are in Canada, Kentucky and Kansas, put together.

The report was released Monday. It was timed to come out right before The World Economic Forum, which opens on Wednesday in Switzerland. It is a gathering spot for global leaders in politics, education and business.

Along with the study, Oxfam published a message on its website. It said the growing gap between rich and poor is weakening democracy.

The past 25 years has seen more and more money go to fewer and fewer people, the website said. The very richest people in the world have about $110 trillion, the report said. That's 65 times the money that the poorest half of the world has.

## Financial Crisis Hurt Poor, Helped Rich

The report says 210 people joined the ranks of billionaires last year. Now there are around 1,400 billionaires in the world.

In 2008, the world had a crisis where a lot of people lost their savings, homes or jobs. The report also said that while the crisis hurt the world's poor, it ended up helping the rich. The very richest people on Earth collected almost all of the wealth that was created after the crisis.

The report said that the rich are getting richer while the poor are getting get poorer, especially in the United States. But it is not just in the U.S. There are only two countries where the rich were not increasing their share of the money. Those countries were Colombia and the Netherlands.

The report said that in the United States, China and Portugal, the very wealthiest people had seen their share of money increase by more than two times in the same period of time.

Oxfam is asking countries to take steps to make sure laws don't make the situation worse. When there is growth and less inequality, the report said, the rules of business work to help the middle classes and the poorest sections of society. But, the report continued, when only the rich are making money, the rules start bending to help only the rich.
