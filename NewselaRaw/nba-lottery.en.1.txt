LOS ANGELES — Four ping-pong balls are proudly displayed in the Los Angeles Clippers' practice facility. The black numbers printed on the balls read 5-3-6-10, the winning combination from the 2009 NBA draft lottery.

Winning that lottery did not give the Clippers a pile of cash. It meant they got the first pick of all the newest players coming into the league.

The Clippers made the most of that opportunity by signing Blake Griffin, the young star who has helped the Clippers get back on track.

Now it's draft season all over again. The NBA's 14 teams will soon find out the order they will use to take turns selecting new players in June's 2015 draft.

## Time To Remake The System

Once upon a time, the draft sequence was based solely on a team's regular-season record with just one twist: The worst team from each conference took part in a coin toss to determine who would get the number 1 pick.

Then in 1984, Houston started losing games on purpose to give them a better chance of ending up with that year's top pick. To prevent the same thing from happening the following year, the NBA switched over to a lottery system. The new system did not guarantee the worst-performing team would get one of their top choices.

For the first lottery, officials drew envelopes out of a container to determine the draft order. This method didn't balance out the league by giving the lowest-performing teams the best shot at the most talented players. After a scandal involving a "frozen envelope" that stood out from the rest, critics decided that it was also too easy for teams to cheat. The envelope system only lasted a few years.

## It's Quite A Production

Since then, the NBA lottery has evolved into a more complicated process. Entering its 30th lottery, the NBA now relies on ping-pong balls to keep the draft fair for all 14 teams.

When four balls are drawn out of 14, there are 1,001 possible number combinations - sort of like bingo cards. Before the lottery begins, 1,000 combinations are assigned to teams based on that year's win-loss records. In order to balance things out, the worst teams get the most chances to win the first pick.

For example, Minnesota had the NBA's worst record this year, so they will get 250 of those combinations. That gives them a 25 percent chance of winning the lottery. New York finished next to last, so they will have 199 combinations for a 19.9 percent chance of claiming the first choice. The percent chance of winning goes down for the other teams.

## Shake. Draw. Repeat. 14 Times

On lottery night, ping-pong balls are numbered 1 through 14 and placed in a plastic drum machine with an air current that mixes them for 20 seconds. The balls are drawn one at a time and whichever team has the combination with those numbers in that order wins the top pick.

The four balls are placed back in the drum and the process is repeated to determine the selection order for the other teams. If the same team is drawn more than once, the result is discarded and another four-ball combination is selected. If the lone unassigned combination is drawn, there will be a redraw for that pick.

The ping-pong ball system gives losing teams more chances to improve, but still creates plenty of surprises. Teams that were given the most combinations have only won the first pick three times in the last 21 years.

"There's no format that's perfect, but this is as close as you're going to get," Orlando Magic executive Pat Williams said. "I think the league has found the best system at this point."

## A Dramatic Drawing Event

Williams says the event is guaranteed to be entertaining. He has won the number 1 pick three times, making him the most successful participant in lottery history. "It's a dramatic evening, particularly if there is an absolutely great player in the draft," Williams said.

There isn't a LeBron James or Kevin Durant in this year's pool of new players, but scouts say Duke's Jahlil Okafor and Kentucky's Karl-Anthony Towns might have star potential. Ohio State's D'Angelo Russell is also attracting a lot of attention, as is Emmanuel Mudiay. Mudiay opted to played professionally in China instead of attending Southern Methodist University.

## "Weird" Keeping The Secret

The private ping-pong ball drawing will take place in a hotel conference room more than an hour before the results are announced in a television broadcast. Representatives from all 14 teams will attend along with NBA executives, members of the media and accountants who keep track of the results.

Everybody in the room is barred from leaving it until the TV broadcast is complete. Cellphones, computers and other devices are temporarily taken away from witnesses of the drawing to ensure results are not leaked before the TV broadcast.

Lakers' team publicist John Black was in the private room for last year's ping-pong ball drawing and remembers how tense things got when another team unexpectedly jumped ahead of the Lakers.

"It was interesting, but it was a little bit frustrating, having dropped down a notch and knowing that the rest of our organization — our general manager, our owners and everyone else — didn't know," Black said. He thinks it is only natural to want to share that information right away, but promises to keep this year's results a secret — even if it feels a bit "weird."
