LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — On April 1, California Governor Jerry Brown stood on a patch of brown grass in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The ground there should be covered with a few feet of snow at this time of year.

Brown watched as state officials checked the historically low levels of snow in the area. Then he announced new rules about using water. California has never had water rules like these before.

Brown told the State Water Resources Control Board that they must put rules in place to make sure everyone uses 25 percent less water. That means California will save 1.5 million acre-feet of water over the next nine months.

## Fighting The Drought

Other parts of Brown's plan include:

—Making sure golf courses, cemeteries and other grassy areas use less water.

—Helping cities replace grass with rocks or plants that won't use as much water.

—Rewarding customers who buy dishwashers and washing machines that use less water.

—Making sure new homes use smart lawn care systems.

—Making sure city workers don't water the grassy areas between traffic lanes that are just for decoration.

—Making water more expensive so people won't waste it.

Frank Gehrke has been part of California's snow survey program since 1987. He said there is always snow on the ground on April 1.

Gehrke said California is setting a record for having so little snow on the ground. That's bad news because California is already in a drought. California has gone for a long time with very little rain — and this time is usually the rainiest part of the year.

## A Shrinking Snowpack

California's "snowpack" measurements are usually highest on April 1. Some of the snow is packed almost as tight as ice and other snow is loose and fluffy. That is why the scientists don't measure how many inches of snow is on the ground. They melt it down to see how much water it makes. The water from this year's snow is only about 5 percent of the usual amount.

When the snowpack melts, the puddles soak down into the ground or they flow into streams and rivers. The melted snowpack usually makes up almost a third of California's water supply.

Water reservoirs are places where extra water is stored. Recent rainfall has raised water levels in California's reservoirs. Officials from the Department of Water say it's still not enough. They say California needs water from melted snow.

Department spokesman Doug Carlson said his team has never observed anything like this before. He said he would usually see 60 inches of snow on the ground at one of the snowpack measuring spots on April 1.

Carlson said he thinks that California will need to use groundwater, which is water located below the earth's surface. Carlson warned that there are also problems with using groundwater. He says California has already used too much of it.

## Recent Rain Has Helped

Officials said the low snowfall is due to low rainfall and warm weather. The Department of Water Resources said that the northern Sierra only has 76 percent of the rain it usually gets. According to the National Weather Service, temperatures in the area have been higher than normal for the past 15 months.

Fortunately, the rest of the state's water situation isn't quite as bad as the snowpack.

The weather was warm when recent storms hit California and they brought in rain rather than snow. Now California's rain levels are lower than average but still better than they were last year. The northern Sierra stations have already gotten more rain in the past six months than they did for the entire year before that.

The rain has helped refill the state's reservoirs. Still, it hasn't been enough to make the State Water Resources Control Board feel comfortable about water levels. As Board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus described it, the state of California's snowpack is "just terrifying."

The board recently put together an emergency plan. It has stricter rules about using water during the drought. Officials told cities to limit the number of days people can water their yards. The board also warned that it will make the rules tougher if they don't see improvements soon.

## "Ringing The Alarm Bells"

So far, Marcus said the board hasn't seen enough "stepping up and ringing the alarm bells."

Governor Brown agrees that things need to change. He and other officials have created new plans in response to the drought. Last week, the governor signed a $1 billion plan into law.

Most of the money will go to big projects that will take a long time to complete, like recycling sewage water and improving treatment plants. The plan also includes $127.8 million to help make changes right away. That money will buy food and water supplies. It will also protect California's environment from the effects of the drought.
