Ernie Chambers is a state senator in Nebraska. He works as a lawmaker and helps make sure the state government runs smoothly. Even though he is busy, he finds time for one special hobby: drawing. Senator Chambers is known for being a sketch artist. His office at the Capitol is full of drawing notepads that display his work.

Chambers has been a state politician for nearly 40 years. He learned some basic art skills as a child. Since then, he has slowly improved his drawing abilities. He draws a little bit of everything and everyone. There are sketches of other politicians and national leaders in his portfolio.

"Sometimes, I'm not even concentrating on making a picture. I'm just putting lines on a sheet of paper," Chambers said. He is 77 years old. He said he watches the pencil and pictures just flow from it.

## "Defender Of The Downtrodden"

Chambers was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He was a state politician for 38 years. Then he took a short break and was elected again. He is known as being the "Defender of the Downtrodden" and supports laws that help people and causes that others may ignore. Chambers also stands out for dressing differently than other lawmakers. While most politicians wear suits and ties, he shows up in sweatshirts and jeans.

Chambers said he doodles during work to pass the time. When the days are long and boring, he draws more. He writes messages and poetry under his drawings.

The ideas for his drawings often come from the people he sees at work. He will sketch portraits of lawyers talking about cases during meetings.

Senator Adam Morfeld is another Nebraska politician who works with Chambers. Morfield says that Chambers usually draws while people are talking. If he doesn't agree with something someone says, he will stop drawing and ask questions instead.

Morfeld said he was amazed by the quality of art. "I've thought about asking him for one or two," Morfeld said. "I call them Ernie-grams."

## "He Sits There And Draws"

Senator Bob Krist also works with Chambers.

"He's a great multitasker," Krist said. "He sits there and draws, but he's always listening to every word of the arguments."

Chambers started drawing in art classes in high school. He continued with the hobby when he was in law school. A law professor noticed his work on a piece of poster board. The professor suggested Chambers consider a career as an artist. Chambers felt sure that the professor wanted him to drop out of law school.

Chambers' collection of art is diverse. It includes a portrait of John F. Kennedy, a former U.S. president. It also includes a drawing of Kennedy's wife, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In 2001, he drew a picture of Elvis Presley. Someone he works with got it framed. The picture now hangs in her office at work.

Chambers receives praise for his artistic talents. Still, he insists he is not a formal artist because he does not have real training.

"What I do is like Burger King: Have it your way," he said. "If some people see it as good art, that's what it is. If people see it as bad art, that's what it is."
