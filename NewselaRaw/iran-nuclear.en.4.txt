TEHRAN, Iran â€” In 1979, the Iranian people threw out their government. They put Muslim leaders into power. These leaders ended many freedoms. They were also very anti-American. They hated Western ideas, values and even music.

The United States and other countries stopped trading with Iran. The Middle Eastern country has much oil. Yet, most countries would not buy it. Many countries refused to sell their goods to Iran, too. Iran became poor, and people could not buy what they needed.

On Sunday, an important agreement began. Six countries signed the deal with Iran. The United States was one of them. Iran agreed to slow down work on its nuclear program. Nuclear power can make electricity. It can also make a very dangerous bomb.

## Trade Can Begin Again With Other Countries

In exchange, Iran will get to start trading again with other countries.

Still, many Iranians doubt that life will get much better. Others do not know what the fuss is about.

Bahram Asgari has three children and sells carpet. Asgari does not know what the agreement is about. Still, he hopes it will be good for the Iranian people. Prices have been going up, and people cannot afford many things, he said.

In the gold market, shop windows glittered with jewelry. There are not many customers.

Asghar Nouzad is one of shop owners. He seemed sad. He said he does not have much hope for the future.

## Many Iranians Work More Than 1 Job

Life is hard for Iranians. Many have to work at several jobs. Many older people do not have enough money. They have started driving taxis.

Ali Reza is 62 years old. He has three children. Ten years ago, his pay was equal to about $2,500 a month from the government. He now gets pay equal to about $600 a month. It is not enough to support his family. Reza now works as a cabdriver to make more money.

He does not think anything will ever change.

Iran's young people are more hopeful.

Parisa Jalili is 24 years old. She decorates people's homes for a living. Jalili hopes people will now have more money. She also hopes they will spend that money decorating their homes.

## Leaders Say American Ideas Still Not Welcome

Iran's leaders have made a point over and over again. They say that Iran will not become more open to American ideas.
