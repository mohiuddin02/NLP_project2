NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. — Every morning at Corona del Mar High School, students hustle out of their shiny BMWs and head to class.

Corona del Mar is one of the state's top-ranked schools. But many see it as a place of unlimited money and intense competition, where the pressure to be smart and beautiful are extreme.

Recent controversies have not helped. Earlier this year, the school expelled 11 students accused in a cheating scheme, and a former official complained that the richest students weren't punished.

Over the last few days, news leaked out about the latest scandal -- an NFL-style "draft" to pick desirable prom dates.

## Not So Harmless

"I think it's insulting — it demeans girls," said Andrea Fine, the mother of two students, a boy and a girl, at the school. "Among my circle of friends, we talk about it. We're kind of alarmed, (like) 'What's our school coming to?'"

Over the weekend, school principal Kathy Scott sent an email to parents, urging them to discourage their kids from participating in the draft. "It is not OK for any student to be objectified or judged in any way," the letter said.

Social media sites buzzed with the controversy. Some condemned the prom draft as "creepy" and "sexist," though some Corona del Mar students have rallied to its defense. One girl, a junior, said she doesn't find the practice offensive. She said that most girls knew ahead of the draft who wanted to ask them to the prom.

"There's still a chance of us saying no," said the student.

Before the message was taken down, a tweet from one male participant proclaimed: "Many drafters on the prowl tomorrow for #freeagents so dress nice ladies."

## Defensive Moves

Students from a group calling itself "the 2014 CdM Senior Prom Draft Committee" sent emails to the media. They claimed the draft "was planned and organized with only the best intentions in mind."

The email said that 40 senior boys met recently at a private location. Numbers were plucked from a number ball roller and issued to the boys, who took turns selecting girls. Each boy was given two minutes to make his choice. The most desirable girls were apparently chosen first.

"The picks were announced by the draft commissioner and were generally applauded," one email said. It adding that the yearly prom draft "provides a solution for two guys who want to ask the same girl."

The boys aren't supposed to pay for a higher draft pick, the email said. But during the separate junior prom draft, a boy apparently paid $140 for a better chance of asking out a specific girl.

The email said that the female students were not ranked or rated.

## The Role Money Plays

Katrina Foley, a school district trustee, called for district-wide ethics training for all students.

"They probably believe it's not offensive or objectionable and that's part of the problem," Foley said. "A lot of this stuff comes back to wealth and being responsible with that wealth."

Corona del Mar ranks 37th in the state and 222nd in the country. The school is heavily white and minorities make up just 16 percent of the total number of students.

Some observers spoke about a sense of entitlement among kids with money. The kids feel that they can do whatever they want and get away with it. Jane Garland is the school district's former head of discipline. She said that during the cheating scandal she felt pressure to go easy on kids whose parents gave money to the school.

"We were always told, 'They're high-profile, be careful,'" she said. "There is really a bad culture over there, and everyone knows it's there."

## Pressure From All Sides

Irvina Kanarek graduated from nearby Newport Harbor High School in 2000. She developed an eating disorder when she couldn't squeeze into her prom dress.

She later founded a nonprofit group to prevent eating disorders.

Growing up, she said, "I heard things like, 'Oh, if you live in Corona del Mar, maybe you'll find somebody to take care of you.' 'Your boobs are nice, but they'd be better if they were one size bigger.' 'I'm on this new (diet), I'm only eating grapefruit for a week.'"

She said, "When you hear that over and over, it just becomes the norm. 'Yes, we all go on (diets), we all get boob jobs, we all want to marry a rich man.'"

As she sees it, the pressure on high school girls to look perfect, particularly around prom season, is more intense than when she was a student. You can go on Instagram and find #promdiet.

"Cheating, eating disorders, drafting people for prom — that's (a reflection of) a highly competitive nature," she said. "I don't want to say it's just wealthy kids behaving badly. I think it has to do with a higher standard of achievement."

Zoe Nicholson, president of Pacific Shore National Organization for Women, objects to the draft. But she doesn't think students should be punished. Punishing students would prevent an honest conversation about deeper issues, like eating disorders, suicide and alcohol, she said.

What about the girl in the room who isn't going to the prom or "the girl who didn't qualify for the draft?" she asked.
