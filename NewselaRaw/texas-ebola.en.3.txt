<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20141002_Ebola_updates.jpg" />EULESS, Texas â€” A Liberian named Thomas Eric Duncan who traveled to the Dallas area from West Africa recently was found to have a deadly disease. It is called Ebola and it kills most of the people who catch it.

Since Duncan was found to have Ebola, some Texans are blaming Liberians in their community for bringing the disease to the United States.

Carolyn Woahloe and others have heard the whispers and threats.

"Go back to Liberia."

On Wednesday night, Woahloe, a registered nurse, appeared with several Liberian pastors and community leaders to spread the word: "Please don't blame Liberians."

Woahloe said she got calls from at least two Liberian workers who said people told them they should leave the United States. The nurse said she told the callers to stay put.

"If I am Liberian, that doesn't mean that I have Ebola," Woahloe said at a news conference. "This is not a Liberian problem. This is a world problem."

## Many Questions To Ask

A group of about 10 leaders stood together as a sign of solidarity. Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, addressed a crowd of reporters who had urgent questions:

"Do you know the Ebola patient?"

"Where is the patient's family?"

"Is the community concerned for its image?"

Gaye said the last thing Liberians need is to be blamed as a group.

"We want to work together with the Dallas community and with the people of the Liberian community to get as much information out about this as possible," he said.

Someone asked whether Liberia's borders should be closed to keep other infected people from leaving. However, health officials have said Duncan showed no sign of illness when he left Liberia.

Local Liberian Pastor Emmanuel Botchway was eager to respond.

He said that closing a country's borders does not just stop people from moving in and out. It also means money and goods cannot get in or out of the country.

"That would be terrible for Liberia" he said.

## Learning What They Can Do

Gaye said the Liberian community had met a month ago with officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Dallas area. They wanted to learn what they could do for relatives suffering with Ebola back home in the very poor nation. Health care in Liberia is not very good and even ambulances are scarce.

The CDC is responsible for protecting America from health and safety threats due to disease.

But since Duncan was found to have the disease, Gaye said, the community has not heard from health officials.

There are about 10,000 Liberians living in central Texas.

## Worried About Those Back Home

Harling Moore, a pastor at New Life Fellowship Church, said they have more to worry about than their public image. They are concerned about their countrymen in Africa who are dying.

"We've been in communication with loved ones back home," he said. "We're offering advice on how to deal with this disease, and we are sending supplies."

In the church parking lot, officials pointed to a semi-trailer they said was loaded with medical supplies. It was to be sent to two hospitals in Liberia.

If the borders were closed, they said, aid could not get in.

"This is more than just about words," said Moore who fled civil war in Liberia and has lived in Dallas for 14 years. "This is a life-and-death situation. But we are trying to stay positive, encouraging one another and letting the community know that we are possible victims in this situation as well."

Don't point a finger at Liberia, Jimmy Sando, an airport worker, pleaded.

"This disease has been around since the 1970s. It ... spread to countries like Nigeria and Liberia. You can't blame Liberians, just like you can't blame any one nation for AIDS. That's just fear talking. Here there is one case. Back home, there are many, many cases."

## How Ebola Is Spread

Ebola is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of infected people who have signs of the disease, such as bleeding or vomiting. One cannot become infected by breathing in the Ebola virus through the air.

Botchway said pastors in the nine local Liberian churches would spread the word about the disease on Sunday. They will urge citizens who might have come in contact with Duncan to go to the hospital. They will tell them to contact the CDC.

Woahloe stressed that people should not even think of returning to their homeland because of mean-spirited comments.

One of the women who called her said she had to go home, Woahloe said. "And I told her, 'Don't go anywhere. Just go to work.'"
