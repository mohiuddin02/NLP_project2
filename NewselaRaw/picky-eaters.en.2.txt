There is no scientific definition of picky eating. Yet it is still a problem many parents have to deal with. Until recently, all picky eating habits were looked at in the same way. According to new research, different kids might have different reasons for making mealtimes difficult for their parents. In other words, picky eaters are not all the same. They can be motivated by a broad range of behaviors, and knowing which type of picky eater a child is might help parents develop constructive responses to get them to try new foods.

The researchers brought together 170 2- to 4-year-olds. Half of them were described by parents as being choosy. For two weeks the parents fed their families special meals designed by the researchers and then observed and recorded their children's responses.

Non-picky kids ate more and did not make a fuss about eating. Those seen as picky acted differently before and during meals. Some kids simply refused to even come to the table. Others were unsure about certain foods but eventually sat down to eat. A few kids even cringed and gagged.

## They Just Don't Like It

Sharon M. Donovan is a professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She is a co-author of the study. Donovan and her team talked to parents after observing their children. The researchers observed four different types of behavior that could identify any child as a picky eater.

Some of the behavior, such as refusing to eat broccoli, may be difficult to change in the short term. There are always going to be foods some children just do not like eating. Research shows that some children can taste a bitter flavor more strongly than others and may therefore take longer to like the taste of certain vegetables.

Other bad behavior at mealtimes, such as looking sad or even gagging, may not have to do with the food at all. For example, a child may be upset that a mealtime has interrupted a game she is playing. So she expresses her disappointment by refusing to eat, explains study co-author Soo-Yeun Lee, who is also a nutrition professor at the University of Illinois.

## Pickiness Will Eventually Fade

Lots of kids are picky eaters. Donovan says that 19 to 50 percent of youngsters up to age 2 can have problems eating some foods. How parents react can affect how long this behavior lasts.

The researchers might not know how to treat each kind of picky eater. But that does not mean their research is not useful. Lee thinks it will help parents to recognize that kids who are unhappy at mealtime may not always be that way because of the food being offered to them. Therefore, it does not make much sense for parents to try and change their kids' behavior every time they sit down for dinner. In all likelihood, the behavior will usually go away or be less after age 5.

## Try This Instead

Until they understand more about the differences between picky eaters, the nutritionists recommend a few approaches that have been shown to work. For a child who does not like mixed foods, explain to him or her what each type of food is on their plate the first time you serve the item. Accept that all children have their own tastes, but serve foods they don't like along with their favorites. Do not force your child to eat something new but encourage him or her to take a taste. Most of all, keep trying, Donovan says. Children may need to be served a food they do not like 10 times before eventually accepting it. Parents often give up before then.

## Four Types Of Finicky Eaters

Sensory-dependent eaters do not like some food because of the way it feels or how it smells. They might think it is yucky or slimy!

Preferential eaters try to avoid new or mixed foods.

General perfectionists have unusual needs, such as foods not touching one another.

Behavioral responders may cringe or gag when a meal is not exactly the way they like it. A ham and cheese sandwich might not be acceptable if it is on brown bread, for example. They may refuse to come to the table before they even know what is for dinner.
