Clues about how our ancestors lived may be found in their teeth.

This new discovery comes from the DNA of millions of tiny bacteria and plant material. They were found in the teeth of four 1,000-year-old skeletons. The DNA may help scientists figure out how people ate, got along and what diseases they had.

"I feel like we discovered a time capsule that has been right under our noses this whole time," said Christina Warinner. She is an anthropologist at the University of Oklahoma. She uses DNA information to find links between different groups of people. She is the lead author of the important new study. "This is a game changer," she said.

Matthew Collins of the University of York co-wrote the paper. He compared the discovery to finding the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, which was destroyed in a volcano eruption in 79 AD. Lava from the volcano preserved the town. People visiting Pompeii today can see what the city looked like and how people lived 2,000 years ago.

## Tiny Fossils Of Bacteria

The DNA was found in plaque on the ancient teeth. Plaque is the rough, bumpy stuff you might notice coating your teeth if you have skipped too many dentist appointments. Today, dentists scrape plaque off our teeth as part of our regular teeth cleanings. Without this, plaque can grow thick on our teeth. Before dentists were around, the plaque covering a tooth could be thicker than the tooth itself.

The buildup of plaque can trap the bacteria that live in our mouths. It turns them into tiny fossils. Even after death, these micro-fossils don't break down. They last for thousands of years.

Archaeologists study how people lived in the past. Often, they dig up bones and tools from ancient people. Most archaeologists have considered tooth plaque unimportant. They often removed it from skeletons during cleaning. But now, it is clear that plaque holds a huge amount of information.

"People are realizing that you have this rich bacterial community living on the surface of your teeth," Collins said. "There is so much information there. The challenge is how to (find) it."

Over the past 10 years, scientists started looking at ancient plaque samples under a microscope. They hoped to find tiny bits of food stuck in its hard material. Warinner wanted to know whether it had also preserved DNA.

To find out, she scraped the fossilized plaque off the teeth of four skeletons from Dalheim, Germany. The skeletons were from people who lived about 1000 years ago. She treated the plaque with various chemicals. Then, she put them through a machine that separates out the DNA.

The result was thrilling, she said.

## "Frozen In Time"

"When you get DNA from bones it is so damaged and there is so little of it left," she said. The scientists found 100 to 1,000 times more bits of DNA in the plaque than they can get from a bone.

From those tiny pieces of DNA, Warinner and an international team of scientists determined that bacteria in tooth disease has not changed much in 1,000 years. Tooth cavities are caused by bacteria. The ancient bacteria in the skeletons had a gene that could allow it to resist antibiotic drugs. This means the antibiotics won't work. They won't kill the bacteria like they're supposed to. Some of our bacteria has the same gene today. The scientists also found bits of plant DNA in the plaque. This provides evidence of what people ate 1,000 years ago.

But scientists can learn much more from ancient plaque.

Anne Stone is an anthropologist at Arizona State University. She said the findings were significant.

"What is exciting is it looks like the way (plaque) protects the DNA — almost like it is sealed in concrete — so it is more protected," she said. Other scientists will be interested in the study. This includes scientists who study the germs that cause lung diseases and ones who look at how tooth and gum diseases have changed over time.

Warinner notes that all groups of people who ever lived have had plaque on their teeth. So this study could teach us more about people in different time periods.

"Everything was there in an incredible level of detail and it was frozen in time," said Collins.
