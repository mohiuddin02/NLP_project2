PHILADELPHIA â€“ Solar panels capture sunlight and turn it into electric power. It is a clean way to make energy, but it costs a lot. The high cost is the main reason why solar panels are not used very much.

But some scientists in Pennsylvania want to change that.

The scientists have created a new material for making solar panels. Their work eventually could make it cost less to collect energy from the sun.

Solar panels work by absorbing sunlight. The sunlight makes electrons in the panels move. But the electrons have to be moved in the same direction to make energy. To do that, solar panels typically are made with layers of two kinds of materials.

## One Material, Two Jobs

The scientists have come up with a material that can do both jobs. They wrote about the new material in the journal Nature.

The group of researchers has created just small bits of the new material. But they think it can be used to make solar panels.

Right now, most solar panels are made from silicon. The new panels would be better at harvesting energy than the silicon panels. The new panels would be less expensive, too, the researchers said.

The new material contains elements called potassium, niobium, barium, and nickel. There are a lot of those elements around. They are also friendly to the earth. Materials in older cells can be bad for the earth. There also are not much of those materials around.

Silicon is common. But a lot has to be done to silicon for it to be used in solar panels. The authors say their combination of materials will be cheaper.

The government says only a tiny amount of energy used in the United States comes from the sun. Solar energy companies disagree. They say the government does not have a correct count of all the solar panels up on rooftops.

## Taking The Next Step

Solar power has been climbing steadily. For scientists, the sun remains an interesting source of untapped power.

Materials that can make electrons move one way have something called "polarity." Scientists have known about materials with polarity for many years. But those materials absorb energy from the wrong type of light. So they have not been used to make solar panels.

The Penn-Drexel team started with a material with polarity. It is called potassium niobate. Then the team added barium and nickel. Those elements let the material absorb energy from the right kind of light.

"The nickel is really doing the job," Anthony M. Rappe said. He is a chemistry professor. "The barium's kind of along for the ride."

Making the material involved many steps. The elements had to be ground up and heated.

Right now the scientists have only made the material. The next big step will involve putting the material into a solar "cell." It will have wires. Solar cells produce electricity.
