MIAMI, Fla. â€” The Florida bonneted bat is so rare that scientists know of only one group of them in the wild. There are only a few hundred left in Florida. They fly high in the sky and are hard to spot. Luckily, they are very chatty.

Thanks to some citizen scientists, it is now easier to hear them and study them. Volunteers have recorded the bats' songs and found out many new details about them. Luck also helped. The bats just happened to live in the backyard of a famous bat scientist.

"Who would have thought?" said Alfonso Perez, who is one of the volunteers. "If we just sit back and smell the roses, there's a lot of things going on."

All the attention has made stars out of the bats with their funny pug noses. They have a Facebook page and parties have been thrown to study them. Much of that is thanks to Kirsten Bohn, who is an expert in bat songs. She began organizing activities to collect information about them when she heard them in her backyard.

## Bat Songs Recorded On iPads And Phones

Her group of volunteers found bats near the Gables Granada Golf Course. They recorded the bats' calls using iPads and phones. The recordings show that the bats feed and sing like no other bat.

Frank Ridgely recently released the first bonneted bat raised at the Miami zoo. Ridgely is a veterinarian. A tracker was attached to the bat to let Ridgely follow it in the wild.

The new research could help officials protect the bat. The government wants to create a special habitat, an area where the bats will live safely.

Ridgely said tougher steps must be taken to help the bats survive. He said other parks in the county should be studied to use as habitat. The forest is never coming back in most of Miami-Dade County, he said.

## Saving The Bats Is Important For Farming

Saving the bats has become more important. Up to 2 million bats die each year, from diseases and other problems. Their deaths are bad for farming. Some bats pollinate plants and others eat large amounts of insects.

Bohn helped write a study about bat singing. It found bats don't chirp just to find their way or find food. They also sing to flirt, fight off other males and call young. Bats sing from their nests and they sing when they fly. Like humans, they may have a language.

Florida scientists knew bats came to the Granada golf course to feed. Bohn was lucky to move to the neighborhood in 2012. In a few weeks, she heard the bat songs and began recording them.

Neighbors read about the study and called Bohn. She formed the Bat Squad to help collect information. At their first bat night at the golf course, hundreds of volunteers wandered around or sat in lawn chairs looking into the night sky.

## They Need Open Space To Fly High

Bohn set up recorders on the Granada golf course. Amazed at the number of calls, she began recording in other areas. Bonneted bats are large and fly high, so they need plenty of room to maneuver. The bats typically lived in pine woods, where they can fly easily among the trees. Now, most of those woods are gone, and have been replaced with buildings. The bats now live where they can find space, like the parking lot around Zoo Miami.

Bohn and volunteers studied calls and the comings and goings of bats. The information helped them find that the bats call differently than other bat species in South Florida. It could make them easier to count.

Bohn picked up bat calls all over southern Miami-Dade County, but in very low numbers. It must mean the bats travel far to find food. Bohn also found that the bats do not like the cold, flying out only on warm nights. Counting them during colder months could get the wrong information.

Without more money, Bohn could not do more research. She hopes volunteers in Florida will keep recording, so she can continue her study.
