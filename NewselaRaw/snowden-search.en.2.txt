The man who leaked the U.S. government's secret programs that gather information about people's telephone calls and Internet habits is trying to keep his own secret from the government: Just where exactly is Edward Snowden?

Snowden's attempt to avoid facing U.S. criminal charges has become an international game of hide-and-seek. The governments of Hong Kong and Russia are not playing along with the United States.

U.S. authorities want to arrest Snowden on charges of espionage and theft. His passport is no longer valid.

Snowden is being helped by WikiLeaks, the group that became known for publishing government secrets on the Internet. WikiLeaks' leader,  Julian Assange, has been living under asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for a year, trying to avoid legal problems of his own.

## WikiLeaks Helps A Leaker

Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy and being returned to Sweden to face an investigation about a sexual assault. He has denied the accusations. He could also be extradited to the United States for an investigation into WikiLeaks.

With WikiLeaks' help, Snowden has also sought protection from Ecuador.

"The WikiLeaks legal team and I are interested in preserving Mr. Snowden's rights and protecting him as a person,"  WikiLeaks legal director Baltasar Garzon said in statement that compared Snowden's situation with that of Assange. He called what is happening to both men "an assault against the people."

On Friday, the United States said that it was seeking to extradite Snowden -- to legally bring him to the country to face charges. U.S. officials have also revoked Snowden's passport. That could make it more difficult for him to travel between countries.

Snowden was in Hong Kong. He had lived there for a few weeks while disclosing the secret National Security Agency spy programs to The _Guardian,_ a British Newspaper, and the _The Washington Post_.

His information sparked a worldwide debate over how far U.S. security officials could go to gather information to try to prevent terror attacks. Some have asked whether that can include monitoring people's phone calls and Internet use.

## Hong Kong Let Snowden Go To Russia

To the Obama administration's dismay, Hong Kong let Snowden fly to Russia on Sunday. Hong Kong authorities said they had asked the United States for more information regarding the request to extradite Snowden. Hong Kong said it could not legally stop him from leaving.

U.S. officials have expressed their displeasure with Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and with China itself. They said that they were answering Hong Kong's questions when Snowden left.

Once he arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, things became even more interesting. There is no direct flight from Moscow to Ecuador. Reports said that Snowden was taking a flight to Cuba on Monday.

The gate where the flight was boarding was mobbed by reporters and television cameras. Some reporters even booked seats on the flight. But Snowden was not on the airplane.

The _New York Times_ said that Snowden has not been seen publicly, or photographed, since he arrived in Moscow.

Assange told reporters via telephone on Monday that Snowden was "healthy and safe." He would not say where he was.

## U.S. Says Russia Should Hand Him Over

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday said that Russia should turn Snowden over.

"I would urge them to live by the standards of the law because that is in the interest of everybody," he said.

But Russian officials were playing coy.

"Overall, we have no information about him," Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary told Reuters.

Ecuador confirmed that it has received Snowden's request for asylum. It said it will decide the matter in due time. The decision will take into account Ecuadorian and international law.

How can Snowden travel at all without a valid U.S. passport? Assange told the _New York Times_ that WikiLeaks arranged for Ecuador to issue Snowden a "special refugee travel document" a week ago. He had  expected that the United States would file charges against Snowden.

## U.S. Says Phone Tracking Has Helped

U.S. officials have defended the gathering of telephone and Internet data. NSA director Keith Alexander said last week that the programs had helped stop more than 50 terror plots worldwide.

But Assange said in a speech published over the weekened that the government is invading people's privacy.

"The U.S. government is spying on each and every one of us, but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off," he said.
