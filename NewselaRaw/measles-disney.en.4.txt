SANTA ANA, Calif. â€” Measles is a disease that can be serious. After some people caught the disease at Disneyland, it has started spreading in California. Some students cannot go to school. If they did not get a measles shot, they may catch the disease. If they catch the measles, they could spread it to to others.

At one high school in California, 24 students were kept at home. The school wants to keep the measles from spreading.

More than 70 people have now caught the disease so far. Most are in California. Others are in six other states and Mexico.

## A Rash Is The First Sign Of Trouble

Someone who gets measles will first get a rash. The rash then begins to spread. Other symptoms are fever, red eyes and a runny nose. Measles can cause serious problems.

Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing. It is very contagious. One person can easily spread it to another.

Doctors and scientists make a shot, or vaccine, that can keep people from getting measles. Most people get this when they are young.

Today, some parents choose not to have their children get the measles shot. They are afraid the chemicals in the shot will hurt their kids. Scientists who have studied that say the vaccine is safe.

In Orange County, California, there are some rich communities where many parents choose not to give their children the shots.

## Vaccine Keeps It From Spreading

Experts say that out of a group of 100 people, if 8 or more do not have the measles shot, the disease can spread very fast.

Across the state of California, about 3 out of every 100 kindergartners have not had the measles shot.

In some elementary schools in Southern California it is even more. As many as 11 out of 100 children have not received the shot.

Dr. Eric Handler says the shot is safe. He is the Orange Country public health officer.

Handler said that when a school has one case of measles, it is important to be very careful. All children who have not had the measles shot must be kept out of school for 21 days. This keeps the disease from spreading, he said.

One person with measles walking though a group of people without the shot can infect 12 or more of them, experts say.

The United States has had the measles vaccine since 1963. Still, the disease spread across the country in 1976-77 and 1989-91.

In 1977, about 50,000 students in Los Angeles County were told to stay home from school. These students either had to get the shot, or prove they had gotten it before. Within days, most returned to school. The number of measles cases dropped quickly.

## All Parents Are Worried

Today measles is spreading in California. Some parents who did not let their children get the shot are changing their minds.

One mother at a park in Newport Beach said she changed her mind about her 2 1/2-year-old daughter. When her daughter was born she read a book. The book told her to skip some of the baby's shots.

She wanted to read for herself and not just trust the doctor, said the mother, Stephanie. She did not want to give her last name.

Now, Stephanie is worried about the measles. She will get her daughter the shot next month.

Some parents who did give their children the shot are worried, too. They worry about children who never got the shot. Those children could still make their kids sick.

"It scares me," another mother, Julie Angus, said. She talked about her fear while walking her preschooler and first-grader home from school.

These parents are making a decision that could hurt other children, Angus said. "I personally feel that if that's your choice you should home-school your child."
