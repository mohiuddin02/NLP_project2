CUPERTINO, Calif. â€” Apple just got sweeter. The tech giant picked up extra swagger and song-picking savvy with its $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics, a headphone and music streaming company founded by rapper Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine. Iovine is one of the first music business executives to roll with hip-hop culture.

The announcement was made on Wednesday, nearly three weeks after the press first reported that a deal was in the works. It's by far the most expensive purchase in Apple's 38-year history. It's a price that the company is willing to pay to defend its iTunes store from competition.

The price consists of $2.6 billion in cash and $400 million in Apple stock. The deal is expected to be final before October.

Beats is already making money, taking in $1.1 billion last year. It will boost Apple's earnings starting in October, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview.

## Beats Gets Closer To Its Dream

Iovine, 61, and Dre, 49, were the keys to the deal. They began working with Apple in the early days of its iTunes store and now will become key in Apple's music divisions.

"We have known these guys forever," Cook said of Iovine and Dre. "We've dated, we've gone steady and now we are getting married. This relationship started a decade ago, so we know there is an incredible cultural fit. These two guys have a very rare set of skills. It's like finding a particular grain of sand on the beach. It's that rare."

Cook indicated Beats' music streaming service was the main selling point in the deal. However, the headphone line also is expected to continue growing, too.

Iovine thinks little of most technology companies, calling them "culturally inept." But he believes Apple will empower Beats to realize its goals. Beats is bent on improving the sound of digital music and creating playlists tailored for each subscriber.

"To complete our dream, we needed a company like (Apple)," Iovine said in an interview. "We couldn't finish this on our own."

## Apple's Image Gets A Boost

Music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify have been growing in popularity. But this has reduced sales of songs and albums. iTunes has dominated that business for the past 10 years. U.S. sales of downloaded songs slipped 1 percent last year to $2.8 billion. Meanwhile, streaming music revenue surged 39 percent to $1.4 billion.

Apple broke into streaming with the launch of iTunes Radio last September. Unfortunately, the service has not been as popular as the company expected.

ITunes Radio has 40 million listeners and will continue as a free service with ads. Meanwhile, Beats Music will try to tap into the more than 800 million iTunes accounts to sell more subscriptions to its customized service. Beats Music currently has more than 250,000 subscribers, Cook said. That's well below Spotify's more than 10 million paying customers.

Apple is counting on Beats to boost its image with teenagers and younger adults. It's trying to remain a leader in digital music. That industry looks much different than when Apple reshaped the scene with the 2001 debut of the iPod.

"Apple suddenly has regained its cool," said Sony Music CEO Doug Morris. He was one of the first music business executives to embrace iTunes at Iovine's urging more than a decade ago.

## The Music And Technology Bridge

Beats was founded in 2008 by Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, and Iovine, a longtime music business executive. It now dominates the luxury headphone market. Its equipment is also a big seller in Apple's stores.

The purchase is the biggest sign that Apple's Cook is leading the company in his own way. The previous CEO, Steve Jobs, died in October 2011. Jobs favored smaller purchases with other companies. He also didn't believe subscription music plans would be popular.

Morris, who considers Iovine to be his best friend, believes Cook is making a smart move. He thinks it will give Apple even more credibility in the music industry.

"It's a game changer because Jimmy is that kind of guy who can change a game," Morris said. "I am not saying he is Steve Jobs, but he is a guy with new ideas. He really knows how to build the bridge between music and technology."

But some business analysts question whether Beats will be a good fit for Apple. The company makes most of its money selling hardware such as iPhones and iPads.

Analyst Frank Gillett says Apple would have been better off developing its own headphones itself. It could have expanded into music subscriptions through iTunes, he said.

## Not To Worry

Yukari Iwatani Kane is the author of "Haunted Empire," an inside look at Apple since CEO Jobs' death. She also sees the Beats deal as strange.

"Culturally, Beats is the complete opposite of Apple," Kane says. "It's known for being loud and bold and in your face. It doesn't fit with Apple's understated, discerning brand."

Iovine has visited Apple regularly since he first met Jobs more than a decade ago. He said he has no worries about joining Apple.

"This is not a big company to us," Iovine said. "We can roller skate in the halls here. Dre and I have been working together for 22 years. We are not about to go somewhere where we are going to fall."

Dre was calmer Wednesday than he was in a celebratory video posted online. It declared him as hip-hop's first billionaire after news of the Apple talks leaked earlier this month. "To be able to do something that could potentially change the world, I'm thrilled."
