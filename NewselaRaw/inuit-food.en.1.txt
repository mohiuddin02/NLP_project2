ANCHORAGE, Alaska — John Goodwin hunts oogruk, or the bearded seal, a marine mammal prized for its meat, oil and hide. He is one of approximately 35,000 Inuit in Alaska. The Inuit, in some places known also as Eskimos, live in the Arctic region. The Arctic includes parts of Alaska as well as parts of several European countries and Russia. 

The bearded seal is the largest of Alaska's ice seals and uses sea ice to rest on and to birth pups. After the long winter, ice breaks into floes, or sheets of floating ice. Then Goodwin, who is from the small city of Kotzebue, Alaska, has only a short time to hunt the seals before they migrate. The animals travel north through the Bering Strait, a waterway that connects the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Sea.

A hunting season that used to last weeks is shorter now, and ice that formerly froze 5 feet thick or more is now a fraction of that. Goodwin says, "As soon as the sun comes out, it starts melting, or we have a heavy rain. Basically, it's the rain that deteriorates the ice real quick. We don't have enough time to hunt." 

The Inuit consider themselves to be part of the environment, and they want to protect their culture and the environment as climate change takes a toll. It is a threat to food security, or people having a way to get enough safe and nutritious food.

## Food Is Connection To Past

The Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska advocates for coastal villages from southwest to north Alaska. The group recently issued a report asking for laws to protect Inuit traditional food and the Arctic environment. The study included visits to 15 Inuit villages and contributions by 146 authors. Carolina Behe is the organization's adviser on native knowledge and science matters. She says, "When we say food security, it has to do with the health of all of it." 

More than 90 percent of the food in Alaska comes in from elsewhere. A reliable food supply in more urban communities, such as Anchorage, means affordable prices and groceries shipped north by barge or jet. However, for the Inuit, who have survived for thousands of years in one of the harshest climates on Earth, food is a connection to the past.

For thousands of years, food traditions such as hunting seals and gathering salmonberries were shared through art, storytelling, dance, drumming and language. The report states,"Our traditional foods are much more than calories or nutrients; they are a lifeline throughout our culture and reflect the health of the entire Arctic ecosystem."

## Inuit Insights Called Crucial

As the climate began changing, Inuit leaders spoke about food at public hearings. Their description of secure food differed from ideas held by lawmakers, who spoke of nutritional value and purchasing power. "They were talking two different languages," says Behe.

Behe remembers a meeting where someone asked whether the Inuit were looking forward to increased shipping because it would create an opportunity to import more food. "Our people were saying the exact opposite. We're really concerned about these ships because they're going to disrupt our hunting, the noise is disrupting the animals, the pollutants, and that's a threat to food security," Behe says.

She also says that the report asks lawmakers to look at Arctic policy decisions through the lens of food. Inuit leaders want information collected on the Arctic ecosystem using both science and native knowledge. For example, a scientist researching salmon might look first at population factors, but an Inuit might taste the water, look at vegetation, check fish scales and gauge the texture of the meat. "You're asking two different questions but both of them are really needed," Behe says.

## World's Polluters Must Change, Adviser Says

The report also points out that land, ocean and wildlife laws are created by different government agencies. State officials set hunting seasons, which may correspond to the best time to process game. They also establish rules about the handling of food in group settings. Federal officials oversee harvesting of marine mammals and commercial ocean fisheries, and international agreements play a part in decisions about salmon and migratory birds. 

Sources in the United States and around the world contribute to the global warming and pollution that affects the Arctic. Behe says, "The people causing the pollution have to have more responsibility and have to be expected to change their behavior, as opposed to expecting the Inuit to change theirs."

Fran Ulmer, who is head of the United States Arctic Research Commission, says food and nutrition security is a priority. Researchers want to better understand how rapid climate change in the Arctic is affecting natural systems and people. Ulmer says the problem is also a priority for the Arctic Council, a gathering that promotes cooperation among Arctic countries.
