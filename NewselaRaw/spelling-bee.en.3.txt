NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. â€” As their names were called, 46 of the world's best spellers lined up on the stage. Medals hung around their necks.

Many of them appeared shocked they'd made it to the semifinals of the 2014 Scripps National Spelling Bee. Parents shouted, cheered and even cried with happiness.

The Spelling Bee has become a major sensation. More than 1 million students participated this year in local bees. The winners go to regional contests. The top 281 spellers made it to the national championships to try to spell some of the hardest words in the world.

This year's Spelling Bee was especially dramatic. The first round on Wednesday went through 41 spellers without a mistake. But 24 spellers got sent home after stumbling on such words as Keeshond, a Dutch dog breed, and paradigm, which refers to patterns.

## Especially Tough Words

Wednesday afternoon's round began with 257 spellers. They had to correctly spell words for rare animals and foods, medical terms and other curiosities. Some of them included objicient (argumentative), Valkyrian (related to battle) and formicivorous (feeding on ants). Other spelling stumpers were pikas, ocellus and Wordsworthian. A pika is a small Asian mountain mammal. An ocellus is an insect eye used for detecting light. Wordsworthian relates to the poet William Wordsworth.

A crowd favorite was Hussain A. Godhrawala. The youngest speller, Hussain is 8 years old and from Barnwell, South Carolina. He seemed almost overwhelmed when he got unguiculate. It means relating to nails or claws. Nine-year-old Kasey Cuenca Torres of San Angelo, Texas, got a rousing response to his winning word, phaeton. A phaeton is a kind of car without a roof.

In the second on-stage round, spellers were knocked out by some especially tough words. They included jeroboam (a wine bottle) and obtundent (lessening pain). Palatalize (use of the tongue in producing sounds) and diphtheria (a childhood illness) sent other spellers home.

Many of the spellers enjoyed joking with pronouncer Jacques Bailly, who announced the words. But others seemed in a hurry to get away from the microphone and went straight to the spelling.

Spellers often drew attention with bubbly greetings to Bailly. Sriram Hathwar is 14 and from Painted Post, New York. He gave a cheery "Hello, Dr. Bailly and friends."

## "Back To Business"

Some spellers wrote invisible words on the backs of their name cards, on arms, on hands and in the air. Others bit lower lips, played with their hair or stuck hands deep in pockets. A few did short comedy routines. Neha Seshadri is 13 and lives in Detroit. She asked Bailly: "May I take a deep breath, please?" When he said yes, she replied, "Back to business."

The spellers were from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. overseas territories. They also came from U.S. schools in Europe and seven foreign countries.

Some spellers were relieved at getting common words. But they also seemed to welcome head-scratchers. Three especially tough ones were galjoen (an African fish), roodebok (a small antelope) and schottische (a polka-like dance).

Ed Horan is 14 and lives in Hoboken, New Jersey. The crowd appeared breathless as he seemed puzzled by the word for puppets moved by overhead strings. Then he nailed the word, fantoccini. Mary Polking, 14, of Charlotte, North Carolina, repeated the first few letters of the word for a man's felt hat. She started over twice. Then she figured out the second vowel and spelled homburg.

Some words were ones few kids use in everyday conversation. They included mandir (a Hindu temple), quisling (a traitor) and jeremiad (an angry rant). Foggara is an underground pipe for carrying water. Baedeker is a travel guidebook. And bobbejaan is a word for baboon in the Afrikaans language of South Africa.

The spelling words came from all over the world. There was a word from the Algonquin Native American language. Other languages of origin included Javanese, Yiddish, Russian, Dutch, Persian, Latin and Greek.

In the end, the Scripps National Spelling Bee crowned two winners Thursday night. After a five-round duel, neither could miss a word. Sriram Hathwar, of Painted Post, New York, and Ansun Sujoe, of Fort Worth, Texas, shared the prize.
