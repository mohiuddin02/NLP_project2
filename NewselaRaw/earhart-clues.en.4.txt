MIAMI — The photo of Amelia Earhart's plane was taken on June 1, 1937, just before dawn. Amelia Earhart was a famous female pilot and the photo of her plane was taken just before she took off on her famous flight around the world. On that flight, Earhart disappeared and was never seen again.

The picture contains one strange detail. It shows a shiny silver patch on the body of the plane. The patch doesn't show up on any of the other pictures of Earhart's plane.

Investigators wonder whether it's a clue to what happened to Earhart.

Longtime Earhart investigator Ric Gillespie thinks so. He believes the silvery patch is really a repair. He hopes to use a computer to link it to a scrap of metal that might have broken off Earhart's plane. The scrap was found on a tiny Pacific island. The island is in the area where Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan disappeared.

## Connecting The Dots

Gillespie hopes to match a pattern of holes in the photo to the holes in the broken piece.

It would prove that Noonan and Earhart weren't lost at sea, but made it to the island, Gillespie said. Gillespie is the head of the a group that tries to solve missing plane cases.

If he's right, that would solve one of the greatest mysteries in the history of flight.

Earhart's trip around the world didn't go well from the start. First, she landed at the wrong airport in Miami. The landing was rough and the plane needed repairs.

In earlier photos of Earhart's plane, a window is clearly seen.

However, in the photo shot on June 1, 1937, the window is gone. It is replaced by that odd silvery plate.

The window must have been broken by the hard landing in Miami, Gillespie said. Earhart and Noonan probably just took it out and patched the plane instead.

Then a month later, her radio antenna tore away.

As she neared Howland Island in the Pacific, she radioed, "We are circling but cannot see island, cannot hear you." Messages continued for more than an hour. She then radioed her location: "We are on the line of position 157 dash 337. … We are now running north and south."

Then there was silence from the plane.

## They Kept On Going

Rescue ships began looking for Earhart right away. Search planes spotted signs that someone had recently been on Gardner Island. Gardener is located about 400 miles from Howland. But the planes moved on.

In 1991, the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) went to Gardner. There, investigators found a scrap of metal with rows of holes. The piece looked like it was torn from the outer skin of an airplane.

The scrap was made from a metal that matched Earhart's plane. But the hole pattern didn't match.

Gillespie began thinking the piece could have come from the patched window. He looked at photos of Earhart's plane. Only one shot offered a good view of the patch — the 1937 photo.

Gillespie said if they can match that hole pattern in the photo, he doesn't see how anybody can argue against this anymore.

Gillespie thinks Earhart landed her plane on a coral reef just off Gardner Island. He believes she then radioed for help.

## Lots Of People Heard Calls For Help

After she disappeared, more than 100 shortwave radio listeners reported distress calls from a woman identifying herself as Earhart. At the time, people thought they were fakes. But Gillespie believes some of them may really have come from Earhart.

One of the reports came from a Florida teenager. Her name was Betty Klenck. She died recently at the age of 92.

Three days after the plane went down, Betty was listening to her radio. She heard a call from someone calling herself Earhart. For three hours, the teenager took notes. The woman asked for help. She said: "Oh, if they could hear me."

Officials weren't interested in the notebook. They thought Betty made up the story. Yet the notebook contains information Betty couldn't possibly have known. The woman may really have been Earhart, calling from Gardner Island.
