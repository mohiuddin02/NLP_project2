LONDON — Hoping to sell that art masterpiece for a fortune? It might help if it's red.

That's just one trend from an art market that has come roaring back from the global financial crisis. These days, buyers from emerging markets such as China are molding tastes and driving top-end prices ever higher.

Global demand for works by [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso), Matisse and other modern masters seems bottomless. Sales next week at London's Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses are expected to generate at least 400 million British pounds ($658 million).

Sotheby's put its works on public display in London Thursday, and there was a distinct scarlet hue to the star lots. Gerhard Richter's intensely red abstract "Wall" is expected to sell for at least $20 million. An Andy Warhol portrait of former Chinese leader Chairman Mao is valued at $7 million to $9 million. And a vivid red piece in molten plastic by Alberto Burri titled "Rosso Plastica" could break the $4 million record for the Italian artist.

## Red Is Primal, And It Sells

"When we're pricing things we're aware of the power of red," said Alex Branczik, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department in London.

"Red is a color that incites passion. It's the color of the sunset, it's the color of blood," he said. "I think it's more primal than nationality, but I do think" it's particularly appealing "for Asian buyers," for whom red may have associations with luck and happiness.

There is some evidence to support this theory — four of the five most expensive Richters ever sold are red. Sotheby's says there's a chance "Wall" could smash expectations and beat the $37.1 million record for a living painter.

Buyers from Asia, and especially China, are one reason the art market has rebounded from the global financial crisis of 2008.

Newly wealthy Chinese collectors began by buying works from their own country — both modern art and historic treasures. They then moved onto European contemporary art and other areas.

Sotheby's estimates that China now accounts for $14 billion of the $58 billion global art market. Asian buyers spent twice as much on contemporary artworks at the auction house in 2013 as they did the year before.

## Global Buyers Pay Record Prices

Art spending by Latin Americans also leapt last year and Russian and Middle Eastern collectors continue to pay record prices.

"When I started in this industry, it was really European and American (buyers)," said Jay Vincze, head of Christie's Impressionist and modern department. "Now it is truly global.

"The buyers are out there," he said, and "the market is strong."

That has led to a mood of quiet optimism about this year's sales at the auction houses.

In auctions of Impressionist, modern and Surrealist art starting Feb. 4, Christie's has Pablo Picasso's "Woman in a Turkish Costume," a portrait of his wife Jacqueline Roque — estimated at up to $27 million — and Juan Gris' Cubist "Still Life with Checked Tablecloth," valued at up to $24 million.

There are also multimillion-dollar works by Piet Mondrian, Rene Magritte, Fernand Leger and Joan Miro.

"When you look around these rooms, the supply we've got this season is incredibly rich and varied," Vincze said Thursday. "The quality is very, very high."

## Eyes On Central Asia

A few blocks away at Sotheby's, sales that start Feb. 5 include Vincent Van Gogh's "Man is at Sea," once owned by actor Errol Flynn; Lucian Freud's portrait "Head on a Green Sofa" and works by Claude Monet, Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse.

Another highlight is Camille Pissarro's 1897 "Boulevard Monmartre," which Sotheby's calls "one of the most important Impressionist paintings we've handled." It's estimated at $9 million to $14 million, but there's a feeling it could fetch more.

It's a far cry from the jittery years after the 2008 banking crisis, when works went unsold or fetched lackluster prices at best.

Auctioneers are already looking to woo the next wave of wealthy art buyers. Christie's held its first sale in India last month, and Sotheby's opens an exhibition of Indian and international art in New Delhi on Friday.

And, said Branczik, "I think Central Asia is interesting. It's a place where a lot of wealth is being generated."
