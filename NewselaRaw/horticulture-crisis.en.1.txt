PHILADELPHIA â€” Coming from proud professionals, who prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables than make bold warnings, the words were downright shocking: "Horticulture is under siege."

Horticulture is the study of plants, and six of the field's most prominent had penned an alarming letter in December. It went to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, industry associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions to zucchini.

The letter said horticulture is in trouble and warned that something must be done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field. Or else, it said, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science.

"Think of all the careers horticulture is competing against," said Paul B. Redman, director of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa. He is a strong supporter of the four-year campaign outlined in the letter, which calls for:

A scientific study of the decline in interest in horticulture to show with numbers what backers already believe to be true;

An education plan outlining how horticulture can be integrated in K-12 education and promoted on college campuses;

Using advocacy and marketing to raise public awareness of horticulture's importance, as well as the different career options in the field.

## An Art And A Science

"We have to come up with a game plan. Period," said Redman, who has been in horticulture for three decades. Reflecting the first hurdle this effort faces, Redman says he still has to define for people what horticulture means.

By the book, horticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants. But Mary H. Meyer, a horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota and a major force in the campaign, said people don't really understand what being a horticulturist means.

She described the mistaken impression people have. "It's a guy with a pickup truck and a lawn mower, a low-paying job requiring manual labor and no college degree," Meyer said. She is also president of the American Society for Horticultural Science.

Horticulture offers many career opportunities, she said. She ticked off a few, including plant breeding, greenhouse and food production, and the cut-flower, landscape and nursery industries. There's also caring for public gardens, parks and sports turf. And there's a number of fields of research for people who are interested in plants, including global climate change, plant pests and diseases, water quality, biofuels, and food safety and security, as well as the psychological and physiological benefits of plants.

This crisis is not unique to the United States, as Meyer discovered while teaching in England over the summer. The world's horticultural powerhouse was facing the same concerns, so much so that the Royal Horticultural Society decried in a report in May, "an alarming shortage of skilled professionals" in horticulture jobs. It poses "a threat to Britain's economy, environment, and food security," the society said.

Horticulturists in both countries say the crisis has been building for decades. They cited a number of causes, like the globalization of the food and flower trades, the population shift from farm to city, and the loss of a personal connection to the land.

"When do most people get interested in plants now?" asked Richard Marini, head of Pennsylvania State University's plant science department. "Usually, when they buy a house," he said, "and by then, they're out of college."

## Getting Kids Interested

Matthew Bond, 21, a plant sciences major at Cornell University, found his future the old-fashioned way. He grew up in farm country in Ogdensburg, N.Y., where his father and grandmother were enthusiastic gardeners.

Bond, who's been an officer of the National Junior Horticultural Association since 2009, is worried that the group's membership has plummeted from 1,000 in the '60s to half that number 15 years ago to 300 today. He suggests today's heavily scheduled kids have little time for hobbies like gardening. "They don't even go outside," he said.

But Bond said there are signs that much-needed energy could be injected into horticulture, like interest among young people in farming in cities. More young people are also interested in organic food production, a method that involves avoiding the use of chemicals.

Pauline Hurley-Kurtz, chair of the landscape architecture and horticulture program at Temple University, says student interest in traditional horticulture is holding steady. That includes areas like ornamental shrubs, trees and plants. Giving her hope, she said, is that practical courses have become extremely popular in the last two or three years. Among them: growing food, storm-water mitigation, native plants, restoring landscapes, the study of trees in cities, and even beekeeping.

A challenge is getting people interested in horticulture early, said Jessica McAtamney, who teaches environmental science and gardening in cities at W.B. Saul High School in Philadelphia. "There's nothing sexy about plant science until you make it so for kids," she said. But as McAtamney added, "Once you do, they're hooked."

Hydeia Brown, 17, from Philadelphia's Germantown, could be the poster child for an idealized horticultural future, in which not only would there be more practitioners, but the ranks of horticulturist would have more diversity as well.

"I love science," said Brown, an environmental science major in Saul's horticulture program, in a phone interview from Morris Arboretum in Philadelphia. Her class was photographing and cataloging the Latin botanical names of pitch pine, American holly and other trees. Brown, who wants to make a career in plants, said she wished "other kids would come out and experience this. Not a lot of them know about the outdoors. They like electronics and stuff like that."

That mindset is just one obstacle to a horticultural turnaround, which, if it happens, could take 20 years. But many believe a long-term commitment is critical.

For Douglas C. Needham, education department head at Longwood, it's also personal. "I'm passionate about this," he said, "and I don't want to see the art, science, and craft of horticulture die out."
