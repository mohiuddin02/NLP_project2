CHICAGO â€” Robert McDaniel was puzzled when the Chicago police commander dropped by his West Side home last month. Commander Barbara West was polite, but her message was clear: Stop committing crimes or be prepared for the worst.

West told the 22-year-old that she knew his best friend had been killed last year. It had happened in Austin, their dangerous South Chicago community. She cautioned that the same thing could happen to him if he didn't change his ways.

McDaniel had never been arrested for anything serious. For that reason, he was surprised to learn he was on the police department's so-called "heat list." This lists people the department considers most likely to be involved in violence.

McDaniel had been arrested for things like smoking marijuana and gambling. In his neighborhood, that's common. "I haven't done nothing that the next kid growing up hadn't done." He couldn't believe his name was on the list.

## "Heat List" Has 420 Names

Chicago police are trying to figure out who is most likely to shoot someone. Or to be shot themselves.

To find out, they enter arrest records into a computer system. Then, they use math to sort that information.

Police officials said they had come up with a list of 420 names. They had looked at various questions, such as: How many times has a person been arrested? Have they been arrested for carrying weapons? Do their friends have criminal records? And have any of those friends been shot?

Those who are highest on the list really stand out. They are more than 500 times more likely to be involved in violence than the average person, according to the police.

People on the list are warned by police officers. They are told that they will be severely punished for further crimes, no matter how small. But the police also offer help: Those who want it can receive job training or other kinds of aid.

## Listed Because Of A Friend

McDaniel most likely ended up on the heat list because of a childhood friend. The two had once been arrested after police found marijuana on them. Last year, that friend was fatally shot in Austin.

He said he was offended that West had singled him out. "I have no background, so why watch me?" said McDaniel. "And if you're watching me, then you can obviously see I'm not doing anything."

But the police were right to be concerned about another young man. This month, 21-year-old Jacobi Herring was killed near his South Chicago home.

His uncle, Koland Herring, was not surprised that his nephew was on the heat list. He said Jacobi had given in to neighborhood peer pressure.

"He was never a shooter, burglarizing or stealing cars, anything like that," Herring, 49, said. "Some of the people that he knew did. They're hard-core. And in order to get around and to be accepted out here, you have to be around them."

## Another On The List Killed

Herring was only arrested a few times. And for minor things, like trespassing or hanging out with known gang members.

But four friends also made the list. In addition, someone who was arrested with Herring was shot and killed this March. And Herring himself was shot in 2008.

"We talked about him getting shot all the time," said Herring's father, Floyd Redmond. "I used to see my son hanging out, and I used to ride down on him. I feared for my son being out on these streets. I know what these streets are all about, man."

As for McDaniel, he's thinking about accepting the police department's offer of help. He has a 2-year-old daughter to care for. And another child on the way.

But he insisted he doesn't belong on the heat list. "I don't too much appreciate that," he said.
