Of all the things young children put in their mouths, dirt may be what parents are most worried about.

Although there are reasons not to eat soil, getting intestinal worms may not be one of them.

## You've Got To Be Kidding!

Researchers have long been investigating the link between being too clean and the loss of immunity to disease. There's some evidence that a little dirt creates an immune response in the body that helps fight off disease and allergies. Giving poop from healthy people has been shown to help fight antibiotic-resistant infections in patients for whom nothing else worked.

Now, some are looking into the potential health benefits of ingesting worms, which are parasites that live in a person's intestines.

In the Western world, it has been decades since worms were a familiar part of the human biome, the term for all organisms - or tiny life forms - that thrive in people.

## After Worms, Pollen's Not So Bad

But as worms have disappeared, rates of autoimmune and allergic diseases have skyrocketed. It does not necessarily mean that their disappearance has caused more disease, but the subject is getting more attention.

William Parker, associate professor of surgery at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, said the worm-allergy connection was first scientifically investigated about 40 years ago. British scientist John Turton, who had a hunch that hookworm might stop his allergic reaction to pollen, gave himself a dose of hookworms and his hay fever went away.

Decades ago, antibody cells in the blood attacked the intestinal worms, called helminths, but in the 1960s, the Western world killed off this worm population. Since then, those antibodies have sought a new target. For many, that has meant an overreaction to pollen and even their own bodies, Parker said.

"As far as the big picture of human health goes, it's pretty much already accepted that when you put helminths back into the ecosystem of the human body," you can stop disease, he said.

## The Government Is Not Convinced

Helminthic therapy is done with worms at the tiny, larval stage after they first enter the body. Human antibodies kill off the worms before they can grow or before they can multiply.

According to Neilanjan Nandi, assistant professor of gastroenterology at the Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, patients will ask if helminths can work for them?

Although the use of helminths in humans is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there are about 7,000 people in the world using helminths for a variety of diseases.

Several studies have shown that helminthic therapy may treat people with digestive and other diseases.

Parker, who recently published a study on self-treatment with helminths, said those using worms to cure themselves fall into two groups.

## Physician, Heal Thyself

"About half are very well educated," he said. "A lot of them are scientists, or are in the medical field; and the other half either knows one of those people or weren't that educated but got very, very sick" and educated themselves.

Parker said a helminth supplier told him about 25 percent of its clients were medical professionals who used the worms themselves. Many won't recommend helminths to their patients because they do not have FDA approval.

But some doctors already are suggesting helminths for their patients.

"Most antibiotics are not FDA approved for children, either," said Nancy O'Hara, a pediatrician with a private practice in Connecticut. "They have not been tested on children. They have been tested on people who are older than 12, but because they're thought to be safe, we give them to children."

## "Absolutely Grossed Out"

Depending on the species, helminths are given through a drink or are placed on a bandage applied to the skin, which absorbs them.

For Rosemary Kind, a writer from North Yorkshire, England, helminths were a last resort for severe food allergies.

After conventional treatments failed, she read an article on helminthic therapy.

"That's gross. I really don't want to do that," was her first reaction. Still, she tried it, and some of her allergies went away, and she continues to use helminthic therapy.

"People are absolutely grossed out by the idea of worms. I think it's the wrong word to use," said Donna Beales, a medical librarian in Boston who used helminths to treat angioedema, a rapid swelling of the throat tissue that left her feeling like she was suffocating.

## Who Are You Calling A Parasite?

"We use the word worms and we use the word parasite. I think this just calls up a lifetime of negative thought process," said Beales, who added that the worms "worked beautifully" for her condition.

It will be some time before reports of helminthic success are backed by enough scientific data to win FDA approval. The experiments are complicated by issues of where to get the worms, how many doses are needed, and how long treatment can take before showing results, Parker and Nandi said.

People considering self-treatment with helminths are advised to speak with their doctors. Some will not be in favor of, but others may think it's worth a try.

"The risk-benefit ratio is so skewed to the benefit side," O'Hara said. "Helminths are much safer than any medication I've ever put any child on, or any adult. I really do think that this is something more and more physicians need to consider."
