CHICAGO â€” The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took a step Thursday to eliminate an unhealthy ingredient from Americans' diets. The government agency is making a rule against trans fat.

Trans fat is an artificial substance that clogs the arteries. It was found in a lot of processed foods, or foods made in factories. Food makers and restaurant chains have taken steps to remove trans fats over the past decade. As people learned more about the risks of trans fat over that time, they also have bought healthier alternatives.

The FDA has required that nutritional labels break out trans fat content since 2006. The rule caused many companies to change their recipes.

The FDA noted that trans fats in processed food have been shown to raise "bad" cholesterol. That can raise the risk of heart disease. Reducing the use of trans fats could prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths from heart disease a year, the FDA said.

## Partially Hydrogenated Oils

The amount of trans fat people eat is still a big concern, Food and Drug Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said.

Trans fatty acids, or trans fats, are formed when food makers turn liquid oils into solid fats by adding hydrogen atoms. The process is called hydrogenation.

Trans fats are added to some foods. The FDA now has declared that partially hydrogenated oils are not "generally recognized as safe." Partially hydrogenated oils are the main source of trans fats.

The new guidelines mean that companies that want to use the ingredient have to first get the FDA's approval. Companies also could not claim their food contains "zero grams trans fat" if the product has a half-gram or less per serving. For now, food companies can still make that claim.

Nutritionists say it's a victory that will take a dangerous substance out of the American diet.

Trans fats are used mostly to make foods feel a certain way or to last longer on the shelf. They preserve flavor, make crusts flaky and keep peanut butter from separating.

The fats were used more often as Americans ate more processed foods starting in the 1950s. But studies began to question the impact of trans fats on health in the 1990s.

## Sharp Drop In Trans Fats

The FDA will get responses from the food industry and other experts over the next 60 days.

Americans have eaten almost 80 percent less trans fat in the last decade. More education about their risks have helped, and so have some local bans against trans fats. Food makers and restaurants also have voluntarily eliminated the ingredient.

California became the first state to make restaurants stop cooking with trans fats in 2008.

"Getting rid of artificial trans fat is one of the most important life-saving measures the FDA could take," said Michael F. Jacobson. He runs the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

Nutrition experts say that many people do not know how much actual trans fat is in foods. Smaller serving sizes can sometimes make people think that the true fat content is less than it seems.

"If the serving size is small and you eat several servings, the amount of trans fats adds up," said Jennifer Ventrelle. She is a dietitian at Rush University Medical Center.

Also, trans fats most often are in products without food labels. Scones at your local coffee shop or restaurant French fries are a few examples, Ventrelle said.

"It's how they prepare the food that's important," she said.

## Trans Fat In Some Baked Goods On Menus

How people prepare foods at home matters, too. For instance, the nutrition label on a box of Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese lists zero grams trans fat per serving. But the label also says that adding margarine and 2 percent milk adds trans fat.

Kraft declined comment.

Mondelez International makes Oreo cookies, Wheat Thins and other cookies and crackers. It said all of its cookies and crackers are labeled as "zero grams trans fat" per serving. But some Mondelez products still contain partially hydrogenated oil, according to the label.

General Mills said that it has taken the trans fat out almost all of its U.S. products. It pledged on Thursday to eliminate the rest in response to the FDA's proposed rules. General Mills produces food under different brands including Betty Crocker and Pillsbury.

Most major restaurant companies eliminated partially hydrogenated oils in the mid- to late-2000s, the Center for Science in the Public Interest said. But a number of chains still have menu items that contain some partially hydrogenated oil. The oils are in baked goods.

McDonald's uses cooking oil that contains zero grams of trans fat per serving. But the USDA notes that some of its products contain trans fats. Those products include apple pies, cookies and pancakes.

McDonald's declined to comment Thursday.

The FDA proposal focuses on partially hydrogenated oils. A small amount of trans fat is naturally found in some meat and dairy products. The proposal would not affect that trans fat.
