WASHINGTON â€” The United States government runs on a calendar that ends on September 30. After that, Congress has to pass laws to pay for the government.

The deadline to pass those laws this year is midnight Monday. If they are not passed, parts of the government will shut down. Right now it looks like the shutdown will happen. It would affect many things, from national parks to the military. It would be the first shutdown in 17 years.

Democrats are blaming the Republicans. Republicans say it's the Democrats who are at fault.

The root of the disagreement is a new health care law. Republicans do not like the law which many people call Obamacare.

## House Wants To Delay Part Of Obamacare

The Republicans run the House of Representatives. It approved a new plan on Sunday. The plan would have delayed a key part of the health care law by a year. It also would have gotten rid of a tax on medical devices. In return, a shutdown would have been avoided. President Barack Obama and the leader of the Senate said the plan was no good. The Senate is controlled by the Democrats.

The White House said it would not approve the plan. It also said Republicans were "pushing the government toward shutdown."

Lawmakers from each side spoke on the Sunday talk shows. They did not seem to be talking to each other. They repeated the same old arguments about the health care law. They talked right over one another.

"I agree we should have this debate, but we shouldn't connect it to a government shutdown," said Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia. That is the biggest disagreement between the two sides, he said.

The House's vote was 231-192. Almost everybody voted with their political party. Now the action moves to the Senate.

## Only A Partial Shutdown On Tuesday

Not everything would shut down Tuesday morning. Some important services would keep running. Among them are border patrols, meat inspection and air traffic control. Retired people would be paid. Health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals.

The Senate was not scheduled to meet until midafternoon Monday. There will be just 10 hours before a shutdown would begin. Even some Republicans said privately that they thought Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had an advantage because of the timing.

If so, the House Republican members would have a choice to make. Do they cause a shutdown or come away empty-handed from their latest battle with Obama? Keep in mind that several Republican members are supported by the anti-government tea party.

"We will not shut the government down," said Kevin McCarthy of California. He is the No. 3 Republican in the House. Republicans will bargain "a little longer" if they need to, he said. He did not explain what he meant.

He suggested the House would "get back together in enough time" and send the Senate another possible law to pay for the government. It would have different ideas for the Senate to look at, he said.

## Fight Over Obamacare Goes On And On

Republicans claim the law was costing jobs and driving up costs.

"The American people overwhelmingly reject Obamacare," said Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas. "They understand it's not working. The only people who aren't listening to the argument are the career politicians in Washington."

Obama has said he won't let the law be stripped. It is one of his biggest achievements. Democrats say Republicans are stuck on trying to attack the law.

Republicans have criticized rules put on insurers. But the House bill did contain new wins for Democrats.

Republicans said their measure would leave in place most parts of the law that have taken effect. Those include making insurance companies let people with medical problems buy insurance. They would also have to let children up to age 26 stay on the parents' insurance. Insurance lets people pay money ahead of time to make sure that they have health care.

But it would delay a rule that says people would have to pay a fine if they did not buy insurance. It would also delay the opening of marketplaces that would sell insurance. The marketplaces are supposed to start working this Tuesday.
