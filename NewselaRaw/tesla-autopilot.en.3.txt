DETROIT, Mich. â€” Tesla Motors is trying to build a car that drives itself. Now it has just taken a big step forward. It has figured out a way to make cars change lanes by themselves.

The company announced the news on Oct. 14.

Automobiles that drive themselves are run by autopilot systems. Car computers give directions to the wheels and engine. Such directions let the car drive or pilot itself. The way the computer and the car's parts work together is called a system.

##Outsmarting The Other Smart Cars

Mercedes, Audi and Volvo are other large car makers. They have also been working on cars that drive themselves. Each has its own autopilot system.

Tesla's new system does everything that those other systems can.

It keeps a car within its lane. It makes sure a car stays a safe distance from the car in front of it.

The Tesla system also lets a car park itself. It can warn drivers when the car is in danger of being hit from the side.

Only Tesla's new system lets cars change lanes on their own. Changing lanes is trickier than just staying in a lane. The car has to be smart enough to know when it is safe to change. If a car changes lanes at the wrong moment, it could hit another car.

Elon Musk is the head of Tesla. He says his company's new system will make driving completely different. He thinks drivers will be amazed.

## Keep Your Hands On The Wheel

Musk added that drivers still need to be careful. The system is still very new.

Drivers should keep their hands on the wheel at all times, Musk said. If something goes wrong, they will then be able to take over. The autopilot system will remind them if they forget to keep their hands on the wheel.

Musk said cars that can fully drive themselves will not be ready for around another three years. The government may take a couple of years more to find out if they are safe. Then they could be allowed on the road. In such cars, drivers will never need to take the wheel. Instead, they will simply be passengers. They will be able to just sit back and enjoy the ride.

## A Car That Comes When Called

Tesla is already working on something new, Musk said. It will allow a car to drive itself in and out of garages. The owner will be able to call the car when it is needed.

Karl Brauer is an automobile expert. He said Tesla's new system puts it ahead of other car companies. The other companies will now have to try to catch up.

Brauer said the car companies are all racing against each other. Each wants to be the first to make a car that can drive all on its own.

Brauer said the race will go on for a while. He thinks it will probably take another five to 10 years before cars will be able to drive completely on their own. Until then, drivers will have to take the wheel sometimes.

## Human Driver Versus Autopilot

Brauer worries that such quick changes in how cars work could be dangerous. Drivers may not understand what their car can do. If they are confused, they could make mistakes on the road.

Musk is not worried. He is sure that autopilot is a great idea.

It will still take some time to get everything just right, he said. Then, autopilot "will be safer than a person driving."
