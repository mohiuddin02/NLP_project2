PALM BEACH, Fla. — Early one Saturday in August 1992, South Floridians discovered they had 48 hours to get ready for Andrew, which is called one of the nation's most wicked hurricanes.

Oklahomans got all of 16 minutes before last week's tornado. And that was more time than most past twisters have allowed.

In a game of "choose your poison," Floridians debate which disaster they'd rather have.

Hurricanes have many cons: powerful winds, vicious storm surges and damage over a wider area. But "they're the one threat we can see coming," said Craig Fugate, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Fugate was Florida's emergency manager during 2004's series of storms.

## No Excuse For Not Being Prepared

That advantage makes it wrong to not prepare, Fugate told the National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans in March. Yet studies show that two in three Florida residents aren't ready.  That's even with hurricane season starting on June 1.

Preparation helped only a little in Moore, Oklahoma, last Monday. Monday's tornado was an EF5. EF is short for Enhanced Fujita Scale, which measure's a tornado's wind speed and damage. The scale ranges from 1 to 5. A 5 is the most powerful. Winds in the Moore tornado topped 200 to 210 miles per hour, and it was 1.3 miles wide. It was tracked on the ground for 50 minutes and its damage zone was more than 17 miles wide.

Oklahoma's insurance commissioner has said damages could top those from last year's Missouri tornado. That storm caused about $2 billion in damages.

Tornadoes cover a smaller area than hurricanes, and last just minutes. Last Monday's twister traveled 17 miles. A tornado of EF2 or more — winds of 111 to 165 miles per hour — can destroy a structure in four seconds. But only one in four tornadoes have wind speeds at 110 mph or greater. That speed would be a major hurricane.

Hurricanes can be hundreds of miles across. And they can plow across thousands of miles for days before dying. Even minor problems such as power outages often cover a vastly larger area. Wilma in 2005 knocked out power for weeks for 6 million households from Orlando south to Florida's tip.

Emergency responders must then face a sea of people who want immediate help.

Bill Johnson is an emergency manager in Palm Beach County. He says it's important for people to have everything they need to survive for three to five days.

Tornadoes are wind storms, and there can be very different effects from those winds.

Damage at 111 mph is 21 times what it would be at 75 mph, a minimum-strength hurricane. This is according to a chart by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

At 155 mph, the damage is multiplied by 333. At 190 mph, it's multiplied 1,696 times. Last Monday's tornado topped that level, if only for seconds.

Tornadoes can do vast damage in a short time. However, hurricanes last longer and have many ways to damage lives and property.

## Killer Winds

Hurricane winds can range to a top-end of 155 miles per hour and can last for hours. As a result, they usually cause more property damage than deaths.

The strongest winds of Hurricane Frances stayed in Florida's Treasure Coast on the Atlantic Ocean. Only a tiny corner of Palm Beach County experienced hurricane-force gusts. But the storm pounded that area for two days, and did as much damage as a stronger, shorter storm.

Andrew, one of only three Category 5 storms to strike the U.S. mainland, had top sustained winds of 165 miles per hour. As many as 500,000 people felt hurricane-force winds. Because people took precautions, only 15 died in South Florida. Category 5 is the strongest hurricane.

## Rains Lead To Flooding

A slow-moving hurricane can produce much more rainfall than a swifter, stronger one. Andrew's rainfall topped out at 8 inches. Isaac was hundreds of miles out in the Gulf of Mexico last year. Yet, it dropped as much as 17 inches of rain on parts of Florida. Twisters can be associated with heavy rain, but don't directly figure into rainfall or flooding.

A storm surge is considered a hurricane's most dangerous aspect. It generally features a rising tide and breaking waves, that can start hours before the storm. It can flood buildings and drown people miles inland.

Hurricanes can create tornadoes. Twisters typically form on the edges of hurricanes.  They mostly form in or ahead of the storm's most powerful part — its front right section.

In 1988, Hurricane Gilbert's eye passed into Mexico. But it produced 41 tornadoes in Texas. Several hit San Antonio, about 350 miles from landfall.

Small storms can produce tornadoes as often as large ones. In 2008, Tropical Storm Fay spun off a tornado. The twister nearly flattened a horse center in Wellington, Florida.

But a high-end tornado might not create as much damage if it reached Florida.

"In Florida, the homes are built to be wind resistant," said Remington Brown, a home safety expert. He said homes in the Midwest are less so.

Buildings in Florida are built to withstand winds of up to 140 miles per hour. Yet, those in the Midwest might be built for 90 mph, Brown said.
