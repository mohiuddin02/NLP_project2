UNITED NATIONS — In a major speech at the United Nations on Wednesday, President Barack Obama defended recent U.S. bombings in Iraq and Syria aimed at the extremist group Islamic State (ISIL). He called on world leaders to help fight violent groups around the world, asking them to "choose hope over fear."

The militant group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

ISIL wants to take over land in the Middle East and create a strict religious government. The group has already taken control of land in Iraq and Syria.

At the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Obama told leaders that Iraqis and Syrians are fighting to save their communities, and they need help.

He explained the need for the recent bombings against the militant group.

"There can be no reasoning — no negotiation — with this brand of evil," Obama said. "The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. The United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death."

## Pledges To Help Fight Ebola

In the speech, Obama emphasized cooperation, not conquest. He criticized governments that have acted aggressively, singling out Russia. Russia is supporting rebels in Ukraine, and seems to want part of Ukraine to become part of Russia.

Obama said the U.S. would support democracy in Ukraine and support other NATO allies. NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was formed in 1949 by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries to fight the threat of the Soviet Union, now Russia.

Obama also pledged U.S. help to stop the outbreak of the Ebola virus that has infected thousands of people in West Africa, and killed 2,600 of them.

Most of the speech, though, was dedicated to events in the Middle East. Obama discussed recent global conflicts there, as well as U.S. airstrikes during the past two days. The Pentagon announced that it had bombed eight ISIL vehicles in Syria near the border with Iraq, and carried out bombings near Baghdad in Iraq.

Videos from Syrian social media showed civilians looking through the rubble of destroyed houses. According to Syrian activists, some civilians had been killed in the bombings.

Still, Obama called for toughness at the U.N. The world must face "religiously motivated fanatics" and identify the trends that create these fanatics, he said.

## Stopping The Spread Of Extremists

In the past, Obama has blamed many problems in the Middle East on the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.

In this speech, Obama had a different focus. He emphasized that Muslim community leaders have a responsibility to fight the extreme views of groups like ISIL and al-Qaida, the group responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S.

It's important to stop these extreme views from spreading further into the Middle East and North Africa, Obama said. He said poverty in those countries may make it easier to recruit angry young men.

"No children anywhere should be educated to hate other people," Obama said. The civilized countries of the world must destroy war at its source: young people being taught to hate and kill, he added.

After the speech, Obama planned to meet with the U.N. Security Council to discuss foreign fighters, young men who leave their countries to fight with ISIL and similar groups. Obama wants tougher penalties and more restrictions on foreign fighters.

## "Our Military Might"

The U.S. government did not ask the U.N. for permission to bomb in Syria. It is likely that Russia would have blocked the U.S. proposal.

Instead, Obama explained why the U.S. was allowed to bomb in Syria, even without the permission of the U.N. Iraq is facing a direct threat from fighters in Syria, he said, and Iraq has asked the U.S. for help.

A year ago, Obama was at the U.N. talking about Syria. At that time, he saw hope because Syrian President Bashar Assad had agreed to give up his chemical weapons. Obama hoped the agreement would lead to "a political settlement within Syria."

Now, a year later, Obama is explaining why the U.S. military is bombing in Syria.

"We will use our military might to roll back ISIL," Obama said. "We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground. We will work to cut off their financing, and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region."

He added, "Those who have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they can. Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find they are increasingly alone. We will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build — not those who destroy."
