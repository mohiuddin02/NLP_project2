They used just their hands and feet to reach the top of El Capitan. The 3,000-foot-high rock formation is in Yosemite National Park in California.

Their path up El Capitan's Dawn Face was nearly straight up. No one had ever dared to try the path before.

Down below, hundreds of people were watching. They screamed as climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson pulled themselves up to the top.

"It has been such a part of our lives, I miss it already," said Mike Caldwell. He is Tommy's father.

## Study, Plan And Train

"I'm shaking," added Jorgeson's mother, Gaelena. She left home at 5 a.m. to reach Yosemite to see her son. Their route — 3,000 feet nearly straight up — is considered the world's most difficult free climb. In a free climb, climbers use only their hands and feet. They are attached to safety ropes in case they fall.

It took the climbers seven years to achieve their dream.

They failed again in 2011 when Jorgeson broke his ankle. On Wednesday, Jorgeson fell on the first section of the day's climb, slowing them down.

Their families have watched them study, plan and train for years.

Caldwell has been climbing these rocks much of his life. His father took him up one of El Capitan's 100 routes as a kid. His father called Wednesday's feat "the next level in a video game."

## Thousands Follow Online

People around the world have watched the climb. Thousands followed it online. The White House even tweeted a picture of President Barack Obama in front of a painting of Yosemite. In the tweet, Obama said, "You remind us that anything is possible."

Caldwell and Jorgeson began the journey up El Capitan on Dec. 27. They spent nights in tents attached to the rock. The tents hung 1,200 feet above the valley floor. The men kept climbing even after falls, little sleep and bloody fingers.

Before Caldwell, no one ever thought to free climb the Dawn Face wall. People thought it was impossible. The Dawn Face got its name because it catches the first sun rays in the morning.

The Dawn Face has little for a climber to grab on to. It was climbed in 1970, but the climbers used more tools.

## Climbing Since Childhood

Caldwell grew up in the shadow of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. He began climbing at 3 with his dad. After winning a climbing contest at 17 years old, he became a professional climber.

Jorgeson also climbed as a child. He trained at an indoor climbing gym in California. Jorgeson is known as one of the world's top boulder climbers. He runs up rocks that are 400 feet tall. He uses a lot of energy but he doesn't use any rope.

Caldwell's love of climbing is inspiring younger climbers. His 9-year-old nephew is named Grant Van Nieuwenhuyzen. Grant looked up at El Capitan just before his uncle reached the top. "I'll try that," he said,

Jorgeson hopes their climb helps other people follow their dreams, too.

"I think everyone has their own secret Dawn Wall to complete one day," he said.
