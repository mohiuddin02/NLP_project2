CHICAGO, Ill. — In the town of Mount Prospect, Illinois, hundreds of students at Prospect High School set aside their smartphones and tablets in favor of the glossy pages in their high school yearbooks.

"With social media, the pictures and messages we post kind of go up, and then they go away," said senior Caroline Chengary, 18, editor-in-chief of the 2015 Prospect yearbook Crest.

"I always loved looking at my mom's old high school yearbooks. … It's the one tangible thing from high school that you can keep with you, and look back at when you're older," she said.

## "To Feel The Book In Your Hand"

Today, teenagers are tied to technology and some rarely open traditional, hardcover books. Yet students, teachers and industry experts say high school yearbooks remain surprisingly popular among students.

Printed products have continued their downward spiral as improvements in technology allow for more materials to be digitized. Despite this decline, yearbook sales have held steady for the past five years. According to a 2014 report from IBIS world, a business research company, these steady sales are due to an increase in student enrollment at schools.

Kevin Miller is the vice president of Lifetouch, a chain of portrait studios that also produces yearbooks. He said that his company had tried making digital yearbooks, but decided against them. "We've found that there's something very central to people looking through a hard-copy yearbook, to actually feel the book in your hand."

He added, "With a high school yearbook, all you need to look at it are your two human eyes, and that will stay the same 100 years from now."

## There's An App To Tag Print Photos

That is not to say that the high school yearbook hasn't evolved.

Murad Velani is the chief operating officer at Jostens, a Minneapolis company that has published yearbooks for 65 years. He said that some high schools are even incorporating a digital technology known as "augmented reality" into their hard-copy yearbooks.

The technology uses an app to tag print photos with digital links to videos of special events, like a prom or a winning football game.

Still, Velani thinks that many high school students prefer the traditional style of yearbooks.

"Facebook and other kinds of social media have their place, but the messages are just fleeting moments in time," Velani said.

## A Yearbook With All That Jazz

Pete Macabobby, the yearbook adviser at Wheaton Warrenville South High School in Chicago, said 1,300 yearbooks were sold to students this year for $50 apiece.

"We sell a yearbook to more than half of the students enrolled here, and sales have picked up a bit in recent years," Macabobby said. His school's yearbook, Tigris, is produced by 10 students who are members of the yearbook club.

"We looked into using some video clips, but it's almost a novelty with the kids to have a high school yearbook that's permanent and old-fashioned," Macabobby said. "I also sense a trend that there's starting to be a bit of backlash from students who don't want to be too plugged in. … The kids seem to have a desire to dwell on things a little bit more."

At New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, yearbook adviser Kevin Bond said the spring tradition of distributing the yearbook, Trevia, includes a celebration for seniors: a jazz band performing while students gather to write in each other's yearbooks.

"Our yearbook sales are as strong as they've ever been," Bond said. "Students tweet, text and Snapchat, but they see that as a very temporary thing. When it comes to reading, many kids I talk to overwhelmingly prefer a real book in paper, which is so different from all their media experiences."

At Prospect High, junior Brady Schwartz was all smiles as he picked up his yearbook. "It's always exciting to see your pictures in the yearbook," he said. "And when the yearbooks are handed out, you know it's that much closer to the end of the school year."
