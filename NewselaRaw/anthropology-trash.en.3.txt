NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” Robin Nagle studies garbage. She often rides around on New York City garbage trucks and looks at the things people throw out. Nagle tries to figure out how people live from their garbage.

New York City's garbage collection department calls her its anthropologist-in-residence, because she is allowed to go on garbage collections to study people's trash. As an anthropologist, she studies how people live. Nagle is also a college professor.

"What does trash tell you about us?" she asks.

She goes out on trucks with garbage-collection crews in search of an answer.

## Good Stuff For Garbage Pickers

New York is the largest city in the United States. Its 8.5 million people throw out almost 3.5 million tons of trash each year.

What does she learn from this trash?

New Yorkers tend to treat just about everything as something to throw out, she says. Furniture, electronics and clothing are all put in the trash, Nagle says.

People in New York think that they do not need to "waste time" taking care of everyday objects. They can just get rid of them, she said.

The city's apartments are also mostly small. People are constantly tossing out stuff to make more space. Nagle says the trash is a gold mine for garbage pickers.

Many New Yorkers furnish their homes with other people's garbage. Some dig for food that has never been cooked. They look for things like bagels, rice and pasta. Meanwhile, a person's closet could be filled with rejected clothing, shoes and jewelry. People also grab sofas, beds and even paintings that have been thrown out.

The amount that New Yorkers throw out is "dazzling," Nagle says. The quality is also very good, she says.

## From Divorce To Diapers

Garbage workers get to know the people on their route from their garbage. If a marriage breaks up, they might find photos of the ex-wife or husband in the trash. If someone has had a drinking problem, there are empty bottles. Disposable diapers appear when babies arrive.

Nagle kept asking sanitation officials for two years to be named anthropologist-in-residence. They gave her the job in 2006. She does not get paid. Her studies have led her to write several books. Nagle also teaches a class at New York University called "Garbage in Gotham," using a nickname for New York. She is even trying to get companies to use more recyclable materials.

## Heroes With Dirty Hands

Nagle got her hands dirty, too. She went through the training to become a garbage collector. Nagle learned to drive the trucks. She worked for almost a year as a regular paid sanitation worker.

"She's part of the family," says Keith Mellis, the sanitation department's assistant chief.

Her biggest contribution is in making garbage collectors feel better about a job that is often overlooked. The city has 6,400 sanitation workers. Nagle talks with new trash collectors. She tells them they should be proud of what they do. The department clears streets of the garbage that would otherwise attract rats and cause disease, she says.

"I get to work with people who make a difference every single day," Nagle says.

Elliot Belnavis is a new trash collector. He says that while members of the police and fire departments are treated as heroes, "we're invisible." Nagle's talk with Belnavis about his new job gave him a greater appreciation of it, he says.

"I now definitely feel like sanitation workers are the most important workers that we have in this city," Belnavis says.
