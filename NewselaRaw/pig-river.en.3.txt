DONGHUI VILLAGE, China â€” The pig farmer was not in a good mood. The man stood in front of barns that hold more than 500 pigs. He said he has been losing money. The price of pork keeps falling. But the costs of feed and other supplies are going up.

Some of his pigs started dying early this year. There was a series of temperature swings and rains. He had little choice but to throw them out. Before, farmers in the area would have sold them to dealers. The dealers bought dead pigs, even ones with diseases. The dealers illegally sold them again for people to eat. But late last year, the government began cracking down.

"We had no place to put them. We can't sell them anymore. If we do we will be punished," said Wang, 43. "So there's nothing we could do but dump them secretly."

The results were as spectacular as they were sickening. More than 14,000 pig bodies were found floating in the Huangpu River in March. The pigs were rotting in the water. The Huangpu River is a major source of drinking water for Shanghai. That city is home to more than 20 million people.

## Dream And Reality

China's President Xi Jinping, has spoken about working toward a "Chinese Dream." He talks about a great renewal of the country. But the dead pigs scandal shows the distance between those dreams and the grim parts of life in China.

Last week, a group of tall, slim models could be seen getting ready for a fashion show. They were gathered near the banks of the Huangpu. But it was different upriver. In the pig farming communities outside Shanghai, the challenges that come with China's fast growth were harder to ignore.

## A Lot Of Dead Pigs

In Donghui, a village near Shanghai, farmers spoke of their need for more money and information. Going broke is a constant worry. Locals say the decision to sell dead pigs to shady brokers was easy. They knew it could mean dangerous meat making its way to the dinner table. But they took the risk anyway.

China has had a lot of problems with food safety. Officials tried to fix the problem by rounding up the illegal meat dealers. But that solution just caused another problem. Farmers were left with a lot of dead pigs. What could they do?

Zhulin is a village more than an hour from Shanghai. State media has identified it as a trouble spot for pig deaths. One farmer there complained, "When there's disease we don't understand what's going on, and they (officials) don't tell us which vaccines to use."

The man had pulled up on a black scooter in front of a small livestock dumping station next to a trash shed. The station was an open-air space with a slanted roof. It was slapped together by the government, according to the farmer, but only after the public outcry about the floating pigs.

When pigs began showing up in the Huangpu River, the public started to question the official explanations. The chief government veterinarian said, "Water in the Huangpu River, where a great number of dead pigs were found, meets national standards for drinking water."

One blogger wrote, "I suggest the leaders fill a bowl with that water, and finish it." Many other people felt the same way.

## Who Is To Blame?

Official media tried to pass the blame. The state TV station showed an interview with Pan Huimin. He is a former dead-pig dealer from Zhulin. Pan said that all of the dead pigs showing up were "100 percent" linked to the pressure on him and other dealers. But it was not clear how Pan could be so sure. He had been in jail before the floating pigs came to light.

In Zhulin, Pan's relatives had a reason for why he had gotten mixed up in that line of work. His wife, Hang Yaqin, hiked up her T-shirt. She unwrapped a strap of gauze and pointed to a tube. She explained she had received a kidney transplant in December 2010.

Hang said the new organ did not cure her. Lots of expensive medicine followed. The family had to borrow more and more money. There was simply nothing else to do, she said.

"We just didn't have the money," said Hang, 45. "If we had the money, who would ever get into this sort of business?"
