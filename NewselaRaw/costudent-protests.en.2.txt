DENVER â€” On Wednesday in suburban Denver, around 1,000 high school students participated in what was the largest yet in a series of student demonstrations. They were protesting to oppose a new set of high school history standards. The standards would focus class material on topics that promote patriotism and respect for authority, while discouraging civil disorder.

They had recently been proposed by the area's school board.

Most of the young protesters gathered at a busy intersection. They chanted "Education without limitation!" and waved signs and American flags.

The afternoon demonstration lasted about three hours, authorities said.

Later, about 75 students from Alameda International High School walked out after meeting with Jefferson County School Superintendent Dan McMinimee. They had met to discuss the proposed standards.

## Whose Standards Are They?

The standards the students object to were proposed by Jefferson County school board member Julie Williams. She is a conservative, meaning that she supports traditional attitudes and values. Many conservatives believe some school textbooks are too critical of America. They believe that reading such material will change students' thinking and lead to rebelliousness and loss of pride in their country.

Williams' proposal comes in response to a change in how history is taught in schools across the country. The Advanced Placement (AP) history test, which is given nationally, has changed its focus. In response, classes that prepare students to take the test must also change the kind of readings that are assigned.

Supporters of the new approach to AP history say it will lead to a more balanced view. Both sides of the story should be heard, they say, and honesty about our country's flaws and mistakes is a good thing. Critics of the approach fear it would place too much emphasis on the nation's problems.

Under Williams' plan, a committee would review all texts and coursework, starting with AP history. The committee would attempt to make sure that classroom materials "promote citizenship, patriotism" and "respect for authority." It would also seek to ensure that materials do not encourage or accept "civil disorder, social strife or disregard of the law."

## Students' Lesson In Peaceful Protesting

The district has not tried to stop the students' own form of civil disobedience and the young demonstrators have not been punished. "We're going to allow students to make their concerns heard," district spokeswoman Lynn Setzer said.

School officials have been sent to watch over the demonstrations to make sure students stay safe, she said.

At the large afternoon protest, students peacefully gathered as police and school officials looked on. The majority of the students came from one of two high schools, either Chatfield or Dakota Ridge.

"There are kids here" just to skip class, student organizer Scott Romano said, "but the majority of us are out here for the right reasons."

## Waves Of Walkouts

The protests began Friday with an action organized by teachers upset over the plan and other issues. Teachers staged a so-called "sick out" by taking sick days at the same time, causing two schools to shut down.

Students began walking out of classes in waves on Monday, an action organized largely through social media like Facebook and Twitter. Hundreds of students from at least six area schools have participated so far.

The dozens of students who left Alameda International High School in Lakewood asked McMinimee about the school board plan and teacher concerns including pay. McMinimee said he was worried that students have not been fully informed.

"I think sometimes, as a student," he said, when "you hear what is going on, you don't necessarily have the whole picture."
