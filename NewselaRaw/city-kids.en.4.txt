SEATTLE  â€” Parents with children have one big choice when it comes to where to live: the city or the suburbs.

The suburbs have more space and peace and quiet. Houses have backyards, parks nearby and good schools.

The cities have more people, more things to do, more culture.

In the past, many families moved to the suburbs. Now, that may be slowly changing. More young parents are staying in the city. These parents are pushing cities to become more family-friendly. Seattle, Minneapolis and Denver are three cities where parents are pushing for changes.

## Wish List: Schools And Playgrounds

Parents want cities to have more schools and playgrounds. They also want cheaper homes for families.

Jenny Kelly and her husband Michael moved to Seattle when they were almost 30 years old. They lived downtown, in the city center. They stayed when they had a child. Now, both parents walk to work from their apartment. In their small apartment, the laundry room is also the baby's bedroom.

The city had more benefits than the suburbs, said Jenny Kelly, age 32.

In 2013 Kelly helped start a parents group called Parents for a Better Downtown Seattle. The group has asked for a public school downtown and a playground near the city's water.

Some cities are making changes to meet families' needs. Portland, Oregon, changed the rules to allow apartments with courtyards where kids can play. Baltimore has promised to add 10,000 families to its city.

For many years, Seattle has been known as a city with very few kids. In the 1960s and 1970s, families moved to the suburbs. The number of children in the city center dropped. Today, Seattle has fewer children than many other parts of the country. Still, it's holding on to the kids it has.

Some cities have fewer kids now. But in Seattle, the number of kids is going up.

Jon Scholes runs the Downtown Seattle Association. He said many parents used to stay in downtown Seattle until their kids were age 5. Then many would leave. Today, many parents are staying longer, he said. Schools and parks matter, he added.

## Good-bye Yard, Hello Sidewalks

Melissa and Aaron Whitney made the move to Minneapolis, Minnesota. They sold their large house in the suburbs. Then they bought a small apartment in the city.

"We thought once we got married, we had to buy a house in the suburbs," said Aaron Whitney, age 40.

So they bought the house. Then the Whitneys realized they didn't like it. They didn't enjoy fixing their home or working on their yard. They often went downtown to have fun. Eventually they moved to downtown Minneapolis with their son, who is now 2 years old.

The Whitneys said they would like to see more parks. They also want cheaper housing in the city. They are keeping an eye on a new school opening in downtown in the fall.

Lindsey Carillo is 31 years old. She grew up in a suburb but wanted her kids to know what life in the city was like. "It gives them a different way of living," Carillo said. She has two kids. One is 8 years old, the other is a 1-year-old.

Her family of four people shares an apartment in a tall building in downtown Seattle. Sometimes her son wishes it had a back yard and that he could walk to school.

Still, she says, "he loves to show off where we live."
