FERGUSON, Mo. — The hungry crowd had traveled far for their Thanksgiving meal.

Some were hundreds or thousands of miles from home, but inside this St. Louis-area church it seemed like a family dinner. Most of the people didn't know each other until three months ago. Now, they were united by both their outrage over the shooting of an unarmed black teen by a white police offer, and their thankfulness for Cat Daniels, who has fed them since August.

They call her "Momma Cat." She has been serving Sunday meals to demonstrators outside the Ferguson Police Department nearly every week since Michael Brown was killed by Officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9.

Daniels, 53, who lives in nearby Florissant, has tried to calm the scene with plates of food. "Momma Cat does have quite a bit of influence," said Pastor Henry Logan, a Ferguson activist who has been working with Daniels since August. "She does it one meal at a time."

## A Quiet Holiday

After months of protests, sometimes violent, the city of Ferguson seemed to take a deep breath on Thanksgiving

The fires that erupted last Monday after a grand jury declined to indict, or charge, Wilson were gone. The holiday was cold and quiet — at least for a few hours.

"It's a day to breathe, to love one another, to share and give thanks for what we have and what we will have," said Daniels. She was surrounded by fried turkey, collard greens and other dishes she spent a sleepless night cooking.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon shared Thanksgiving dinner with National Guard troops after sending more than 2,000 soldiers to keep the city safe. West Florissant Avenue, where rioters looted and burned stores after Monday's grand jury decision, was still under guard. "I would ask Missourians to join me in thanking these officers and guardsmen as they spend time away from their families this Thanksgiving weekend," Nixon said.

Members of the group Veterans For Peace, some who joined the protests, looked beyond the Brown shooting. They attended a fundraiser to help provide meals for poor St. Louis schoolchildren.

Momma Cat said she wanted to find a way to join the national discussion about race and police following Brown's death. She was moved to aid in the demonstrations by what she sees as the deep-rooted mistreatment of black people by police in St. Louis County.

## "A Healing Power"

A frequent presence at rallies, Daniels does as much marching as she can. Sitting in her living room in Florissant, holding a sore knee, her voice is hoarse from chanting. She was outside the Ferguson Police Department headquarters Monday and held her phone high, live-streaming the announcement for the crowd to hear, but left before the violence began.

"I can't sit down. I have to be on the right side of history. But it's not my fight these days. ... This is you guys' fight, your age group, the young people," Daniels said of the younger generation. "It's our duty, it's our role, to have your back. Make sure that you guys are going about it the right way."

To do that, Daniels turned to one thing she believes can unite any group of people, regardless of what they think or where they come from.

"Food has a healing power," said Daniels, who punctuated most sentences with a smile or a knowing laugh. "Food can heal your soul."

Most Sundays since August, Daniels has been behind a row of warming dishes and cooking pans along a buffet-style line. She has dished out food and advice to anyone who walks up to the parking lot across from the police station.

At first, Daniels paid for most of the food out of her pocket. As the weeks wore on, she accepted donations from the dozens of activists she feeds each week.

Daniels says she has been cooking from a young age. She has been attending classes at the Culinary Institute of St. Louis and cooks meals for doctors at DePaul Health Center in St. Louis.

Daniels says her passion is cake design, but she serves up Southern-style comfort food on Sundays. Police officers have yet to walk across the street for a meal, Daniels said, but if anyone with a badge and gun joins the buffet line she'll gladly fix them a plate.

## A Chef And Friend

A great-grandmother, Daniels has been a mother, therapist, chef and friend to demonstrators who traveled to Ferguson from around the country.

"She's definitely one of the mother hens," said Biko Baker, a demonstrator from Milwaukee. "When you've got 35- and 40-year-old people calling you Momma, you've done something."

Baker said the Thanksgiving dinner served at St. Luke's AME Church came at a crucial time for the demonstrators. "Right now, given the extreme fear and exhaustion that exists in the activist community, Momma Cat gives us an opportunity for people to come together and heal," Baker said.

Before she became one of the protesters' main chefs and counselors, Daniels and her husband were considering selling their house. They wanted to move away from the area considered fiercely divided along racial and economic lines, but after Brown's death, Daniels knew she had to do something.

Maybe she didn't belong on the front lines, but she could at least keep the front lines fed.

"I'm not a professional protester. I'm not an activist," Daniels said. "We had to get active. We had to say, that's enough."
