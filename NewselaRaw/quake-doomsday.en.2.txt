PORTLAND, Ore. — Military helicopters ferry search and rescue teams over the Pacific Northwest. Below them are scenes of devastation from a giant earthquake that could strike the area at any time.

Tsunami waters surge through coastal communities. Buildings, bridges and roads lie in ruins. Fires burn out of control. Survivors are stranded on rooftops, cling to floating debris or are trapped inside wrecked buildings.

Scientists fear the possibility of such scenes and say a great crack in the 650-mile-long offshore fault running from Northern California to British Columbia and the tsunami that follows could come in our lifetime. Emergency officials are busy preparing for the worst.

Federal, state and military agencies are working together to plan for when the "Big One" happens.

## Disaster Effort Could Be Biggest Ever

These plans reflect the deep concern about the looming disaster: the possibility of 14,000 people dead, 30,000 injured, thousands left homeless and businesses and jobs lost for years.

The planners see the deployment of civilian and military people and equipment that would be greater than any response to any natural disaster that has occurred in the U.S.

"The response will be greater than that for Hurricane Katrina or Super Storm Sandy," said Lt. Col. Clayton Braun of the Washington State Army National Guard.

Since 2013, Braun has led a team working on a military response plan for Washington state. The plan will be coordinated with other government agencies.

## Tens Of Thousands Of Helpers On Call

There would be waves of cargo planes, helicopters and ships. Tens of thousands of soldiers, mortuary teams, police officers, firefighters, engineers and medical workers would be called in.

Oregon's response plan is called the Cascadia Playbook, named after the threatening offshore fault. Last year it was handed out so the state can respond quickly when disaster strikes.

"That playbook is never more than 100 feet from where I am," said Andrew Phelps, director of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management. When he goes out to dinner, he keeps the playbook in his car.

A measured 9.0 earthquake and tsunami devastated parts of Japan in 2011\. The same thing can happen in the Pacific Northwest. Scientists say there is a 10 to 14 percent chance that a magnitude 9.0 earthquake could hit the Pacific Northwest in the next 50 years.

"The Japanese quake and tsunami allowed light bulbs to go off for policymakers," Phelps said.

## Planes, Helicopters, Ships Needed

Emergency planners and military officials have been meeting to plan ways to save lives and speed recovery. 

While it is impossible to fully prepare for a catastrophe of this size, planners are making headway.

The plans call for action levels to deliver people, gear and supplies into the devastated region.

Large cargo planes would land at airports or air bases capable of handling them. Smaller aircraft would be used to get workers and supplies to smaller airfields close to devastated areas.

Helicopters would play a major role, especially in coastal communities, isolated by destroyed bridges and roads. Ships would likely be needed to assist with the delivery of emergency supplies and to assist with the injured and homeless.

## Hospitals, Shelters To Be Set Up

Emergency hospitals would be set up because those on the coast would probably be too damaged to use. Collection points for bodies would be created. Hotels, motels, college dorms, sports arenas and government buildings would be used as temporary shelters.

Military and civilian engineers would be sent in to begin repairing an infrastructure that could be shattered in the most populated areas. 

People predict that more than 1,000 bridges in Oregon and Washington state could either collapse or be so damaged that they would be unusable.

The main coastal highway, U.S. Route 101, would be damaged by the shaking and from the tsunami. Traffic on Interstate 5 — one of the most important highways in the nation — would likely have to be rerouted because of large cracks in the pavement.

## Seattle, Portland Face Major Damage

Base camps would be set up for emergency workers coming in from across the country. There would be distribution centers for critical supplies such as water, food, tents, blankets and medical supplies.

Water purification systems and emergency communications units would be brought in.

Seattle, Portland and other cities could suffer considerable damage. Buildings built before codes were updated would collapse in a mega-quake. City search and rescue teams would be sent to look for survivors in the ruins of destroyed buildings.

Phelps said he has learned to live with the threat of an earthquake from the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Still, he said, "it's a little unsettling to know that in five minutes I might have to grab that playbook and call the governor."
