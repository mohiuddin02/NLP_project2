MILWAUKEE — A priceless 300-year-old Stradivarius violin was stolen after a performance last Monday.

Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra lead violinist Frank Almond was robbed by a man with a stun gun. Almond had just finished performing at the Wisconsin Lutheran College. Shortly before 10:30 p.m., he was attacked in a parking lot behind the college, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Tuesday.

Flynn said the violin was worth millions of dollars.

As Almond lay on the cement, the robber escaped to a nearby minivan, Flynn said. The escape vehicle then left the scene. It was driven by someone other than the attacker.

Investigators believe the instrument was the target of the robbery, Flynn said. The violin is known in musical circles as the Lipinski Stradivarius.

## Violin Made in 1715

Stradivarius violins are among the world's most famous and expensive. Built by Antonio Stradivari during the late 1600s and early 1700s, they have been played by some of the world's greatest violinists.

The Stradivarius that Almond played was crafted in Italy in 1715. It has a unique pattern on its back, the chief said.

Chicago violin seller Stefan Hersh said the Lipinski violin was worth about the same amount as another Stradivarius. That other violin sold for more than $3.5 million in 2006.

Chief Flynn described the violin taken in the robbery as "priceless." He said its value could only be appreciated by a very small population.

"It can't be easily sold for even a fraction of its value," he said. "These are wildly valuable to a tiny slice of the art world."

Police have not ruled out that the robbery was an unplanned street crime. Yet, they are working with investigators with the FBI's art crimes team, which specializes in high-end art thefts. The International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol, has also been notified, Flynn said.

## An International Art Crime?

"This is a potentially international crime," Flynn said. Investigators are searching everywhere from pawn shops — where people sell rare objects — to online listings around the world.

 Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra president Mark Niehaus said Almond was recovering from the attack. He would not be on stage this weekend.

The instrument was on long-term loan to Almond from its owners. It's not known who the owners are. Almond has described them as people with "strong ties to Milwaukee." It's common in the music world for the owners of famous instruments to loan them to only the greatest performers such as Almond.

The violin's early owners included the extremely talented Giuseppe Tartini (1692-1770). He's known to listeners for his "Devil's Trill Sonata." The instrument has also belonged to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski (1790-1861). That violinist's name has stayed attached to it.

Local music writer Elaine Schmidt held the instrument during a 2013 interview with Almond. She described it as "far lighter than one would expect, and an absolutely gorgeous example of craftsmanship."

During that 2013 interview, Almond explained that the Lipinski is "finicky" about temperature. The violin responds differently some days than others. If there's a lot of moisture in the air it may sound differently.

## "A Violin's Life"

"One of the really mysterious things about these instruments is that they really maximize our strengths if we can figure out how to play them," he said. Almond began playing the Lipinski in 2008. He found the way it produces sound to be different than one would expect. As the player adds more bow pressure to the strings, its sound tightens and narrows.

"It's like a high-performance car," he said. "You have to learn to drive it."

Almond has said that he was told the violin had been stored in a bank vault. The bank is just a short distance from where Almond was playing with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. He met the violin owners at the bank, and they asked him if he wanted to play it on loan. He said yes.

Niehaus said that because the violin is made of wood, "it needs to be touched, it needs to be played."

He added, "The vibrations of the music keep it alive."

Almond launched a Kickstarter project to pay for "A Violin's Life." The recording memorialized the history of the violin. The CD included music from the violin's owners throughout history.

In 2013, British police recovered a stolen 300-year-old Stradivarius. That violin had been missing for more than two years.
