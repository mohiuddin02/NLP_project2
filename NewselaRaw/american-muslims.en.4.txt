WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last month, gunmen launched terror attacks in Paris. It is the biggest city in France. A week after, Lena Badr Abdelhamid's husband sat her down. He warned her that police are looking for the man in charge of the attacks. The man has the same name as they do. Even the spelling of his name was the same.

## U.S. Muslims Frightened

Abdelhamid said that people may think she and the man are connected. She is worried someone may try to attack her. The only reason is that she and the man shared a name and a religion. They both believe in Islam. But she is peaceful. The attacker believed in a violent kind. Most Muslims are against that.

A group called the Islamic State attacked the people in Paris. It is a violent group. Its fighters are Muslim. Abdelhamid said that Muslims in America had nothing to do with the Paris attacks. She said they should not pay for the crimes of the Islamic State. It is creating its own violent form of Islam.

After the attacks, some people said terrible things about Muslims. It frightened Muslims in the United States. They are worried that people might harm them to get even. They wonder if they should be careful when they go outside. Some women think about taking off their headscarves. Some Muslim women wear the scarves out of modesty. 

Things have gotten even more scary for U.S. Muslims. A Muslim couple in California shot a lot of people. The couple died in a shootout with police.

## Crimes Against Muslims Are Up

The FBI is a part of the government. It looks into threats against Americans. The FBI said that crimes against Muslims are up. They grew from 135 in 2013, to 154 in 2014, the FBI said.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations is a Muslim group. It keeps track of attacks against Muslims. The group said people have attacked mosques. Muslims pray in mosques. One was set on fire. People also have written hateful things about Muslims on walls and on the Internet.

Muslims say they are grateful to some non-Muslims. They have sent messages of support. One of them is Jack Swanson. He is a child in Texas. A mosque in Texas was damaged. Jack was saving money for an iPad. But he gave the money from his piggy bank to help fix the mosque. A Muslim man sent Jack an iPad with a thank-you note. It read, "Love, The American Muslim Community."
