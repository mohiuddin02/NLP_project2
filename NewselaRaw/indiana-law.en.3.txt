INDIANAPOLIS â€” Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Tuesday that he wants state lawmakers to fix a new state law by the end of the week. The law is the state's religious-freedom law and it has made people angry. Pence wants lawmakers to make it clear that a new law does not allow unfair treatment of people who are gay.

Pence did defend the law. He said the law was meant to protect religious freedom. Still, he said he has been meeting with lawmakers "around the clock" to discuss concerns. Many people are worried that it would allow businesses to deny services to gay customers.

The governor said he does not believe that lawmakers mean to let people be treated unfairly with the law.

"It certainly wasn't my intent," said Pence. The governor signed the law last week.

But, the Republican governor said, he understood that some people thought the law was unfair. "We need to confront that," Pence said.

## "Done Enormous Harm"

The law prohibits the state from making new laws that make it difficult for a person to follow his or her religious beliefs. Religious institutions and businesses are treated as a "person" under the law.

The legal language does not specifically mention gays or lesbians. However, critics say the law is designed to protect businesses and individuals who do not want to serve people who are gay. Examples include people such as florists or caterers who might be hired for a wedding. Some florists or caterers might not believe in gay marriage.

Businesses and organizations including Apple and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) have voiced concern over the effect of the law. Some states will not let government money be used to pay for travel to Indiana.

The Indianapolis Star newspaper said Tuesday that the law needed to be changed.

The Star printed an opinion article. It was called "FIX THIS NOW." The article covered the newspaper's entire front page. It told lawmakers to pass a new law. The newspaper said the law must ban discrimination against a person who is attracted to someone of the same gender.

The newspaper says the arguments sparked by the law have "done enormous harm" to the state. It said the law could hurt business in the state in the future.

## Arkansas Law Like Indiana's

Meanwhile, Arkansas was ready to pass a law like Indiana's. The state was set to do this despite increasing criticism from businesses and gay-rights supporters.

The Arkansas proposal would stop state and local governments from making someone do anything that was against that person's religion without a "compelling" reason. Arkansas lawmakers also said they won't change their planned law.

"There's not really any place to make any changes now," said Republican Bob Ballinger of Hindsville, Arkansas. He proposed the law. "If there are questions in two years, we can fix it," he said.

Hundreds of protesters filled the Capitol in Arkansas to oppose the measure. They held signs that read "Discrimination is not a Christian Value."

Similar laws have been introduced in more than 12 states. Nineteen other states have laws like it already.

## Both Laws Criticized

Republican Asa Hutchinson is Arkansas' governor. He had said he was worried about accidental issues that could come up if the law passed. Since then, Hutchinson has said he would sign the current law.

Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola asked Hutchinson to not sign the law. He said it would hurt the state's efforts to bring in business. The proposed law "sends the message that some members of our community will have fewer protections than others," he said.

People against the law said that Hutchinson promised to bring jobs to the state when he ran for governor last year. One group has run advertisements in northern California. The ads are aimed at the same technology firms Hutchinson has said he wants to lure to Arkansas.

Tim Cook, who runs Apple, wrote in The Washington Post over the weekend. He is against the Arkansas and Indiana measures. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart has said the proposal sends the wrong message about its home state.

In Indiana, the reaction has included a planned women's conference in Indianapolis being canceled this year. Meanwhile, the band Wilco has canceled a May performance.
