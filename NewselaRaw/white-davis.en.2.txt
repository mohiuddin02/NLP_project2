SOCHI, Russia — Seventeen years ago, two ice skaters paired together.

Seventeen years ago, an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old were thrown together as an ice dance team, a pairing that irritated the younger member, Charlie White. He already had been doing it for six months. Meryl Davis was just starting. With her as a partner, he was back to dance Square One while she caught up — quickly.

Seventeen years during which Davis said there never was any doubt about whether they should stick it out.

Seventeen years leading to a physically and mentally demanding free dance. The routine left them looking as if they had spent 17 years of energy on four minutes of skating. They were unable to do anything but collapse into each other's arms when it was over Monday night at the Iceberg Skating Palace.

## Rivals And Friends

Seventeen years for the moment when the scores were announced. Seventeen years until two kids from Michigan realized all that work and time together was worth it. They became the first U.S. skating couple to win an Olympic gold medal.

"You dream of the opportunity, and being able to put in the work every day to make it happen is a tribute to our partnership," White said.

"We prepared ourselves so well for what we wanted to put onto the ice and focused so hard on that, we weren't really prepared for what might happen," Davis said.

Davis and White needed relentless effort to beat the 2010 Olympic champions, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada. The Canadian and American pairs had become not only fierce rivals. They also became friends during the 10 years they trained together under the same coaches in Michigan.

"The struggles, the rivalry, knowing if you're not perfect then you can forget about your dreams, with that constant striving for perfection, you have to look in the mirror and figure out every day what it is going to take to get there," White said. "You mature a lot quicker under that kind of pressure."

## "We're Linked Forever"

Virtue and Moir had been the first North American ice dancers to win Olympic gold. Both couples had become so good they would lose only to the other in the four years beginning with the Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. In those 2010 games, Davis and White were the silver medalists.

"We're linked forever," White said.

But he and Davis have separated themselves from the Canadians in the judges' eyes. The two Americans skated to music from "Scheherazade." The ballet is based on the Thousand And One Arabian Nights where a woman named Scheherazade must tell 1,001 stories to the sultan to avoid being killed. The U.S. couple continued a dominance over Moir and Virtue that has reached six competitions in a time span fast approaching the 1,001 nights in the story.

Davis and White won both the short and free dances with season bests. Their total score of 195.52 beat Virtue and Moir by 4.53 points.

"No athlete likes to sit in this position," Moir said, referring to second place, "but it is easier when you know how hard these guys worked."

Virtue and Moir have said this will be their last season as competitors, while Davis and White have made no decision. Both U.S. skaters have occasionally studied at the University of Michigan.

## Up And Coming Russian Pair

The next great dance team clearly is going to be Russians Elena Ilinykh and Nikita Katasalapov. They took third place with the most compelling free dance of the night. Their interpretation of "Swan Lake" was utterly ballet-like and seamless, full of poses and movements that made the arena feel like the famous Bolshoi Theater in Moscow.

The intense "Scheherazade" music was perfectly suited for Davis and White's power and athleticism. The most striking feature of the way they performed it was a feeling for tempo, their skating changes of pace matching the shifts in the music's speed. That is an understanding White said they had not developed until three years ago.

Virtue and Moir's free dance music was an unfortunate mash-up of Russian classical pieces cut and pasted in a confusing way. Even though they skated exceptionally well Monday, and they were supposed to be interpreting the turbulence of life, a sense of fragmentation prevailed.

Davis and White skated last. Two Russian couples had gone immediately before them, sending the crowd into its usual fit of nationalistic pride.

"The moments before we take the ice are difficult," White said. "It is probably the most nervous you will be in a lifetime."

Or at least in 17 years.
