WASHINGTON â€” A Malaysia Airlines jet went missing Saturday. The FBI is sending agents and technical experts to help investigate the disappearance.

The plane left from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, with 239 people aboard. It was heading to Beijing, China's capital. Air traffic control lost contact with the plane.

Three American citizens were aboard the lost flight. This fact allows the FBI to join the investigation, a top official in Washington said Saturday.

He said that a fourth passenger also may be a U.S citizen. The passenger was an infant flying with the three Americans.

Since Americans were on the plane, the FBI can help with the case, the official said. He had to be secretive because the FBI investigation is just beginning. "But so far what happened is a mystery," he said.

## Was It Terrorism?

U.S. officials said they are looking at whether this could be terrorism. Checking for signs of terrorism is normal in any plane crash. Two passengers apparently used stolen passports.

Passports are documents. People need them when they travel from one country to another. One official said stolen passports being used is not a sign of a terrorist attack.

The official said there was "no evidence" of terrorism so far.

The federal law enforcement official said FBI agents will assist the investigation. The agents will review video of the airport in Kuala Lumpur. They'll be looking for images of passengers at the ticket counter, the security sections and the area where people boarded the plane. He said images they find can be used with the FBI's vast technology. Video can be matched with photos of known members of al-Qaida or other terrorist groups.

But he made clear that no known terrorist link has surfaced. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for making the plane crash.

## Search-And-Rescue Operation

Vietnamese military aircraft participated in a search-and-rescue operation for the plane and its passengers. They spotted two oil slicks off the coast of southern Vietnam, the Associated Press reported. The slicks could be signs of a plane crash. But it hasn't been proven that they were from the missing jet.

The U.S. law enforcement official said that the government's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will probably be brought into the investigation. The jet was built by the company Boeing in the U.S. That could let the NTSB get involved.

The Department of Homeland Security is in charge of preventing terrorist attacks against the U.S. An official there said it would be a first if the plane was brought down by two terrorists who boarded the jet carrying stolen passports. "We've never seen that," he said.

He noted that in the United States, passports and other travel documents are immediately run through lists kept on computer systems. A computer search would have turned up stolen or lost passports. He said that in Malaysia the security arrangement is not as tight. Stolen travel documents could have gotten two of the passengers through the security checkpoints, he said.

He cautioned that at this early stage, "we can't say what it means yet." But he said that the two stolen passports have given investigators a reason to look for holes in security.

The Homeland Security source said that one passport was stolen from an Italian. It was taken from his rental car when he returned it in August in Malaysia. The second passport was stolen from an Austrian man two years ago, he said.

## Stolen Passport List

"Just because they were stolen doesn't mean the travelers were terrorists," the Homeland Security source cautioned. "They could have been nothing more than thieves. Or they could have simply bought the passports on the black market."

Another U.S. law enforcement official said an international list of lost and stolen passports exists. It is kept by an international police group. The group is called Interpol. Major international airlines routinely check Interpol's list before passengers board a flight. It would be unusual for a passenger on a major airline such as Malaysian Airways to be able to board using a stolen passport, he said.

Passenger lists for international flights are checked against lists kept from U.S. intelligence agencies. But that happens if a plane makes a stop in the United States. The jet that disappeared did not have a U.S. stop on its travel plan.
