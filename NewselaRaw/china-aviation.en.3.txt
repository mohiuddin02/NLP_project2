TAIYUAN, China — Air China Flight 1236 was supposed to take off at 8:10 p.m. for Beijing from Xian, hometown of China's famous terra cotta warriors.

It felt like the warriors could have marched faster. What was supposed to be a 100-minute flight last month ended up delayed, diverted and finally canceled. In the end, it took passengers 18 hours to get to Beijing.

China's skies are in a state of almost permanent gridlock: More often than not, there is no room for planes to take off or land. And this means flights are usually late.

During the month of July, only 17.8 percent of flights departing from Beijing's airport were on time. In August, on-time departures improved, but only to 28.8 percent. Out of the 35 top international airports, Beijing is ranked the worst for punctuality. Shanghai is close behind.

## Airways, Like Roadways, Badly Congested

The maddening delays have been bad for businesses. They have also caused near-riots. Between May and August, there were 26 major fights at Chinese airports. One Hong Kong airline has started teaching its flight attendants kung fu.

Flights here are delayed for pretty much the same reason highways are backed up: rapid economic growth. Airports and highways simply haven't been able to keep up with the rising number of travelers.

Since 2003, the number of airline passengers in China has nearly quadrupled. Last year, there were 319 million.

Meanwhile, airspace is limited by the Chinese army: It controls 80 percent of the skies above China. In the U.S., only around 17 percent is controlled by the government.

Chinese air traffic controllers — who decide when flights can land and take off — also are extremely cautious. Strict rules went into effect after a series of accidents in the early 1990s. Flights are now spaced about 7 to 10 miles apart. Thus, only 20 to 40 planes can land on a runway every hour. In the U.S., 60 per hour are allowed to land.

## Three Fights Due To Delays One Night

China spent more than $3.5 billion on a fancy new terminal for Beijing Capital International Airport. It's the world's second-largest and makes the city look rich. But it did nothing to reduce crowding in the air.

"It is like building a bigger parking lot. It didn't expand the airspace, so things only got worse," said aviation expert Xu Hongjun.

Xu said it would be very difficult to take away airspace from the military. Probably only President Xi Jinping could do it.

China is a huge country, full of mountains and gorges. It's easier to travel by plane than train. In 2011, the Chinese government announced it would build 55 new airports. One in Beijing is expected to be the world's largest.

For the time being, more passengers has meant more delays. And more frustration. One can now find YouTube videos of angry passengers throwing chairs and smashing telephones and computers.

On one night in July, there were three separate fights at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Passengers beat up airport staff members, some badly. The following weekend, 30 passengers stormed a runway in Nanchang after a seven-hour delay.

"The airlines are always coming up with different excuses. You never find the right person to ask, and the passengers just get angrier," said Tao Yuanyong, a Beijing travel agent.

## Hurry Up And Wait On A Plane

This summer authorities finally acted: They introduced a new rule known as "unlimited takeoff." This lets planes from the busiest airports take off whether a landing strip is available or not. Aviation authorities also threatened to punish airlines if they have too many delays. Airlines can even lose their routes.

But the new rules haven't really helped solve the problem. Airlines simply hurry passengers onto planes. Those planes then pull away from the gate, making it look like the flight is on time. But passengers end up strapped in their seats, waiting hours to take off. Or, even worse, they end up in flight, circling an airport for a long time. This wastes fuel and creates pollution.

The Air China flight from Xian last month was delayed nearly two hours. Then, it landed in Taiyuan rather than Beijing. A thunderstorm was the cause, passengers were told.

After an hour on the runway, the flight to Beijing was canceled. Passengers were placed in a guest house for the night.

After all this, many passengers decided to take the train to Beijing. They arrived at 3 p.m. Those who waited for a plane did only slightly better: They made it to Beijing at 1:30 p.m. — nearly 16 hours late.
