PITTSBURGH — Only 2 out of 100 teachers in the United States are black men. One education professor in Pennsylvania has started a program to recruit more African-American teachers. It is called the Black Men Teaching Initiative.

Robert Millward, who started the initiative, said many young people are not interested in teaching.

"They say that teachers don't make much" money, he said. "They see teaching as a woman's profession. They say, 'I didn't have a good experience in school, so why would I want to spend life teaching?'"

Four local colleges have joined Millward's initiative. They hope to encourage young people to teach.

## Strong Role Models Are Needed

At one workshop, 20 high school students sat in a room. The speaker asked them who planned to go to college. All raised their hands. Then he asked them who planned to become a teacher. The hands all went down.

Millward and his associates think it is very important to have a diverse group of teachers. Teachers can be strong role models for their young students.

To find out why there are so few black teachers today, we must look back to the 1950s and '60s.

Until the 1950s, American public schools were mostly segregated. There were separate schools for black children and white children. Officials at the time claimed the schools were "separate but equal."

In the U.S. Supreme Court's groundbreaking 1954 case, Brown v. Board of Education, it ruled that separate schools could never be equal. The court said black students were being treated unfairly.

Through the '50s and '60s, American schools began to desegregate. Schools that were once only for white students would also have to enroll black students.

## Guiding Students As They Grow Up

The government began sending some black students on buses to white schools. With fewer students, some black schools had to close. Many black teachers and principals lost their jobs.

The number of African-American teachers in the United States was cut almost in half. There were 80,000 black teachers in 1954, and only 42,000 in 1965.

Fewer black teachers meant fewer positive male role models for students.

Walter Lewis works with students through the Black Men Teaching Initiative. He said many of the families that he works with do not have father figures.

"A lot of the students call me 'dad' or 'uncle,'" he said. "I am often the positive male role model. They need someone who can say, 'Don't do that' — someone who is not afraid of them."

The organizers of the Black Men Teaching Initiative hope that providing African-American middle and high school students with mentors will create a snowball effect. A few mentors can guide some young students. When those students grow up, they can become mentors as well.

Education experts support this effort for more diversity. They warn, though, that more black male teachers is not the only solution. They say poor schools and under-trained teachers can also hurt black students.
