HACKENSACK, N.J. — New Jersey has so few little brown bats that there may soon be no more left. At the same time, the number of another species, big brown bats, is growing. The reason behind both is a disease called "white nose syndrome."

White nose has killed a large number of little brown bats. Surprisingly, big brown bats do not die from white nose.

The picture looks grim for little brown bats. Nine out of every 10 bats has died since 2008. Back then, there were about 30,000 in New Jersey. Now there are only a few hundred — so few that little brown bats might die out altogether, experts say. The females produce only one baby bat, or pup, a year, leading little brown bats to die faster than they are being born.

## Hibernation Becomes Deadly

Scientists estimate that 7 million bats, of many types, have died across the country since white nose was first detected in a cave near Albany, New York, in 2006. The fungal disease has now spread to 25 states.

Little brown bats become infected while hibernating for the winter. The fungus leaves a white powder on their noses, ears and wings. It causes the bats to move around while sleeping. They quickly burn off the fat they had stored up for hibernation. Since bats do not eat when they sleep, they die of hunger before spring arrives.

Big brown bats are also being infected by the disease. Yet, their numbers have actually grown 50 percent since white nose struck. Their large bodies have more fat, so moving around doesn't burn so much fat that it becomes dangerous to them. They hibernate for less time than little brown bats, and have two babies a year. Big brown bats also sleep farther apart, so white nose cannot spread as easily from bat to bat.

## Bats Are Good For The Environment

White nose isn't just a problem for bats. Having fewer bats around can affect humans too. Bats eat insects that spread diseases to humans. They also eat insects that damage crops that farmers grow. Bats eat so many insects that they save U.S. farmers billions of dollars worth of fruits and vegetables every year.

Scientists in New Jersey see some hope. The overall numbers of little brown bats are still declining. However, the number of those who live after they awake from hibernation has been going up a tiny bit each year, one study found.

It isn't yet enough to save the bats. All of the little brown bats would have to live through the winter to start replacing the ones lost to the disease.

Brooke Maslo is a scientist at Rutgers University. She says that at some point there might not be enough little brown bats to save them from dying out altogether.

## Working On Infection Fighter For Bats

Scientists across the country are close to finding a way to treat the disease. Some are testing a type of bacteria that could help the bats battle infection.

Others are studying a different fungus that might be stronger than the white nose fungus but would not kill any bats. Still another group of scientists is looking at something called "chitosan," which fights fungus and is found in the shells of sea creatures.

Jeremy Coleman works at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and is in charge of the government's efforts to stop white nose. He says no one has tried any of the treatments on bats yet. The scientists do not know how spraying the caves with the treatments might affect other animals living there. Coleman says for now scientists will not give any treatment to whole caves of bats.

Even if the bats could fight off the disease, it could take hundreds of years for them to get back to the numbers before white nose started killing them, he said.
