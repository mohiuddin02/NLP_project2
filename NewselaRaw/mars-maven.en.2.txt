Mars' atmosphere is so thin, it amounts to less than one percent of Earth's. Yet the Red Planet at one time apparently had rivers and lakes, which suggests it also once had a much thicker atmosphere.

Earth's thick atmosphere of gasses traps heat from the sun and allows life to survive. Mars once had an atmosphere like that, and Mars was warm and wet — but now it is cold and dry.

Where did this thick Martian atmosphere go? Solving that mystery is the main goal of NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, which arrived in orbit around Mars on Sept. 21.

## MAVEN Pulled Into Orbit

"One of the really overarching questions about Mars is whether there was ever life," MAVEN's principal investigator Bruce Jakosky said last week. Life, most scientists assume, would have required liquid water — as all life on Earth does.

MAVEN will measure Mars' current atmosphere. Scientists will then use those measurements to try to understand what might once have been there and how it was lost.

MAVEN has been traveling toward Mars since its launch 10 months ago, in November 2013. On Sunday night, it completed a tricky move that allowed Mars' gravity to pull it into orbit. Over the next six weeks, MAVEN will gradually lose altitude.

Eventually, its current 35-hour orbit will become a tighter circle-like orbit that takes just four and a half hours to complete. Its instruments will begin taking scientific measurements in November.

## India's Orbiter Due To Arrive

If all goes well, MAVEN scientists will coordinate with the researchers behind India's Mars Orbiter Mission, which is due to arrive on Sept. 24. While MAVEN will focus just on Mars' upper atmosphere, the Indian mission will be broader: It will record images of the planet's surface and atmosphere.

Mars Orbiter's science capabilities are simple compared to MAVEN's. Still, if it succeeds in reaching Mars, it will make history as the first Asian spacecraft to do so. "Both India and NASA are really quite interested in cooperating," said Jim Green, the director of NASA's planetary science division.

Mars' thin atmosphere is 95 percent carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, argon, oxygen and other chemicals. Scientists have two main possible explanations for how the bulk of the atmosphere could have escaped: It could have seeped down through the surface to the planet's crust, or floated up and been lost to space.

For clues, MAVEN will watch to see when and how gas is currently stripped off the top of the atmosphere. The process is thought to be driven by solar wind, but other forces could be at work as well.

## Siding Spring Comet Is Coming Too

MAVEN will get a bonus in the form of comet C/2013 A1 — also known as Siding Spring. By chance, the comet will cruise to within 80 miles of Mars on Oct. 19. Cometary dust and gas that strike Mars' atmosphere should provide information about the composition of both the comet itself and the Martian atmosphere. "The odds of having an approach that close to Mars are about one in a million years," Jakosky said. "It's really luck that we get the opportunity here."

MAVEN is the latest phase in an all-out scientific effort aimed at increasing our understanding of Mars. MAVEN will join NASA's two other orbiters — the Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance — as well as the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, which drive along the planet's surface. Europe's Mars Express orbiter is the only other spacecraft currently at the planet.

The various missions not only aim to understand whether life could ever have existed on Mars. They are also laying the groundwork for future human exploration.

"This is our next big step on our journey to Mars," Jakosky said. MAVEN and other missions "are blazing the trail for us to understand everything about Mars that we need to for humans to be able to land safely." In NASA's eyes, every bit of information brings us closer to the day when humans first walk upon the surface of the Red Planet.
