LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Los Angeles is now the official U.S. nominee for the 2024 Olympic games. Being selected was a dramatic turnaround for a city that just two months ago was considered out of the running.

The tide began to turn in L.A.'s favor after Boston dropped out from the process. On Tuesday, Los Angeles found itself the U.S. candidate, and its leaders were left feeling inspired and destined.

"This is a quest that Los Angeles was made for," Mayor Eric Garcetti said. "This city is the world's greatest stage."

Garcetti said Los Angeles, home to the Olympics in 1932 and 1984, would stage games that are both spectacular and profitable. He was given unanimous approval from his city council to strike agreements for a 2024 bid, a move that was immediately followed by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) naming Los Angeles as its candidate.

"I want to thank Los Angeles for standing up, once again, as America's bid city," said Scott Blackmun, the USOC's chief executive. Blackmun made his comments at Santa Monica Beach, where the city's plan calls for staging beach volleyball on the site where the sport was founded.

## Cost Is A Key Issue

The city's selection as the U.S. nominee marks the start of a two-year international competition. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will pick the host city in September 2017, and so far Rome, Paris, Hamburg, Germany, and Budapest, Hungary, are also in pursuit of the 2024 Games.

"The focus needs to be on convincing the 55 or so IOC members that Los Angeles is the best city to host the Olympics. That process starts immediately," USOC Chairman Larry Probst told reporters on a conference call.

A key issue has been whether approval of the resolution by the city council would saddle Los Angeles with potential cost overruns for an event that historically runs over budget. Council members were assured repeatedly that the approval only starts a negotiation with Olympic officials, and does not commit the government — and therefore taxpayers — to future spending.

"This is the engagement, not the wedding," Council President Herb Wesson said.

## City "In It To Win It"

The city's 2024 plan outlines more than $6 billion in public and private spending. It calls for staging events from volleyball on Santa Monica Beach to mountain biking in Griffith Park, one of the nation's largest city parks. As was the case in 1932 and 1984, the Memorial Coliseum would serve as the centerpiece of the games.

A so-called host city contract, which essentially sticks the city and state — not the IOC — with the burden of any cost overruns, became an obstacle in Boston. The city was dropped from contention in late July amid shaky public support and questions about taxpayer spending.

For Los Angeles, negotiating and striking a host city contract would come later, if the city is selected to stage the 2024 Games. For now, looming questions about costs can be temporarily pushed aside.

"We are in this to win it, and I think we will," said Councilman Paul Krekorian. However, he added, it cannot be done in a way that would leave taxpayers saddled with out-of-control expenses.

## Financial Plans For L.A. Games Remain Vague

Over the years, the Olympics have been notorious for cost overruns, and studies have questioned whether host cities benefit economically. Russia has been struggling with costs from the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which have been called the most expensive Olympics of all time.

Many financial details of the Los Angeles plan remain vague.

The bid calls for building a $1 billion athletes village on a rail yard the city does not own. Government analysts have warned that developing the site could cause the city to significantly exceed the projected cost of staging the games.

A private developer would invest most of the $925 million to build the village, but who would build the site, how the company would be selected and what type of financing would be used is unclear. The plan refers to necessary environmental and planning studies, but no cost estimates are given.

City analysts last week said they did not have enough information to verify the overall 2024 budget or determine the financial risk.

The IOC had set a Sept. 15 deadline for cities to enter the race for the 2024 Games.
