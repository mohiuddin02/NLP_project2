CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Sometimes, the smallest things can be life-changing. Justice Crawford and Nathaniel Nitkin are learning this thanks to a cello, a violin and a school music program.

Justice and Nathaniel are sixth-graders at Northwest School of the Arts. They came to the school from Winterfield Elementary. Winterfield runs a program sponsored by the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra (CSO). They are the first two students from the program to attend Northwest School of the Arts.

For the past six years, the CSO has taught after-school classes at Winterfield.  Kids in grades 2 through 5 learned how to play music. More than three-quarters of the students come from low-income homes.

## Music May Boost Attendance, Grades

Now, one person from the CSO works at the school full time. The CSO is trying to determine whether the after-school music class also helps kids in other ways. They hope it helps them stay out of trouble, have better attendance and get better grades.

Music helped Justice and Nathaniel avoid middle schools their parents didn't want them to attend. It launched them on a path that will provide a lifetime of pleasure and — who knows? — maybe a job in the arts.

"I would love to see him go on to play in an orchestra someday," says Endora Crawford, Justice's mom. She said she is very happy that he does well in the class, and he likes it. 

## Learning Responsibility, Cooperation

"As he adds technical skills, he's showing more confidence all around," says Neil Nitkin, Nathaniel's dad. "He's better able to concentrate on what's in front of him, both the musical and nonmusical stuff. It makes a big difference."

When the program started, the goals were simple but meaningful. The program wanted to teach kids to take responsibility for something of value. They are allowed to take smaller instruments home to practice. Students learn the importance of taking proper care of the instruments. 

The students also learn cooperation. They spend time with children they might not know outside of the program. The program also teaches practice habits. When students get better after practice, they learn that practice is good. This transfers to studying for other subjects in school.

Finally, the program gives students experiences in the arts that they might not get any other way.

## Program Gets Parents Involved, Too

Attendance has gone up and down over the years. CSO director of education Chris Stonnell said, "Winterfield has a constantly changing population, and we struggle with that. Not a lot of kids go there for four straight years. This year, we're working with 82 to 84 students, (and) we have a school programs manager on our staff."

"We look at the musical component, but it's also about the community component. It's about getting parents who may never have come to the school before to participate in the process."

## Kids Look For "Forever Instrument"

Until recently, music was something Justice and Nathaniel found on the Internet. They did not think of it as something to play. Justice had never picked up a stringed instrument before coming to Winterfield two years ago. Nathaniel had not until he joined the music program a year before that.

Students use the first year to explore and find a "forever instrument," as Courtney Hollenbeck calls it. Hollenbeck started the music program with the CSO in 2009\. Justice flirted with the clarinet and cello before selecting a violin. Nathaniel enjoyed the trumpet but decided on cello and violin.

"When I started, it actually looked easy, but I knew it would get tougher and tougher," says Nathaniel. "Practicing is a pleasure: I'm always trying to get a song perfect, so I'm playing 15-20-25 minutes a day, plus working on my keyboard. It's a big step for me, going to a school where almost everything you do is (related to) the arts."
