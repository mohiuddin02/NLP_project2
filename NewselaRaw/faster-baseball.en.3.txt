SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. â€” For 150 years, there have been no clocks in baseball. But that could change soon.

Baseball is the only major sport without time limits. It could soon add clocks to time pitches, substitutions, and breaks between innings. Major League Baseball (MLB) is testing new clock rules in the Arizona Fall League (AFL), a lower league it runs.

If players take too long at any of those things, umpires can charge pitchers with balls and batters with strikes. The rule changes are meant to speed up the game and make it more interesting for young people.

Frank Kremblas, a manager in the AFL, said major league baseball games are usually the slowest. He said the AFL was changing its rules just as an experiment.

## Today's Games Take Over Three Hours

Baseball games take longer than they used to. An average game in 1950 lasted 2 hours, 23 minutes. The average game took more than three hours this season.

Games aren't just longer. They are slower too. In 2000, teams scored an average of 5.14 runs each game. Since then scoring has decreased, with teams scoring an average of 4.07 runs each game this year. There are more strikeouts than before.

If fewer runs are scored and fewer balls hit, what's taking so long?

Batters are more patient, waiting for the perfect pitch. Coaches make more substitutions than they used to. New video reviews slow things down too. Players often adjust their equipment and take practice swings.

The fastest pitchers, like Mark Buehrle of the Toronto Blue Jays and Doug Fister of the Washington Nationals, take about 18 seconds between pitches. The slowest pitchers take more than 25 seconds on average. Edinson Volquez of the Pittsburgh Pirates averaged 25.3 seconds between pitches, the fourth-slowest time this year.

## Clocks For Pitchers And Batters

Batters also slow games down. Hanley Ramirez of the Los Angeles Dodgers takes 28.1 seconds between pitches. He was the slowest batter in the major leagues this year. His teammate Yasiel Puig takes 26.7 seconds, which tied for third. Dodgers games took an average of 3:14 this season.

The AFL clock rules were announced in early October to address these problems. MLB officials want to use them as an experiment to speed up baseball games.

The biggest change is the pitch clock. Pitchers must throw the ball within 20 seconds or receive an automatic ball. Batters are supposed to stay in the batter's box during their at-bats.

You can only step out if you if you swing, said fall league player Josh Bell.

Pitchers have to throw the first pitch of a new inning within 2 minutes, 5 seconds after the end of the last one. Batters must be in the batter's box within 1:45. Pitching changes can take no longer than 2:30. Teams are also limited to three timeouts. Pitchers can give an intentional walk by saying so rather than throwing four pitches.

## They Did Speed Things Up A Bit

The rules are enforced at Salt River Fields, the only AFL ballpark outfitted with the clocks. There are five digital clocks that count down the various times.

Having the clocks there changed the game, Bell said.

"So you're trying to pick up the ball, the lights are flashing right behind," he said. "It's definitely a little bit different."

The rules seem to have worked. Through Oct. 24, nine-inning games under the new rules averaged 2 hours, 20 minutes, while nine-inning games without clock rules averaged 2:49. The average AFL game took 2:51 last year.

It is still unclear if any of the clock rules will move to the major leagues. The game can only speed up so much, and shorter isn't always better, some say.

Pittsburgh Pirates manager Clint Hurdle shared that feeling in September. "If it's all about a clock," he said, "go watch another sport."
