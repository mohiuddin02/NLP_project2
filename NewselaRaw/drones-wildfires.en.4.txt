SAN DIEGO, Calif. â€” Jason Thrasher is a helicopter pilot who fights fires.

He was battling a fire in a forest. Suddenly, he saw something flying nearby. It was not another firefighting helicopter. It was a drone and just 10 feet from him. Thrasher turned sharply to avoid it.

A drone is like a remote-controlled plane. No one is on board. It can be flown by a computer or a person on the ground.

## More Drones Flying, Getting In Way Of Planes

There are more drones in the sky than ever. They are getting in the way of planes and helicopters. Pilots are worried because drones can cause crashes.

This year, drones got in the way of 13 forest fires. If a drone is close enough, a firefighting pilot must land. The result is that the fire often gets worse.

There is a reason why there are more drones in the sky. They are getting cheaper. More people can afford to buy them. Two years ago in 2013, people bought 128,000 drones. Last year, the number was 430,000. This year, people will buy about 700,000 drones. Drones cost about $150. Two years ago, they cost $300.

## Lawmakers Asking For Stricter Laws

California lawmakers want stronger laws against drones. They want to keep drones away from fires. Lawmakers want to jail owners who break laws. They also want to let firefighters destroy drones.

Greg McNeal is a expert in the law. Flying near wildfires is dangerous, he said. Most drone owners may not know that. Some owners are careless, he said. They just want to get near fires. Drones usually carry cameras. They may want to use their drones to take pictures of big forest fires and sell them.

## Drones Cannot Fly During Emergencies

Government rules do not let drones fly higher than 400 feet. They must stay away from stadiums and people. They also cannot fly within 5 miles of airports. During wildfires and other emergencies, drones cannot be in the sky.

Jon Resnick works for a tech company. It makes drones.

Drone owners need to use common sense, he said.
