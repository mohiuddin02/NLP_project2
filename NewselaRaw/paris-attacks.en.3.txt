PARIS, France - Gunmen launched a wave of attacks Friday night in Paris, the capital of France. The attacks were planned to take place at just about the same time. More than 132 people are known dead so far with more than 350 injured.

The attacks were the deadliest in France since World War II. It was one of the worst terror strikes on a Western country since the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, in New York. In Paris, the attackers killed people at various places across the city.

The killers targeted spots where people were enjoying a regular Friday night. Soccer games, concerts and cafes were attacked.

French police and military went into the streets while many people hid indoors.

## Europe Is Targeted

It was the second time this year that Paris has been a scene of mass killings. In January, Islamist extremists attacked the newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a supermarket owned by Jews. Seventeen people died. Charlie Hebdo was targeted because of cartoons it published of the prophet Muhammad. He is the most important person in Islam and lived hundreds of years ago.

The attacks will raise more concerns in Europe. European nations are already dealing with a huge flow of people coming from the Middle East, southern Asia and Africa. Many are escaping poverty or wars in their home countries and want to stay in Europe. They are called migrants.

At the same time, Islamist extremism has been growing as some Muslims have become angry at the governments in Europe. European leaders cannot agree on how to handle the problems facing their continent.

## "A United France"

World leaders spoke out against the Paris attacks. French President Fran√ßois Hollande promised that France will fight back. "We are going to lead a war," Hollande said.

He said France must join together to let terrorists know they face "a united France."

On Saturday, the Islamic State said it was responsible for the attacks and Hollande went on television to blame the group. He called the attacks "an act of war."

The Islamic State is a violent group, also known as ISIS. It wants to start its own country under Islamic law. ISIS fighters have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq.

Late on Sunday, France's Defense Ministry said French warplanes had launched a swift retaliatory response on targets in Syria where the Islamic State is based, after coordinating with the U.S. military. The ministry said 10 aircraft dropped 20 bombs on facilities used by the militant group.

The attacks took much planning. Many people will question how the planning was not noticed by French intelligence services and stopped.

On Saturday, the French government announced that all eight of the attackers had been killed. Six of them died by setting off suicide bombs and one was shot and killed by police. However, on Sunday, French police said an eighth suspect was urgently being sought.

## Explosions At Soccer Game, Concert Hall

The worst attack took place at the Bataclan concert hall. It is one of the most famous places to see live music in Paris. About 1,000 people had gathered there for a show by an American rock band.

Witnesses said three or four men wearing black entered the building and used rifles to shoot audience members.

Police surrounded the building as the sounds of explosions and gunfire could be heard. The police moved in, and as they did so, the attackers blew themselves up. At least 100 people died, said Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman.

At other places across the city, including cafes and shopping centers, attacks left dozens more dead. Bombs were set off near a soccer stadium where France was playing Germany. People were not allowed to leave the stadium.

City life came to a halt. Subway lines were shut down and the government told people to stay indoors.

## Stricter Rules At Borders

Hollande went on national television Friday night to announce a state of emergency. The government will send 1,500 troops to Paris to back up police. France will also boost security at its borders. Planes and trains from other countries will still be allowed in.

European governments let people move easily among European countries. Often, they do not have to show papers, like a passport. This might be changing. Sweden began border checks this week. It is trying to stop migrants coming in. Slovenia put barbed wire on its border with Croatia.

In Washington, D.C., President Barack Obama said how sorry he was for the French people. He offered the help of the United States "to bring these terrorists to justice."

He said the attack was not just an attack on France. Obama called it "an attack on all of humanity."
