ROZSYPNE, Ukraine — World leaders called for an immediate cease-fire in eastern Ukraine on Friday. The call came a day after a Malaysia Airlines jetliner was shot down over the country's battlefields. Global leaders demanded that international investigators be allowed to reach the crash site.

The strong words came as search teams combed the area near the Russian border for pieces of wreckage from the Boeing 777.

The attack Thursday afternoon killed 298 people from nearly a dozen nations. Among the dead were vacationers, students and a large group of scientists heading to an AIDS conference in Australia.

President Barack Obama called for an immediate cease-fire between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russia separatists. He also called for a trustworthy investigation.

"The eyes of the world are on eastern Ukraine, and we are going to make sure that the truth is out," Obama said at the White House.

## Surface-To-Air Missile Attack

U.S. intelligence authorities said a surface-to-air missile brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 as it traveled from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told the U.N. Security Council in New York on Friday the missile was likely fired from a rebel-held area near the Russian border.

The Ukrainian government is fighting pro-Russian rebels who are trying to separate from Ukraine. Many consider themselves ethnically Russian and speak Russian. Ukraine accuses Russia of supporting these rebels. Russia, Ukraine and the rebels all denied shooting the plane down. Moscow also denies backing the rebels.

The rebels began fighting after Russia in March invaded and took the Crimean Peninsula away from Ukraine. Crimea has with many Russians. The takeover led to the fighting now.

After holding an emergency session, the U.N. Security Council called for "a full, thorough and independent international investigation" into the downing of the plane.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said both sides in the conflict should put down their weapons and hold peace talks. On Thursday, Putin blamed Ukraine for the crash. He said Ukraine's government was responsible for the unrest in its eastern regions. However, he didn't accuse Ukraine of shooting the plane down. Putin also didn't address whether Russia gave the rebels such a powerful missile.

## Ukraine Releases Video

The Ukrainian government released a video supposedly showing a truck carrying a Buk missile launcher it said was used to fire on the plane. One of its four missiles was apparently missing. Ukraine said the footage was filmed by a police squad Friday as the truck was heading toward the Russian border.

There was no way to prove the accuracy of the video.

Reaching the sprawling crash site remained difficult and dangerous. The road into it from Donetsk, the largest city in the region, was marked by five rebel checkpoints.

A commission of around 30 European officials traveled to the crash site Friday afternoon.

"No black boxes have been found ... we hope that experts will track them down and create a picture of what has happened," Donetsk separatist leader Aleksandr Borodai said.

Yet earlier Friday, a member of Borodai's group said eight out of 12 recording devices had been recovered. It was not clear what he was referring to. Planes usually have two black boxes — one for recording flight information and the other for recording voices in the cockpit.

## Charred Wreckage Amid Sunflowers

The crash site was spread out over fields between two villages in eastern Ukraine — Rozsypne and Hrabove. In the distance, the thud of Grad missile launchers being fired could be heard Friday morning.

In the sunflower fields around Rozsypne, 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Russian border, lines of men searched for remains. One fainted after finding a body. Another body was covered in a coat.

About 70 off-duty coal miners joined the search, their faces still sooty from work.

In Hrabove, several miles away, sticks with red or white rags attached marked where body parts were found.

Andrei Purgin, a leader of the pro-Russian separatists, said the bodies were to be taken to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Mariupol.

Smashed watches and mobile phones, charred boarding passes and passports were among the wreckage.

Large chunks of the plane were scattered over one field. The cockpit and one turbine lay a kilometer (a half-mile) apart. The tail landed 10 kilometers (6 miles) away. One rebel militiaman in Rozsypne told the AP the plane's body showed signs of being struck by a missile.

## Airlines Now Avoiding Parts Of Ukraine Airspace

The area has seen heavy fighting between government troops and pro-Russia separatists. Rebels had bragged about shooting down two Ukrainian military jets Wednesday.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed Ukraine's claim that Moscow could be behind the attack.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk described the attack as an "international crime." He called on those behind it to be punished in an international court.

Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lay insisted again Friday that the airline's path was an internationally approved route. He denied claims the airline was trying to save fuel and money by taking a more direct flight path across Ukraine.

Aviation authorities in several countries, including the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, had issued previous warnings not to fly over parts of Ukraine. Within hours of the crash Thursday, several airlines announced they were avoiding parts of Ukrainian airspace.
