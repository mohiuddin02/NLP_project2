WASHINGTON â€” For generations, Asian-Americans have lived on the coasts of the United States. Recently, thousands have moved to the South, changing the communities where they have settled.

Asian-Americans were the fastest-growing ethnic group in the South between 2000 and 2010. The Asian-American population there increased 69 percent in those years, according to a government count of the country's population.

The Asian-American population grew faster in the South than any other region of the country. In the count, the South includes 16 states from Maryland and Delaware to Florida to Texas and Oklahoma. The District of Columbia is also included.

The average growth of the Asian-American population in the region was 63 percent. Twelve states and the District saw increases of 50 percent or more. By comparison, the Latino population grew 57 percent in the South.

## Fast Growth Equals Challenges

State by state, the growth is even more striking. In some states the Asian-American population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010. In Georgia and North Carolina that population jumped more than 80 percent.

The growth in some cities was even higher, even if the Asian-American amount of the overall population remains small.

In Atlanta, Georgia, Asian-Americans make up just 5 percent of the population. The city's overall population increased 24 percent between 2000 and 2010. During that time, the Asian-American population rose 88 percent.

The sudden growth means there are several problems for local governments. A significant example is the number of new languages.

Communities in the South now have to educate students who do not speak English as a first language. There are 111 different languages spoken in the area of one Georgia school district.

Some cities in Georgia are encouraging Asian-American-owned businesses to put up signs in English so police will know where to go in an emergency. Public officials also have to translate official documents for immigrants. Some states in the South have little experience in hosting large immigrant communities.

## It Is Cheaper To Live In The South

An older Asian-American population is another challenge. Experts say the number of elderly Asian-Americans in the region is increasing alongside the overall population. The cheaper cost of living draws retirees to the South. As a result, there is an increasing need for health care.

The Asian-American newcomers could affect the South's politics. In Virginia, for example, the number of Asian-Americans registered to vote increased 136 percent from 2004 to 2012. The number actually casting ballots rocketed 180 percent. In Georgia, registered Asian-American voters doubled, while turnout soared 168 percent.

Most new arrivals bring different viewpoints with them when they move to the South.

There are many reasons for the population shift, because so many different groups are moving. The government tracks 23 different ethnic groups under the Asian-American umbrella.

It's hard to find one explanation for why so many groups are moving. Marita Etcubanez, who works for an Asian-American civil rights group, says many people move to the South in hopes of getting good jobs. It is also cheaper to live in the South for many of them.

"People are willing to settle wherever opportunity is available to them," Etcubanez said.

## Some States Are Playing Catch-Up

Different people will have different opportunities available, Etcubanez and other experts said. Immigrants from parts of Southeast Asia are likely to have different skills than a highly educated professional from India.

C.N. Le, a professor of Asian &amp; Asian American Studies, agreed that different groups have different motivations for moving. He mentioned good universities in North Carolina as a draw for more educated Asian-Americans. That state had the highest increase in its Asian-American population in the region.

Each state will have to deal with the new arrivals on its own. How well they do will depend on their politics and history. Some states, like Tennessee, have long been a destination for refugees, and might be better ready to respond to a changing population.

Many of these states do not have much history of new populations, said Chris Kromm, a civil rights worker. "A lot of them are catching up, and it takes a lot more to turn the ship."
