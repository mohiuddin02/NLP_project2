WASHINGTON â€” Harry S. McAlpin made history in February of 1944: Despite strong resistance, he became the first black reporter to cover a presidential news conference at the White House.

Time magazine and The New York Times noted the breakthrough. And Franklin Delano Roosevelt greeted the reporter as he made his way over to the president's desk, telling him, "Glad to see you, McAlpin."

It was not a sentiment shared by McAlpin's fellow reporters, who were members of the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA). For 10 years, the WHCA had denied black reporters the opportunity to attend the twice-weekly news conferences in the Oval Office.

McAlpin was there only because Roosevelt had opened the White House doors to black reporters. The president's invitation followed repeated pleas from African-American publications starting in 1933.

## A Veiled Threat

Roosevelt's invitation did nothing to change the attitude of WHCA members. One member made a veiled threat, suggesting to McAlpin that if he did attend, "someone" could get hurt in the crush of reporters moving into the room. If McAlpin chose to stay away, that reporter promised, he'd share his notes from the news conference with him.

McAlpin "ever so politely declined the offer," said White House correspondent George Condon. Instead, he stepped into the White House, thereby breaking the color barrier.

Condon, a former WHCA president, has been researching the group's not-always-honorable history. He is doing so in celebration of the WHCA's hundredth anniversary this year.

Now, 70 years after doing all it could to block black reporters, the WHCA is looking to make amends: It is dedicating a scholarship for journalism students in McAlpin's name. McAlpin, who died in 1985, will be honored at the association's annual scholarship dinner on May 3.

"Harry McAlpin was a remarkable man. We honor his role as the first black reporter to cover a presidential press conference. And we acknowledge that he did that in spite of opposition from the White House Correspondents' Association of the time," said Steven Thomma, the current association president.

"Thanks to the work of Harry McAlpin," and others who followed, he said, "the White House press corps and the White House Correspondents' Association is a diverse chorus of faces and voices. The country is better for it."

McAlpin's son, Sherman, calls his father's history-making White House assignment just one chapter in a life well-lived.

"He has been and continues to be my hero," Sherman McAlpin said of his father. "If I accomplished one-tenth of what he accomplished in his life, I would be a total success."

## Over The Threshold

Discrimination was an obstacle for McAlpin, his son said. As a young man, McAlpin hoped to study journalism at the University of Missouri, but he was barred because of his race. He ended up at the University of Wisconsin instead.

Similarly, it was a "hard road to try to get a black person into the White House correspondents' circle," Sherman McAlpin said. His father told him he was warned that at the White House news conference "someone might step on your foot" and a scuffle would follow.

 McAlpin said his father replied: "I always thought the White House press would be the cream of the crop. I can't imagine that would happen. But if it did, it would be the story of the year and I wouldn't want to miss it.' "

Once over the threshold, McAlpin attended the briefings. He wrote for several black newspapers, including the weekly Chicago Defender and the Atlanta Daily World, the country's only black daily. In the Oval Office, he asked Roosevelt about the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC).

Roosevelt started the FEPC to ban racial discrimination by defense companies that did any business with the U.S. government. The FEPC was started during World War II, when huge numbers of jobs were being created making equipment and providing services for the military. Many employers were reluctant to integrate their workforces.

Roosevelt's order helped blacks take part in the wartime hiring boom. The FEPC was an issue close to many of McAlpin's readers.

"He was a good writer, a good reporter who paid attention to what his community cared about," Condon said.

## "They Blackballed Him"

McAlpin achieved another first when he was part of the press train traveling to the 1944 Democratic National Convention. He was also one of the few reporters allowed to cover White House funeral services for Roosevelt.

And he made his mark with President Harry S. Truman: At the new president's first news conference, McAlpin asked whether he could assure African-Americans that he'd consider their views as Roosevelt had.

But he was never a member of the WHCA.

"They blackballed him from ever joining the correspondents' association or attending the group's annual dinner," said Condon, who recommended creating the scholarship. "The president could break the color line for his press conferences, but he could not rewrite the WHCA's membership policies."

McAlpin left the White House beat in 1945. He later served as a Navy war correspondent before moving to Louisville, Ky., where he practiced law and was president of the local NAACP branch.

Sherman McAlpin said that his father had instilled a belief in him that all men were created equal, but that he was often tested.

In a radio essay from the 1950s, McAlpin spoke movingly of the struggles he faced as he confronted racism.

"To live by these beliefs, I have found it necessary to develop patience, to build courage, to pray for wisdom," McAlpin said.
