LOS ANGELES â€” It has long been known that the clouds of gas and dust, or nebulae, that dying stars cast off are strikingly colorful. Now, though, astronomers have discovered something new and mysterious: Some planetary nebulae in the Milky Way galaxy's central bulge are strangely aligned; that is, they line up in the same direction.

The discovery was made by two astrophysics researchers from the University of Manchester. Their findings help explain how the stars behind the nebulae formed. And they also suggest what unknown forces might have pulled the nebulae into formation.

A dying star's nebula is a sight to behold. Like a flower shedding its petals, an aging star casts off its outer layers. Soon, it is surrounded with cloud-like shells of gas and dust.

But these shells aren't just interstellar eye candy. Planetary nebulae can tell scientists much about the environment in which they were formed. Nebulae reflect their stars' individual characteristics. And they can reveal whether a star is one of a pair of stars and whether it has any orbiting planets.

## Deep In The Central Galactic Bulge

The two researchers, lead author Bryan Rees and Albert Zijlstra, studied 130 nebulae. All are located roughly 26,000 light-years away, in the Milky Way's densely populated central galactic bulge. About 44 of them were bipolar; that is, they had formed into twin gas clouds, often resembling butterfly wings. The majority were elliptical, meaning they had a mostly roundish shape.

Soon the researchers began to notice something strange: More than half of the bipolar nebulae seemed to be aligned. This was particularly surprising because they were many light-years apart. Just one light year equals about 6 trillion miles.

"The surprise is that there's a relationship between things that are so widely separated," Rees said. "Now, how can we explain it?"

Other bipolar nebulae that sit closer to us are randomly oriented, not neatly arranged. This means there must be something going on in the galaxy's center that's causing its nebulae to line up.

The nebulae's shared alignment points to "a powerful magnetic pull in the galactic bulge when they were formed," Rees said. "It's not necessarily there now."

## Magnetic Field Around A Black Hole

Say you're holding a magnet near a bunch of scattered nails, and only some of the nails are magnetized. Only the magnetized nails will turn and point if you bring the magnet near, leaving the unmagnetized ones untouched.

That's sort of what could be happening here, astronomers say. The bipolar nebulae were probably two-star systems with strong magnetic fields. Like the magnetized nails, they would have been unable to resist a powerful magnetic force. Such a force may have existed in the galactic bulge around when it was forming stars, about 8 to 13 billion years ago. The elliptical nebulae lacked a strong magnetic field, and so would have remained unmoved.

The bipolar nebulae, Rees said, ended up looking something like hourglasses lying on their sides.

The findings could help explain how "bipolar nebulae are formed," he said. And they might "provide some insight, possibly, on the way the bulge was formed."

The study doesn't go into what could have caused that magnetic field. However, a recent study suggests there is a strong magnetic field around the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Whether that field was responsible for the oddly aligned nebulae remains to be seen.
