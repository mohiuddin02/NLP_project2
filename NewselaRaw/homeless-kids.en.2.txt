Ten-year-old Kaylie Hegwood is hungry; so is her 12-year-old brother, Tyler. It is not because they just finished soccer practice or forgot to eat breakfast. They are hungry because their mother can't afford to buy enough food.

"There's good days and bad days," Tyler told Jezza Neumann, the director of "Poor Kids," which aired on PBS. "Sometimes when we have cereal, we don't have milk. We have to eat it dry. Sometimes we don't have cereal and we have milk."

## No Pocket Money To Spare

Kaylie and Tyler live in Iowa with their mother, Barbara. Their mother has a job. But after she pays monthly rent and bills, there is very little money left over for groceries. Kaylie and Tyler try to help. They both collect empty cans to recycle. Tyler also mows lawns.

"A lot of times, I have to give my money up to buy groceries and buy gas for the car and lawn mower," Tyler told Neumann. "I got $10, and I put in $6 of it for the gas and gave the rest to my mom for some food. And (that's) what I do with my money."

Kaylie and Tyler do not attend school because they move homes too often. They are officially homeless.

## Who Are The Homeless?

"Homeless" does not just describe adults begging for money on the street or in the subways. Children are also victims of homelessness.

Studies say that 16 million children in America live in poverty. Poverty means having little or no money to support oneself or one's family. Poverty can often lead to homelessness.

"I'm just starving," Kaylie tells Neumann. "We don't get that three meals a day, like, breakfast, lunch and then dinner."

Studies say that one in every 45 children in the United States does not have a place to call home. That means about 1.6 million children are homeless in America. That number is equal to all the people who live in the state of Idaho.

Since the economy crashed in 2008, homelessness in the United States has exploded.

The number of homeless children in the United States is so large that it has been called an epidemic by some in Congress. An epidemic is something that grows or spreads rapidly, usually with bad results.

Kaylie and Tyler are not alone in their struggle to help their mother make enough money to survive. Millions of adult Americans spend more than half of their income on rent and utility bills. That means one missed paycheck or a health emergency like a breaking a leg can lead to a crisis.

That is what happened to Kylie and Tyler. Their mom could not afford to keep paying her bills, so they had to move. Now the family lives in a small motel room. The move meant that Kaylie had to give away her dog, Nala.

"(Nala) was like my favorite dog," Kaylie says. "And now we have to take her to the pound."

## Childhood Is Critical

The more time children live in poverty, the harder it will be for them to avoid poverty as adults. That is because children who face poverty and homelessness have a hard time attending school. Like Kaylie and Tyler, they have to stop going to school and instead find work. The money they receive from working helps pay the bills.

Studies say 45 percent of people who spent at least half of their childhood in poverty were poor at age 35. That means kids who spend at least nine years living in poverty risk being poor as an adult. Among those who spent less than half of their childhood in poverty, just eight percent were poor at age 35.

## Homeless But Hopeful

Directors Sean Fine and Andrea Nix Fine wanted to shed light on the homelessness epidemic. Their short documentary film, "Inocente," about a 15-year-old homeless girl named Inocente Izucar, aired on MTV in 2012. Inocente moved more than 30 times in nine years. She used her artistic talent to escape her poor circumstances.

"In a normal school classroom in the U.S., there are 22 kids. So if you take two classrooms, one kid is going to be homeless. And if you think about all the classrooms in the U.S., that's a lot of kids," Sean Fine told Vice.com reporter Jamie Lee Curtis Taete.

The documentary won an Academy Award in 2013.

The directors hope that winning the Oscar will bring more attention to the subject of homeless kids.  They want the 40-minute film to be shown in museums and libraries and to become part of school curriculums in order to spark discussion about this epidemic.
