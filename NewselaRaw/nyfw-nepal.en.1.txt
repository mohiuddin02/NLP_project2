They attend countless movies. They flip through rare books and listen to unusual forms of music. They love oddball personalities and fictional characters who have totally impractical wardrobes. They hunt for ideas in countless sources, and sometimes the explanations for their clothing collections are so dense they are hard to understand.

What does all of that intellectualism do for the clothes? Oftentimes, not much.

During Fashion Week here in New York City, designers are unveiling their spring 2016 collections. They have listed influences as varied as modernist architecture, 1960s jazz singer Nina Simone and mind-altering psychedelic drugs. Ultimately, however, some of the most beautiful clothes were produced by designers who simply drew on personal experience. The clothes they presented reflect who they are and how they relate to the world around them.

## Solemn Monks Open Runway Show

Nepalese-American Prabal Gurung's collection was perhaps the most striking in that regard. Garung opened his Sunday night show with the solemn and soothing chants of a chorus of Buddhist monks. As the audience waited in a large darkened room, the monks silently assembled at the top of the runway. With soft lights illuminating their saffron robes, the low rumble of their voices moved gently across the room.

When the monks finished, they left silently. Then, the show's music rumbled to life and the first models appeared. They had on flowing dresses in shades of saffron, burnt orange and gold, a range of colors that echoed the robes the monk wore.

The collection reflected what has been a difficult year for Gurung. The designer grew up in Nepal and felt the devastation of the 2015 earthquake there deeply. As he wrote in his show notes, "Saturday, April 25, 2015 changed my life forever." Gurung has family and friends in Nepal, and the images of the destruction there left him reeling. He set out to raise money to help the victims, and so far has raised more than $613,000.

## Clothing Reflects Childhood Memories

As Gurung worked to do what he could for Nepal, he also began to think back to his childhood there. His mind began filling with memories of the sights, sounds and smells of Nepal. Soon he decided to create a line of clothing that reflects those memories, as well as the depth of his country's history.

The result is a collection that is full of ease and beauty. The clothes moved with grace, and the embroidery was rich but not overwhelming. Small differences in the thickness of the fabric created a delicate range of color.

The show was, in some ways, Gurung's "thank you" to the fashion industry for supporting the people of Nepal — and for supporting him. His gift was in sharing a bit of what he holds dear. Even though most in the audience had little knowledge of Nepal, the collection was created with such personal feeling that it all felt soulful and familiar.

Gurung's was not the only collection to draw on cultural roots. Designer Joseph Altuzarra turned to his Basque background for design ideas, and the results were beautiful. The rich fabrics gave his lean shapes interest and a sense of luxury. Tiny white pearl buttons were used to give a linen coat the feeling of antiquity.

However, it was his colors — shades of the sky on a shirt or of a sunset on a sweater — that especially captured the imagination. They almost seemed to bring back sweet childhood memories of family picnics or days at the beach.

## One Designer Celebrates Jazz Singer

The ideas behind the other designers' collections were not as personal. Still, the results were sometimes quite charming.

Derek Lam's collection, for instance, successfully reflected his love for the music of Nina Simone, and his fascination with her life. His collection was a little bit appealingly old-fashioned, a little bit masculine and a little bit girly. It ultimately added up to a group of sharp jackets, breezy dresses and intriguing proportions that attract the eye.

Other designers, however, struggled to go from an idea to a finished garment that speaks with a unique voice.

## Collection Echoes Famous Architect

Designers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim were inspired by influential modernist architect Frank Lloyd Wright. They presented their collection in an elaborate set with lights inspired by Wright's work. There were dancers, and a thick pamphlet with "further reading" about all the various elements of the show — but not so much about the clothes.

While there were patterns and shapes that echoed Wright's architecture, the connection between the presentation and the clothes was not always clear. All in all, it was a fine collection but one that felt a bit overwhelmed by the ideas behind it.

Baja East's collection drew on the psychedelic experience and the hippie and neo-hippie lifestyle. It featured an explosion of red and blue knits, rainbow-colored cropped tops and trousers that dragged across the floor. The collection was jarring in its styling and in its colors and proportions. To make matters worse, the models wore ungainly black wigs and had greased-up skin.

If this was inspired by a personal drug experience, one hopes everyone has since recovered.
