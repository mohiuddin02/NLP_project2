ST. LOUIS - The freshman-year roommates at Colgate University would talk about what they hoped to do after college. They were just 18 or 19, their paths barely formed. But they had some ideas. One wanted to be a lawyer. Another, a music producer. And then there was Ryan C. Fogle from Richmond Heights near St. Louis. He wanted to join the FBI or CIA.

"Those were his goals in life," Ben Flicker, one of those roommates who is now an attorney in Denver, recalled Wednesday. "He had this sense of service, of duty. And if he reached the FBI or CIA, that was the highest level of duty he could imagine giving to his country."

Fogle, 29, apparently realized his dream. And the whole world now seems to know about it.

Fogle is accused by Russia of spying for the CIA while he worked as a low-level U.S. diplomat in Moscow. His arrest by Russia's security services was so intensely publicized on Tuesday that it appeared designed to embarrass the United States and its intelligence service.

## Man With The Crooked Blond Wig

State-run television showed Fogle, wearing a crooked blond wig under a ballcap, and what were reportedly the strange tools of his spy trade. These included wads of cash, several pairs of dark sunglasses, a compass and map of Moscow, a knife, more wigs, pepper spray and a letter laying out how the spy recruitment would go.

Then Fogle was kicked out of the country.

But the peculiar details of Fogle's arrest have raised suspicions that this was not just the simple case of a bumbling spy. Relations between the United States and Russia have grown frosty. Some think he was used - perhaps even framed - to make a point.

Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, said initial stories in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and The New York Times detailing Fogle's arrest only made her "curiouser and curiouser" about what is going on.

"If the allegations Russia is making are true, it appears that our effort at gaining intelligence is rather lame. It reads like something you would see in a movie that you would say 'That's not realistic.' I know our intelligence community is very sophisticated, so that's why it doesn't compute," she told reporters.

The State Department remained tight-lipped and tried not to make a big deal of the incident. A spokesman said it did not even come up during a meeting Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart in Sweden.

"I wouldn't read too much into one incident one way or another," spokesman Patrick Ventrell said.

## Trying To Recruit A Russian?

Russia's domestic security service, the FSB, claims Fogle was trying to recruit a Russian counterterrorism officer who specializes in the Caucasus region in southern Russia, where the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects had roots.

Eric O'Neill, a former FBI counterintelligence officer, said he believes Fogle really works for the CIA and he probably was trying to recruit double agents. That seems like it could be true, he said. But the items that Fogle carried with him did not appear to be genuine tools of a CIA spy.

"I doubt he had this kit on him," he said. "It was planted on him for political theater."

O'Neill, who helped capture former FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who spied for the Russians for more than two decades, thought the pepper spray and knife were over-the-top details. The compass is obsolete in an era of GPS. "I doubt he was really running around with a wig," he said.

The wording of the letter intended to recruit the Russian official sounded unreal to O'Neill. The letter, typewritten in Russian, offered $100,000 plus $1 million a year for cooperation. "That's a pretty big budget," he said.

He also noticed the letter opens with "Dear friend" and closes with "Your friends." Those phrases were similar to words in messages that Russians sent to Hanssen, O'Neill said. It is not how Americans talk to Russians. "That doesn't ring true to me," he said.

But Peter Earnest, who worked 36 years at the CIA, said it was possible a CIA agent would use a compass and wigs during an undercover operation.

"I am not thrown off by what looks like '70s tradecraft," said Earnest, now executive director of the International Spy Museum in Washington. "We used very traditional means to run spies, to run agents."

## "Dangle Operation"

Earnest thought Fogle was likely ensnared by "a dangle operation," where Russian agents made an opportunity so attractive that the CIA agent could not resist. The Russians might have been motivated to publicly embarrass a CIA agent after the Russians in 2010 had the long-term cover for its ring of 10 spies in the United States blown.

Fogle is widely described as extremely smart, which makes his alleged missteps even harder to understand. He graduated from Colgate in Hamilton, New York, in 2006.

"He was a sharp guy, a smart guy," said Nate Hopson, a high school classmate.

At Colgate, he had a double major of political science and international relations and was elected to the honor society. Classmates recalled him as a politically conservative young man who was focused on his goal.

Flicker, his former roommate, recalled how Fogle didn't want to be anywhere near other students smoking pot, fearful that it somehow might affect his application to the FBI or CIA.

Fogle joined the U.S. foreign service in February 2011, when he had an address in Virginia, according to public records. He was reportedly working as a third secretary in the political division of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The title is among the most junior positions in the U.S. diplomatic corps.

It was unclear what will happen to Fogle now. Earnest, the former CIA official, said it was possible Fogle could return to the CIA.

O'Neill, the former FBI agent, was less confident. "The Russians beamed his face all over the world," he said. "I very much doubt he'll be returning to the field."
