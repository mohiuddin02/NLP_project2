PRINCETON, N.J. – During my class last month, several students stood up and walked out. They joined a protest led by the Black Justice League (BJL). The BJL is a student group that protests the unfair police treatment of African-Americans. There have been several police killings of African-Americans recently.

After class, the BJL went to the office of the Princeton University president. They refused to leave until their demands were met. They demanded that all staff learn about different cultures. They insisted that all students take classes on the history of marginalized people and groups that have been treated unfairly. Another thing they want is for the school to build a space for the appreciation of African-American culture.

One demand received national attention. The BJL demanded that the school rename the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. They also want to remove a painting of Woodrow Wilson in the dining hall. The BJL said that Wilson was a racist, so honoring him is disrespectful to African-Americans.

## Many Of Wilson's Laws Helped Workers

Woodrow Wilson was president of Princeton University and later became president of the United States. He created both forward-thinking and traditional rules.

Wilson was forward-thinking by passing laws that made things better for society. After he became president in 1913, he passed laws against child labor. The new rules protected children from working too much. He also passed laws that gave more rights to workers.

At the end of World War I, Wilson helped to create a world peace treaty. The peace agreement called for the formation of "a general association of nations." This became the League of Nations, which then became the larger United Nations.

Today, the United Nations is an organization to which many countries belong. It allows the countries to work together and promote international cooperation.

## Turning Back The Segregation Clock

However, Wilson's policies for African-Americans were traditional. In some ways, he made things worse for African-Americans. Before Wilson was president, many African Americans worked alongside whites in government jobs. Wilson decided to segregate workplaces and bathrooms by separating whites and blacks, even though this practice had ended after the Civil War.

Wilson gave African-Americans lower jobs than the one they previously had. When they protested, he told them that segregation was good.

History is full of flawed people who did great things. The Founding Fathers and early presidents of the United States, like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, were slave owners. Some people say that at least they were no worse than the average people at their time. However, is that a good enough reason to continue honoring them?

## Reaching Into Wilson's Full History

In New Orleans, a school board decided that schools should not be named after slave owners, even if they were presidents. They renamed George Washington Elementary School after an African-American doctor who fought to end segregation in the way medicine was practiced.

Wilson's name was added to Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs in 1948. At that time, segregation in American was accepted. Today, segregation and slavery are unthinkable. We notice Wilson's racism in today's world more than we did in 1948.

Wilson's contributions to the university, the United States, and the world cannot and should not be erased. Instead, they should be recognized in a way that creates a conversation about how values have changed. Today's conversation should include both his positive achievements and his contributions to America's racist past.

At Princeton, this conversation could educate students and staff who do not know about the entire history of such an important figure. Princeton can still honor and remember Wilson for the good that he did. The university should also remember that Wilson's racist views were wrong. This will present a fuller picture of Wilson's history.
