SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” NASA wants to find and track asteroids, but it needs help. It is asking people around the world for ideas.

Some asteroids can wipe out life as we know it. Finding asteroids might mean keeping planet Earth safe in the future.

In February 2013, a 65-foot-wide asteroid exploded over Russia. It exploded like 500,000 tons of TNT explosives.

Nobody had known it existed before. Afterward, NASA launched a series of contests. It wanted to come up with ways to keep an eye on asteroids that could threaten Earth.

NASA thinks that we have only found 1/100th of the asteroids out there. There are millions flying around our solar system.

## The Big Asteroid Hunt

NASA calls the series of contests the Asteroid Grand Challenge. It says they are "a broad call to action." The hope is to defend Earth against asteroids. Some could be coming down on us right this instant.

"Good ideas can come from anywhere," said Ben Burress. He is an astronomer, but he doesn't work for NASA. "There are millions of asteroids we don't know about, so the idea of more information really is better. Are we going to be hit? Yes. The question is, when and by how big of an asteroid?"

NASA made a video announcing the contests. "Asteroid hunting is an activity everyone can get involved with," the narrator said. "Survival is its own reward. It's up to each of us to protect our planet from asteroids."

## Dinosaurs Didn't Have A Clue

The narrator makes a challenge to all citizens of Earth. He says, "The dinosaurs would have cared if they knew about this problem."

But NASA is out of the business of launching humans into space. So "Earth's defense" is left in the hands of regular people.

NASA first invited "citizen scientists" to join them in March. This was at the South by Southwest festival in Texas.

On Friday, NASA ended the third contest. The task was to make computer programs to find hidden asteroids. It said 422 people from 63 countries submitted programs. They came from Argentina to Zimbabwe.

In all, NASA plans to award $35,000 this year. That will go to people who can figure out how to find hidden asteroids.

## Asteroids Come In All Shapes And Sizes

NASA is now using what its people learned from the contests. It will help "protect the planet from asteroids." said Jason Crusan, who runs a lab in the agency.

This year, NASA's scientists hope to receive help from citizen scientists. They want to be able to find and track asteroids. They need to know their size and shape. Then they need to know whether they are dangerous to life on Earth. Finally, NASA will come up with ways to prevent them from hitting and wiping out plants, animals and humans.

"This is a big global problem that needs everybody to solve," NASA spokeswoman Sarah Ramsey said. "We can't do it alone. That's the whole point of the grand challenge."

NASA plans 10 contests this year.  How long will the entire Asteroid Grand Challenge will last? Ramsey said, "Until the problem's solved."
