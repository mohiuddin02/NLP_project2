WASHINGTON â€” Last year about 1 million of the nation's poorest children got a leg up through Head Start. This 48-year-old federal program helps prepare children for school. It is open to those five and under.

This fall, though, about 57,000 children will be denied a place in Head Start and Early Head Start.

Their loss is fallout from the automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration. These large-scale cuts went into effect after lawmakers in Washington were unable to agree on a budget.

So far, the cuts have slashed more than $400 million from the federal program's $8 billion budget.
## Layoffs And Lower Enrollment

Yasmina Vinci is executive director of the National Head Start Association. According to her, sequestration represented the largest hit to Head Start funding since the program began in 1965.

"The cut has been very painful throughout the country," Vinci said. Nationwide, about 1,600 organizations and agencies receive federal Head Start funding.

According to the latest figures, slots for 51,000 preschoolers were eliminated along with child care slots for 6,000 babies. Children will lose 1.3 million days of service at Head Start centers. More than 18,000 employees will be laid off or see their pay reduced.

Head Start provides preschool services to 3- to 5-year-olds from low-income households. It also offers their families education, health, nutrition and social services. Early Head Start supports the families of infants and pregnant women.

Supporters of the program say it offers major long-term benefits. They claim these are reflected in better school grades, higher earnings and lower crime rates.
## "This Should Be Heartbreaking"

Head Start directors across the country have struggled to find ways to cut costs without reducing the number of children served. Administrators have reduced their staff, ordered unpaid leave and trimmed pensions. They have shortened school years, ended summer programs and held fundraisers.

But in many cases, there was no way to avoid reducing enrollment. In Indiana, at least two Head Start programs used lotteries to decide which preschoolers had to stop attending in March.

"I think it's going to be devastating for families who were hoping ... for a year or two [of preschool] before their children got into kindergarten," said Cheryl Miller, executive director of the Indiana Head Start Association. "These are families that are struggling already. They're not going to be able to pay the cost of some other type of preschool program in their community."

She added, "For all of us, as a nation, this should be heartbreaking."

Peg Tazewell is executive director of Knox County Head Start in Ohio. She chose to increase class sizes rather than reduce the number of spots for children. At the same time, she had to cut six staff positions.

Tazewll was also forced to reduce transportation for students. Parents now will have to drive their children up to six miles to a bus stop rather than have them picked up and dropped off at home. Some of the children will have to ride the bus as far as 20 miles.
## Snowballing Effect Of Cuts

Parents of the children at Tazewell's center typically have low-wage jobs with irregular hours. Many work in nursing homes, fast food restaurants or construction. Tazewell worries that some won't be able to drive their child to and from a bus stop every day.

Tazewell pointed out that these cuts have a snowballing effect on families. The average income for a family of four in her program last year was about $13,000 a year, she said.

"Think about what that means as the price of gas goes up, if parents are having to drive 12 miles a day. They tend to have cars with high mileage, their food stamps are being cut. It's like a thousand cuts."

In Colorado Springs earlier this year, Rachell Ruiz feared that her 2-year-old daughter would not be able to get into Head Start. The local program had announced that there would be fewer spots as a result of the budget cuts.

Ruiz is herself a graduate of Head Start. She wanted her 2-year-old to be in the program because of the experience of her older daughter, who is now 4.
## Head Start Helped Her Daughter

Ruiz's older daughter used to spend her days with her grandmother and rarely had the chance to socialize with other children. There are few children in their neighborhood, where people from other parts of town are afraid to go. "They think they'll get shot in a drive-by," Ruiz said.

Now, after a year in Head Start, her older daughter is much more social. She has learned how to write her name and count to 20.

"Low-income people like me need that place," Ruiz said of Head Start. "You don't have money to go pay for play dates. You don't have the money to go and pay for them to be in a gym or places like that."

Ruiz eventually learned that both girls would have spots in the coming school year.

"The government doesn't realize what it's doing to ... lower-income [people]," Ruiz said. "They're taking away what we don't have. We barely have it and they're taking away. It hurts."
