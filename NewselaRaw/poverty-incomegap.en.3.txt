WASHINGTON â€” Some of the poorest people in the United States live in some of the wealthiest states, says a new report.

Stateline.org news organization said it discovered this after studying a poverty report released by the U.S. government last week. It found that some states with the least amount of poverty in 2013 had some of the highest percentages of people living in deep poverty. The poverty line in 2013 was $23,550 for a family of four. Deep poverty is defined as a family of four living on only $12,000.

Some rich states like Maryland, Massachusetts and Hawaii have managed to reduce the number of people who live in poverty. Yet, the fact that there are so many desperately poor people in these states is a huge problem, some experts say.

## Deep Poverty In Rich States

Take Maryland. In 2013, about 20 percent of Americans were living close to the federal poverty line, living on about $23,000 to $30,000 per family a year. Maryland was the state with the third-lowest poverty rate in the country. Just 13.3 percent of people in the state were considered poor.

However, nearly 38 percent of Maryland's poor were living in deep poverty. Neighboring Washington, D.C., was the only place with a higher rate of deep poverty.

Experts have several possible explanations for this. Some say that people in parts of rural Maryland are too far from jobs and anti-poverty programs. Others say that many extremely poor people live in certain neighborhoods of Baltimore. A recent study found that about 1 in 10 poor people in Maryland live in neighborhoods where the poverty rate tops 40 percent.

The situation is familiar to Bill McCarthy, the head of Catholic Charities of Baltimore. McCarthy described neighborhoods of Baltimore where more than 90 percent of the people live in poverty and many of them are homeless. Also, more than 70 percent of the people there are not working. Many of them have a police record, which makes it harder for them to find a job. He said most programs for getting people out of poverty don't really work well for them.

## Making Things Worse

The programs help in the short run, McCarthy said, but they don't bring "real change to people."

For one thing, some of the poorest people in Baltimore are homeless and don't have an address where food stamps or unemployment checks can be sent.

Other states are experiencing similar problems. About 14.5 percent of the people in Hawaii are poor, the fifth lowest rate in the U.S. However, nearly 37 percent of them live in deep poverty. Food and housing are very expensive in Hawaii, making the problem worse for many who live there.

Nationally, about 34 percent of poor people live in deep poverty. Vermont has the lowest rate of deep poverty, at just 26 percent.

Half of the Americans who are stuck in deep poverty are younger than 25 years old. More than a third of those are younger than 17. To help poor children, the government and charity groups provide health care and school lunches.

## Difficult To Get A Job

Reaching adults in deep poverty can be more difficult. Many programs are limited to parents, or are connected to work.

"Most people in poverty are working," said Elizabeth Lower-Basch. She is with the Center for Law and Social Policy, which is trying to fight poverty. People in deep poverty tend to be out of work or don't have a steady job, she said.

"It's really hard to get a job if you don't have a place to go at night," said Jenny Reed of the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute. "It's very difficult for people who are in deep poverty to start to climb out."

Some people believe that any program that doesn't involve work is doomed to fail. They say that programs should require people to work or get job training if they want help. Having a job is the key to escaping poverty, they say.

Rachel Sheffield is with the Heritage Foundation. She said the country has a huge system for helping poor people, but it hasn't really helped them get jobs so they can support themselves.
