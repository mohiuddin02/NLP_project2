Last week, Roni Dean-Burren received a text from her 15-year-old son.

It was not about dating or money for the movies.

It was about history.

Her son, Coby, had sent her a photo of a page from his McGraw-Hill World Geography textbook. It was from a section called "Patterns of Immigration." The photo showed a speech bubble pointing to the continent of Africa. It read: "The Atlantic Slave Trade between the 1500s and 1800s brought millions of workers from Africa to the southern United States to work on agricultural plantations."

The words alarmed Dean-Burren, who was an English teacher for 11 years and is studying to become a language professor. She has spent much of her life thinking about the power and dangers of language. The reason behind the textbook's words seemed clear.

## "Workers" Not Accurate For Slaves, She Says

Dean-Burren said the book erased the pain of slavery. She added that the textbook revised history, "retelling the story however the winners would like it told."

She posted about this on Facebook. The book called the slaves "workers" and their move to the United States "immigration," she wrote. It made it sound like her African-American ancestors arrived in America willingly and that they were paid for their work.

On Friday, the publishing company, McGraw-Hill Education, apologized. In a Facebook post, it said the book did not really show that Africans were forced into coming to America and working against their will as slaves.

"We believe we can do better," the post read. The company promised to change the speech bubble to say that the African slaves were forced to come. It will also explain that their work was done as slave labor.

## Publisher Will Change Book

McGraw-Hill said the changes will be made in the textbook's online version. They will also be included the next time the book is printed.

McGraw-Hill's statement came only after tens of thousands of people expressed their outrage on social media. Dean-Burren's video about the textbook had at least half a million views.

Dean-Burren has mixed feelings about the outcome. On one level, she said she felt happy. "I understand that McGraw-Hill is a textbook giant, so thumbs up for listening."

On the other hand, few students use the online version of the book. Because her son's textbook is brand-new, another print version may not come out for 10 years.

"I know they can do better," she said. She said the company can send an updated copy of the page to schools. They can also ask schools to return the books in exchange for the new version.

Dean-Burren added that the book downplays slavery. She said it is a way of saying that the pain black people experienced "didn't matter enough to give it a full description."

## Texas Textbooks Criticized Before

The publisher has been criticized for its Texas textbooks before. In 2010, the Texas State Board of Education changed its guidelines for social studies. Many educators said they were not accurate, though.

The guidelines declared that a Muslim headscarf was against women's rights, for instance. They downplayed laws in the South that treated African-Americans unfairly. They also said that the Civil War, which was fought between the Northern and Southern states, was not mainly over slavery. The changes were made only to books sold in Texas.

Edward Countryman is a history professor at Southern Methodist University in Texas. He said it harms students when textbooks do not talk much about race and slavery.

Still, the book had a good effect on at least one student.

Soon after the company decided to change the book, Dean-Burren and her son were sitting next to each other. Coby dialed his mother's cellphone number.

"Why are you calling me?" she asked.

"Answer your phone," he told her. Speaking into his phone, Coby fulfilled a request his mother made when he started high school.

"Mom," he said, "you told me to call you when I realized I could change the world."
