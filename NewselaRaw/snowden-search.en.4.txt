Edward Snowden is hiding from the U.S. government. The government wants to arrest him for giving away secrets about its spying programs.

Snowden is in Russia. We think. His attempt to avoid arrest has turned into a serious game of hide-and-seek. Snowden is getting help winning. The United States is not.

Snowden is being helped by WikiLeaks. That is a group that has leaked government secrets on the Internet. WikiLeaks' leader is Julian Assange. He has been living under protection in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for a year. He is trying to avoid his own legal problems.

WikiLeaks is helping Snowden try to get legal protection in Ecuador.

The group is "interested in preserving Mr. Snowden's rights and protecting him as a person," WikiLeaks'  Baltasar Garzon said. He compared Snowden's situation with Assange's. He called what is happening to both men "an assault against the people."

## Flight To Moscow

On Friday, the United States said that it wanted to extradite Snowden. That means it wanted to bring him home to face charges. U.S. officials have also said that Snowden's passport is not good anymore. That could make it harder for him to travel.

Snowden was in Hong Kong. He had lived there for a few weeks while he was telling reporters about the secret spying of the National Security Agency.

His information started a big discussion about personal privacy against security -- stopping terrorists.

U.S. officials wanted Hong Kong to send Snowden back to the U.S.

But Hong Kong let Snowden fly to Russia on Sunday. This upset the Obama administration. Hong Kong authorities said they had asked the United States for more information about the request to send Snowden back. They said that they could not legally stop him from leaving.

Hong Kong is part of China. The United States has told both Hong Kong and China that it is annoyed.  U.S. officials said that they were answering Hong Kong's questions when Snowden left.

## Hiding In Moscow?

Things became even more interesting when Snowden got to Moscow. There is no direct flight from Moscow to Ecuador. Reports said that Snowden was taking a flight to Cuba on Monday.

The gate where the flight was boarding was mobbed by reporters and television cameras. Some reporters even booked seats on the flight. But Snowden was not on the airplane.

Assange told reporters that Snowden was "healthy and safe." He would not say where he was.

John Kerry is the U.S. Secretary of State. He is in charge of dealing with other countries. He said that Russia should turn Snowden over.

"I would urge them to live by the standards of the law," he said.

But Russian officials were being secretive.

"Overall, we have no information about him," a Russian spokesman told Reuters.

## Request For Asylum

Ecuador has received Snowden's request for asylum. It said it will make a decision in due time. Officials will look at Ecuadorian and international law.

How can Snowden travel without a valid U.S. passport? Assange told the _New York Times_ that WikiLeaks arranged for Ecuador to give Snowden a special travel document.

U.S. officials say they need the telephone and Internet information. It is important to make us safe. They say it has helped stop a lot of big attacks.

Assange says the government is guilty of spying -- on everyone.

"But it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off," he said.
