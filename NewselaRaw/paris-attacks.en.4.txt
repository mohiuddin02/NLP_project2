PARIS, France - Gunmen launched several attacks in Paris on Friday night. Paris is the biggest city in France. The attacks were well-planned. They took place at about the same time.

More than 132 people died, and more than 350 were injured.

The attacks were the worst in France since World War II.

The killers attacked places where people were enjoying a night out. Soccer games, concerts and restaurants were attacked.

French police went into the streets. People hid indoors.

## All Of Europe Is Worried

Friday was the second time this year that Paris has seen large killings. In January, Islamist fighters attacked a newspaper. They also attacked a supermarket owned by Jews. In all, 17 people died. The newspaper was attacked because of cartoons it drew. The cartoons made fun of the prophet Muhammad. He is the most important person in Islam. Muhammad lived hundreds of years ago. People whose religion is Islam are called Muslim.

The attacks will worry people in Europe. A huge number of people from the Middle East, southern Asia and Africa are coming to Europe. Many are escaping wars in their home countries.

At the same time, some Muslims have grown angry with European governments. European leaders are not sure how to handle these problems.

## French Government Will Fight Back

The French president is Fran√ßois Hollande. He promised that France will fight back.

On Saturday, the Islamic State said it did the attacking. Hollande also went on television to blame the group.

Then on Sunday, France sent 10 warplanes to Syria that dropped 20 bombs on places where it is believed the attackers worked.

The Islamic State is a violent group. It is also known as ISIS. It wants to start its own country. ISIS fighters have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq.

The French government first said that all eight of the attackers had been killed. One was shot by police and six others died by setting off bombs. On Sunday, the government said the eighth man was on the run and French police were looking for him.

The worst attack took place at a concert hall. It is a place to see live music. Many hundreds of people had gathered there. They were there to see a show by an American rock band.

The city's deputy mayor said at least 100 people were killed there.

## Two Presidents Speak Out

President Hollande went on TV Friday night to talk to the French people. He said it was an emergency. Now France will send 1,500 soldiers to Paris. It is also adding more military at its borders with other countries. Planes and trains from other countries will still be let in.

In Washington, President Barack Obama said how sorry he was for the French people. He offered the help of the United States "to bring these terrorists to justice."

He said the attack was not just an attack on France. Obama called it "an attack on all of humanity."
