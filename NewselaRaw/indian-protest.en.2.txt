SEATTLE — On a narrow central Idaho highway coursing through thickets of ponderosa pines and along a winding river, members of the Nez Perce tribe made their stand.

Hundreds gathered along U.S. Highway 12 on Monday and Tuesday and formed a barricade — a human wall that blocked the road. They were trying to stop a huge load of equipment bound for the oil tar sands of Alberta, Canada. Reportedly, the load weighed about 644,000 pounds and stretched over 200 feet. The crowd intended on continuing their protests Wednesday and Thursday nights.

The protesters included tribal elders, mothers with young children, and activists from elsewhere. Together they slowed but did not stop the convoy — a group of trucks traveling together — which carried a giant water evaporator. After police arrested about 20 protesters for allegedly disturbing the peace by blocking the road, the convoy continued on its way.

But the protest served to energize environmentalists and [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) who want to stop the giant shipments. Both groups say the convoys clog roadways, disturb tourists and threaten a delicate, unspoiled landscape.
## "Destruction To Those Areas"

The beautiful land around the highway is part of the Nez-Perce National Forests. It is home to white-tail deer, cougars, black bears and mountain goats. Its rivers teem with salmon and trout.

"Everything is in there," said Silas Whitman, a Nez Perce tribal leader who was among those arrested. "Yet they want to make it an industrial corridor" — that is, a road regularly used to transport huge truckloads of material. If it allowed the loads, he said, the tribe would be partly responsible for "the destruction to those areas."

Omega Morgan, the company carrying the water evaporator, said it had been given permission by the Idaho Department of Transportation.

The company said it followed state rules. These require traveling at night, not holding up traffic for longer than 15 minutes, and not making any changes to the roadways or surrounding vegetation.
## Spiritual Value To Tribe

But the U.S. Forest Service claims to have authority if loads travel through protected lands. It opposes the state permit that is allowing convoys to pass through the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests.

In a statement, it said it could not support the permit until it finished finding out whether the convoys might harm the environment.

Forest Service officials are not only looking at possible environmental damage. They are also considering the spiritual value of the land to the tribe.

"That's the part we struggle with, the ... spiritual value of this corridor," said Rick Brazell, forest supervisor for the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests. "We can touch those biological things and get a feel for the numbers. We can't gather ... things you can't see and touch, and they mean a lot. We are on a path to get that information."
## Making A Stand

Tribal officials said they had challenged use of the rural highway — traveled mainly by sportsmen and tourists — as an industrial corridor. But their concerns had been ignored.

"The only way we ... [thought] we could get to the man was through his pocketbook," Whitman said. In other words, they realized people would have to pay attention if businesses started losing money.

Their hope was that their protests would delay the shipments. Delays would cause the shipping company to lose money. And that in turn might discourage further shipments.

Before the protests, tribal leaders told police they understood that officers might have to arrest them.

On Monday, Whitman was the first to be cuffed. He was with his 10-year-old granddaughter. As he was being carried off to jail he told her to get back behind the barricade. "You have to stay here. You can't go with me."
