###PRO: Getting in on the online action

LAS VEGAS — Making online gambling illegal won't work. In the 1920s, the government tried a similar thing when it introduced Prohibition, which banned the sale of alcohol. As our history books show, Prohibition closed the doors of many good businesses. And it led to severe side effects.

These effects — criminal activity, illegal manufacturing and selling of booze, and more — took years to fight. And that battle cost significant public money. All for nothing, because Prohibition was later ended.

Let's not let history repeat itself. Some people want to pass a law ending online gambling. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is part of American history. Since our nation's founding, it's existed in some form or another.

Let's use common sense. We can apply protections used at casinos to online gaming.

## Making Use Of Online Gambling

It would be silly to think that blocking gambling would stop Americans from gambling online. It would happen anyway. All that would be accomplished is that police would be forced to crack down on gamblers. And millions of average American citizens would be turned into criminals.

The black market exists. Today's gambling websites are clearly against state and federal law. There are no regulatory controls or responsibility for the websites to pay taxes. They get away with it because they're based in foreign countries.

Unregulated online gaming is exploding: an estimated 1 million Americans or more spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming sites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to get in on in the newest form of gaming — online.

The U.S. should make use of gambling, not criticize or ignore it. The billions of dollars online gambling generates could pay for services Americans need. The money can be put toward paying for people to monitor the gambling online, for instance.

Modern technologies used in online gaming exist to protect Americans. They can prevent minors and problem gamblers from betting. Safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow online gaming within state borders. These technologies are not perfect, but will continue to improve.

Moreover, when properly put into action, the taxes generated through online gaming can cover the cost of regulating it. Leftover money can help cities and states pay for public services such as education.

States and casino operators should have a say in whether they want to offer online gaming at all. For those that do, many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.

## Domino Effect Of A Ban

It's no secret that many state and local governments desperately need new sources of money. Online gaming could help cities and states get the money they need.

State lotteries are a perfect example of using entertainment to raise money for good purposes. Large numbers of states offer online lotteries. States use lottery money to pay for many things they need. Even lotteries would also be at risk of being shut down by government prohibition.

Banning online gambling could have a domino effect. Popular fantasy sports leagues might have to end under this law as well. The fantasy leagues allow participants to choose players from any team in basketball, football, baseball or any other group of professional athletes. Then, they can create a made-up "team" of their favorite players. They might bet money on whether the players on their team play well in real life.

It wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming were investigated under a prohibition, too. Facebook and other social media feature games that might be looked at closely.

America is well known for business people who have created exciting new technologies. Inspiring businessmen like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents.

We shouldn't let the government prevent new technologies. Other countries are already in on online gaming. We need to get on board, too.

Pretending that things don't change or that the Internet doesn't exist is pointless. America should instead look back at our historical mistake with the prohibition of alcohol. And we should look to the technologies America has developed in the past to inspire us. They will show us how to navigate the challenges and opportunities associated with Internet gaming today.

### CON: It would be making a bad bet

WASHINGTON — Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos are now licensed to operate online gambling sites. It's good news for them. Casinos in those cities have had been making less and less money for seven years. The University of Nevada studied what would happen if casino profits continue to shrink. It found that if this continues, casinos will have to double their online gambling websites to make up for the money their casino houses are losing.

It's no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey are jumping into online gambling. Both states rely on the money gambling brings in to pay for services, like education.

Online gambling became possible when the Department of Justice (DOJ) gutted the Wire Act in 2011, which had banned online gambling. But, then the DOJ decided that only Internet gambling on sports was illegal.

Be careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.

## Problem Gamblers Hurt Families

Congress set up the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) to look into the effects of gambling on Americans. In 1999, it recommended there be no new casinos. And it recommended that Internet gambling be blocked entirely. It said more research was needed on gambling's harms and benefits. Unfortunately this has not happened.

And online gambling supporters are asking Congress for new laws. They want to spread online gambling nationwide. Allowing this would give the false appearance that online gambling is somehow safe.

Online gambling will make gambling easier. But where there is an increase in availability of gambling, there's also a documented increase in problem gambling. Abuse of gambling leads to people running out of money, collapsing marriages, and jail. Sometimes people even end their own lives.

Promoters of online gambling say problem gamblers make up only a small percentage of overall players. But, the numbers don't take into account ripple effects. Studies show that a problem gambler will affect an average of five to 10 other people.

Even recovering problem gamblers may not be able to undo the damage done. Gamblers can lose enormous amounts of money. Their problem can destroy relationships, particularly their marriages. Couples may separate or divorce because of gambling.

The NGISC said it found plenty of proof that problem gambling increases anxiety in marriages and families. Its survey of Americans found that gambling problems were a strong cause of divorce.

## Gambling's Big Cost To Society

The total cost to society cannot be known. The increase in crime, money problems, lost jobs and family break-up damage our society. They have led Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols to estimate the cost of gambling to outweigh its benefits by 3-to-1.

Internet gambling is particularly worrisome. Evidence overwhelmingly shows that problem gambling is three to four times more common among online gamblers than non-Internet gamblers.

Online gambling is clearly more dangerous than other forms of gambling. It's available 24/7 and games move quickly. People often play games alone — and play several games at once. It's possible to lose more money than you actually have.

Online gambling companies claim they will be able to screen out minors. The companies say they can ensure that players are who they say they are. They say they can also validate that players are physically located where they say they are.

However, the FBI has countered this claim. In a 2009 letter to Congress, it stated that online gambling sites claim that they can validate age and location. However, "they are more than likely relying on credit card information and geo-location to gather this information. Both can be spoofed."

Legalizing online gambling may seem like an attractive solution to a state's money shortfalls. Evidence, however, suggests the contrary. Gambling hurts the poor more than the rich. It takes money away from local businesses. At the same time it fuels social problems, which cost money to fix.

Both sides of this debate agree that letting each state set its own online gambling rules will not work. Congress needs to act in the interest of families and communities. It should update the Wire Act to block Internet gambling.
