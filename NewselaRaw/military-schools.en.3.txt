EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. â€” At school, sixth-grader Damian Rattler sits on a chair held together with tape.

Water leaks stain his school's ceiling. There are cracks on the playground.

"We need new stuff," Damian said. He goes to Irving L. Branch Elementary School on Edwards Air Force Base.

Branch is one of 10 California schools on military bases in terrible condition. The United States Department of Defense said they are among the most broken-down schools on military bases in the country. The department is responsible for the schools on bases.

Branch is the eighth worst out of 160 schools on its list.

## Money Has Not Magically Appeared

The government has set aside $945 million to fix up the schools. However, it will only pay 80 percent of the cost. To use the money, school districts or their states must pay the remaining 20 percent.

Mark Wright is a Department of Defense spokesman. California has more schools on the repair list than any other state. It is the only state, though, that has not found money for the repairs, Wright said.

At Branch Elementary, 60 percent of the students' parents are in the military.

"It's just sad to think that somebody is out there protecting our country," principal Dennison Winchell said. "And at home their kids are going to a school with great teachers, but with awful" buildings.

## They Cannot Pay For Repairs

School officials at Branch would like to replace the roof. They would like to put in new playground equipment and new doors for classrooms and offices. They could also use better lighting and air conditioning.

The repairs will cost $27.8 million. Branch's district, Muroc Joint Unified, would have to pay $5.5 million of that.

Trevor Walker is a district official with Muroc Joint Unified. The district does not have the money.

"We've tried pretty much anything we can think of in hopes we could find that match money," Walker said. They still could not afford it.

Public school districts usually pay for major repairs and construction with money from property taxes. These are taxes that property owners have to pay. Part of the money from property taxes goes to schools and education. Military base schools are on government land, which is not taxed. They do not receive any money from property taxes.

## Government Is Slow To Help

State Senator Jean Fuller from Bakersfield is a California lawmaker. Last year, she suggested a law that would give the 20 percent matching money to some of the base schools. However, the bill did not even make it to a vote.

Without government help, California may have to spend money for their repairs itself.

"We cannot let this stand," Fuller said.

Sierra Sands is located about 70 miles from Edwards Air Force Base. It has has two schools high on list that need to be fixed up. Murray Middle School is ranked fourth, and Burroughs High School is ranked 10th. Murray was built in the 1940s on the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. It is in such bad condition that the district needs to completely rebuild it.

The district is struggling to find the money, superintendent Ernie Bell said.

"We're seriously having some concerns about whether or not we can afford it," Bell said. "We're scraping everything we can to make it happen."

Muroc Unified has spent thousands of dollars on the Branch school design. However, it has not found the money to begin construction.

Sammy Rattler's wife is in the Air Force and has been sent overseas five times. They have a child attending Branch. The school, he said, needs more money.

"When children are left behind here," Rattler said, "parents want the best opportunities possible for them." Parents also want them to go to a school that is safe.
