TOKYO, Japan â€” The Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan was destroyed by a large wave in 2011. Radioactive material was released into the air and soil.

Many children lived in the area. A new study says these children have thyroid cancer at a rate 20 to 50 times that of children elsewhere. Thyroid cancer is a disease in which cells in the thyroid gland do not grow normally.

The Japanese government had claimed that more thyroid cancer was found only because it checked all the children. The study's authors argue that their study showed that many more children had thyroid cancer than expected.

Most of the 370,000 children in Fukushima prefecture, or state, have been given checkups. A total of 137 of those children seem to have thyroid cancer, according to the most recent numbers. A year ago, 112 children had thyroid cancer. Scientists estimate that only about 1 or 2 of every million children get thyroid cancer each year.

"This is more than expected and emerging faster than expected," said the study's main author, Toshihide Tsuda. "This is 20 times to 50 times what would be normally expected."

## A Hard Connection To Make

The study was released online last week. It is also being published in the November issue of Epidemiology. The medical journal is produced by the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology. An epidemiologist studies the spread of disease. The information comes from tests overseen by Fukushima Medical University.

It is not always easy to make a connection between radiation and cancer. Radiation is energy from radioactive material and can be extremely dangerous. Individual cases of cancer cannot be linked to radiation. Routine checkups, like the ones in Fukushima, lead to quicker discovery of cancers. The number of cancer cases goes up, which is called a "screening effect."

Right after the disaster, Shunichi Yamashita was the leading doctor brought in to Fukushima. He repeatedly said that the radiation would not cause cancer. The thyroid checks were ordered just to be safe, according to the government.

Tsuda, a professor at Okayama University in Japan, said the study shows that the government may not be right about the radiation. The tests continue to be performed today.

Thyroid cancer among children is definitely linked to radiation, the study said. If treated, thyroid cancer is rarely deadly. However, patients have to take medicine for the rest of their lives.

## Is The Study Correct?

Scientists do not agree if the study's findings are correct.

Scott Davis is a professor at the Department of Epidemiology of the School of Public Health in Seattle, Washington. He said there is not enough information to figure out how much radiation each child got.

Two international health organizations studied the Fukushima disaster. They are the World Health Organization and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. The groups said that more people would not get cancer because of the radiation. Davis agrees with them.

David J. Brenner, a professor at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, has a different view. He agreed that scientists need to know more about each child's level of radiation. However, he said that the higher thyroid cancer rate in Fukushima is "real."

## "Radiation Is Behind Sicknesses"

People are not allowed to live within 12 miles of the Fukushima nuclear plant. Workers are trying to clean up the dirt and soil. Even many people who live in safe areas have left. They worry about sickness, especially for their children.

Noriko Matsumoto used to work as a nurse in a town outside the 12-mile area. She fled to Tokyo with her then-11-year-old daughter a few months after the disaster. At first, she was not concerned about radiation. But she became worried when her daughter started getting nosebleeds and rashes.

"My daughter has the right to live free of radiation," she said. "We can never be sure about blaming radiation, but I personally feel radiation is behind sicknesses."

Andrew F. Olshan is a doctor who studies diseases at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. He pointed out that research after a disaster is complicated and difficult.

Still, the study is important, he said. More scientists should begin looking into how the Fukushima disaster affected health, Olshan said.
