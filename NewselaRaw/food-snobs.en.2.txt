What a pain it is to eat kale when it is not as crisp as it was when first plucked from the ground. Squash that's a few days old is not bad either, but it could be better. It could be a day old. Or not old.

A new study found that Americans are pretty picky about what gets to stay in their refrigerators. The study was published this week by a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University. One of the most common excuses for throwing out food is that people "want to eat only the freshest food." The other common reason is a fear of food poisoning.

## Food Fussiness

Most of them show that some wealthy people feel they can throw away food. These people feel comfortable tossing out food that is likely still good to eat. They can afford to buy more food that is fresher.

This sort of fussiness over food has has become more and more popular in the United States. The fussiness can be a good thing. It has, after all, made people appreciate fruits and vegetables more. Their appreciation then increases their willingness to pay a bit more for food. They pay to get fruits and vegetables from smaller family farms, many of which struggle to make money against giant farm businesses that can sell food more cheaply.

## Labels Both Help And Confuse

Caring too much about how green an avocado is or how many days it has been since a peach was picked can also be a very bad thing. It encourages people to throw out perfectly good food because it is not fresh enough.

The amount of food that goes to waste in the United States has increased in recent years. In 2012, Americans threw out about 35 million tons of food. That is almost a quarter more food than Americans tossed out in 2000.

Roughly half of all food waste comes from families and other individuals, not businesses.

The problem is often caused by the unreasonable standards we have set for foods sold in stores. Several studies have pointed to this very problem. When people buy food, they sometimes get confused about labels. Someone might think that a label suggesting when a food will stay fresh until is actually a warning to not eat the product after that date.

The most recent research confirms that food poisoning is indeed on many people's minds. But it also suggests that food snobbery is not helping either. There are justified reasons to throw away food. "This apple isn't good enough for me," isn't one of them.
