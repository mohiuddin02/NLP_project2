COLUMBIA, Mo. â€” J'Mon Moore is a football player for the University of Missouri. His team is called the Tigers.

Many students at Moore's school are feeling angry these days. They are unhappy about racism at the school. They want school leaders to do something to stop it.

The school's problems began a few months ago. Several black students said they were called racist names.

## Students Were Angry At University President

Many black students think racism is getting worse at the school. They say they no longer feel safe.

Many students became angry at the school's president, Tim Wolfe. They said he was not doing enough to fight racism at the school. It seemed like he just did not care.

Then a black student named Jonathan Butler went on a hunger strike. He said he would not eat until Wolfe gave up his job as president.

Moore knew about all this. He decided he had to do something to help Butler.

## Thirty Players Joined Protest

Moore spoke to Tigers teammate Anthony Sherrils. Then the two of them spoke to teammates Ian Simon and Charles Harris. Soon, the plan to help Butler began to spread.

Saturday night the players met with their coach, Gary Pinkel. They told him they planned to stop playing until Wolfe was gone. Coach Pinkel told his players to go ahead with their plan.

Later that night, the football players' protest began. Thirty black players announced that they would no longer play or practice. They said they would not play as long as Wolfe remained the school's president.

## President Steps Down

Football is very important at the University of Missouri. Many people did not want the games to stop. More and more people said Wolfe should leave.

On Monday, Wolfe announced that he would step down. The football players had beat him. Soon the school will have a new president.

The players wanted "to make a difference," Moore said. Now they will be remembered in the history books.

## Football Mattered Less Than A Man's Life

Simon said Butler's hunger strike made the players feel they had to do something. Butler's life was in danger.

Simon said the players all love football. Football is only a game, though. Some things are more important, he said.

The players learned that they have the power to change things, Harris said. They did not understand that before.

The players were able to bring about real change. Maybe now things will get better at their school.
