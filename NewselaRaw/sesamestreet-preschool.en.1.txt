NEW YORK — Most Americans born since the mid-1960s have a favorite "Sesame Street" skit. Jennifer Kotler Clarke watched hers on a black-and-white television set in her family's Bronx apartment.

There were two aliens: One of them had long arms that didn't move, while the other had short, moving arms. The aliens wished to eat apples from a tree, and they succeeded, after a couple of minutes, by working together. "Let's call this cooperation," one of them says. "No," the other replies, "let's call it Shirley."

Clarke grew up to be the show's vice president for research and evaluation, and she has long believed that the program's laughs and lessons stick with children. Now, important academic research appears to back her up.

The most authoritative study ever done on the impact of "Sesame Street" was released on June 8. It finds that the famous show on public TV has delivered lasting educational benefits to millions of American children. The study claims the show's benefits are as powerful as the ones children get from going to preschool.

## Viewers More Likely To Stay At Grade Level

The research was conducted by the University of Maryland's Melissa Kearney and Wellesley College's Phillip Levine. The authors found that the show has left children more likely to stay at the appropriate grade level for their age. This effect is particularly evident among boys, African-Americans and children who grow up in disadvantaged areas.

After "Sesame Street" was introduced, children living in places where they could watch the show started doing better at school. The researchers saw a 14 percent drop in a student's likelihood of being behind in the classroom. Levine and Kearney note how Head Start, the pre-kindergarten program for low-income Americans, delivers a similar benefit.

They also think "Sesame Street's" focus on presenting viewers with academic lessons had an impact. Heavy on reading and math, the TV show appears to have helped prepare children for school.

It might seem hard to believe that a TV show could have such effects. The results, however, build on government studies from the 1960s that found big short-term benefits in watching the show. There have also been years of studies of groups of children, called "focus groups," by the team of academic researchers who help write "Sesame Street" scripts. Several other researchers have reviewed the study, and none are known to have questioned its results.

## Experts Review Need For Preschool Funding

The results also raise a provocative question, at a time when many lawmakers are pushing to spend more money on early-childhood education: Do kids need preschool if a TV show works just as well?

Yes, say economists, who make estimates about how money should be spent to achieve the best educational outcomes. The "Sesame Street" educational team agrees. The study's authors believe Head Start was designed to provide more than an academic boost: It delivers family support, medical and dental services, and development of emotional skills that help kids learn how to become social.

Levine and Kearney see the study as a clear lesson in the value of a very cheap mass-media addition to preschool. The potentially controversial implication they embrace from the study isn't about early-childhood education. It's about the trend at colleges to use low-cost massive open online courses, or MOOCs.

"'Sesame Street,'" Levine and Kearney write, was the original MOOC. "If we can do this with 'Sesame Street' on television, we can potentially do this with all sorts of electronic communications," Kearney said. "It's encouraging because it means we might be able to make real progress in ways that are affordable and scalable," meaning that they can be done in a larger way to reach more people.

## In 1970s, One-Third Of U.S. Toddlers Watched

"Sesame Street" debuted in 1969 with a mixed cast of humans and brightly colored fuzzy Muppets, including Oscar the Grouch, Bert and Ernie, and, of course, Big Bird. It was the country's first children's program that was designed to be educational, and it was an immediate hit: In the early 1970s, one-third of all American toddlers watched it.

That's the kind of share of American viewers that the Super Bowl gets. What's even more striking, though, is that another third of the nation's toddlers couldn't have watched the show if they wanted to, because they didn't have the right kind of antenna to tune in to their local public television station.

Levine and Kearney pinpointed which cities had high or low levels of access to the show, based on what areas had the right antennas then. Then they used government information to track children from those cities throughout school, to see whether they were staying at grade level. They couldn't study individual people, or even determine whether people in particular areas watched the show. However, they found a large effect on the educational progress of children who, because of where they lived, were much more likely to be able to watch. The effect appears to fade out before high school graduation, they also found.

## Show Offers Academic Subjects For City Kids

"Sesame Street" writers design their shows to have those effects.

From the start, the program used academic subjects designed to help children. They particularly focused on low-income kids living in cities who were preparing for school.

At first the writers focused on basics: letters, numbers, cooperation. Over the decades they expanded to include research on what children needed to succeed in the classroom and in life. "We're constantly changing the show, for good reasons," said Rosemarie Truglio, who designs educational content for "Sesame Street."

Kearney grew up loving "Sesame Street." Levine, her co-author on the study, was of school age when the show hit the air. Kearney remembers running through her house with her sisters, singing a Big Bird song about the alphabet. Her favorite character was the Count — the one who most resembled an economist.
