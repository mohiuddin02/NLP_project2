WASHINGTON â€” Julia A. Pierson, the director of the Secret Service, resigned on Wednesday following a string of high-profile security lapses. President Barack Obama had lost confidence in her ability to lead the troubled agency.

Pierson stepped down following a Sept. 19 incident in which Omar Gonzalez, a U.S. Army veteran, ran into the White House with a knife in his pocket.

Pierson, a 30-year Secret Service veteran, was named director only 18 months ago. She was the first woman to head the elite force responsible for protecting the president, his family and visiting foreign leaders.

Fresh security breaches, and Pierson's repeated stumbles during a combative House of Representatives hearing Tuesday, led to growing calls in Congress for her resignation. Obama quickly agreed.

"Over the last several days, we've seen recent and accumulating reports raising questions about the performance of the agency," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. "The president concluded that new leadership of that agency was required."

## Security Improvements Are Called For

In another recent potential threat, officials said, a private security guard armed with a pistol rode in an elevator with the president during a Sept. 16 visit to Atlanta. The incident violated agency rules over who can carry a weapon near the president.

The gun was discovered only after agents complained the guard was acting oddly. Officials said they subsequently discovered the guard was a felon, with multiple convictions for assault and battery.

Jeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security, said he had appointed Joseph Clancy as acting director of the Secret Service. Clancy headed the Secret Service presidential protective unit before retiring in 2011.

Johnson also said he had ordered his top deputy, Alejandro Mayorkas, to take charge of the internal Secret Service investigation of the Gonzalez incident.

Johnson said he would put together a panel of outside experts to recommend improvements to White House security and Secret Service operations.

The House Judiciary Committee will also hold hearings into the Secret Service next month.

## The Agency Will Be Investigated

Pierson said it was painful to quit while the Secret Service was "reeling from a significant security breach."

Leaving, Pierson said, was "the noble thing to do." She had decided to resign after meeting with Johnson. The two agreed "we were at the point where it was going to be hard for the department and president to have confidence in the Secret Service leadership if I didn't step down."

Several senior Democrats joined Republicans in saying the next director should come from outside the agency.

To bring about needed reforms, Democratic Congressman Bernie Thompson said, "the Secret Service needs a seasoned law enforcement professional." It should be someone "who is not a product of the Secret Service."

Pierson's departure won't end congressional scrutiny of the agency, several lawmakers said.

## The Latest In A Series Of Lapses

The Secret Service had serious problems even before Pierson became director, said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa. "Her resignation certainly does not resolve them."

Pierson had been appointed in the wake of a 2012 scandal in which a dozen agents allegedly hired prostitutes in Colombia while preparing for a presidential trip. Two other lapses also led to her appointment. The first was a 2011 shooting attack on the White House to which agents failed to respond. The second was a 2009 incident in which an uninvited couple attended a state dinner at the White House.

The latest uninvited visitor was Gonzalez.

According to court papers, Gonzalez, 42, climbed over the north fence of the White House at 7:19 p.m. on Sept. 19. He sprinted across the lawn without anyone attempting to stop him. He then opened a glass door and a wooden door in the North Portico.

He allegedly knocked over an agent inside the door and wrestled with guards who chased him into the East Room. He was finally subdued outside the Green Room. Obama had taken off in Marine One, the presidential helicopter, moments earlier.

## Slow Release Of Information

During her grilling on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Pierson struggled to explain what had happened. She could give no good reason why agents failed to stop Gonzalez before he entered the executive mansion, and why an alarm was muted. She also had trouble explaining why the agency did not acknowledge for more than a week that Gonzalez had forced his way deep inside the building before he was tackled.

Lawmakers from both parties criticized her and her aides for giving misleading or inaccurate information about the incident. Some accused her of being evasive in her answers, and her support quickly evaporated.

Secret Service officials initially said Gonzalez was unarmed. In fact, he carried a black folding knife in his pocket, the agency later acknowledged.

Investigators also found hundreds of rounds of ammunition for shotguns, pistols and rifles in his car, which was parked nearby.

After his arrest, Gonzalez told agents that "he was concerned the atmosphere was collapsed" and that he needed to get the information to Obama.

Gonzalez faces a federal charge of entering a restricted building while carrying a deadly weapon, along with other charges connected to the ammunition in his car. If convicted, he could face 16 years in prison.
