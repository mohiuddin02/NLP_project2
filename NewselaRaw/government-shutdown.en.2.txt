WASHINGTON — The U.S. government could shut down next week if Congress does not pass legislation to keep paying for the government past Monday. Sort of.

In reality, the government would not actually shut down.

Agents would still patrol the nation's borders. Prisoners would still be held in federal jails. Letter carriers would still deliver the mail. And soldiers would still remain at their posts, though they might not get paid for their service right away.

The House of Representatives and the Senate must approve a dozen spending bills by Sept. 30 — the last day of the budget year — to keep the government running. The legislation has gotten tied up by Republican efforts to stop money going to the President's new health care plan.

## Government Has Shut Down Before

It is true that there would be a partial shutdown if Congress does not approve the spending bills on time.

What does that mean?

Social Security payments and passport and visa applications could be delayed. The National Institutes of Health could stop accepting patients for research. National parks, museums and monuments could close.

"Hundreds of thousands of government workers will not be working," said Brian Deese of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). "Even those who are will not be receiving paychecks." The OMB manages government agencies and helps the White House with the budget.

The House is run by Republicans. It passed a proposal last week to keep the government open until mid-December. The catch is the measure also would stop money from going to the federal health care law. Large parts of that law, known by some as Obamacare, are scheduled to start on Tuesday. The Democratic-controlled Senate expects to defeat the House bill, leaving the two sides without a way forward.

Congress has failed to meet the deadline for approving spending bills 17 times since the 1970s. The results were partial shutdowns lasting from one day to three weeks. The last time was for a 21-day stretch in December 1995 and January 1996.

## Agencies Planning For Partial Shutdown

Maya MacGuineas is president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The group wants lower government debt. She said a shutdown would not have as "profound or immediate an impact as people think." But, she said, "the fact that this is how we govern is so shameful."

The Obama administration told federal agencies last week to begin planning for a partial shutdown.

Managers have to decide which employees are essential and would be required to come to work. The others would be sent home.

The president and people he appointed would still report to work. Lawmakers would do the same, but would decide who on their staffs was essential.

The president has flexibility in deciding what is essential, Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf told reporters. "So how much of the government stops working and how much keeps working is not something we have a good basis for predicting."

The administration would rely on a variety of documents. It would get Department of Justice legal opinions and OMB planning memos. History would also play a part.

In 2011, during a similar shutdown threat, the government estimated that about all but 800,000 of the more than 2 million federal employees would go to work. This year's estimates are similar.

## Research Programs Would Be Halted

The law requires agencies to be staffed with unsalaried employees if they deal with national security, process benefit payments or protect life and property, according to the OMB. Government operations not directly paid for by the Treasury would also continue.

That means disaster aid to the Colorado flood victims would proceed but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would stop monitoring diseases. Mail delivery would continue but loan programs to small businesses, farmers and homeowners would cease. Inspectors would still regulate food and drugs but research programs would be halted. Taxes would be collected but judges would have to go home when the courts run out of funds.

Even the health care law that is the focus of the dispute between Republicans and Democrats would continue to be implemented. Much of its funding comes from other sources, including new taxes and fees and cuts to other programs.

Barry Anderson worked for the White House budget office during the 1995-96 shutdown. He said the task of determining which employees are essential is difficult and keeps changing.

For example, Anderson said, the OMB could determine that while the National Zoo must close, the workers who feed the animals must work. Later, as a shutdown goes on, employees in charge of buying food for the animals may have to come in.

## Will Workers Get Paid Afterward?

After the government reopens, lawmakers must decide whether employees — both those who worked and those who didn't — should get paid. In the 1990s shutdowns the workers were paid, but it was not guaranteed.

Chris Edwards is a budget expert at the Cato Institute, which favors limited government. He said that if there is a positive outcome of a shutdown it could be that people may start thinking about which services the government provides are necessary and which should be permanently dropped.

"You can ask why do we do certain things in the first place," he said.
