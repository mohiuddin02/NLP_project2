LOS ANGELES â€” Steve Barnett was put in charge of Capitol Records in 2012. The record company was started in 1942. It had recorded albums for big stars in music like the Beatles and Frank Sinatra.

When Barnett came to Capitol, he cleared out the old records hanging on the office walls. They were a sign of what he had to fix. Capitol was stuck in the past. It could not think about the future, Barnett said.

Barnett had been president of Columbia Records. Columbia was the top record label in the United States. Capitol was the fifth-largest, but it moved up to second place after Barnett took over.

## No More Yesterday

Barnett made big changes at Capitol Records. He picked different artists. He signed two of the biggest acts of last year, Sam Smith and 5 Seconds of Summer.

Record companies have to sign contracts with musicians and artists to record their albums. Then the companies sell and promote the records.

The 2015 Grammy awards were good to Capitol Records' artists. Their musicians got 46 nominations. Smith got six nominations for his first album and was nominated in the top four awards: best record, album, song and new artist.

Capitol had been hurt by changes in the music business over the years. Fans went from buying CDs to downloading songs and albums. Now they can hear some music online for free. Experts said Capitol was managed badly. It did not spend money on developing new artists.

## Turning The Beat Around

Universal Music Group bought Capitol Records in 2012. They brought new owners to Capitol. The owners said they wanted to help the workers turn the company around.

The new owners said the people working at Capitol already had the skills, talent and dedication. They just needed the right tools to become great.

The first step for the new owners was finding the right leader to make Capitol better. They hired Barnett.

Barnett had been a manager of music stars. He also worked with singer Adele and the popular boy band, One Direction.

Barnett has been a fan of Capitol's artists since he was a kid growing up in England. He liked the Beatles and Beach Boys.

## Everyone's A Fan

Many artists and their managers are fans of Barnett.

Singer Sam Smith said he met with many record companies before he signed on with Capitol. He said he liked how Capitol respected him and his music. It was a done deal when he met Barnett, he said.

Barnett also liked Sam Smith. He felt Smith would be a success. He was right. Smith's first album sold millions of copies. Only Taylor Swift's "1989" and the "Frozen" soundtrack sold more copies than him last year. Katy Perry's album "Prism" also did very well for Capitol.

Barnett said Capitol Records is back to working well. Two years after he arrived, Capitol is on a new path.

"I think we're in the game," Barnett said.
