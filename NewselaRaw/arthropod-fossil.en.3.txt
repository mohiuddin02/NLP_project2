Long before the dinosaurs, a giant sea creature was one of the largest animals on Earth.

The Aegirocassis benmoulae lived about 480 million years ago. It swam in a shallow sea in what is now the Sahara Desert in Morocco. It grew up to 7 feet in length.

Scientists say the Aegirocassis benmoulae is an early member of the arthropod family. Arthropods are animals with skeletons on the outside of their bodies, like shells. The sea creature was an ancient ancestor of cockroaches, butterflies and lobsters.

"It is one of the biggest arthropods that ever existed, far bigger than any arthropod today," said Peter Van Roy. He is a paleobiologist at Yale University who helped find the sea creature. Paleontologists and paleobiologists study fossils of ancient creatures to see how they changed over time.

A paper describing the creature was published Wednesday in the scientific magazine Nature.

## Odd-Looking Mouths

The giant sea creature was part of a group of animals that died out long ago. The group was called the anomalocaridid. They were the largest animals of the Cambrian time period, about 543 million to 490 million years ago. The recently discovered sea creature is the latest of these animals to be found. It is more than twice the size of the biggest of its older relatives. They lived before the earliest dinosaurs.

The anomalocaridids had flat bodies and lived in water. All of them had two growths in the front of their mouths. These growths were mostly used to grasp prey like worms. However, the growths on the sea creature just discovered were shaped differently. In the new creature, they formed a series of spikes, like a net. The creature used them to catch tiny animals called plankton in their mouths like whales do.

The sea creature seems to have been common, Van Roy said. It was named in honor of Moroccan fossil collector Mohamed Ben Moula, who found it. Ben Moula and Van Roy have found dozens of the Aegirocassis benmoulae fossils in the Moroccan desert.

Van Roy said the creatures may have come together to molt â€” shed their shells as they grew. Or they may have lived together in a group. "It is interesting we found so many of them," he said.

## An Exciting Find

Arthropods first showed up about 530 million years ago. Today, arthropods have the largest number of different animals on the planet. There are so many of them because they adapt easily to different kinds of environments.

Early arthropod fossils are hard to find, which made this particular find so exciting.

Most fossils are the remains of the hard parts of animal, like shells and bone. Soft tissues like skin and muscles decay quickly after death, explained John Paterson. He is a professor at the University of New England in Australia and was not involved in the study.

"However, these extraordinary fossils are soft-bodied, which are typically very rare," he said.

Van Roy explained that giant storms sometimes caused mud to flow into the ancient sea. The mud smothered everything at the bottom, including Aegirocassis benmoulae. The mud turned the creatures' soft tissues to stone.

"Sites like this are extremely rare," he said.

## Old Mystery Solved

The fossils were in good condition. This helped scientists solve an old mystery.

Scientists wondered why the legs of most arthropods have two parts. Scientists did not know how they got this way.

Studying the sea creatures helped them figure that out.

Van Roy said the scientists have not yet looked at most of the fossils they found.

"We have something like 5,000 or 6,000 specimens," he said.

They also found fossils of later arthropods. These include ancient horseshoe crabs, some of which look just like modern-day horseshoe crabs. They also found relatives of the jellyfish, and early starfish and snails.
