WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. â€” Back when Navajo elder Jay Tsosie was a skinny, rowdy schoolboy, government teachers tried to drive out a part of Tsosie he considers central to his very being: his native language.

When caught whispering Navajo to classmates, teachers washed his mouth with soap. They forced him to kneel on pencils, holding two heavy bottles in his outstretched arms. At the time, a federal government agency tried to force Native American children to forget their language and culture.

"Some days," said Tsosie, now 77, "I had to write on the blackboard 100 times: 'I will not speak Navajo.'"

## "Our Sacred Language"

Many years later, the Navajo language has caused a major problem in the upcoming election for president of the Navajo Nation. With 300,000 members, the Navajos are the country's largest Native American group.

Last week, the tribe's high court removed Christopher Deschene, a candidate for president, from the ballot after his rivals claimed he wasn't fluent in Navajo. Under tribal law, the president of the Navajo Nation must be able to speak the language.

The subject may be politics, but the underlying issue is Navajo identity. "Our sacred language defines us as individuals and as a Nation," the justices wrote.

On Thursday, the high court delayed the election.

Some support the court's decision and say that speaking Navajo is essential to leading their 300,000 members. The rule was a response to the government's efforts to destroy the native language.

## Candidate Called A Role Model

To ignore the rule, they say, insults elders, like Tsosie, who were punished for speaking Navajo.

But a 94-year-old woman who said she was Deschene's grandmother says he speaks Navajo well enough to carry on a conversation about his plans as president. "I understand him," she said in the Navajo language.

Others say it punishes younger Navajos, who are doing just what their own tribe encourages them to do. They are getting an education in the outside world.

Along the state road south to Gallup, New Mexico, is a route called the Code Talker Highway. The name honors Navajo soldiers in the U.S. Army. During World War II, the soldiers used Navajo as a code to send secret messages. Billboards along the route show young Navajos in graduation gowns. They encourage young Navajos to "Climb the Ladder," "Go Out Into the World" and "Learn English."

Deschene, 43, was born in Los Angeles but grew up in Indian Country. He earned his master's degree in engineering and later received a law degree. He also served in the Marine Corps. As a result, many call Deschene a role model, not an embarrassment.

## Is The Language Dying?

"We teach our kids to get that education and then to come back to the reservation and help their people, just like Chris did," said Art Huskey, 71. "Part of the sacrifice might be forgetting some of their Navajo."

Huskey and other protesters say that many years ago, 90 percent of tribal first-graders spoke the language fluently. Now only 30 percent speak it. He said only one of his four children speaks Navajo, and none of his grandchildren.

Huskey was among the many people who protested Thursday outside the government building in Window Rock, Arizona. Window Rock is the capital of the Navajo Nation. The area, known for its rock formations, is sacred in Navajo culture.

One protester, Mattie Christensen, said she feels 100 percent Navajo, no matter what she speaks.

But Sarah White says the tribal president needs to speak Navajo. She said if her grandson ever ran for tribal president, she would tell him, "Learn the language first. That's the only way you're going to feel and taste the experience of everyday Navajo life."

## Tense Moments At A Protest

Although Tsosie still speaks Navajo, he said he won't teach his grandchildren the difficult language. Navajo has no simple way to say some English words. For example, "computer" becomes "thinking metal."

"What's the use?" Tsosie said. "We've been discouraged from using our language all our lives. Why make this an issue now when we have a bright young lawyer who wants to return to lead our tribe? Speaking the language is not going to do him any good, other than talking to the old folks. There are translators for that."

The protest became tense when a tribal officer ordered activists to remove their signs. "It doesn't look good" to the outside world, said Tribal Police Sergeant Stanley Ashley.

In the end, the signs stayed, but there were moments of doubt. Three elders read one sign, but couldn't translate it. Finally, one spoke up, "Somebody here wrote this sign. We should be able to figure this out."
