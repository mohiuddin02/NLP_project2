BEIJING, China â€” The 59-year-old Beijing woman got a shock while visiting her new local graveyard, China Dragon Garden: She said she discovered her own name written in gold letters on a black granite tombstone.

If there was any bright side, at least she wasn't "dead" alone. Hundreds of other people had the same thing happen to them. These people were all very much alive but had tombstones at the cemetery. Among them was even one Yao Ming, the name of China's most famous basketball player and a former NBA star.

The woman, identified only by the family name Wang, complained to the cemetery staff. She did not get any real answers, according to a report in Beijing's Jinghua Times. Businesses in China sell gravesites for $5,000 to $8,500 apiece. The cemetery owners are accused of erecting hundreds of graves to apparently make possible customers believe that the cemetery was popular. The popularity is meant to boost shoppers' confidence to buy a plot.

## Woman Claims Reputation Has Been Harmed

Wang went to court this week, complaining that the people who run the cemetery had smeared her name and her family's reputation. Three of her relatives also had fake graves at the site, she said. She is seeking an apology and $16,000 in payment for emotional distress.

Burials are a controversial business in China these days. They are also profitable. The country of more than 1.3 billion sees about 10 million deaths a year. Rising land prices and an aging population have limited space for graves and driven up the cost of plots so much that many Chinese complain, only half-jokingly, that it's too expensive to die.

The lack of gravesites in Beijing has gotten so extreme that the city government doubled the money this year that it gives to help pay for sea burials. Families who opt to bury people in the ocean and save space on land can receive about $640.

"The demand (for cemetery space) is relatively stable, but prices keep on going up," said Guo Yu, a 25-year-old sales representative at Wanfo Huaqiao cemetery in suburban Beijing. The cemetery is one of the city's most respected. Guo said while the government restricts grave plots to 32 square feet, the cemetery has boosted its the money it makes by building graves with thicker, higher-quality stones. "They look grander that way," she said.

## Local Governments Earn Tidy Income From Cemeteries

Local governments control most graveyards in China. The governments earn significant sums from selling plots or giving land to cemetery developers. The money involved makes the business ripe for cheating. According to the respected publication Southern Weekend, the Civil Affairs Bureau of Guangdong province earned 90 percent of its income from funeral-related income last year.

But China is quickly running out of space for graves. In 2013, the government said the country would be out of burial spaces by 2019.

The Changping District Civil Affairs Bureau has been investigating the China Dragon Garden case. It has also put up a sign in front of the graveyard, labeling it an "illegal cemetery," according to local media reports.

During this week's court hearing, judges heard testimony that the operators of the cemetery were eager to attract customers. The operators began marketing the graveyard even before they had all the proper government approvals in order, the judges were told.

Such a move is common among Chinese businesses, said Qi Lianfeng. He is a Beijing lawyer who is not involved in the China Dragon court case.

## Operators, Prompted By Profit, Jump Gun On Licenses

"Government regulations aren't strictly enforced and many profit-hungry businesses will start operating without the proper licenses," he said. "We've seen many cases of property developers, for example, starting construction even before they get approvals."

Qi said he had never heard of such a fake-grave case before. "It just goes to show, the grave business is doing well," he said.

Representatives of the cemetery could not be reached for comment. But the Jinghua Times report said the operators also were eager to receive government certification for the cemetery because approval would qualify the graveyard for certain payments.

## Cemetery Inflated Popularity With Fakes To Boost Sales

Operators reportedly believed that showing strong demand for the burial plots could only help. The graveyard was advertised as a beautiful location with good feng shui, a Chinese idea of harmony with the environment. The ad even noted that one brother of a Chinese emperor was buried nearby.

Authorities said about half of the 600 tombs at the China Dragon Garden were fakes. Among people in the countryside, inscribing the name of a living person on a gravestone is considered "very bad luck, and we would take great pains to avoid" such a thing, Wang told the newspaper. "They said I was dead so they could earn money; I think this is a violation of my rights."

In the event she doesn't win the case, at least Wang can take some comfort in knowing that the fake graves might not last forever. Private companies who get land from the government for graveyards only have, at most, a 100-year lease on the property.
