ARRIAGA, Mexico — Earlier this month, 16-year-old Wilson Coxaj left his village in Guatemala and began making his way by himself to the United States. It is a dangerous journey.

If he's successful, he'll join what U.S. officials are calling "the surge." This is the huge increase in [children illegally crossing the U.S. border](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Central+american+emigration). It is creating what President Barack Obama has called an "urgent humanitarian situation."

Coxaj is short and has the thick black hair of his Mayan ancestry. He speaks with determination of his desire to find work in the U.S. and send money home to his mother and younger brother.

"I am not with a coyote," he said. Coyotes are the paid human guides who help some illegal immigrants cross the border. "I'm just trying to guide myself through instinct."

## A Dangerous Journey

Children from the northern part of Central America and from Mexico are flooding into the United States. Between Oct. 1, 2013, and May 31, the U.S. government says, 47,017 young people illegally crossed the border. So many have come without parents that the government has set up housing for them at military bases in Texas, Oklahoma and California.

Nearly all the children cross the border at the southern tip of Texas. This means that they must travel through Mexico's lawless Tamaulipas state. The only way they can do this is to travel with coyotes working with crime groups.

Republican lawmakers have blamed Obama. They say that the government isn't trying hard enough to keep the kids out. The lawmakers also say that the children are drawn by the chance that the laws will change and they can stay. In particular, children are looking to join a parent already in the United States.

"President Obama is responsible for this" disaster, said Sen. Jeff Sessions. He is a Republican from Alabama.

But the kids' goal may be more complicated. It seems like they're trying to escape violence in Central America.

## Fleeing Drug Gangs

Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have some of the world's highest murder rates. Many youths who refuse to join street gangs have to flee.

"The Mara Salvatrucha dominates the streets, and they wanted me to join them to sell drugs," said William Alberto Molina. The Mara Salvatrucha is a dangerous gang.

Molina left San Salvador last year at age 17 to escape them. "The only option is to leave the country or join the rival gang."

"Violence in Central America is pushing these kids out," said Wendy Young. She is the head of Kids in Need of Defense, a Washington, D.C., based group that provides legal help for children.

Young said that younger children are crossing the border on their own. "There are a lot more kids under age 12. And the percentage of girls has risen from 25 percent to 40 percent," she said.

"I think the goals these kids have are safety and reunifying with family," said Elizabeth Frankel. She teaches law and is with the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights at the University of Chicago.

## "No Avalanche Of Minors"

The Rev. Alejandro Solalinde is a Catholic priest who is perhaps Mexico's best known advocate for migrants. He said that when teens take off from Central America, they "band together with others from their hometowns. Nobody protects them."

Shelter workers, though, say they aren't seeing many children traveling alone without adults.

"What has increased are children aged 10 to 12 who are traveling with their mothers," said Rene Vigne. He works at the Hermanos en el Camino (Brothers on the Path) shelter in Ixtepec, Mexico.

He doubted reports that 6,000 children cross into the United States each month by themselves.

"There's no avalanche of minors," Vigne said.

## Seeking Work In U.S.

But an official from Central America said many of the child migrants travel in groups and avoid shelters.

He said few of them are like Wilson Coxaj, the 16-year-old who was literally alone on his journey. Most are in groups under the control of an adult.

"These kids aren't alone. They go accompanied by someone," he said.

For his part, Coxaj said he wants to find work in the United States to send money back to his single mother and little brother. He doesn't know where he will end up. He knows the names of only two cities — New York City and Los Angeles. Yet he was confident that he'll find a better job than he could at home.

For a factory job in Guatemala, you need school certificates, he said. "I only completed second grade, so it's difficult for me to get those jobs."
