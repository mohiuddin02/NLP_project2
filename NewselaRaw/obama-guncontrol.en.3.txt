WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Tuesday, President Barack Obama announced his plan for gun sales in the United States. He wants to tighten control of guns and have stricter laws.

In the past, it has been difficult to have strict gun laws because of the gun lobby. The gun lobby is a group of individuals who value guns. They try to influence the government about the importance of gun ownership. Members of this group do not like gun control laws. They believe in the right of citizens to freely buy and own guns. They point to the law written in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Obama said that it was possible to protect the Second Amendment and make changes to keep Americans safe.

There have been several mass shootings in the United States recently. One of these shootings was at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. 

## Young Victims Remembered

He spoke about the 20 first-graders who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary. Some of these children's parents were there to see Obama speak. He reminded the audience that these children were killed with guns. He said that the students who died and their parents did not deserve what happened.

"Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad," Obama said. He had tears on his face.

Right now, some people are not allowed to have guns. People who break certain laws cannot own guns. A background check is a way to find out if a person has ever been in trouble with the law or is a dangerous person. A person who passes a background check has probably not been in trouble with the law. 

"This is not a plot to take away everybody's guns," Obama said. "You pass a background check, you purchase a firearm." The problem is that some gun sellers have been working under a different set of rules, he said.

## Background Checks For Buyers

The main point of Obama's plan is to change the definition of gun sellers. The president wants all people who sell guns to do background checks on buyers. Background checks might help keep guns away from those who could use them to kill people.

Today, the law only requires federally licensed gun sellers to do background checks on buyers. Some gun sellers are not licensed or do not have official government papers. The federal government does not know that these sellers have guns. Without a license, gun sellers do not have to do background checks. So then, almost anyone can buy a gun. Somebody who is dangerous could own a gun.

New rules will help make sure that gun buyers in the United States have had background checks. The federal government has some new rules. These new rules say that a gun seller is anyone in the business of selling guns. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will also hire 230 more people to help with background checks.

## Will Obama's Plan Work?

Nobody knows if Obama's plan will work yet. His staff does not know how many more gun buyers will have background checks. Right now, there is no way to know how many guns are sold. Officials hope that the background checks will keep people safer. If a person cannot pass a background check, he or she cannot buy a gun.

Obama said every time the issue is debated, gun rights groups have the same argument. No matter what is proposed, they claim that it would not have stopped the last shooting, "so why bother trying?"

"I reject that thinking," Obama said, arguing it would be worth it if the measures would prevent even a single gun death. "We maybe can't save everybody, but we could save some."
