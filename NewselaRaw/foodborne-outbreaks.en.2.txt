WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Major outbreaks of illnesses caused by germs in foods have more than tripled in the United States over the past 20 years. The germs most frequently involved are salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. All three have long been a source of trouble.

Between 2010 and 2014 these multistate outbreaks were bigger and deadlier than ever before. Together they caused more than half of all deaths related to incidents of foodborne illness. A wide variety of foods were involved, including vegetables, fresh fruits, beef and chicken. Some of the foods had never been linked to outbreaks, such as the caramel apples that killed seven people and sent 34 to hospitals in late 2014. The apples were found to be infected with listeria.

## Chipotle Hit By E. Coli, Salmonella

Just last weekend, an outbreak of E. coli cases in Washington state and Oregon prompted Chipotle to temporarily close 43 of its restaurants there. No deaths have been reported, but eight people were hospitalized. At least 22 cases have been reported across the two states.

The current outbreak follows one involving tomatoes served at Chipotle restaurants in Minnesota. The tomatoes were infected with salmonella and sickened more than 60 people in August and September.

The restaurant chain's executives will soon meet with federal health officials. The goal is to identify Chipotle's methods that might be contributing to the problem.

A new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clearly shows how deadly recent multistate outbreaks have been. The report identifies 120 multistate outbreaks between 2010 and 2014, each involving at least two states. They were just a fraction of the more than 4,000 food-poisoning incidents reported during that period. However, they accounted for 34 percent of hospitalizations and 56 percent of deaths.

## Nastier Germs And Deadlier Consequences

CDC Director Thomas Frieden said the latest multistate outbreaks are more dangerous because they involve deadlier germs. Such outbreaks can be big and they can be fatal, he said.

Salmonella accounted for most of the illnesses and hospitalizations seen in recent multistate outbreaks. It was also the cause of the three largest outbreaks, which were traced to eggs, chicken and raw ground tuna.

Listeria killed the most people, however. It was responsible for 57 of the 66 deaths during the five-year period. A single outbreak of contaminated cantaloupe in 2011 killed 33 people.

## Imported Foods Blamed In 18 Multistate Outbreaks

Imported foods accounted for 18 of the multistate outbreaks. Foods from Mexico, including mangoes and papayas, were the leading source in those events. The second most common source were foods from Turkey, such as pine nuts, tahini and pomegranate seeds.

Regardless of an outbreak's scale, the effect can be significant. Contaminated foods sicken an estimated 48 million Americans annually, leading to 128,000 hospitalizations and about 3,000 deaths.

In September, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finished writing a new set of food-safety rules. They will require U.S. food manufacturers to come up with detailed plans to identify and prevent possible contamination risks. Most of these rules have not yet gone into effect.

The FDA is also working on a new set of rules covering the growing and packaging of fruits and vegetables. In addition it is writing new rules covering imported foods. These will help guarantee that imported foods meet U.S. safety standards.

## New Tools To Trace Outbreaks To Source

The CDC has also begun using new high-tech tools to track down the source of outbreaks. These tools enable CDC scientists to better identify germ DNA. They then can link germs in sick people with the germs in contaminated food more quickly than was previously possible.

In a way, the process is like finding a germ's DNA "fingerprint." Once a germ is identified, it can be linked to an outbreak of illness.

The new methods have allowed the CDC to crack several "cold cases." Scientists have been able to track down contaminated food responsible for unsolved illnesses.

For example, last spring a major incident was traced to ice creamâ€“maker Blue Bell Creameries. Ice cream tainted with listeria was linked to illnesses and three deaths in Kansas and illnesses in Texas. Some of these previously unsolved cases went back as much as five years.
