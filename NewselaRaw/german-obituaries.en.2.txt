BELLEVILLE, Ill. — The fourth-year German students at Belleville East High School had a difficult task. They had to translate notices of peoples' deaths from an old German newspaper into English. The notices are known as obituaries, and the German newspaper was published in Belleville during the 1800s.

The newspaper was written in an old German dialect, so seniors Colin Creedon and Daniel Jackson chose to translate the old German alphabet, known as Fraktur, into modern German first. Then they translated the German text they were more familiar with into English.

"We have to translate it and then rearrange it so it makes sense in English," Creedon explained.

On the other hand, seniors Meghan Gingrich and Peyton Kaercher chose to translate the old German directly into English.

"Once you know what the words say, it's really easy," Kaercher said.

## Clicking With A Great-Great Grandfather

The class assignment overseen by teacher Andrew Gaa isn't just for a grade. It serves a larger purpose in helping families learn more about their ancestry.

After the students translate the death notices, they are posted online.

That's where Craig Eberhard of San Diego, California, found the death notice of his great-great grandfather.

Eberhard recently sent an email to Gaa, thanking him and the two students who translated it.

The project the German students are doing is "one to be appreciated and admired," Eberhard said. "Without that, I never would have known that history of my great-great grandfather."

Eberhard said reading his great-great grandfather's obituary allowed him to "connect some of the dots" of his family's history.

"There was so much information in there," he said. "It gave a little bit of color to my great-great grandfather."

## From Germany He Sailed

Eberhard's great-great grandfather, Friedrich Pannier, was born in 1832. He died in 1893. Pannier was a farmer who came to Belleville in 1866 on a ship that set sail from Germany. He brought his wife and five children, including Eberhard's great grandfather, William, who was 6 years old at the time. William moved from Belleville to California.

Gaa said the German students are providing "a service to people" who can't read German and don't live locally. These people can't read the old newspapers stored on microfilm at the Belleville Public Library.

## Calling On The Language Sleuths

The assignment to translate the obituary is challenging for the 19 students in his fourth-year class, according to Gaa.

"Old German script is hard to read," he said.

The students agree. Some of the letters that were used then are not the ones used in German now.

"Once you get into the flow of it, it becomes easier," said senior Madelyne Knipp. "A lot of times, I just use the context clues to figure it out."

The students don't have to tackle it alone. They work with partners. Gaa is available to help as well.

"The challenge is translating it and making it sound like good English," Gaa said. "There's definitely an art to it."

Knipp said it's "really cool" to translate the old German obituary into English. "I like translating this stuff knowing it's going to help people."

## Accuracy Is Essential

After the students translate the obituaries, they type them up and submit them to Gaa for review.

Gaa must make sure the obituaries are accurate because people will use them to research their family history.

"I'm interested in Belleville history, so it's worthwhile for me," Gaa said.

The German students translate obituaries twice a year — one time each semester.

"By the second time, it's much easier for them to do," Gaa said.

## Accent On German Towns

Gaa actually learned about his own family history through this project, which started in the fall of 2012.

So far, the students are almost through obituaries published in 1898. They will move on to 1899 next.

Diane Walsh, who studies family history, or genealogy, said she appreciates the work Gaa and his students put into the project.

The most important thing about the German obituaries is they mention the particular town the immigrant came from, Walsh said.

"I know people in the genealogical community are very grateful for work people do to bring ancestors to life," Walsh said, "and that's what this project is about."
