DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Saudi Arabia's ban on allowing women to drive is under attack from a small number of men, who want to see women behind the wheel. But, by doing so they risk their jobs and maybe worse in the traditional kingdom.

Some of the men have been questioned by authorities. One man was even held by the Saudi government. That move sent a chill through activists working to end the ban.

On Saturday, more than 60 women said they defied the ban and drove. The police seemed to do little about it.

Leading up to the weekend protest, men played a key role. They believe it is a basic right that their wives, sisters and female friends should be able to drive.

## Driving In Packs

Since the campaign was launched in September, men have produced videos of women driving. They've put them on social networks, like YouTube.

They have helped protect the female drivers by forming packs of two or three cars to surround them. The action should keep people from harassing them.

And some have simply ridden as passengers with the women as they run their daily errands.

The view "is that there's a problem in Arab culture and that we are against women and that the West is on the side of women. This is totally rejected," said Abdullah al-Bilassi, a 23-year-old engineering student in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.

He is tired of hearing that Saudi men and Islam are against allowing women to drive. That led him to get involved in the campaign.

No laws ban women from driving in Saudi Arabia. But, the authorities do not give them drivers' licenses. Many of the women who drove last weekend had licenses from abroad, activists said.

The tradition of banning women from driving is rooted in the kingdom's interpretation of Islam. Saudis practice a traditional form of Islam known as Wahabbism. Religious critics warn that women driving could damage Saudi society, and lead to people not knowing what's right or wrong.

## "No Woman, No Drive" Video

Most of the men in the campaign are in their 20s and 30s. They say their fathers and uncles tell them in male gatherings that it is not yet time to allow women to drive.

Alaa Wardi of Riyadh, who says he is not involved in the campaign, has produced an online video called "No Woman, No Drive." It uses a Bob Marley song to make fun of comments by a prominent sheik, or religious leader, who said driving can harm a woman's ovaries. It has had more than 8 million views so far.

Rights activist Ali al-Hattab said the king uses the opposition of religious people to keep women from driving.

"They don't want women driving because it opens the door to a flood of other demands that will lead to calls for political reforms," he said.

King Abdullah has gradually introduced reforms in Saudi Arabia. Women are now allowed to sit on the national council and permitted to vote and run in local elections. But the strict male guardian system is still in place. Women are still required to obtain permission from a male relative to travel, get married, or enroll in college.

In 2011 and 1990, authorities arrested women for driving, which led to an international outcry. This time, rather than arrest women, authorities have instead increased pressure on their male supporters. A handful of men have been questioned since Saturday, activists said. Other campaigners have had to sign pledges not to allow their female relatives to drive again.

## Interior Ministry Detains Teacher

On Sunday, elementary school teacher Tariq al-Mubarak was detained by the Interior Ministry's Criminal Investigation Department in Riyadh, said his lawyer, Abdel-Aziz al-Qassem. He has not been charged, however.

Al-Mubarak was targeted because of his role in the campaign, the lawyer said. A phone line used by activists was registered under al-Mubarak's name. He also had written columns in a major Arabic newspaper supportive of women's rights to drive.

Interior Ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki could not be reached for comment.

The lawyer told The Associated Press that he and al-Mubarak's wife were able to see him for the first time Wednesday.

"He is well and healthy," al-Qassem said. "They just wanted to know what the point of the campaign is — if it is pressure on the government, which of course is not allowed, or a social campaign."

The activists have been careful not to gather for fear of being accused of organizing a protest. Instead, they work independently in several cities to upload the videos and help manage the campaign's website and Twitter and YouTube accounts.

## Some Campaigners Followed

One female activist, who asked not to be identified for fear of punishment, said some campaigners have "started to really panic" after al-Mubarak was detained.

Two women said they were followed by undercover agents. Five others said they were contacted by the Interior Ministry and told not to drive.

The female activist said the role of men shows that a broad slice of society is supportive.

"It never was a women's campaign only. From the initial start, we've had men's support and assistance," she said.

A male campaigner who asked not to be identified for fear of losing his job in Saudi Arabia said he is afraid he may be detained before his upcoming wedding. He said he closed his Twitter account at the request of his worried fiancé.

"The Saudi government is careful not to arrest women (and) tend to take it out on the men," he said.

He is staying active in the campaign because the women need the support of men.

"Because of the activism of men, sooner rather than later, women will drive," he said.
