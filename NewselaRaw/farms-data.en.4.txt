KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” The weather is expected to become more unpredictable in the future. That could make it harder for farmers to grow as much as they have in the past.

But, one company wants to help farmers outwit Mother Nature by using math.

The company is called Climate Corp. It is offering farmers a new way to handle severe weather patterns.

These days more and more farmers are seeing crops fail. The reason? Overheating, periods of little rain and increasingly wild weather swings.

## Mother Nature's Unstable

"We're moving into a period of very unstable weather," said Jerry Hatfield, a scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). And farmers "need to be prepared."

Scientists believe they know the cause of the crazy weather: climate change, or [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming), caused by humans when they burn things like gas.

There are still many people who don't believe climate change is real. In fact, many farmers may think that way.

But scientists are planning ahead anyhow. They are trying to figure out what farmers can do if the weather gets hotter and there is less rain.

Enter Climate Corp. Started six years ago, the company offers super-local weather forecasts.

To come up with its forecasts, Climate Corp. looks at huge amounts of information. It examines weather readings taken at 10 million spots. And it looks at 40 years worth of information about crops.

The company can provide detailed information about 29 million U.S. fields. Farmers receive forecasts for rain and wind speed for their fields.

## Fields Of Details

But Climate Corp. doesn't only provide weather forecasts. It can also give farmers other information. For example, it can tell them how much their fields are likely to produce. Or report on the condition of the soil. Or give a rundown on how well the crops are growing.

"Farmers still face a tough battle out there every year. Hopefully this helps them," said Climate Corp. vice president Jim Ethington.

But some farmers don't think much of the new ideas.

Ted Guetterman farms about 10,000 acres. His dad and three brothers work with him.

Guetterman said he's the best judge of what needs to be done.

"Nobody knows my land better than I do," Guetterman said. "I've been farming it all my life."

Guetterman said he would take some advice from a company. But, he added, "I'm not going to do my whole farm that way."

## High Heat Hard On Crops

A USDA report this year warned of increasing changes in weather patterns. And it said warming temperatures will be hard on crops.

Kansas will likely see big changes. So will other Great Plains states. These include Oklahoma, Nebraska and South Dakota.

The USDA says Great Plains states will grow a little less wheat and corn by 2050.

Few in Kansas believe climate change is going to push wheat or corn out of the state. But it could make growing them more risky.

Scientists say agriculture will have to change. There will have to be better ways of weather forecasting. Farmers will have to handle soil better. And grow plants in new ways.

Scientists are now working on developing a new kind of wheat. They hope it will hold up better as temperatures rise.

Hatfield, the USDA expert, said farmers will need to adjust to climate change.

"Climate has changed, climate is changing," he said. "And climate is going to change in the future."
