Environmentalists celebrated last month after the United Nations finally agreed that the high seas need protection. The high seas, which lay beyond a country's coastal waters, represents about 58 percent of our planet's oceans. Its rich marine life, though, is dying off.

For the first time in history, countries agreed that an international treaty is needed "to address the urgent crisis of biodiversity loss on the high seas," says Daniela Diz. She is a marine policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund, and sat in on the talks at the United Nations. "It's an important step forward."

And the decision hasn't come a moment too soon. The Census of Marine Life estimated that 90 percent of some types of large fish, such as tuna and swordfish, have disappeared from the seas.

## Making Marine Protected Areas

Harmful fishing practices cause much of the threat. Most of the deep-sea fishing in the high seas is done by bottom trawling, in which heavy nets are scraped across the seafloor. These nets sweep up everything in their path. They destroy fragile marine ecosystems, such as deepwater corals and sponges that give shelter to fish. Much of the nets' catch, called its bycatch, is thrown back dead.

To prevent overfishing, the agreement would, among other things, make it much easier to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the high seas.

MPAs are the oceans' national parks. They range in size and level of protection. Twelve percent of the world's land is currently protected in national parks and wildlife preserves. In contrast, just about 1 percent of the high seas is protected. The plan is to increase this number to 10 percent by 2020 and eventually to 30 percent.

"The new agreement will be about what we keep in the seas, instead of what we extract," says Karen Sack. She is the director of The Pew Charitable Trusts' International Marine Program. Sack has been involved in the discussions to create an agreement since their beginning in 2004.

## Who's Watching The Oceans?

An uncoordinated jumble of institutions and regulations have control over different aspects of the high seas. There's the International Maritime Organization for shipping. For mining, there's the International Seabed Authority. For fishing, it is the Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. A recent report by the Global Ocean Commission found that too many different agencies have made it virtually impossible to safeguard the high seas.

The commission called on countries to quickly agree on a set of rules for the high seas. Other problems include government support of deep-sea fishing, lack of tracking for fishing vessels, offshore oil and gas exploration and plastics pollution.

If these rules do not go into effect within five years, the commission suggests closing the high seas to fishing. "This proposal is not anti-fishing," says RÃ©mi Parmentier, commission deputy executive secretary.

Coastal states would benefit, he said. Many of them are suffering economically, because fish are being killed off by high-seas fishing fleets. This is especially the case in West Africa.

Matthew Gianni is the co-founder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition. He fears a complete closure may lead countries to expand their coastal zones, where they have exclusive rights to fish. Countries' coastal zones extend 200 nautical miles into the ocean. The high seas lay beyond this point, in international waters.

"There's a lot of merit to collective regulation," said Gianni, whose environmental group aims to save the high seas.

## "Biggest Savings Account"

Yet, the evidence in favor of closing the high seas is growing. Earlier in February, a study from the University of British Columbia (UBC) suggested this would have ecological, economic and social benefits.

Researchers found that closing the high seas would actually increase the amount of fish caught annually. A greater number of countries would catch these fish within their coastal areas. This would make the high seas the "biggest savings account on the planet." Major fishing nations, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, rely on high-seas bottom trawling. They would lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year.

If the agreement is successfully negotiated, there may be no need for closing down the high seas to fishing. This is because some key areas would be set aside for marine protection. Also, areas outside the MPAs would be closely studied. These would help ensure that the high seas' health is maintained in the long run. "I realize what we have lost," says Enric Sala. The deep-sea diver is a National Geographic Society explorer-in-residence and co-author of the UBC paper.

"I also see what the ocean of the future can be," added Sala. "It's the difference between the places that are degraded, and places that are pristine and beautiful that gives us hope."
