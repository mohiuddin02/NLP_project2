CHICAGO — Michelle Secor is a big Chicago Blackhawks fan. She wears the team's colors and watches every move when the players take the ice.

"I have to cheer for our home teams," Secor said. She was watching the Stanley Cup finals. "Bulls. Sox. Bears. Hawks. I was born into this."

Secor is Mexican-American. She is one of a small but growing number of non-white people who have become hooked on hockey.

"It makes us all feel good to see a Chicago team out there winning — race doesn't matter," she said.

## Minority Players Pull Fans

Hockey for years has been watched and played primarily by whites. It is partly because the sport was created in Canada. But the National Hockey League said its fans are slowly changing. There are more non-white players on NHL teams in recent years. Years before they were mostly white. There are more minority fans, too.

The Blackhawks have three black players. It is the most of any NHL team.

The NHL says it has 58 million U.S. fans. Of that, 9.4 percent are Latino. About 8.3 percent are African-American.

"We are gaining more fans of different backgrounds," a spokeswoman said.

The NHL does not try to target specific groups, said Ken Martin. He is in charge of NHL fan development. Still, the league has tried to reach out to youth in urban communities.

The league is getting fame in new Chicago neighborhoods, too. "One way is by the Blackhawks winning," said Martin."The Blackhawks have been a leader in making our game accessible."

## NHL Programs In Cities

The sport still remains out of reach for many minorities. There are few opportunities to learn the rules and not a lot of places for minorities to play, said Richard Lapchick of the University of Central Florida. "The NHL now has programs in cities, but it's a slow building process."

Plus, there have not been a lot of big stars who are minorities, Lapchick said.

According to the NHL, there are 44 minority players in the league. Half of them are black and four are Hispanic.

"Once there are some African-American star players in the game that will help," Lapchick said. "The value of diversity for the NHL is that it would greatly expand their fan base."

The cost of the sport is another problem, experts said.

"It's not a sport you can go in your backyard and play," said Jimmy Terracino, of the Bobby Hull Ice Rink in Cicero. "You've got to have an ice rink. You need skates, you need sticks, helmets, gloves, elbow pads, shin guards. That limits many people from playing or learning it."

## Youth Hockey Leagues

The league is making an effort to get more diversity. For example, there are youth hockey leagues based at Johnny's IceHouse in Chicago. Those reach out to local minority children so they can learn how to play.

Cicero is a Chicago suburb. In the town, 78 percent of the people are of Mexican descent. It has a $3.5 million ice rink. The rink has become popular among the town's Latino children, Terracino said.

The Blackhawks winning games "gets even more kids interested in hockey," Terracino said.

Vic Ortiz is Mexican-American. He lives on Chicago's South Side. He says he is a big Chicago sports fan. For years, he took little interest in the Blackhawks. The games were too expensive. Also, most of the home games were not on TV.

Now, Ortiz tunes in, even when the Blackhawks aren't in the playoffs.

## Blackhawks Fever

Gertrude Johnson is African-American and lives on the Near North Side. She grew up watching the Bears and Bulls, she said. About five years ago, her mother told her to start watching hockey.

At first, she liked the fights. Then she learned the rules of the game. She admired the speed of the players and the way they stick up for and protect each other.

"Anybody who is making a name for Chicago, we're riding with them," Johnson said.
