MILWAUKEE â€” A much-watched undercover video showed sick and injured dairy cows being slapped, poked and forced to their feet with heavy machinery. Such treatment may not be that unusual, according to farmers and others who this week viewed the video of the Wiese Brothers Farm in Brown County, Wis.

Farmers did not defend the way the workers treated the cows. But they did say that some of the actions in the video may have been necessary.

There are ways to get a downed cow back on its feet, said Paul Rozadowski, a dairy farmer from Stanley, Wis. You can sneak up behind the sick cow, scream at it, and that may scare the animal into getting up. But it doesn't always work, and quick action must be taken if the cow is to recover.

"When you have a downed cow with milk fever, you have to try and get her back on her feet as soon as possible. Otherwise, the muscles in the back of her legs turn to mush and she will never get up again," Rozadowski said.

## Seeking To Prosecute Workers Seen Hurting Cows

Mercy for Animals is an animal rights group that hired an investigator to take the video in the fall. The video shows workers at Wiese Brothers Farm dragging downed cows by their legs and necks using chains attached to tractors. The workers can be seen whipping downed cows as well.

The video also showed sick or injured cows suffering from open wounds. Animal care experts call the treatment shockingly cruel.

Wiese Brothers Farm did not speak to the media. The farm's owners released a statement instead. It said the owners had fired two employees for suspected animal abuse. The farm is cooperating with an investigation into animal cruelty claims.

Brown County District Attorney David L. Lasee would not comment. A district attorney makes legal cases against criminals and takes them to court. A spokeswoman for Lasee said the sheriff's department is still investigating the case.  The sheriff's department had not contacted him yet.

Tim Carpenter is a member of the Wisconsin State Senate. He released a statement calling on Lasee to "investigate and prosecute" the workers who were shown harming the cattle.

"Animal abuse of the nature captured in that video is reprehensible," Carpenter wrote in a letter to Lasee. "A clear message needs to be sent that it will not be tolerated in Wisconsin."

Leaders from the Wisconsin dairy industry have spoken out against the practices shown in the video. They say the treatment is shocking, cruel, and not typical of the industry.

Farmers say some scenes in the video might be mistaken for animal cruelty. They suggest Mercy for Animals might be trying to promote its own cause. The animal rights group supports a vegan diet. A vegan diet does not include any animal products.

## Disabled Animals Not Uncommon

John Rosenow is a Buffalo County dairy farmer with 500 cows. He says it's not unusual for a large farm to have a disabled animal once or twice a month. Workers on his farm use heavy equipment to move a downed cow. The animal is placed on a soft bed of sawdust where it has a chance to recover.

Rosenow says kicking a downed cow won't get the animal on its feet. Using a stick won't help either. He pokes the cow with an old ink pen to get it moving.

A cow weighs 1,500 pounds. What can a farmer do if such a heavy animal won't get up? You have to convince the cow, says Rosenow.

The animal treatment shown in the short video clip was unnecessary, says Temple Grandin. She is an animal welfare expert from Colorado State University. Her work has led to the more humane treatment of livestock.

A well-run dairy farm would never allow such things, Grandin said.

She agrees that it is difficult to get a downed cow back on its feet. But you don't lift the animal into the air and carry it around, she says. A machine should be used to bring the cow to a standing position.

## Nestle Ditching Wiese Brothers Milk

Grandin says that what she saw on the video was "terrible." But she also pointed out that not all dairy farms are behaving badly. "I have been on some very good dairy farms," she said.

Until the video was released, Wiese Brothers Farm was a milk supplier for Foremost Farms and Nestle USA, which makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas. After the release, Nestle and Foremost quickly cut ties with the farm.

"Nestle is outraged and deeply saddened by the mistreatment of animals shown in this video," the company said in a statement.

Mercy for Animals said it was seeking talks with Nestle. The group wants to convince the company to adopt anti-cruelty guidelines for its milk suppliers.

"We haven't heard anything from them yet, but we are hopeful," said Matt Rice, chief of investigations for the Los Angeles-based group.
