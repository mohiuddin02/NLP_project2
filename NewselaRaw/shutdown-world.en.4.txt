BERLIN â€” If you think U.S. lawmakers behaved badly during the government shutdown, you are not alone. People in Europe are also surprised at how U.S. leaders have acted.

But one German newspaper writer asked why.

After all, people in Germany had seen this sort of thing before. The Republicans insisted on cutting back the healthcare law. That led to the shutdown. It wasn't so different from when German leader Angela Merkel's insisted that Greece cut back its spending. A crisis followed in Greece. It hurt business and the people there.

The article summed up how much of the world seemed to be seeing the United States during the fight: both broken, like Greece, and bossy, like Germany.

## No Laughing Matter

No one was amused, however. The United States is not a small country like Greece. It is the world's No. 1 superpower. And sure, Europeans may express anger at the United States because of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But many were shocked to see how mean American leaders seem to be to one another. They also didn't understand how little Americans seemed to care about how the fight might affect the rest of the world.

Some say the fighting will matter years from now.

Willem Post is an expert on U.S. politics at The Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands. He warned that the squabbling in the United States could cost the country its place in the world. The same goes for the European Union. Neither power is paying attention to what they need to do to remain the most important forces in the world. Meanwhile, China is on the rise.

This is the time for the two continents to work together to make sure they will stay strong, Post said. Instead, both Europe and the U.S. have governments that don't know how to cooperate.

And not knowing how to cooperate will lead to bad results, he said.

"For our children and grandchildren, it is a looming disaster," he said.

## One Nation Divided

The American problems are hard for Europeans to understand. To people in Europe, their own issues make sense. The European Union is made up of 28 nations. Those countries have competing goals. There are also 17 countries that use the euro for their money. Those countries have different styles and needs.

But the United States is one country.

"Europeans really don't understand," Post said. "The United States is the model democracy; it should be leading by example. Instead, there is no talking, there is no compromise. The lesson to the rest of the world is that the United States these days can't be relied upon."

The official Chinese news agency made a comment about the U.S. political battle. The writer suggested that it might be time to think of  "building a de-Americanized world."

It may be time to stop using the dollar for international business, the article said.  Doing that would be a disaster for American shopper. Prices on products from other countries could soar.

The article also said the United States is not using its power to end fights. It is instead bringing more trouble into the world, the writer said.

The thoughts are not new. They also won't go away just because the shutdown has ended.

## Wanted: New World Superpower

Earlier this year, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius gave a speech in Indonesia. He talked about recent global history and the end of "The American Century."

The world had two powers with the United States and the USSR, he said. The USSR collapsed. Then for a short time, the United States was the sole power. In the future, there will be several big powers. For the moment, Fabius said, there is no power in control.

That means the global cost of this government shutdown shouldn't be measured in dollars. It should be measured in how important the United States is, some analysts say. And in those terms, the United States lost a lot.
