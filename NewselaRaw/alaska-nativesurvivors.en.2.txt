HOOPER BAY, Alaska â€” In a small white building in the center of Hooper Bay, a group of young people gathered to sing, dance and drum. They also came to save each other.

They call themselves the Native Survivors. The youth group began out of a desire to end the sadness and despair that trouble too many Native Alaskan teens and young adults. They find peace through sewing and friends through dance.

Wilma Bell-Joe, 35, launched the group after an unusually bad year for suicide in this village on the Bering Sea. In Alaska, the suicide rate is the highest or nearly the highest in the country. In 2010, Bell-Joe said, at least eight people killed themselves in Hooper Bay, then a community of about 1,100, and even more tried to commit suicide.

## Something Remarkable Has Happened

Since the Native Survivors began, though, something remarkable has happened. No one has committed suicide in Hooper Bay.

"Because of us," Bell-Joe said. The room echoed with the sounds of song, the beat of drums, the voices of young men. "These kids are inspired and encouraged, and even if they make a mistake, they are not discouraged."

After that rough year in 2010, "she said 'enough,' and Wilma became a lion," said Charlie Ess, a coordinator for AmeriCorps, the national community service organization that supports and helps pay for the work of Native Survivors.

## Letting Go Of Alcohol, Developing Skills

For some in Hooper Bay, alcohol is a struggle. Bell-Joe herself drank in the past, but now she uses her experience to show the teens the trouble it brings. "You are slowly killing yourself," she tells them.

In Alaska, some of the AmeriCorps workers focus on environmental projects, such as recycling and gardening. Others including Bell-Joe turn to health, wellness and alcohol prevention. In the town of Huslia, young people learned to race dogs and care for them.

Young people and leaders learn more from these programs than dog care or recycling. They develop important skills and gain confidence.

## She Is There For Young People

Bell-Joe grew up in Hooper Bay, the middle child of 13 children. Her family lived in a two-bedroom home, with her parents sleeping in one room and all the children in the other. She was a teen mother who dropped out of school more than once. When she graduated from high school, her oldest child, then 2 1/2, was in the audience.

Native Survivors, which began with just two students in 2013, now has 53 members and is growing, Bell-Joe said. Even on a night when the local high school basketball had its practice, dozens of young people showed up for dance practice, and players stopped by later.

At just 4 feet, 9 inches tall, Bell-Joe looks almost like a teenager herself. When she hears of problems with a teacher at Hooper Bay School, she slips inside to observe. Bell-Joe is like a watchdog in disguise.

"I literally dress up as a teenager and go into the classroom," Bell-Joe said. "Sometimes we have problems with teachers at the school, with attitudes and favoritism."

She said she talks to the teachers about what she sees, reminding that they are there to teach and encourage, not discriminate. "They are not there to talk down on the kids," she said.

She also wants the students to know that she is there for them.

## In A Complex World, Traditions Are An Anchor

The modern world can seem far away from village life. Bell-Joe just learned about Amazon last month and discovered Facebook a year ago.

But traditional ways help anchor the kids, she said. Her parents, Margie and Joseph Bell, are among the elders who come to the little building to teach. Her father is the mayor of Hooper Bay, and her mother teaches Yup'ik, the native Eskimo language, at the local preschool. Elders have led classes in making harpoons and dance fans, in beading and sewing qasperet, the Yup'ik word for cloth pullovers.

In the spring, the elders will take the young people out to the tundra to look for greens.

## Teaching Patience, Solving Problems

Sewing, hunting and other traditional skills, Bell-Joe said, teach patience. They also help young people to work through problems rather than blow up in anger.

At the dance practice, Joseph Bell led the drumming, and his wife led the dancers.

The Native Survivors kept going into the night. They danced the story of a big family celebration, a loud, happy time that drowned out the cries of a baby. Then the dancers reached out, arms moving together, and found their way to a tiny imaginary baby, giving comfort through dance.
