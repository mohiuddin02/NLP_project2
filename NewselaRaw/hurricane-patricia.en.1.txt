CHAMELA, Mexico — Just a day after threatening Mexico as one of history's most powerful storms, Hurricane Patricia caused surprisingly little damage Saturday. The storm quickly dispersed and posed little threat beyond heavy rain.

The hurricane's most powerful punch landed on a sparsely populated stretch of Mexico's Pacific Coast. It then crashed into mountains that weakened its potentially catastrophic force. The popular beach city of Puerto Vallarta and the port of Manzanillo were spared the brunt of the violent weather.

Authorities were still checking on some areas where roads had been blocked by downed trees, but the destruction appeared to be far less than feared.

There were no reports of deaths or injuries, said Roberto Lopez Lara, interior secretary for the Mexican state of Jalisco where the storm landed. Later, President Enrique Pena Nieto reported that between 3,000 and 3,500 homes had been damaged, and the storm also affected 3,500 hectares (about 8,650 acres) of farmland. He said 235,000 people had lost electricity when the storm hit, and about half had power restored by Saturday.

## Saved From A Tragic Ending

It was a remarkable outcome, considering that Patricia had been a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest on a scale of 1 to 5. Winds blew up to 200 miles per hour before the hurricane came ashore in an area dotted with sleepy villages and a few fancy hotels. Residents of towns nearest where the hurricane landed described a terrifying night.

"Those were the longest five hours of my life," said Sergio Reyna Ruiz, who took cover in a neighbor's home when Patricia passed over the village of La Fortuna, about 2 miles from the ocean. "Five hours riding the monster."

Before the storm hit, Reyna Ruiz tried to tie down the shingles of his roof with metal cables. But looking up from the inside Saturday, blue sky could be seen through the ceiling. He and family members tried to clean up, sawing through a fallen tree and putting waterlogged mattresses and books into the sun to dry.

All were thankful that everyone survived: "It's something to tell the grandchildren," Reyna Ruiz said.

## One Village Was Not As Lucky

Down the road in Chamela, people picked through the destroyed buildings for anything that could be saved. All 40 families that live there took shelter in nearby San Mateo, and when they returned, they found little they could recognize.

Arturo Morfin Garcia wielded a machete trying to clear debris from around his home, which had collapsed into a jumble of bricks and beams. The only part of his house left standing was a concrete bathroom at one end.

"It wasn't hard to leave. It was hard to come back and find this," Morfin Garcia said. "So much work to build something. It makes me very sad, but what can we do with these natural phenomena?"

## Resort Slapped With Rain, But Not Much Else

Home to some 200,000 people, including thousands of U.S. residents and visitors, Puerto Vallarta was largely untouched by the storm. Patricia plunged ashore about 65 miles southeast of Vallarta. After the hurricane passed, people snapped selfies next to a seaside sculpture, and business owners swept sidewalks as they would on any morning.

"We were fortunate as to where it made landfall. It was not a densely populated area," said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the U.S. National Hurricane Center. "You and I would be having a very different conversation if this went over the top of Puerto Vallarta."

He said no one was killed, probably because the storm did not sweep through a wider area.

## In Like A Lion But Out Like A Lamb

On Saturday, Patricia's winds dropped to 30 miles per hour, according to the hurricane center.

That such a monster storm could inflict so little harm seemed wondrous. Patricia formed suddenly Tuesday and quickly strengthened to a hurricane. Within 30 hours it had zoomed to a record-beating Category 5 storm, surprising many with its rapid growth.

By Friday, it was the most powerful hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere, with a central pressure of 880 millibars, according to the hurricane center.

Patricia's power while still out at sea was comparable to that of Typhoon Haiyan, according to the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization. Haiyan left more than 7,300 dead or missing in the Philippines two years ago.

## Mexico's Winning Pair: Good Luck And Storm Preparation

Hurricane experts praised Mexico's expertise at storm preparations and also credited the country's good fortune.

The mountains in the area quickly weakened the storm. The coast did not offer the large area of shallow water necessary for a storm surge that could have become a devastating wall of water.

The storm was also moving fast enough at landfall — about 20 miles per hour— that its heavy rains did not stay in place long enough to cause huge floods, said Jeff Masters. He is the director of meteorology at Weather Underground.

Mexico's transport secretary, Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, put it another way: "Nature was good to us."
