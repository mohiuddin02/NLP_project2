WASHINGTON â€” There might be hope for curing a rare type of cancer that attacks the liver. And it's all because of a teenager who beat the disease and then decided to study it.

Elana Simon of New York City has helped scientists find a strange problem in certain genes. Genes are the building blocks of the human body. They determine what color eyes we have or how tall we are. But they also decide whether we might get a certain disease. Finding the problem in Simon's disease may help in learning how the disease strikes.

Age 18 is pretty young to be listed as one of the writers of a study. The study she helped write was published in the respected magazine Science. The high school student's efforts are bringing new attention to this mysterious disease.

"It's crazy that I've been able to do this," said Simon. The disease affects the body's liver. It mostly hits teenagers and people a little older.

## Finding A Gene Problem

Studying the disease required a lot of help from scientists, including her father. He happens to run a science lab at Rockefeller University. Her doctor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center also helped. Experts at the New York Genome Center, which studies genes, assisted. Another person who survived the cancer also co-wrote the study.

Together, the team reported Thursday that they uncovered an oddity: A break in genetic material would leave the "head" of one gene attached to the "body" of another. It results in an unusual protein. It doesn't form in healthy livers. But it does form in tumors, which grow in people who have cancer. So the problem in these genes might have something to do with cancer growth, the study found. Evidence of this has turned up in all 15 of the tumors tested so far.

There's more to be done. It was a small study. More work is needed to understand this gene problem, cautioned Dr. Sanford Simon, the teen's father. He is also the study's main writer.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are involved. The government agency is advising the Simons on how to develop a list of people with the disease. An NIH office that studies rare diseases has posted a YouTube video on its website. Elana Simon and another patient who survived the disease explain why teen patients should get involved in the tests.

"Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Not easy to pronounce. Not easily understood," it says about the disease.

Simon was found to have the disease at age 12. Getting an operation is the only treatment that works. Doctors called surgeons removed the tumor from her body. Her tumor was caught in time. If the cancer spreads it can be deadly. Simon knows other patients who weren't as lucky as her.

## Using Her Computer Skills

During her second year in high school, she had an internship at a laboratory studying another type of cancer. She used computers to help scientists sort information about genes, with changes in them, called mutations.

Simon wanted to try the same approach with the liver cancer she'd survived.

A hurdle was finding enough tumors to test. Only about 200 people a year worldwide are found to have the disease, says the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation. It's the group that helped pay for the new study. There was no place that kept samples of the disease after an operation. They want to build one so testing can be done.

Sloan-Kettering's Dr. Michael LaQuaglia, who does operations on children and was Simon's doctor, agreed to help. Simon spread the word to patient groups. Finally, samples of the disease trickled in. Sanford Simon said his daughter helped examine what was different in the tumor cells with her computer skills.

The New York Genome Center zeroed in on the weird change in the gene.

Sanford Simon said other scientists then showed the unusual protein really is inside tumor cells. He calls it "an exciting time for kids to go into science." Nowadays, there's so much they can study with a computer.

As for Elana Simon, she plans to study computer science at Harvard University next fall.
