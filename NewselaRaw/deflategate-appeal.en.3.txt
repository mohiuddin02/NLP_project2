The New England Patriots played a championship game against the Indianapolis Colts on Jan. 19. The Colts told the National Football League (NFL) that the footballs the Patriots were using did not feel right. The footballs were tested at halftime and were discovered to be low on air. People refer to it as "Deflategate."

Less air in the footballs makes them easier to throw and catch. The Patriots defeated the Colts 45-7 and went on to win the Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks.

In May, the football league found that Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady probably knew that the air had been let out of the footballs. It suspended Brady for the first four games of this coming season without pay. Brady appealed and asked the league to reconsider.

On Tuesday, football Commissioner Roger Goodell ruled that the original punishment should stand. Brady will have to sit out the first four games of the season.

## NFL Says Brady Blocked Investigation

Now Brady will likely go to court and ask a judge to let him play.

Goodell revealed a new piece of information Tuesday. Brady had his cellphone destroyed shortly before meeting with the NFL's investigators about Deflategate.

In his ruling, Goodell wrote that the evidence showed that Brady participated in the scheme to let air out of the balls. Team workers were the ones who actually let the air out. Deflating the balls too much is cheating, according to the NFL's rules.

Goodell also said that Brady blocked the investigation by destroying his cellphone. Brady knew it contained information the investigators had asked for, Goodell said.

The football commissioner said he has great respect for Brady's achievements in football and in the community. Nevertheless, he concluded that Brady's actions harmed the honesty of the game. It has also affected people's confidence in professional football.

## "The Decision Is Wrong," Says Yee, Brady's Agent

Brady's agent, Don Yee, criticized Goodell's ruling. Yee said Goodell's decision "is deeply disappointing."

Yee said that Brady gave Goodell electronic information that showed he was not involved. Goodell ignored the evidence, Yee said.

Yee pointed out that no quarterback was ever suspended for four games because of deflated footballs. Goodell's decision could change the outcome of the first four games of the football season. A less experienced quarterback will have to replace Brady. "The decision is wrong," Yee said.

Brady and NFL Players Association (NFLPA) are expected to ask a judge to let Brady play. The NFLPA is a group that represents the football players.

The NFL made the first legal move Tuesday. It filed a case in New York to attempt to have the suspension upheld.

Those connected to the case on the players side said they believe Brady and the union have a strong case. They said Brady has an excellent chance of winning.

## Union May Say Rule Applies To Teams, Not Players

The NFLPA has several possible arguments. The union can say that there is not enough proof against Brady. It can argue that the rules for handling footballs apply to teams, not to individual players. It can say Brady was given a punishment that no player has ever been given before.

The league and the NFLPA tried to come to an agreement. Not much progress was made, though. The NFLPA did not think Brady should sit out any games. In contrast, the football league insisted that he had to be punished.

Many in the league supported the full four-game suspension. They agreed with Commissioner Goodell's decision. "I think he has to stay with the same thing," an official with one NFL team said.

The Patriots reported to their training camp on Wednesday. If Brady cannot play, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo would open the season. Garoppolo began playing professional football just last year. He completed 19 of 27 passes for 182 yards. He threw for one touchdown and had no interceptions.

The Patriots will play the Pittsburgh Steelers in the NFL's first game of the season on Sept. 10.
