HARTFORD, Conn. — State lawmakers around the United States are taking a harder line on crimes that were once seen as juvenile pranks. At a time of fears over terrorism and shootings, the lawmakers are proposing stiffer penalties for people who threaten schools.

In mid-December, an emailed threat prompted the shutdown of Los Angeles schools, the second largest district in the country. Although the threat turned out to be a hoax, it showed how threats can cause large, costly disruptions and traumatize students.

Most states already have laws that allow prosecution of a school threat as a felony. Recently, though, there have been proposals across the United States to increase punishments, said Michael Dorn, executive director of the school safety nonprofit group Safe Havens International.

## From A Prank To A Felony

"These things keep happening, and they're happening too often," said Wisconsin state Representative Ed Brooks, a Republican. "This isn't child's play anymore. This is serious stuff. Every threat is real until it's disproved. There's a high level of anxiety."

Brooks has proposed legislation that would make a public death threat a medium-grade felony, with more severe consequences if anybody is hurt during an evacuation. He suggested the proposed law after hearing from a police chief about a case in which a threat on Facebook caused the evacuation of a school. The suspect, though, could not be charged with anything more serious than disorderly conduct.

Threats can be especially jarring in areas left jittery by recent attacks, such as Southern California. A recent attack killed 14 people at a holiday luncheon in San Bernardino. The person who sent the email that led Los Angeles to cancel classes remains unknown, but the district's response reflected lingering unease over terrorism.

## Number Of Threats On The Rise

In Connecticut, Republican state Senator Tony Hwang said that he intends to reintroduce a bill that would strengthen the state's threatening laws. The bill would make them more serious felonies. His son was caught up in a 3 1/2-hour lockdown at his high school in October after a threat that came in by telephone.

"As we were kids growing up — I'm 51 — we always had the notion that it was a childish prank," Hwang said. "but I think we have progressed, or digressed, beyond that."

An analysis by National School Safety and Security Services found a 158 percent increase in the number of threats schools received in a five-month span in 2014 compared with the same period the previous year. About 37 percent of the threats were sent electronically, and nearly one-third resulted in schools being evacuated. Nearly 10 percent of the threats closed school for at least one day.

Some states have laws that specifically address threats at schools. These include Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Virginia and Washington, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other states have laws that do not mention schools specifically but would cover threats to schools.

## Clamping Down On Hoaxes

Other states that have seen recent proposals to increase penalties include New York, Pennsylvania and Maine.

A bill passed by the California Legislature would have created a specific crime for someone who threatens to discharge a firearm on a school campus. But it was vetoed in September. Governor Jerry Brown said that firing a gun on school property was already illegal and he wanted to limit additions to an already huge criminal code.

Dorn said school threats are a popular tactic for people who want to cause major disruptions. As a former school district police chief in Georgia, he said, he has seen that prosecutions can discourage hoax artists.

"This is going to be more a deterrent for the copycat, the person who sees some big event somewhere and then says, 'I'm going to call a school,'" he said. "When it comes to deterring someone like a terrorist, they're not as concerned about consequences."
