WASHINGTON â€” A federal trademark board ruled Wednesday that the Washington Redskins nickname is insulting to [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American). The trademark board decides whether a company has the right to protect its name and logos.

The ruling on the Redskins said that the team's trademark protections should be cancelled. Right now, those protections give the team the legal right to be the only company selling products that use the Redskins name. The board's decision puts new pressure on the team to change its name.

The ruling, which was voted 2-1 by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, came in a case that has been working its way through legal channels for more than 20 years. It doesn't force the team to abandon the name. However, it comes at a time of increasing criticism of team owner Dan Snyder. Political, religious and sports figures have all said it's time for the name to be changed.

The Redskins quickly announced that they will appeal, and the ending of trademark protections will be on hold while the matter makes its way through the courts. That process could take years.

## Pressure Has Been Applied Before

It was the second time the board had issued an opinion on the case. In 2003, a similar ruling from 1999 was overturned on a technicality.

"We've seen this story before," Redskins lawyer Bob Raskopf said. "And just like last time, today's ruling will have no effect at all on the team's ownership of and right to use the Redskins name and logo. We are confident we will prevail once again."

If the ruling stands, the team would still be able to use the name. However, it would lose much of its ability to protect its ownership of the name. If others printed the name on sweatshirts or hats without permission, it would become more difficult to go after them.

Courts overturned the board's previous ruling in part because those challenging the name waited until too long after the team won the right to use it. The case was relaunched in 2006 by a younger group of Native Americans. Having recently become adults, they would not have been able to file a case earlier and so were entitled to file one now. The hearing was held in March of last year.

The chorus of critics against the use of the name has grown over the past year.

## Lining Up To Support Change

On Saturday, the United Church of Christ urged its members to not attend Redskins games or buy Redskins merchandise. Half of the U.S. Senate recently wrote letters to the NFL urging a change. One letter declared that "racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports."

On Wednesday, Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray added his voice to the growing list of critics. The Redskins name will almost certainly have to change, he said, if the team ever wants to build a new stadium in the city.

Snyder, who has vowed repeatedly never to change the name, declined to comment. Redskins players have mostly avoided the topic, aware of a possible conflict because they are employed by the team.

"Our job as players is to focus on what we can on this field day-in and day-out and let the legal people take care of that stuff," quarterback Robert Griffin III said. "And when it's the right time, then we can voice whatever it is we know about the situation."

The Redskins have responded to critics by creating the Original Americans Foundation, which has been giving money to Native American tribes. Suzan Shown Harjo, a lead figure in the trademark case, said the foundation was simply trying to buy public support. She likened what it was doing to bribery.

Supporters of a name change quickly hailed the decision.

"It is just a matter of time," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, until Snyder "is forced to do the right thing."
