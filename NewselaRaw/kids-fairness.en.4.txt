Life is not fair.

That is something that children understand at a young age. What no one knows is how children come to think of what is fair and what is not fair.

A team of scientists studied this. They wanted to know if children are born understanding what is fair or if they learn it.

The team created a game for children to play. The game showed the scientists what children thought was fair or not fair.

The scientists wanted to learn if all children think the same things are fair or not fair. To do this, the scientists had children play their game.

## Kids From Seven Countries

This game was played by about 870 pairs of children. The children lived in seven different countries. They were between the ages of 4 and 15 years old.

The game was simple. Two children sat at a table. The children were given some candy by a machine. Sometimes they were given the same number of pieces of candy. Sometimes they were not. Sometimes one child got more. Only one child got to decide if the candy was given out fairly.

The "deciding" child did this by pulling a handle on the machine. The machine had two handles. If the child thought the candy was given out fairly, he pulled the first handle. This gave the candy to both children. They could then eat it. If the child thought the candy was not given out fairly, he pulled the second handle. This made the candy disappear. No one could eat it.

## More Older Kids See Unfair Share

When the deciding child was given less candy, he usually made the candy disappear. Children in all seven countries did this. The children thought it was not fair to get less candy than the other child.

The results changed when the deciding child had more candy than the other child. Children in four countries thought it was OK to have more. Only children in three countries usually thought this was not fair. 

The older these children were, the more they did not like having more candy than the other child. They thought this was not fair. The scientists were greatly interested by this.

The scientists believe that being fair is more important in some countries than in others. That is why only some children thought it was not fair to have more candy than the other child. These children had learned that was not fair.
