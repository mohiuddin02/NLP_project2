WASHINGTON — Lawmakers can't agree about changing laws to let in more immigrants.

It has created a problem for farmers around the country. They have crops to be harvested and not enough farmworkers.

U.S. farms employ more than 435,000 workers from other countries who are here legally, says the government. Thousands more work on farms against the law. The workers — both legal and illegal — come from Spanish-speaking countries south of the border. States like Florida and California hire tens of thousands of agricultural workers. Being near the Mexican border means immigrants can get there easily.

Far from the border, it is harder to get immigrant workers. In the orchards and fields of South Carolina, farmers need more workers to pick fruit. "There's truly not enough farmworkers now, legal or illegal," said Chalmers Carr. He owns Titan Farms. It is the East Coast's largest peach farm.

## Fruit Needs To Be Picked

Lynn Tramonte works for the group America's Voice. It supports changing U.S. immigration laws to let in more immigrants. It also wants to let some people who came here illegally become citizens. She believes the need for immigrant farmworkers won't go away.

"It might be a seasonal job. But we're going to keep having grapes that need to be picked and cows that need to be milked," Tramonte said. "And immigrants are coming to do that sort of labor."

Immigrant workers who came to the U.S. illegally years ago are retiring. Younger, stronger workers are being kept from the farm fields because they don't have work papers. Farmers say the crops cannot wait.

"We're losing that aging population. But we're also not getting anybody replacing them because of the mess we have at the border and no immigration law," said Manuel Cunha Jr. He is the president of California's Nisei Farmers League. The group represents 180 different types of farms.

## Relying On Immigrant Workers

Some who oppose changing the laws say U.S. workers should fill those jobs. That idea won't work, the farmers say.

"I can clearly tell you Americans aren't out there willing to do these jobs," said Carr.

From 2010 to 2012, Carr said he advertised for 2,000 workers. Only 432 who answered the ads were U.S. workers. Then 390 of them never showed up or they quit on the first day.

Americans fill only about 5 out of every 100 farm jobs, Carr said. The other 95 are filled by immigrants. He said the U.S. must bring in workers to harvest food. The other choice is to import food.

"Americans don't want to do this work. It's seasonal. It tends to be low-paying," agreed Mark Gilson. He owns Gilson Gardens in Ohio, which relies on immigrant workers.

Lawmakers aren't expected to pass an immigration law soon. Waiting to pass a law could mean farms don't have enough workers. Complicated government worker programs add to the problem.

The programs provide passes for immigrants to cross the border for agricultural work. Farmers say the rules are difficult to follow. Farmers must pay workers at least a certain amount of money and check that the workers are who they say they are. The programs are so complicated that some farmers hire illegal workers or move their farms overseas.

## Making Matters Worse

"When we need those workers we have to have them, because Mother Nature doesn't hold up and wait for us to get workers," said Cunha. "When it's time to harvest, it's time to harvest."

On top of that, South Carolina's Carr says the recent flood of children slipping across the U.S. border has made matters worse. Thousands of children from Central America have crossed the border illegally by themselves. It has become a crisis. Now it takes even longer for immigrant workers to get passes to work in the U.S.

Gilson of Ohio said the situation is tough, but farmers have a lot of respect for the immigrant workers. "These aren't just people with their heads down in the field for us," he said. "We respect their hard work, and we share traditional American values with them."
