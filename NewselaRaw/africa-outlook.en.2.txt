Dakar, the capital of Senegal, looks nothing like the sleepy city that Amadou Sy remembers from his youth.

High-rise buildings are shooting up across the city's skyline. Shops and restaurants are filled with people, and everyone seems to own a cellphone, or even two.

Changes like these have given hope to many in Africa. Still, the continent continues to experience high levels of poverty and war.

A survey found that people in major African nations felt more positive about their economic future than many others around the world. The survey was conducted by the Pew Research Center. A country's economy is its level of business activity and availability of jobs.

## Growth Faster Than In U.S.

The International Monetary Fund is a group of countries that work together to improve the world economy. The IMF says that the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, the area that lies south of the Sahara Desert, will grow about 4.5 percent in 2015 as more things are produced and sold in the region. This growth rate is not as high as in the past. However, it is better than in many Western countries, including the United States.

"I am not as optimistic as the people in the survey, but I am more optimistic than I have been in a while," said Sy. He heads the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, a group of professors and academics in Washington. "I can see there is a window of opportunity â€” but it is shrinking."

He noted that the region's population has also been growing rapidly. Although the economies are heading in the right direction, poverty rates have not fallen as quickly as in other parts of the world.

More than 40 percent of the people in sub-Saharan Africa still live on less than $1.25 a day, according to the United Nations.

## Some Worry About Lower Prices

Experts also are seeing signs that could darken Africa's economic future.

For a while, prices for oil and other goods were high. Africa has benefited from these high prices, as it sells much oil. Recently, though, prices have started to decline sharply. China and Europe are the region's main trading partners, and economic troubles in both areas are making Africa's leaders anxious.

Pew's report was based on interviews conducted in the spring with more than 9,000 people in nine countries. Together, the nine countries account for about half the population of sub-Saharan Africa.

The nine countries are Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. They are generally seen as among the more stable on the continent.

## Politics Could Have Changed Results

The timing of the study likely affected the results, since the study was conducted last year.

For instance, the findings in Burkina Faso might have been different had the survey been conducted after last week, when its military took over the government.

"But there are up-and-coming countries," said Staci Warden. She is the executive director of the Center for Financial Markets at the Milken Institute in California. Many of the countries have economic growth rates topping 5 percent and a population that is moving from the countryside to the cities. These countries also have a growing middle class, more democratic elections and better government decision-making.

The countries selected for the Pew poll reflect different levels of development. These differences are seen in the results, said Katie Simmons, one of the study's authors.

More than 8 in 10 people who participated in the poll in Senegal, Burkina Faso and Uganda said their countries need more foreign aid. Just 26 percent of South Africans said that. People in South Africa have the highest incomes among the countries in the study.

## Many Say Their Children Will Be Richer

Across the nine nations, about 60 percent of people said they expect their country's economy to improve over the next year. Latin America came in at 44 percent, trailed by the United States at 34 percent and Europe a distant 24 percent.

Many Africans were also optimistic about the economic prospects for the next generation. About 56 percent believed that today's children would be wealthier than their parents.

But they saw serious problems in their home countries. Chief among them were too few jobs, poor-quality health care and bad schools.

Although most of the respondents said they were at least somewhat confident that their governments would solve the major problems in their countries, they also had criticisms. A large majority considered government corruption a big problem, the study said.

Foreign aid groups and businesses also received largely favorable ratings. But some participants had concerns about bad management and corruption in aid groups and government officials. There were also concerns about the environmental effects of oil and mining.
