KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” It is never too soon to get good advice. Army Sgt. 1st Class Terrence Hoard knows this is true for young adults who want to join the military. He needs to reach them early to set them straight.

They think anybody can join. Many see the military as a last resort in a tough job market. Young people always assume it is an option.

High school graduates will have a harder time joining the armed services than ever in the past 40 years.

Hoard tells them long before they leave school: Don't ever get caught with drugs. Work out, shed weight. And be extra careful about getting tattooed.

## Turning Them Away

"We're turning down twice as many as before," said Hoard, who runs an Army recruiting station in Missouri. He used to sign up 16 to 20 soldiers per month. Now, 10 or 12 will do.

Twelve interested people show up at his office to work out. Among them is Kyle Bayard. His dream of serving was held up for a year. He took attention-deficit disorder (ADD) medicine in high school.

Mauricio Lonza maintained a B average in high school and in college. He was also delayed in joining the military. He failed a written armed services skills test, the ASVAB, three times before he passed.

The ASVAB tests candidates on tools and electrical circuitry as well as on language and math. Lonza explained that math was never his favorite subject.

Hoard turned down four people for having tattoos too low on their arms. All four were turned down the week after the Army's tattoo rules took effect.

The Department of Defense, the government agency that directs the military, recently said it plans to cut the Army's active-duty troops from 520,000 to 490,000 by autumn 2015. Under the plan, about four of every five people who want to join won't make it.

## Military Spending Cuts

Retired Army Lt. Col. Mike Byrd says the military is competing with colleges and jobs. With the cutbacks, the military is looking for the same successful people that everyone else is chasing. Byrd would know: he leads a high school's ;young officer training program in Missouri.

It's expensive to recruit, he added. "We don't have the flexibility we once had to get it wrong with one kid and hope the next one works out."

The government wants to spend less money every year. Military cuts are part of that effort. Congress set limits on military spending last December.

The Army could shrink toward its smallest active-duty force since before World War II. It could also shrink more in the future if the government says so, military leaders said.

What does this mean for young adults? They already have trouble finding jobs and paying for college.

There will be fewer opportunities for them in the military, Byrd said. Fewer young soldiers means fewer people getting college costs covered by military benefits.

One study estimated that three out of four young Americans were not able to join. [Weight alone kept out 27 percent of people wishing to join.](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) Many others were kept out by old crimes, unfinished schooling, or credit card debt, the report said.

Commanders did not have to be as picky when the military was bigger. They could allow people to join with some of these problems.

## Expects High Scores

Only 86 percent of new soldiers at the height of the war in [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq) had completed high school. Many with serious criminal records were allowed in.

Today, 99 percent of new soldiers have graduated from high school. The military expects higher scores in the armed services skills test. Even a small crime on someone's record may prevent him or her from joining.

Nathan Christensen, a Navy official, said that the quality of new sailors and soldiers is the best it's been in 40 years.

Many people who want to join don't know that. They're out of luck when they show up with crimes on their records, without finishing high school, or without being in good shape like the Army requires.

A pickier military affects the rest of the country. The military provides young people with jobs. Afterward, it also helps them pay for college. Without those benefits, they're likely to earn less money, studies have found.

"They call it 'scarring,'" said Sarah Ayres, an economist for a research group in Washington, D.C. "It's not just a right-now problem." It's a problem that will be here for "years down the road."
