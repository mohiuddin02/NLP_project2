ORLANDO, Fla. â€” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday spoke out against stand-your ground laws. He asked members of the NAACP to help get rid of the laws.  Holder is the first black to be the nation's top law enforcement official.

The NAACP, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, is the country's oldest civil rights group. It was founded in 1909.

Holder said the stand-your-ground laws are senseless.

The law came up when George Zimmerman was arrested in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. It did not come up during the trial. People had thought it would. Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting.

## Law Can Lead To Violence

The law lets people defend themselves if they feel they could be hurt or killed. They can even shoot somebody. They do not have to just move away, even if they can.

Laws like that can lead to more violence, Holder said. They do not prevent violence.

"We must stand our ground," Holder said to big applause, "to ensure our laws reduce violence."

Holder also said his office is looking at all the evidence in the case. Federal prosecutors could still decide to charge Zimmerman. Holder did not say how long the review would take.

Holder praised the peaceful reaction to Saturday's verdict. The case raised issues of race because Martin was black. Zimmerman considers himself Latino. Holder also praised the "dignity" of Martin's parents.

Holder also talked about the things he dealt with as a young man because he was black.

## Stopped On The N.J. Turnpike

One time he was stopped on the New Jersey turnpike for no reason, he said. Another time he was questioned by an officer in Washington's wealthy Georgetown district. He was running to catch a movie that night. He also happened to be a criminal lawyer for the government at the time.

When he was a teen, Holder's father gave told him a talk. He told him how to act if he were ever stopped by the police. Holder said he had the same talk with his own 15-year-old son after Martin's death.

Benjamin Todd Jealous is president of the NAACP. He said he was "extremely pleased" that the Justice Department is fully involved in the Zimmerman case. He was also pleased to hear Holder's strong stance against stand-your-ground laws.

Jealous said there was evidence that the judge did not let into the case. The evidence allegedly showed racism was a factor in the killing.

Most of the hate-crime evidence was not allowed as part of the state trial, Jealous said. He noted a relative of Zimmerman's who had said that he committed racial acts. Youth in the community said they think Zimmerman went after them because of their race, he added.

## Discrimination Hurts, Even If Quiet

Holder also talked about the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision that got rid of important parts of the Voting Rights Act. He said the Department of Justice would protect people's right to vote.

 "These problems are real. They are significant. They erode our democracy," Holder said.

Earlier, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan drew applause . He promised to continue investigations into housing discrimination. Those investigations already have resulted in people receiving more than $65 million.

"Blatant, in-your-face discrimination is still very real today," he said. But "a quieter form of discrimination has emerged that is just as harmful to our country."

Here is one example. A report showed that fewer homes are shown to minority families than to equally qualified whites.
