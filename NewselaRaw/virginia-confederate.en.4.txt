More than 150 years ago, Southern states flew the flag during the Civil War. They called themselves the Confederacy. They were fighting against the Northern states. The Confederate states allowed people who owned big farms to keep black people as slaves.

Today, the Confederate flag is not allowed in school.

## 23 Students Suspended

The students said they wore the flag to protest the rule.

They said they were expressing their freedom of speech. This is the freedom to express thoughts and feelings. A total of 23 students were suspended for a day. They had to stay home from school.

Brenda Drake works in the school district. Students cannot wear the Confederate flag at half of all middle schools and the high school, she said. Almost 1 out of 10 students at Christiansburg are black. About 8 out of 10 students are white.

Zach Comer is a student at the high school. He was one of the students who protested Thursday morning. He said the school was not being fair. Everyone else can wear what they want. He said the flag is not anti-black.

## Confederate Flag Pride

At the protest, Comer wore the flag over his shoulders. He also wore a Confederate flag belt buckle and T-shirt.

Some say the Confederate flag shows their pride in Southern history. Others say it means slavery.

Chet Morley graduated from Christiansburg High this year. He saw students wearing clothing with the Confederate flag. Teachers sometimes told students they were not supposed to wear it. Other teachers ignored it.

## Reminder Of Slavery

Morley is black. He said that seeing the flag bothered him. He never said anything about it around his white classmates. Morley said the flag made him think of slavery. His family were once slaves.

Comer said that the students plan to continue the protest. They will wear their Confederate clothing again to school, he said.

Comer said the students made their point.
