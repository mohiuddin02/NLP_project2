In large parts of the world girls cannot go to school. They are kidnapped, attacked and sold in the market. They're forced to cart water around and they're married off early to old men.

Then one extraordinary girl, Malala Yousafzai, escaped the fate of others. She soared to freedom, voicing their pain and terror.

Malala was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi. She has become a symbol of hope in her homeland, Pakistan. Girls there are sometimes slain by their families in "honor killings" if they dare to marry for love. They are also kept out of school in very traditional communities.

The award comes as girls are under attack in countries such as Nigeria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Girls are routinely abused in nations including India, Somalia and South Africa.

## "Award Is For All The Children"

In Nigeria, hundreds of schoolgirls have been kidnapped by the violent Islamist group Boko Haram, and are still being held.

In Iraq, the group Islamic State (ISIL) has kidnapped hundreds of girls from the Yazidi ethnic and religious minority group in recent months. The group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

In India, two girls were killed in a village in May after going outside their home at night to relieve themselves in a field because of a lack of bathrooms.

"This award is for all the children who are voiceless, whose voices need to be heard," Malala, 17, said. She was the youngest person in history to receive the Peace Prize. The award is not often given to women.

Spotlighting the struggles of boys as well as girls, the Nobel committee announced in Oslo that the award was also being given to Satyarthi, 60. He founded Bachpan Bachao Andolan, or the Save the Childhood Movement. The group has campaigned to free thousands of children from forced labor and being sold as slaves. Both Malala and Satyarthi could have been killed for their work for children.

## Each Struggles For Children's Rights

The decision was packed with symbolism: a shared award for a Pakistani and an Indian, each struggling for children's rights in neighboring nations which both have nuclear bombs and have fought several wars with each other. The countries' borders in Kashmir have been racked by intense bombing in recent days. The difference in the two winners' ages illustrated that the struggle for fundamental human rights is everyone's concern.

The committee said the award was "for the right of all children to education." It said it was "an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism."

Malala is a high school student in Birmingham, England, which she moved to for medical treatment after she was shot in Pakistan. She was at school when the prize was announced and made the world wait until after school ended for her comments.

"This is not the end. â€¦ I want to see every child going to school and getting an education," she said.

## Campaigning For Girls' Education

As young as 11, Malala had fought a rule by the Taliban group banning education for girls. She wrote a blog campaigning for girls' education and appeared on TV and in an international documentary.

In October 2012, she was on a school bus in northwestern Pakistan when Taliban gunmen asked for her by name and opened fire. A bullet to the head nearly killed her.

Malala has impressed television audiences with her soft-spoken ideas of forgiveness and peace, and with the strength behind it. Her comments to the United Nations last year voiced her hope for something better for girls: "The terrorists thought that they would change our aims and stop our ambitions but nothing changed in my life except this: Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born."

Shahidullah Jan is an activist for the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. Jan said that Malala's campaign had helped improve girls' access to education in Pakistan. Still, it had done little to change practices such as early marriage and honor killings in deeply traditional regions, Jan said.

"It will take time for the girls inspired by Malala to become educated and start speaking for their rights. It will take time to bring change, but she at least has started the process," Jan said.

## Abuses Against Girls

Liesl Gerntholtz is director of women's rights for the group Human Rights Watch. She said the fact that Malala was awarded the prize was a sign of growing global awareness of abuses against girls.

For Malala, the life she escaped but which millions of others endure represents a prison.

"I didn't want my future to be just sitting in a room and be imprisoned in my four walls and just cooking and giving birth to children," she said in a BBC interview last year. "I didn't want to see my life in that way."
