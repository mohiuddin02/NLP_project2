JENNINGS, Mo. — School districts do not usually operate homeless shelters for their students. They do not often often run food banks or have a system in place to provide whatever clothes kids need. Few offer regular access to pediatricians and mental health counselors, or make washers and dryers available to families desperate to get clean.

The Jennings School District, however, does all of these things and more. It serves about 3,000 students in a low-income, predominantly African-American area just north of St. Louis. 

When Superintendent Tiffany Anderson arrived here 3 1/2 years ago, she was determined to clear the barriers that so often keep poor kids from learning. Jennings has been one of the lowest-performing school districts in Missouri for some time. Her approach has helped fuel a dramatic turnaround.

"Schools can do so much to really (affect) poverty," Anderson said. "Some people think if you do all this other stuff, it takes away from focusing on instruction, when really it ensures that you can take kids farther academically."

## Achievement, Attendance Have Improved

Public education has long felt like a small and fruitless weapon against this town's poverty. Academic achievement, attendance and high-school graduation rates have improved since Anderson's arrival. This month, state officials announced that as a result of the improvements, Jennings had reached full accreditation for the first time in more than a decade.

Gwen McDile, a homeless 17-year-old in Jennings, missed so much school this fall that it seemed she would be unlikely to graduate in June. That changed when she was invited to move into Hope House. Hope House is a shelter opened by the school system to give students like her a stable place to live.

She arrived a few days after Thanksgiving. The 3,000-square-foot house had a private bedroom for Gwen, who loves writing and poetry; a living room with a plush sofa she could sink into, and a full pantry.

She's no longer hungry. She has been making it to class. She believes she will graduate on time.

## College-Prep Program On Saturdays

There also is a new academic intensity in Jennings: Anderson has launched Saturday school, a college-prep program that offers an accelerated curriculum beginning in sixth grade, and a commitment to paying for college courses so students can earn an associate's degree before they leave high school.

Anderson restored music, dance and drama programs that had been cut. She found the money for these and other innovations by closing two half-empty schools, cutting expensive administrative positions and welcoming new grants and a tide of philanthropic contributions.

Sherry Johnson said her daughter Breanna, a sixth-grader in the college-prep program, is being challenged in a way she never was before.

Johnson was one of 175 people who stood in line on Thursday. Each family was there to pick up a box of canned goods, fresh vegetables and a turkey for the holidays. "It helps a lot, it kind of carries us through," said Johnson, whose family lives on her husband's disability checks.

## She Hires Graduates Who Can't Find Jobs

Among those handing out food was Samuel Brown Jr., a 2015 graduate of Jennings High who works as a custodian for the district. He was one of 10 members of his graduating class who didn't find work elsewhere, and Anderson hired all of them. It was an extension of her effort to change lives by reaching beyond the classroom door.

"I've learned how it feels to be getting your own," Brown said of his first job, which pays $9.50 an hour. "I've learned how it feels to be free."

One-quarter of Jennings' residents are living below the federal poverty line, according to 2014 Census Bureau data. The median household income is $28,429. Just 13 percent of those age 25 and up have a bachelor's degree, half of the state average.

Yet in 2015, 92 percent of high school students graduated on time, and 78 percent of those graduates had enrolled in the military or post-secondary training within six months of graduation, according to state data. Governor Jay Nixon invited Anderson and a student to his state of the state address this year, praising Jennings for its "big leaps forward."

## "Just Needed Someone Who Believed In Us"

Jennings still has work to do. Most students are not on grade level in math and reading, and just 36 percent of the graduates in 2015 scored high enough on the ACT, SAT or similar tests to meet Missouri's definition of "college and career ready." But almost every academic indicator has been improving.

Many of the district's initiatives, including Hope House, are done in partnership with social services organizations. But many people in Jennings say that the driving force in this community's turnaround is Anderson.

"We just needed someone who believed in us," said Jeff Arnold, an art teacher in the district for the past 23 years. "She's the best thing that's happened to us in a very long time."

Each morning at 7 and each afternoon at 3, Anderson picks up a stop sign and serves as a crossing guard, ushering children across one of the district's busiest intersections. On chilly mornings, she brings a thermos of hot chocolate, doling out the steaming treat in tiny paper cups and using the moment to check in with children.

"How do you know the needs of the community if you're not in the community?" she said.
