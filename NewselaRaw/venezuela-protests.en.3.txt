DORAL, Fla. — Among a sea of Venezuelan flags, thousands gathered Saturday afternoon in a Doral, Fla., park. They were there to express their support of anti-government protests in Venezuela. Those largely student-led protests have been calling for the resignation of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Protesters are blaming the government for many problems: rising prices, lack of food and poor public services. And they are demanding freedom for jailed protest leaders.

The S.O.S. Venezuela rally at J.C. Bermudez Park was one of more than 155 held in cities around the world. Carrying signs seeking help for their homeland, many who gathered in Doral blamed President Maduro for widespread crime, lack of food and little freedom. They also called on the international community to take action.

"I'm here because we are tired of the government we have," said Maria Archer. A Venezuelan, Archer has lived in the United States for 15 years.

"It is a government that represses the people," she said. It "does not allow freedom of expression," and it is responsible for "food shortages and violence." That's why they were urging people around the world to help get rid of the government in Venezuela, Archer said.

"I was born and raised in Venezuela," said 44-year-old Blanca Aleman, who now lives in Weston, Fla. "I love my country and I want my kids to know the country I knew, not what it is now."

Aleman's 18-year-old son Marc Burnard was able to accompany her. Her parents and brother, however, are still back in Venezuela.

## Thousands Attend Florida Rally

"My brother is very worried," Aleman said. "He has kids in college and he just wants to get out."

The Doral rally attracted as many as 4,000 people, according to police. It was organized by several groups, including Un Mundo Sin Mordaza (A World Without Censorship).

Carlos Tagliafica was one of many South Florida volunteers at the park. He said the rallies were intended to support students in Venezuela, who have been leading protests there.

In Venezuela, protests over the past two weeks have led to violence and deaths. Both the government's enemies and supporters have been protesting in the streets. At least 10 deaths have been reported since Feb. 12.

The protests are being called the biggest since Maduro replaced President Hugo Chavez. Venezuela's former president died March 5 last year.

Protest leader Leopoldo Lopez has been jailed. His arrest has sparked outrage among supporters. The New York–based Human Rights Foundation has declared Lopez a "prisoner of conscience."

In Doral, rally participants joined together in chants, songs, and even prayer. Most were dressed in white.

"It's horrible," Caracas native Veronica Arocha said of the situation in her homeland.

## Food And Medicine Scarce In Venezuela

Arocha, 31, who now lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., keeps in touch with her family back home. She said the country is suffering from many shortages. Both food and medicine are scarce.

"My brother is a Type I diabetic," she said. "He can't find insulin."

Most at the rally were Venezuelan. But people from other Latin American countries had shown up as well.

Cuban-born Berardo Barrero said he was there because he can relate to the situation in Venezuela.

"You have to stand up for the right to liberty in all countries," said Barrero, 57.

Another Cuban at the Doral rally was Ramon Saul Sanchez.

"I'm here to lend solidarity to the Venezuelan people," Sanchez said.

## Raising Awareness Online

Latin Americans from Argentina, Peru, Nicaragua and elsewhere also were present.

"It's great," said Venezuelan Andrea Taglia Ferro, 29, speaking of the support from other Latin Americans. "Our situation is touching them."

She added that the Internet has helped raise awareness.

"The rest of the country is getting involved thanks to Facebook," Taglia Ferro said.

Most protesters agreed that there is only one way to make things better: Venezuela must change leaders.

"The country is sinking," said Enrique Chacon, a native of San Cristobal, Venezuela. The 45-year-old attended the rally with his brother, sister-in-law, nephew and niece.

"They have to let other people manage the country," he said. "They have done everything wrong."
