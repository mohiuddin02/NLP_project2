For more than a year, kids nationwide have been singing "Let It Go," the hit song from the film "Frozen."

Now store owners have their own version of the song — don't let it go.

"Frozen" is now the biggest-selling animated movie of all time. It's also a fast-growing brand that has brought in more than $1 billion a year in sales. In November alone, Disney said it sold 3 million "Frozen" princess dresses.

Princesses Elsa and Anna are on products from dolls to iPhone cases. Even Sven the reindeer and Olaf the snowman appear on merchandise, like T-shirts and dental floss.

## "Frozen" Hit The Jackpot

A full year after the film came out, "Frozen" is making Disney more money than ever, said Robert Iger. He is the chief executive of Disney.

The success of "Frozen" pushed Disney's profit up 19 percent to $2.2 billion for the last three months of 2014. Profit is money made after expenses.

The film helped give the whole toy industry a $531 million boost in 2014, the business research company NPD Group said. "Frozen" was the biggest and fastest-growing toy brand of the year.

"When you have a jackpot like 'Frozen,' it can go on forever," said Jason Moser. He is an analyst at the Motley Fool, a company that gives financial advice. He said Disney is really good at making a movie like "Frozen," then coming out with toys and other products that make the company even more money.

## "Frozen" "Frozen" "Frozen"

"Frozen" has been a huge hit at Toys R Us. At the beginning of 2014, the toy store only offered a few dozen "Frozen" products. By the holidays it had expanded its offerings of "Frozen" products to more than 300, said Richard Barry, the chief merchandising officer.

Disney has also been good at keeping interest in "Frozen" high. Kids can go "Frozen" rides at Disneyland and take a "Frozen" cruise. A new "Frozen" film is coming out in March, called "Frozen Fever," Barry said.

Its success "caught everyone by surprise," said Mike Botterman, the vice president of general merchandise of the 99 Cents Only chain.

"Frozen" is especially attractive because girl-friendly products based on movie characters tend to outsell boy's products by 10 percent, Botterman said. "With girls, there are a lot more fashion items."

## No Pink, Please

Disney starts thinking about products when it is planning a film. In fact, product design can influence the way characters look, instead of the other way around.

Michael Giaimo is the art director for "Frozen" and production designer for "Frozen Fever." He said artists and writers talk with stores and Disney's toymakers while they are making the film. The goal is to design characters that can be turned into popular toys.

"Sometimes there is an initial conversation even before they see any of your designs," he said. "They'll say 'We know girls like this and girls like that.'"

But ultimately, they want to create characters that make a better film, he said. Giaimo avoided the color pink in the movie, for example, except for a deep magenta on Anna's cape, he said.

"I wanted to stay away from a Barbie world," he said. "The sisters were coming off so strong and distinctive" that he didn't want them to look like every other princess in pink.

## Creative Thinking

Some of the creative decisions added to the story but increased the cost of manufacturing products, Giaimo said. Anna's dress, for example, features flowers that appear only in the bottom part of the skirt. This requires that the cloth for an Anna costume be cut a certain way, which wastes fabric — making it more expensive.

The popularity of "Frozen" may eventually prove to be its downfall, some observers said.

Disney has to keep coming up with new characters to get shoppers to stay interested and buy new products, said Gerrick Johnson. He is a business expert at BMO Capital Markets. It is one reason that "Star Wars" merchandise has still so popular nearly 40 years after the original movie came out. But customers constantly faced with new movies and merchandise on store shelves may get tired.

"By 2016, we will be darn tired of 'Frozen,'" he said.

That is a danger that Disney is confident it can avoid.

"It is something we do watch and are careful about," said Josh Silverman, an executive vice president at Disney Consumer Products.

## Products That Everyone Likes

Disney's goal is to create merchandise that appeals on a deeper level to customers, he said.

"When you begin to play with it or eat it or dress it up, we want to make sure that emotional connection" is there as well, Silverman said. Disney wants kids to have the same feelings they get from the movie.

This kind of planning "is one of the amazing things Walt Disney Company does better than anybody else," he said.
