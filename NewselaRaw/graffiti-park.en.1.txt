JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — Andre Saraiva owns nightclubs in Paris and New York, works as the top editor of a men's fashion magazine and has appeared in countless glossy magazines. He is also an internationally known graffiti artist famous for scrawling a cartoon-like figure called Mr. A. on the streets of Paris.

Two months ago he showed up on the website Modern Hiker, along with a photo of a boulder he tagged in Joshua Tree National Park in California. Since then, Saraiva, who lives in France, has been scorned by American nature lovers and thrust into a highly charged debate.

Saraiva is of a new generation of graffiti artists who regard nature — not just manmade structures — as their canvas. They tag national parks, then post photos of their work on the Internet.

Those acts infuriate outdoor enthusiasts, many of whom are otherwise fans of graffiti art.

"This is a very complex issue," said Casey Schreiner, editor of Modern Hiker. "How different is graffiti in national parks than street art? If street art is OK, is this OK? Is there a correlation?"

## Graffiti Surging In Some Parks

Schreiner said his readers think graffiti is a problem because, once a place is tagged, other graffiti artists start doing it too, and also they're extremely upset that nature is being defaced. "National parks are special places for most Americans," he said. "Seeing them marked up is like getting punched in the gut."

Federal officials say graffiti is surging in some parks, even as it has been declining in most others. Hardest hit are parks near big cities, such as Golden Gate National Recreation Area in the San Francisco Bay Area and Joshua Tree, not far from Los Angeles.

In Joshua Tree alone, graffiti artists vandalized the popular Rattlesnake Canyon in 2013. Workers just finished removing graffitti from the face of Barker Dam, and in February, someone painted a large, bright blue giraffe on a boulder in another area in the park. About the same time, someone painted an 8-foot-by-12-foot image of a skull on the wall of a historical structure in the Wonderland of Rocks.

"That makes me sick," muttered backpacker Steve Axthelm, 53, of Portland, Oregon, on a recent weekday as he looked at the skull.

Humans have been leaving marks in nature since prehistoric tribes put silhouette handprints on cave walls.

These days, public acceptance for tagging private property is spreading in cyberspace. Google recently launched a website featuring street art around the world.

## Tagging In Parks Sparks Angry Reactions

But tagging in national parks has a different kind of purpose.

"If provoking outrage is not part of your intention as a graffiti artist, why do it?" said Jeremy Cross, an artist and curator at the Night Gallery in Santa Ana, California.

In the modern art world, throwing graffiti up on a downtown wall is outdated, Cross said. Tagging in a national park makes the work edgier, although graffiti artists are setting themselves up for criticism.

An online petition was started at whitehouse.gov after images posted by an artist appeared in several national parks, including Joshua Tree. The petition urged the Obama administration to take action.

The artist is believed to be Casey Nocket, 22, of New York, said Jeffrey G. Olson, a spokesman for the National Park Service. Evidence collected so far includes selfies of a young woman painting colorful faces in profile on rocks and boulders. Federal authorities suspect Nocket is responsible for graffiti in eight national parks, including Joshua Tree.

The snapshots, signed with the phrase "Creepytings 2014," were posted on California hiking websites Calipidder and Modern Hiker.

Nocket could not be reached for comment.

## New Tools To Catch Taggers

Park officials are fighting back with hidden video cameras to catch taggers in the act and a new computer database, said Joshua Tree park Superintendent David Smith.

A year ago, the park service brought a case against three juveniles after an online investigation of works they posted on Twitter and Instagram.

The hiking community is increasing its own policing. Schreiner said Modern Hiker never intended to investigate graffiti, but the issue has caught fire, "so it's one of the things we do now, full time," he said.

Schreiner added that passions run high, with some readers asking for the addresses of the taggers.

## Famous Tagger Paid A Small Fine

Saraiva is the best-known artist who has tagged in a national park. He has become a favorite target ever since his signature "OX" mark popped up on a boulder the size of a large dog kennel at Joshua Tree.

He then denied that the boulder was even in the park, posting on Instagram that the work was done in a friend's backyard.

Readers then used Google satellite maps, latitude and longitude coordinates and their own field notes to pinpoint the boulder's exact location. Their conclusion? It was inside the park.

Facing a torrent of criticism, his lawyer said Saraiva had scrawled an "insignificant" artistic expression on the rock, using erasable paint.

On April 1, Saraiva paid a fine of $275, officials said.

## Outrage Minimal For Private Graffiti

Los Angeles graffiti artist Kalen Ockerman, 43, who is also known as Mear One, said street art has a purpose.

"Graffiti art is the honest voice of the dissatisfied soul — it's a political act," Ockerman said. "All Andre did was smear a work of art by Mother Nature with industrial chemicals to celebrate his own ego."

Meanwhile, some private businesses forced to paint over graffiti regularly said that too much attention is focused on graffiti in national parks.

"I wish they were just as outraged over graffiti on other people's private property," said Lena Kent. She is a spokeswoman for Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, whose freight cars and engines are tagged on a daily basis.
