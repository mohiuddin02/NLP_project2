Ask a grown-up who her favorite stars are. She will probably name a few actors or singers. Ask a teenager the same question and you will likely get very different answers.

Young people spend a lot of time watching online videos. They go to websites like YouTube and watch short videos. Some of these videos get seen by millions of people around the world. A few of those making the videos become famous. For young people, online videos have become as popular as movies and television.

## Online Video Wins Versus TV

Defy Media is a company that is interested in learning about what teens like to watch and listen to. It did a study recently to find out why Internet videos have become so popular.

Defy studied about 1,350 people between the ages of 13 and 24. It asked questions about online videos and why young people watch what they do.

Defy released its findings on Tuesday. The study found that average teens watch more than 22 hours of online video every week. That is nearly twice as much time as they spend watching TV.

Why are online videos so popular? One of the appealing things about them is that they are recorded by regular people. Many videos are made by teens.

Teen viewers may enjoy seeing videos made by people like them. According to Defy, more than half of 13-to-24-year-olds watch videos online because it makes them feel good about themselves.

Andy Tu works at Defy Media. He mentioned another reason that teens like online videos: they can see who made them.

## Kind Of Like Hanging With Friends

Many people work on a TV show or movie. Hundreds of people work on movies, for example. Writers come up with what the actors will say. Costume designers come up with what the actors will wear. The director decides where to put the camera, and a team of editors put the scenes together into a finished movie. All of this work takes place behind the scenes. Viewers can only see the actors. They cannot see all of the other people who worked on the movie.

Online videos are simpler. An online video is usually made by a single person. Often, people just record themselves on their computers or phones. So, viewers can see who made these videos. Watching these videos might feel like hanging out with friends.

Also, viewers tend to have more in common with the makers of online videos than they do with famous performers. One teen who was part of Defy's study said that she loved singer Nicki Minaj. She found it difficult, however, to connect with her. She and Minaj had little in common.

According to Tu, the teenager said: "Nicki Minaj is all about making money." The teen's life was very different from Minaj's.

## YouTube Daydreamers

Some teens even look up to YouTube stars. More than a quarter of teens said that they were more likely to look up to a YouTube star than to other famous people. Many young people feel closer to their favorite YouTubers than they feel to famous actors and singers.

Additionally, teens can imagine themselves becoming YouTube stars. When asked if they could be a YouTube star, more than half of those surveyed said yes. However, when asked if they could be a TV or movie star, fewer than half said yes.

Defy's study shows that there are several reasons why teens enjoy online videos. Meanwhile, these videos seem to be getting more and more popular.

Tu said he was walking around a shopping center in Los Angeles last weekend. He spotted an event that featured famous online video makers.

According to Tu, there were huge crowds of people gathered to see the Internet stars. But not everyone understood what the fuss was about. Tu said that everyone older than 30 just looked confused.

Nevertheless, Tu is confident that online videos will eventually become popular with both teens and older adults.
