One day last month, an odd pair of security alerts appeared on the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) website. They reminded pilots not to fly over Disney theme parks.

The skies over Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, are "national defense airspace," the alerts warned. Flying over Mickey and Minnie could result in the planes being forced to land, and the pilots questioned and possibly prosecuted in court.

These no-fly zones are known as temporary flight restrictions, like the ones that surround the president when he travels. Flight restrictions were put in place above Ferguson, Missouri, during protests over the summer. Wildfires, air shows and large sporting events regularly get temporary flight restrictions.

Yet there is nothing temporary about the restrictions over the Disney properties. Such limits do not exist over other theme parks such as Universal Studios in Los Angeles or Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California.

## Disney's War With Aerial Advertisers

The Disney restrictions have been in place since 2003, thanks to an addition quietly slipped into a massive congressional spending bill weeks before the Iraq war. Defense and anti-terror officials did not appear to ask for the Disney protections. Instead, they were suggested by Disney, according to an Orlando Sentinel investigation in 2003.

The no-fly zones effectively ended a war between Disney and aerial advertisers who had buzzed over the parks for years before the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The airplanes flew over the theme parks trailing large signs advertising products and events.

The FAA's leader, Michael P. Huerta, testified before Congress last year that if not for the 2003 law, he would end no-fly zones over Disney properties. An FAA spokeswoman said the agency also would like to take a closer look at no-fly zones over sporting events. They were also made permanent by the 2003 law.

Defenders of the zones have said the Disney parks deserve special protection because they are important to American culture and attract large crowds. Critics say that the zones would be useless against a true terror attack. The restrictions instead mostly harm pilots who tow the advertising banners, they say.

"Banner towers used to make money with their banner tows around Disneyland. Now they're not allowed to. People can't take aerial photography shots," said Mark Skinner, owner of Anaheim Helicopters. But "you can fly (around) Knott's Berry Farm, Six Flags, no big deal," he said.

## "Definitely Have A Deterring Value"

According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, nearly 100 aerial advertising firms went out of business after Congress passed the no-fly zone laws over the Disney parks and sporting events. Pilots have been especially critical of the sporting event no-fly zones. They may last just a few hours but occur thousands of times a year.

The restrictions serve no real purpose, said Craig Spence, a vice president for the association, which represents individual pilots and businesses that operate planes.

Skinner said even if an attack was launched on Disneyland, no one would be actively patrolling the park's airspace. "If something bad were to happen, how quickly could they get something up there? Not quick enough," he said. "A plane can cover three miles in literally a minute."

Richard W. Bloom is the director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. He said the no-fly zones were "certainly not foolproof." However, they "definitely have a deterring value" as one of many layers of security that protects American airspace.

A Disney spokeswoman said the no-fly zones protected the public. "We believe the airspace restrictions over large gathering places like sports stadiums and our theme parks continue to make sense for enhancing public safety," Cathi Killian said.

In 2003, however, Disney seemed to say it wasn't only thinking about terror attacks.

At the time, Disney spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said the only motive for the restrictions was "the safety and enjoyment of our guests." But Goodman added that "enjoyment" included keeping out "banner ads from trial lawyers" and pilots "buzzing the parks."

## No-Fly Zone Upheld In Court

The no-fly zones have been challenged in court, without success.

A Christian group, the Family Policy Network, sued the government in 2003 to allow a pilot to fly a banner that read "Jesus Christ: Hopeforhomosexuals.com" over Walt Disney World during Gay Day, a gay pride event. The group argued that the no-fly zone was unfair. It mentioned that Disney didn't own the airspace, and other theme parks and potential terror targets, such as downtown Chicago, didn't have similar no-fly zones.

In response, government attorneys defended the Disney no-fly zones. They said attackers could plow planes into crowds of tourists, drop bombs on them, or spray them with chemical or biological agents.

Also, Disney's place in American's hearts and minds, they argued, deserved the protective space.

A federal judge threw out the Family Policy Network's arguments. The judge wrote that combating terror required unquestioning obedience to Congress' action.

More than a decade later, the attorney who fought the Disney no-fly zone, Steve Crampton, chuckled when he was reminded of the government's arguments. "Reading it now, it's kind of a 'you've got to be kidding me, right?' reaction," said Crampton, chief counsel for the American Center for Constitutional Rights.

Since the no-fly zones began, there have been no major terror attacks, Crampton pointed out. "I would say, today, that the case for protecting Disney is even weaker than it was when we argued those cases," Crampton said.
