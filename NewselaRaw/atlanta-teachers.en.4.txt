ATLANTA â€” For years, teachers in Atlanta changed the answers on student tests. They wanted to make it look like students were doing better in school than they actually were.

On Wednesday, a jury decided that 11 people who were teachers and school officials had cheated. A jury is group of people who listen to a court case. When someone is accused of a crime, the jury must decide whether that person is guilty or innocent.

The 11 teachers could be sent to prison for many years.

Ten of the former teachers and officials were handcuffed and taken to jail. The 11th was at home because she is having a baby.

Only one former teacher, Dessa Curb, was not found guilty. The jury decided she was innocent.

## Teachers Secretly Erased Wrong Answers

During the trial, several teachers described how the cheating worked. After students finished taking tests, teachers secretly erased the wrong answers. They then wrote in the right answers. Many of the students could not read, write or do basic math. Their tests did not show that. Because of the good test scores, students were often passed on to the next grade.

The teachers did not just cheat the school system. They cheated the students. The fake test scores made schools miss out on government money. This money could have paid for tutoring or other programs to help students catch up. Lawyers said the district lost $8 million in 2009 alone.

The case began in 2008. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper raised questions about the unbelievably high test scores. The state began reviewing the students' test answer sheets. It found that too many wrong answers were erased and replaced with correct answers.

## 2011 Report Said Cheating Was Widespread

Fourth grade tests at one school were especially bad. The students had almost no chance at scoring as well as the tests said they did.

Special investigators spoke to hundreds of Atlanta Public Schools workers. A 2011 report found widespread cheating. It also said that thousands of schoolchildren missed out on the education they deserved.

Lawyers for the state said the superintendent was to blame. She demanded that the test scores become higher and higher. If students got bad test scores, some teachers were fired. They also were publicly embarrassed.

"I have always felt the whole thing was tragic," said Erroll Davis. He served as district  superintendent after Hall was fired.

## Mayor Wants City To Move Forward

Kasim Reed is the mayor of Atlanta. He said hoped jury's decision would allow Atlanta to "finally close this chapter."

Richard Quartarone is a father of two kids in an Atlanta school. He said it brings his city no closer to healing. The cheating had gone on for too many years.

Judge Jerry Baxter was the judge in the case. He made it clear he will show little sympathy to the former teachers.

They are guilty of serious crimes, Baxter said. He said he does not like to send anyone to jail, but the teachers knew what they were doing was wrong.

Gerald Griggs is the lawyer of Angela Williamson. She used to be a teacher. She told students what the right answers were on the tests.

Griggs said he respected the court decision. Still he asked, "How do you send teachers to prison?"

The Atlanta school system called the case a "sad and tragic chapter" that is now over. It said that the new superintendent and the school board are working together to make sure the teachers do not cheat again.
