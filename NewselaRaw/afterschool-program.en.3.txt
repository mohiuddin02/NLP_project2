OROSI, Calif. —  Emilio Isazaga is only 17 years old. Yet already he has been through many struggles. His mother was forced to leave the United States and return to Mexico. She had come to the U.S. against the law. 

Emilio now lives with his grandmother and younger sister. Emilio recently got in trouble with the police. He hopes going to school will help him "out of the struggle." An education will help Emilio and his family lead better lives.

Emilio goes to an after-school program in Orosi called Tech Connect. He learns how to repair computers. The program also helps students in many other ways.

## Everyone Goes To College

Every student in Tech Connect has gone on to college. This is a great achievement. Over half the adults in their town did not finish high school.

Miguel Castañeda started Tech Connect in 2009. Castañeda grew up in a poor farming area. He believes students in poor areas should have the same chances as those in richer areas.

"It's hard out here," he says about the town of Orosi. He added that many people get paid very little to work as farm workers. The town has many gangs and can be dangerous.

## Only 30 Places For More Than 100 Applicants

The Tech Connect Class lasts for one year. There are only 30 spaces. More than 100 high school students usually sign up. Castañeda does not take only the kids with the best grades. He looks for students who really want, and need, to learn.

Emilio is one of those young people. Even with his troubles, Emilio graduated from high school two years early at age 16.

One of the reasons Emilio loves Tech Connect is because Castañeda has become like a father.

Not long ago, Emilio sat in the classroom. He listened to sirens screaming in the distance outside. 

"Right now, it's helping me stay out of those sirens, right?" says Emilio. "It will help me build some character, help out my people, you know? I feel like it's a good choice, to help out."

## A Leader Who Does Whatever It Takes

At Tech Connect, students learn how to fix computers. They are also required to do community service. They clean up graffiti around town and feed the homeless. They teach adults how to use computers. 

Castaneda also takes students on field trips to colleges and tutors them. He helps them find jobs, too.

Adylene Saucedo is 15. She says Castañeda is a great leader. "He will do whatever he can to help you out."

## A Great Role Model

Elizabeth Gonzalez writes grants, or letters, asking the government for money to help pay for Tech Connect. Recently, she watched Castañeda teach students about computer parts. "This subject could be really boring, but as you can see, the kids are really engaged," she said. 

Many of Emilio's classmates agree that Castañeda is a great role model. He had a rough life when he was young, says Christian Salacup, 15. Still, he was able to find his way. "He teaches us to help your community, help other people," added Christian. 

Emilio hopes to go to community college. Then he will transfer to a four-year college. He is sure the skills he has learned through Tech Connect will help him.

"Hopefully I get to get out of my struggle too," he said.
