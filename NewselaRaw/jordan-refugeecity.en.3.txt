ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan â€” The Zaatari Refugee Camp used to be just empty desert.

In three years, it has become the Middle East's largest camp for refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. The Middle East is located between Europe, Africa and Asia. About 81,000 people live at the camp. That makes it Jordan's ninth-biggest city.

Most of the Syrian refugees will not be going back home anytime soon. The war between the Syrian government and rebels has lasted five years.

## Camp Life Is Tough

Some try to make the best of life in the camp. A Zaatari high school student studied hard in school. The student then won money to go to college. A farmer planted a garden because he was tired of looking at the desert.

Many others leave every week to go back to Syria. They say it is better to risk death in Syria than live in the camp. There are few jobs. One out of 3 children do not go to school. Thousands of young adults do not have a chance to learn a job skill.

Zaatari began on July 28, 2012. Today, Jordan, which is next to Syria, is home to 629,000 Syrian refugees. More than 100,000 live in camps in Jordan. The rest struggle to live in Jordanian cities. They get money and food from the United Nations (U.N.), an international group that helps refugees.

In Zaatari, people talk about whether to stay or go back to Syria.

Around 30 people return each day. About 120 people used to go back daily. Several months ago, there was major fighting in an area where many Zaatari residents were from.

## Trying To Make It Like Home

On a recent day, Emad Issawi and his family stood along a road with a pile of bags. They were waiting to catch a bus to Syria. Those who leave Jordan are rarely allowed back.

"I'm scared," his wife, Nihad, said.

Others try to be happy in the camp.

Jumma al-Sheik planted corn, tomatoes, mint and pink flowers near his home. His family gathers there to talk and drink sweet tea.

Al-Sheik and his family members left Syria after attacks by the government two years ago. Fighting destroyed their homes.

Al-Sheik said the garden "makes everything a little better."

Abdel Mutalleb Hariri arrived in January 2013. He sent his six children to camp schools. He cannot work as a veterinarian, so he now sells clothes. His wife teaches English.

Their oldest child is 19 years old and is named Alaa. She studied hard and won money for college. She finished her first year at a nearby university.

"Education is the way, especially if you live in a camp," Alaa said. She is one of just a few in her class to finish high school. Most students drop out, some because they cannot afford the university.

## Wishes For A New Generation

The camp has opened new doors for some people.

For hundreds of girls, life in Zaatari has meant a chance to play soccer. On a recent afternoon, about two dozen girls in headscarves practiced.

"Shoot! Shoot!" coach Nour al-Dhaher yelled from the bench.

For others, doors are closing.

There has been an increase in early marriages. Some families marry off girls in their mid-teens. It has become too tough to support their daughters.

"Here you have to get married young because the situation is difficult," Sabrine al-Masaad said. She runs a bridal shop. One of her recent brides was just 14 years old.

A new generation of Syrians is being born far from home.

Maan Turkman gave birth in her shelter. Hours later, twins Mohammed and Ahmed lay asleep in their cradles. They were wrapped in blankets.

"I wish them a bright future in Syria," she said.
