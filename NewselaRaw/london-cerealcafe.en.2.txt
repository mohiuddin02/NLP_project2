LONDON, England — One of London's fastest-changing neighborhoods is feeling the snap, crackle and pop of conflict.

An East End cafe that serves 120 varieties of breakfast cereal — and 30 types of milk— has become a surprising site for protest. The conflict is part of London's increasingly wide split between rich and poor.

## "It Is A Bit Weird"

The Cereal Killer Cafe has drawn both insults and big crowds since it opened nine months ago. The restaurant offers a wide variety of flakes, pops and puffs from about 3 pounds - or $4.50 - a bowl. On the weekend, it attracted the anger of protesters who are against changes called gentrification, which make the neighborhood appealing to wealthier people and too expensive for less wealthy people. The protesters surrounded the business with flaming torches and scrawled "scum" on its windows as customers sought safety in the basement.

"It is a bit weird," said Gary Keery, who runs the cafe with his brother, Alan. "I don't see us as hateful people — but a lot of people seem to."

The Keery brothers are fashionably bearded 33-year-old twins from Belfast, Northern Ireland. They are among the latest wave of migrants to this mixed part of east London. Over the decades European Jews, Bangladeshi Muslims and hipsters from around the world have arrived. They brought bagel shops and curry restaurants, espresso bars and independent fashion boutiques to Brick Lane and nearby Shoreditch.

## "Childhood, When Cereal Was Fun"

It is that diversity that made the Keery brothers choose the area for their breakfast business.

"There's a lot of creative things happening," Gary Keery said. "A cat cafe just opened up around the corner. We just knew that if it was going to work, it would work in Brick Lane."

That hunch was correct, judging by the crowds of students, tourists and families lining up for a bowl of milk-soaked comfort food in the quirky cafe. The cafe shelves are lined with brightly colored cereal boxes.

"It takes people back to their childhood, when cereal was fun," Gary Keery said.

## Protesters Wearing Pig Masks

But not everyone is a fan. On Saturday, anti-poverty protesters targeted the cafe as a symbol of all that is wrong with London's development. Video shot from inside showed a group, some in pig masks and carrying torches, shouting outside. Staff were seen telling customers to go downstairs.

Police say one officer was injured by a flying bottle during the protest. The demonstration was organized by a group called Class War.

Tony Travers is an expert on Britain's capital city at the London School of Economics. He says the cereal storm is a war "about something much, much bigger." The squeeze on space in a booming city. London's population, already 8.6 million, is growing by 120,000 people a year.

## It's The Rent, Not The Cereal

Developers are building just 20,000 to 25,000 new homes each year. Therefore, rents and property prices climb ever higher.

The East End has a long-established working-class population. Now it has been joined — and sometimes pushed out — by thousands of wealthy young professionals in renovated buildings and shiny new developments. The result is an area where fancy food shops sit alongside discount stores. One-bedroom apartments sell for $750,000 and up. However, almost half of children in one part of the area, Tower Hamlets, live in poverty.

Travers said the cereal cafe is "an innocent casualty of a wider struggle for territory in the city."

Class War says it is delighted with the publicity it has received. It plans to put on more protests outside independent businesses.

## Cafe Gets More Customers

"The fight against gentrification has basically been lost and it's speeding up all the time," Class War founder Ian Bone told The Guardian newspaper. "So our philosophy is to go back to areas which have already been gentrified and start taking the fight back to them."

The Keery brothers are undaunted. They recently opened a second branch in London, and have a cereal cookbook coming out next month.

The attack has brought new customers to the cafe.

"There are worse things in the world than people eating cereal," said Tess Hoey, from Sussex in southern England, who came to show her support.

She said those concerned about London's property crisis should talk about rich Russian businessmen who buy up homes, "not boys from Belfast."
