INDIAN LAND, S.C. â€” Spinning wheels will hum again in Lancaster County, South Carolina, next spring.

Keer, a textile company headquartered two hours from Shanghai, China, is building yarn manufacturing lines in Lancaster, creating more than 500 jobs.

The Carolinas were once the epicenter of the U.S. textile industry, but since the late 1990s, thousands of jobs were lost when emerging markets joined the game, touting cheaper materials and labor. Carolinas textile jobs went to China, Brazil and Vietnam, among other places.

Now, in an ironic turn of events, Chinese companies are looking to manufacture in the United States, lured by lower costs of energy, cotton and land. The companies are also worried about rising labor costs in China.

## Lost-Job Pain Still Felt

Wally Wang, deputy general manager at Keer America, believes more Chinese textile companies and other manufacturers will follow Keer to the United States.

That would be welcomed in Lancaster County, where the pain of lost textile jobs still resonates.

Carolyn Summers worked for Springs Industries in Lancaster for 42 years before being laid off in 2005 when she was 63. Her daughter, who worked for Springs as a bedding products designer, lost her job two years later.

"They opened the door wider for more imports to come into the country," Summers said. "We got flooded with a lot more cheaper textiles than we were able to produce." She remembers leaving the factory "in total shock" the day she heard the news.

Springs Mills in Lancaster once employed close to 20,000 people, but in 2007, the last South Carolina textile factory closed. Springs Global reports it employs fewer than 450 in four South Carolina locations that handle warehouse, distribution and services.

Lancaster County lost 11,000 textile jobs from 1995 to 2007. The greater region lost about 26,000 jobs at textile mills in the past 20 years, according to Federal Reserve data.

Since the factories closed, Summers said, "we haven't had the luxury of textile here. We didn't think that'd ever come back."

At least 140 employees will begin working at Keer's new site starting in spring. Most will make yarn on 32 production lines.

## Competition Coming From All Sides

China's market share in the global textile industry had rocketed in the past two decades. Lately, though, Chinese textile companies have been stressed by competition within its borders and by its rising costs of labor, power and land.

Keer decided to relocate part of its yarn production line to Lancaster, in a $218 million investment.

While the first plant operates, construction workers will lay the foundation for a second factory to the south of it. The construction will take less than 18 months. After that, Keer intends to build two more factories, bringing its total space to more than 1 million square feet and 500 jobs.

SC Ready, a workforce training program in South Carolina, is helping Keer recruit and train local electricians, technicians and fabric sales representatives. One-third of the program applicants are former textile workers who want to get back to the industry.

## Bringing Textiles Back Has Benefits

Nearly 200 years ago, cotton brought textile mills to the Carolinas, and it is cotton that will bring them back.

"Cotton price is the biggest challenge to our profit" in China, Wang said. Cheaper cotton in the United States is a major draw.

The cost to manufacture in China has risen in the past few years. Feeling the competition intensify, Keer looked toward the Carolinas, after ruling out Vietnam, India and Pakistan as potential destinations.

Keer's yarn production had been using American cotton for years; now it simply moved closer to be able to use more.

Wang counted the list of benefits Keer can enjoy in South Carolina. "It is a state built on manufacturing; its workforce is used to the 24/7 schedule; it has the super low labor union member rate; its government has a lot of benefiting policies; it has a variety of manufacturing industries in the region; its electricity supply is cheap and stable."

Said Wang: "Except for human labor, all other production factors are cheaper in the U.S."

## Energy Costs Make A Difference

To be sure, China retains its competitive advantage in many areas of textile manufacturing, including labor-intensive apparel production, which benefits from low labor costs, according to Yingjiao Xu, an associate professor at the College of Textiles at N.C. State University. Manufacturing yarn and fabrics, however, is more automated. U.S. sites have the an upper hand there because of lower-cost energy.

Keer took the lead in approaching the South Carolina Department of Commerce, which surprised John Ling, a China native who has worked for the department. He at first doubted a Chinese textile company would even think about going to the United States.

"The cost difference between the two countries has certainly been narrowed greatly in recent years," Ling said.

A turning point came in 2010, when the Chinese government introduced a series of bank loan and financing benefits for private enterprises to invest abroad.

Previously, the Department of Commerce worked on just three to five Chinese investment projects every year. Now, there are 20 to 25 Chinese companies visiting South Carolina to evaluate investment opportunities every year, according to Ling.

## "It's Just The Beginning"

Doug Woodward, who teaches economics at the University of South Carolina, described the incoming Chinese companies' investment as "small tiptoes into the U.S. for these big companies." But "it's just the beginning," he believes.

Wang, now based in an office in uptown Charlotte, is coordinating resources across the two hemispheres. He said Chinese investment in the United States "was like water drops, but now there's a little stream flowing."
