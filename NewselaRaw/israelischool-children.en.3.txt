REHOVOT, Israel â€” Israeli children returned to school Monday in a sign that life was getting back to normal after war.

Despite balloons and cheerful signs, though, this was not a typical first day.

The return to school is always something of a national holiday in Israel. This year, though, feelings were mixed. Students, parents and teachers were relieved to get back to everyday life. Yet, they were still sorting through the heartbreak of a summer of war.

Last week, an agreement was made to end the 50-day war between Hamas and Israel. Hamas is the Palestinian Islamic group that rules the neighboring Gaza Strip.

## Contrasting Israeli And Gaza Schools

In Israel, students will be eased back with two weeks of discussions about their experiences. Schools will also take part in "relaxing activities." These will help children express their feelings about the war, the Education Ministry said. Schools paid special attention to students who lost loved ones in the fighting.

Israelis were also concerned about safety, although the agreement to end fighting seemed to be holding.

In Gaza, it will be weeks before the school year can begin. At least 220 schools were damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombs. Many schools still serve as shelters for Palestinian families who lost their homes in the war. In the meantime, half a million Gaza students will be out of school.

## Tough Questions From Youngest Children

In Israel, many elected officials went to schools to welcome students back. Many of them visited schools in the south, which was hardest hit by rocket fire from Gaza.

Schoolchildren in the southern Israeli town of Netivot had many tough questions for Communications Minister Gilad Erdan. What would happen if Israel were to overthrow Hamas? Why does Israel provide electricity to Gaza?

Erdan said these are the questions of university students, "not children returning from summer vacation."

At 5, Daniel Neardea just started kindergarten. He lives in the Israeli town of Rishon LeZion. Daniel recognizes the different sounds of incoming rockets and Iron Dome interceptors. Iron Dome is the name of Israel's air defense system that shot down many rockets fired from Gaza. Daniel can also name the head of the Israeli army and the top Hamas political leaders.

His mother, Enav Neardea, described the summer as "loud." She said her children got used to the rockets and sirens, even when they were out at the playground or swimming pool. "I guess they understand this is part of their lives now," Neardea said. She said she was relieved to have her children back in school.

## Parents Hard Hit By School Budget Cuts

To help pay for the war, Israeli government departments must cut their spending by 2 percent. The Defense Department is the only exception. That department is in charge of the country's army.

The Education Ministry will lose about $140 million.

Shay Piron is the head of the Education Ministry. He insisted the cuts would not harm key school programs or shorten the school day.

Still, many parents argue that the Israeli government does not spend enough money on its schools. Even before the war, Israel spent less than many other countries. Parents have to dig into their pockets for money to help their children's schools.

Parents will feel the effect of the cuts, said Sophie Hod. She is a policewoman and mother of two. Hod said parents had been told that school costs would go up. "I suppose there's not much choice," Hod added. She said that tourism, business and most other areas were also suffering.

Everything takes second place to Israel's safety, "but that's how it must be here for now," she said.

## Thinking Of Safety

Over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he would like to spend money for good government services. However, he said, the country's safety "must come first."

More taxes are unpopular in Israel like everywhere else. Yet, some elected officials suggested a short-term increase in taxes. They said that would be a fairer way to pay for the war. Money should not be taken from government services, they said. The citizens who need these services, like food or shelter, will suffer.

Environment Minister Amir Peretz voted against the cut. He said it would hit poorer Israelis "directly in the pocket." Peretz said the government should "have enough courage" to make everyone pay a short-term tax.
