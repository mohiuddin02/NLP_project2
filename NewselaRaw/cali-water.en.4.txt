LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — On April 1, Governor Jerry Brown stood on a patch of brown grass in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. The ground there should be covered with a few feet of snow at this time of year.

Governor Brown watched as workers checked the snowy parts of the area. Everyone is worried about the snow levels. California needs lots of snow so that people can use the water that snow becomes when it melts.

Brown decided to make new rules about using water. California has never had water rules like these before. The state has to try something new because it is not getting enough rain. It is called a drought.

The State Water Resources Control Board makes decisions on how water is used in California. The board is also in charge of making sure water stays clean and safe to drink.

## New Water Rules

Brown told the board to make sure California uses much less water. He said he has a plan for how everyone can help.

Other parts of Brown's plan include:

—Making sure golf courses and other grassy areas use less water.

—Helping cities get rid of grass. Brown says they should put in rocks or plants that use less water.

—Helping people buy dishwashers and washing machines that use less water.

—Asking workers not to water the grassy areas between traffic lanes.

—Making water more expensive so people don't waste it.

## Why Snowpack Is Important

Frank Gehrke has been part of California's snow measuring program since 1987. He said there is always snow on the ground on April 1. That's when California's "snowpack" measurements are usually the highest.

Snowpack measurements are different than just measuring how deep the snow is. Some snow is packed almost as tight as ice and other snow is loose and fluffy. The tight snow and the loose snow contain different amounts of water. That is why scientists don't measure how many inches of snow is on the ground. They melt it down to see how much water it makes.

When the snowpack melts, some of the puddles soak down into the ground. Some of the melted snow flows into streams and rivers. The melted snowpack usually makes up almost a third of California's water supply. This year, there will only be a tiny amount.

Water reserves are places where extra water is stored. A couple of storms just raised California's stored water levels. The State Water Resources Control Board said it was still not enough. The board said California needs water from melted snow.

Felicia Marcus is in charge of the Resources Control Board. She said the snow problem is "just terrifying."

## An Emergency Plan

Marcus and the board put together an emergency plan. The plan has stronger rules about using water. The board says cities should only let people water their yards a certain number of days.

They will make the rules tougher if things don't get better soon. So far, Marcus said the board isn't happy. They aren't seeing big enough changes.

Governor Brown agrees that things need to change. He and other lawmakers have created new plans. Last week, the governor signed a $1 billion plan to make it into a law.

Most of the money will go to big projects like water treatment plants. The projects will help with water in California, but they will take a long time to complete.

A much smaller part of the money will help people make changes right away. That money will buy food and water supplies. It will also protect California's environment from the lack of rain.
