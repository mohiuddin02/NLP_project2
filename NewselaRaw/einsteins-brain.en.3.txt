If you were asked to name a genius, physicist Albert Einstein is probably the first person you'd think of. Now it turns out there was something special about his brain: He had an enormous corpus callosum.

The corpus callosum is a dense cluster of neural fibers. These are sort of like wires carrying messages from the brain.

The corpus callosum stretches nearly the full length of the brain, right down the middle. It carries electrical signals between the brain's right and left halves. These halves are known as cerebral hemispheres. Signals between them make different brain regions work together.

Einstein's large corpus callosum may partially explain why he was such a genius.

## The Man Who Removed Einstein's Brain

A new study published this week compared the 76-year-old's corpus callosum to those of a group of men. It was thicker in most parts than those of 15 elderly males. And in five key spots, it was also thicker than those of 52 young men.

After Einstein died in 1955, his family allowed his brain to be removed for scientific study. Many slides were made of cross-sections of the brain.

Some of those slides still exist. But many have been lost or stolen. Without a full picture of Einstein's brain, neuroscientists — researchers who study the brain — couldn't look for the reason for his genius.

Then, in 2010, anthropologist Dean Falk became aware of a forgotten set of photographs. These were eventually located among the papers of Dr. Thomas Harvey. Back in 1955, Harvey had removed Einstein's brain.

The new study is based on the photos Harvey took.

## Spatial And Mathematical Creativity

Shortly after finding the photos, Falk was contacted by Chinese scientist Weiwei Men. Men had heard that the new pictures included views of Einstein's corpus callosum. He suggested to Falk that they work together on a study.

Last year, the two researchers published a first report. This offered a remarkably detailed look at the brain's surface. The brain's extra folds showed evidence of unusual size in a number of regions. These were regions that were probably key to Einstein's spatial and mathematical creativity.

The high-resolution photos even revealed evidence of Einstein's lifelong love of playing the violin: A large "knob" was found on the surface of the primary motor cortex. This is the region that usually controls the left hand.

The latest study is based on several of these same photographs. The pictures show the corpus callosum very clearly.

The researchers were particularly impressed by the size of one part of Einstein's corpus callosum: the splenium. That region aids communication among three parts of the brain, the parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. The parietal and occipital lobes are key to spacial and mathematical thinking.

## A Brain Fit For A Genius

Earlier studies of Einstein's brain found that some regions were bigger than those of normal people. This was particularly true of the prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobes. But, the authors wrote, Einstein's genius was not only due to the size of these regions. It can also be explained by his thicker-than-usual corpus callosum. This made communication between the two sides of his brain better than average.

Neuroscientist Peter U. Tse believes there may be another way to look at what the researchers found. The more we use our brains as we age, he said, the less our brains decline. Einstein's brain was much more developed than those of the older men. But it was not so different from the brains of the young men.

This might be because Einstein continued to exercise his brain heavily. He may have prevented the decline that usually comes with age.

"It might just be that Einstein's brain was more like a young person's brain," Tse said. "The brain is like a muscle." If we use it a lot, it's more likely to stay fit.

Einstein's genius might not be due to the parts of his brain that were "slightly larger than average," he said. In fact, his brain might not have been that way when he was born. Perhaps those areas became larger because he exercised them so much.
