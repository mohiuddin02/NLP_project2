WASHINGTON — On Tuesday night, an Amtrak train went off the tracks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At least seven people were killed. The terrible accident raised questions about the safety of the nation's busiest train line.

The accident occurred along a stretch of the heavily traveled Washington to Boston route. The route is known as the Northeast Corridor.

Investigators determined that the train had been speeding. It was rounding a curve at twice the speed limit when it left the tracks.

Some say the curve where the accident happened is dangerous. They have long said that such sharp curves in the tracks should be replaced.

## Lack Of Money Delays Repairs

Amtrak is a national railroad service funded by the government. Some people feel it receives too little money to meet its needs.

Because it does not have enough money, Amtrak cannot make make necessary improvements. Repairs to aging bridges, tunnels and tracks are being delayed.

Amtrak has hardly enough money to keep things running, said railroads expert Steve Ditmeyer. Many things that should be repaired or replaced are left as is, he said.

The seven-car train traveling from Washington to New York derailed Tuesday night in Northeast Philadelphia.

Pieces of the train were spread around the track. Part of the train overturned, and one car was left a twisted heap of shredded metal.

## Train Was Going Too Fast

On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said the train had approached the curve at more than 100 miles an hour. The speed limit there is 50 miles an hour.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s there were plans to straighten out curves in the Northeast Corridor's tracks. The improvements never happened because in the end the government decided not to pay for them.

Half of the line's bridges were built between 1900 and 1920. Two tunnels under Baltimore, Maryland, were built way back in the 1870s.

"These are ancient things," Ditmeyer said. "They're well over a hundred years old." Many are falling apart and badly need to be fixed or replaced, he said.

The twin tunnels under the Hudson River in New York were built in 1910. They were heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Tens of thousands of travelers pass through the tunnels every day.

Amtrak President Joe Boardman says the tunnels need to be replaced soon. "We've got to do it — the nation has to do it. We have to find the money," he said last year.

## A System To Avoid Crashes

Amtrak is in the process of installing a system to avoid crashes. The system, called positive train control, is designed to prevent trains from going faster than the speed limits as they approach curves.

Ditmeyer said the Northeast Corridor was long ago equipped with a system called automatic train control. That system prevents trains from running past stop signals. However, it does not correct for fast speeds ahead of curves.

Unlike Amtrak's long-distance trains, which are diesel powered, the Northeast Corridor is electrified. The system of wires and steel supports that supplies electrical power to the trains dates back to the 1930s.

Amtrak says 62 percent of the wires and 42 percent of the steel supports need to be replaced.
