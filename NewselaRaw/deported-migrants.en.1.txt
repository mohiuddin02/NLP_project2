MEXICO CITY — In a corner of Alejandra Pinzon's room in Mexico City is a pink drawer full of her most cherished possessions: a jumble of keepsakes that connect her to a life that's slipping from her grasp.

Alongside homecoming photos from her Kansas high school, a report card with lots of A's and a B-minus in Spanish, and a letter from her aunt in Missouri is a Taylor Swift concert ticket.

"I'm obsessed with Taylor Swift," said Pinzon, who's known by her friends as Ali. She recalled how her best friend, Kristin, surprised her during the concert with a birthday message that flashed behind the country singer: "Happy late 17th birthday, Alibear!"

Just months after seeing Swift perform in 2010, Pinzon faced an irreversible decision — whether to return to Mexico. Her choice would forever shape her future.

## In A State Of Limbo

Pinzon was 17 and living in the United States illegally. She wanted to go to college, but knew that wasn't an option. If she went back to Mexico, she decided, she'd be able to get her degree there. Then, hopefully, a U.S. company might sponsor her to return to the United States on a work visa. She might be back in as little as four or five years, and in the meantime, she wouldn't have to worry about getting deported.

Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.

When Washington lawmakers debate the pros and cons of immigration policy, immigration is framed as a political issue. But the repercussions are real for young people such as Pinzon. An estimated 500,000 Mexicans ages 15 to 32 returned to their homeland from 2005 to 2010. Now, many are caught in a state of limbo between countries.

Pinzon, now 21, lives in Mexico City — but emotionally, she's tied to the American Midwest.

According to Jill Anderson, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, young people like Ali are in a "very painful and confusing space, because the question is 'Where do I belong?' and 'To whom do I belong?' And I think that becomes even more painful when you're separated from your family."

Ali Pinzon could be anyone's American-born next-door neighbor. She adores country music and peppers her sentences with "like" and "you know." But she's not next door anymore — she's in Mexico City, far away from friends and family.

## A Family Divided

Pinzon's family has been divided by the consequences of U.S. immigration policy. While sister Lulu — born in the United States and thus a U.S. citizen — lives in St. Louis, their younger sister, Gaby, 19, now lives in Mexico City.

In the spring of 2010 as she was about to graduate from high school, Pinzon felt she had two choices. She could remain in the United States and work illegally in a low-paying service job. Or she could return to Mexico and attend college.

Sister Lulu was against the move, and told Ali she didn't know what she was doing. "You haven't been to Mexico (in years)," Lulu insisted.

On Aug. 9, 2010, Pinzon stepped off a plane into a country that felt foreign to her, even though it was her native land. She didn't know when she'd be back in the U.S. again.

"I felt like I was going somewhere where I had never been before," she said. "I didn't really speak a lot of Spanish." Pinzon's grandmother had spoken Spanish to her when Ali was young, but Ali had always replied in English, and hadn't kept up her Spanish since then.

At first, Pinzon spent much of her free time on Facebook and Skype. The friends she does have in Mexico are almost all recent returnees from the Unites States. She doesn't have to worry about being judged by them when she speaks English. Until she found them, she felt as if no one in this massive city understood her homesickness.

"In my mind, I felt like I was the only one who knew English," she said. "I felt like I was the only one who was going through this situation." She still speaks much more English than Spanish, and her phone and Wii video game console are both set up in English.

## "I Still Get Very Homesick"

Pinzon was taken to the United States when she was 11 by her father, who was hoping to build a better life. After overstaying their tourist visas, they moved in with Pinzon's grandmother, who lived in Overland Park, a suburb of Kansas City, Mo.

Pinzon entered the seventh grade at Oxford Middle School in Overland Park, then went to Blue Valley Northwest High School, where she joined the yearbook committee, sang with the chorus and danced with the Dazzlers drill team.

"I still get very homesick," she said. "I miss my friends. I miss everything." Her friends plan to visit her in Mexico City, but haven't managed to yet.

After her father and grandmother died, Pinzon moved to Indiana in 2009. She graduated the next spring. Like her closest friends, she wanted to go to college. Her sister Lulu attended Saint Louis University, and she wanted the same experiences and opportunities.

Pinzon had maintained a 3.5 grade-point average through high school. She had fantasized about attending the University of Missouri or Indiana University and studying journalism or international relations. But as many of her friends were packing to go to college, she was packing to return to Mexico.

Pinzon tried to get into college when she returned to Mexico City, but was told she'd have to first get a U.S. court to validate her identity or wait until she was 21, when she could take a GED-equivalency test.

She ended up finding a low-paying job at a call center, one of thousands where telephone and cable companies, among others, hire Americanized returnees to take customer service calls from the United States.

## Plane Ticket Stored On Computer

Then in June 2012, less than two years after Pinzon returned to Mexico, her sister called with big news. Thanks to the new DREAM Act, illegal immigrants who graduated from high school would no longer be deported from the United States. Pinzon could have benefited, if only she hadn't gambled by leaving the country.

"What have I done?" Pinzon thought to herself, feeling sick to her stomach. "I guess I should have stayed," she told her sister.

After hearing the news, Pinzon fell into a deep funk. She didn't leave her apartment for two days, skipped work and ignored friends' calls.

She should have just waited, Pinzon now says. "It would have just taken me two years. The two years I've been doing this, I could have been doing it there."

Ali still hopes to attend college in Mexico, but going back to the United States illegally is also an option, she admits. "I'm always going to think about going back," she said.

Her sister Lulu even bought her a plane ticket. Pinzon still has her tourist visa, which she could use to return — after which she could overstay again. But she's not sure whether she's ready to start over a second time, leaving behind Gaby and her new nephew, Santiago.

She's keeping the ticket, though. It's stored on her computer, near the pink drawer with the rest of her American stuff.
