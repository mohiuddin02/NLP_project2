ORLANDO, Fla. — Kyarra Garrett has learned how to take blood pressure and perform CPR — and she is not even out of high school yet.

The Jones High School senior is just one of an increasing number of high school students preparing for careers in one of the fastest-growing fields in the country.

Doctors, nurses and pharmacists are in greater demand than ever. As the nation's population gets older and access to health care has increased because of federal law making it more available, more health care workers are needed. School districts around the country are looking to fill that need through specialized courses for students who dream of a medical career.

Garrett is one of them.

"In the beginning it's rough, but in the end it all pays off because you can see all you learned and teach others," Garrett said.

## Hands-On Training

The Lake County school district in Florida, along with other nearby counties, will open its first health-sciences academy next year for 100 students. It will work in partnership with local hospitals, the University of Central Florida (UCF) and Lake-Sumter State College.

Programs like the one at Jones High offer hands-on experiences to students. They help with medical imaging machines like X-ray machines, analyze bacteria and learn bedside manner to speak with patients in a calming way. They can follow paramedics during 12-hour shifts spent responding to emergencies, stitch up chicken legs and assist at hospitals.

The lessons shatter stereotypes. Many TV shows, such as "Grey's Anatomy," make the medical profession seem as if it's just about surgeons and do not show other key jobs such as equipment repair and medical imaging jobs like X-ray and MRI technicians, school officials said.

Hundreds of students already have taken advantage of the programs, and enrollment continues to grow.

## "A Place Where They Can Get A Job"

This fall, Jones High School celebrated the success of its 2014 graduates. While they were in high school, they were paired in a three-year mentoring program with medical students at UCF.

"They see it as a place where they can get a job," said Lisa Barkley, assistant dean at UCF's College of Medicine. "There's so many different things you can do in health — it can meet students with all kinds of different needs."

Garrett, the Jones senior, said she plans to pursue a degree in medicine after high school because of her time in the school's medical-arts magnet program. The 18-year-old said the classes are challenging, but that only motivates her more.

"It's very stressful trying to learn everything at one time," said Garrett, who aspires to be an obstetrics and gynecology doctor, or ob-gyn. She thought about leaving the program, but "I said, 'No, I have so many people depending on me.'"

The teenager said knowing that ob-gyns make a good living pushed her to endure the tough program. Various websites indicate ob-gyns can earn upward of $200,000 a year.

## Plenty Of Jobs, And More To Come

Even if Garrett chose a different medical field, federal data suggest there are plenty of jobs available now and more on the horizon. In 2014, the nation added about 65 percent more health care jobs, which amounts to about 108,000 more positions than in 2013. Experts say the new jobs were the result of money pumped into the health care field by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The federal law made healthcare more accessible for many people, which means more people will be using medical services — and more health care workers will be needed to provide those services.

Students are being prepared for jobs at places like the colossal Medical City complex at Lake Nona, which is expected to create 30,000 jobs and generate $7.8 billion each year by 2017, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said. The 650-acre health and life-sciences park has attracted national attention.

## Hospitals Support Hiring Efforts

Local hospitals are supporting efforts to hire the best and brightest students close to home.

Paul Johns is the chief operating officer at South Lake Hospital in Clermont, Florida. He said the medical sciences programs meet the changing needs of health care, which soon will require more outpatient procedures and physician assistants.

"The trend is that you're really trying to help those students understand what it's going to take to be in the work force," he said. "We are now broadening the horizon of what is out there and what opportunities are presented to high-school students."

Medical sciences programs also offer immediate employment prospects to students. The school day gives time to students to prepare for certification exams. If they pass, they can work as technicians and medical assistants right after graduation. Some programs allow students to earn a two-year associate degree while they are still in high school, which saves them from paying for community college.

## Students Still Have Options

Students still can study something else if they decide the medical field isn't for them. No one expects adolescents to have made all their decisions yet, said Barkley, the UCF dean.

"The double-edge sword is that it could trap kids who don't want to go that way," Barkley said. Or, they might find they have few options if they are "laser-focused in one area," so she said they "need to be well-rounded."
