CHICAGO — You could easily have missed that November was Lung Cancer Awareness Month. Some people say the color blue should be worn to support the cause to stop lung cancer. But, no NFL players or coaches wore blue-ribboned apparel, despite dressing in pink just a month earlier for breast cancer.

"It just doesn't seem fair," said Meghan O'Brien, 31, a nonsmoker diagnosed with stage 4 of the disease last year. That's the most advanced and dangerous stage of the disease, when it has spread to organs throughout the body.

The lack of buzz is especially perplexing because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It claims more lives than breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers combined. The five-year survival rate is just 16 percent — a number that has barely budged since 1975, according to the American Cancer Society.

But lung cancer is seen as a tobacco-related illness that patients somehow bring upon themselves.

## Stigma Of Smoking

About 10 to 15 percent of the roughly 228,000 people diagnosed with the disease each year were never smokers, according to the LUNGevity Foundation, an organization that raises money to find treatments and a cure for lung cancer.

Still, the stigma of tobacco hurts everything from emotional support to the weak November awareness campaign. Even in death announcements, family members feel compelled to include the "nonsmoker" status, lest the deceased be unfairly judged.

Nowhere is the difference felt more powerfully than in funding research. The National Cancer Institute estimates that $17,835 is spent on research to find a cure to breast cancer for each person who dies of the disease, versus $1,378 for lung cancer, even though lung cancer accounts for almost 23,000 deaths annually among nonsmokers.

Not that it's easy to build awareness. Try finding a ribbon for lung cancer. There's even dispute over the appropriate color, according to Andrea Ferris, president and chair of the LUNGevity Foundation, who says it's blue. Others say it's clear or pearl.

"In every other disease, the first question people ask is, 'How can I help?' But with lung cancer, there's no empathy. It's always, 'Did you smoke?' After a while, it's just easier not to say anything," Ferris said.

## No Cigarettes, Ever

In O'Brien's case, doctors found a problem with her genes, called a mutation. Genes are tiny molecules in our body that carry information. They can determine what our eye color can be or if we get diseases. A mutation happens when two normal genes join together to form a new one. But this new one causes cancer.

She started taking a drug designed to help block the mutation. It worked for a while. But now it has come roaring back, invading her lungs and brain. Two months ago, a scan revealed that her liver had tumors.

She is now in another early stage clinical trial for a new drug. She also started a blog to chronicle her lung cancer journey.

"I try not to get too mad when people ask if I smoked," she said. "Instead, I try to turn it into an opportunity to talk about it … to educate. I guess that's the teacher in me."

Even so, O'Brien immediately recited her virtuous health habits: Physical education teacher. Enthusiastic tennis player. She is an "almost vegetarian" who hasn't eaten fast food since age 13. No cigarettes, ever.

At first she had experienced back pain, which she attributed to muscle strain, a logical explanation for someone so active. But in May 2012 it became unbearable, so she went ahead with X-rays. The results were inconclusive.

By the end of summer she had landed a full-time job teaching physical education at a high school allowing her to move out of her parents' home and into her own apartment.

However, just as her "grown-up life" was taking off, it splintered apart.

## "People Still Think It's Your Fault"

She received varying diagnoses, including scoliosis, sinus infection and pneumonia. On Sept. 1, the first day of her new job, she went to her neighborhood clinic. The physician took one look at her test results and sent her to the emergency room.

Two weeks later, a doctor confirmed that she had stage 4 lung cancer, and it was already assaulting other organs. All she remembers is her father reaching out to steady himself on a nearby radiator.

O'Brien spent most of the next four months in the hospital. Before she could start therapy, she needed emergency spinal surgery to remove the tumors wrapped around her spinal cord. Surgeons removed several of her vertebrae, replacing them with titanium rods and screws.

After discharge, O'Brien couldn't keep her new job. After almost three years of trying to obtain a full-time teaching job, her job at the high school had lasted about a month.

O'Brien's eyes glistened with tears as she ticked off her unfulfilled dreams — having a profession, getting married, having kids, buying a home.

Dating isn't really on her radar now. Treatment caused her to lose her hair, while steroids added 50 pounds. Even with the side effects, she tries to find ways to stay attractive, such as having her makeup professionally done.

The ultimate indignity, she said, "is when people ask, 'Are you sure you never smoked?' As if I forgot."

Not that anyone deserves the deadly diagnosis. It wasn't so long ago that the military dispensed cigarettes to soldiers, and many lung cancer patients kicked the smoking habit decades ago, she said. "But it doesn't matter. ... People still think it's your fault."
