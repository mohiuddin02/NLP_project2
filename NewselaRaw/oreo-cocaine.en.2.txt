According to a new study from Connecticut College, Oreos may be as addictive as cocaine — for rats, anyway.

The study was run by neuroscience professor Joseph Schroeder and his students. It was designed to consider the addictiveness of foods with high fat and sugar content. The results were surprising: Cookies activated more neurons in the brain's "pleasure center" than cocaine or morphine.

The study also looked at something else: the associations rats formed between things they liked and the places they received them. It found that the association rats formed between Oreos and a feeding chamber were as strong as associations to places where drugs were given.

"Our research supports the theory that high-fat, high-sugar foods stimulate the brain in the same way that drugs do," Schroeder said. "It may explain why some people can't resist these foods despite the fact that they know they are bad for them."

## Are High-Fat, High-Sugar Foods Addictive?

The original idea for the research came from neuroscience major Jamie Honohan.

Honohan was interested in the fact that so many people in lower-income communities are [obese](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) — that is, extremely overweight. The goal of the study, Honohan said, was to test the idea that high-fat, high-sugar foods are as addictive as drugs.

There was a reason Oreos were chosen rather than a high-fat, high-sugar rat chow, Schroeder said. The researchers wanted something that was tasty for humans as well as rats. That way they could "make a direct correlation from rats to a problem facing humans."

Honohan said she also wanted to use a product that was common in grocery stores. And, she noted, some research has showed that rats like Oreos.

The study was conducted by setting up two adjoining chambers for the rats. In one experiment, rats were given Oreo cookies in one space and rice cakes in the other. It was clear, Honohan said, that the rats preferred the Oreos. They split the cookies apart and devoured the cream first and then went on to eat the cookies. While they often didn't bother to finish the rice cakes, that wasn't the case with the Oreos.

"Just like humans, rats don't seem to get much pleasure out of eating (rice cakes)," Schroeder said.

## Oreos Pack More Pleasure Than Cocaine

Then, the food was removed and the rats were given the choice of spending time in either chamber. The rats spent far more time in the chamber where the Oreos had been than in the chamber where the rice cakes had been.

In a second experiment, rats were given a shot of cocaine or morphine in one chamber, and a shot of salt water in the other. Again, the substances were removed and the rats were given the choice of which chamber to spend time in.

The research showed that the cookie-eating rats spent as many hours in the Oreos chamber as the drug-receiving rats spent in the drug chamber.

In a second part of the research, Schroeder and his students studied what was going on in the part of the rat brain that registers pleasure. To measure this, they looked at the activity level of neurons. These are specialized nerve cells that carry "messages" in the brains of rats and humans. The cookies activated significantly more neurons than the drugs.

This lent support to the idea that "high-fat, high-sugar foods are addictive," Schroeder said.

## Hard To Quit Eating High-Sugar Foods

Honohan said she hopes the research will help people understand something important: It can be very difficult to quit eating the high-fat, high-sugar foods that cause obesity.

"Maybe we can approach obesity the same way we address people addicted to drugs, because neurologically, it's the same," she said. "Oreos and other high-fat, high-sugar foods have this potential to be just as addicting as drugs of abuse."

Honohan said that in some ways, junk foods may be "more dangerous to society than drugs because you don't have to go (into) a dark alley to buy them. You go into any grocery store or bodega, and they are highly available and affordable. They target kids and families on a budget."

As for Oreos, Honohan is done with them. She used to eat them before her research. "Now I can't even look at them," she said.
