WASHINGTON â€” Will wildfires grow ever bigger, more frequent and deadly? People who live in the rugged Western states are enduring another summer of destruction from the flames.

Colorado saw the worst wildfire in its history this year. The blaze killed two people, destroyed 16,000 acres of land and burnt down more than 500 buildings. Arizona is still mourning the deaths of 19 elite firefighters. They were killed recently in the most destructive wildfire the state has ever seen. Californians have fought 43 percent more fires this year than in the past four years put together.

Across the United States, the six worst fire seasons since 1960 have burned in the past 13 years. That includes 2012, when 9.2 million acres went up in flames. The worst year was 2006, when 9.8 million acres burned.

Lawmakers in the Western states have called on the federal government for more help and criticized its management of public lands. Large fires often start on federal territory and then spread to private and state lands. That is a big issue in states like Arizona and Nevada where the majority of the land is federally owned.

## Living Next Door To Wilderness

The U.S. Forest Service says about 65 million acres of its land is at "high or very high risk of wildfires." Lawmakers are also pondering how best fight the fires with their limited money. While hot and dry weather is beyond the control of the authorities, the states can tell people where to live to put them at less risk from wildfires.

Westerners are increasingly settling in communities next to the wilderness. They may be hoping for a little peace and quiet. But these areas can also be dangerous. The population shift has brought in new fire threats, putting more people and property in harm's way. It also makes firefighting more complicated and expensive.

Texas, Utah, Colorado, Washington and Arizona are all at risk from wildfire. They are also among the fastest-growing states since 2010. Much of the new population is building houses in zones at risk of wildfires.

People moving to land next to the wilderness is not new. But the trend is growing quickly. In the 1990s, 61 percent of newly built homes in Washington, Oregon and California were inside this area. By 2000, about 42 percent of all homes in those three states were in the danger zone.

Researchers at Colorado State University expect the inhabited fire zones will triple in size in Colorado by 2030 to 2.1 million acres.

## A Divide Between Federal And State

Wildfire expert Ray Rasker thinks more people will continue to build in these risky areas. He believes that U.S. taxpayers will end up paying for these unwise decisions. Rasker is with a nonpartisan think tank in Montana.

He sees the divide between federal and local government as a big problem. State and local leaders play a huge role in fire policy by setting laws on zoning and construction. But it's often the federal government's job to step in to fight the fires or later hand out disaster aid.

Rasker says there aren't enough fines for people who build houses in dangerous zones. He believes that if this problem was sorted, the other issues would just fall into place.

Some experts have suggested that lawmakers should look at rule changes to stop so many people from moving into the risky areas. Other new policies could make the inhabitants of the fire zones more responsible for their decisions to move in.

This idea surfaced as long as seven years ago in a federal report. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's inspector general wrote that zoning and building regulations may be needed to "make landowners take the actions necessary to protect their homes and property from wildfire."

Many authorities have enacted strong fire-proofing measures, but many more go without protection. This is also often true in the actual communities at risk from the wildfire. One homeowner might spend thousands of dollars on a fire-resistant roof and taking care of the property by doing things like clearing away dried brush and branches. But this is useless for stopping fires if the neighbors neglect their nearby properties.

## Making Fire Zones Safer

Lloyd Burton is an environmental policy professor at the University of Colorado in Denver. He asked that if the residents of the fire zones "aren't going to protect their own lives, why are they expecting others to?"

Some states have tried to make these areas safer. About 40 percent of all housing in California is in the wilderness. California uses its laws to require more fire-safe housing and zones that are cleared of flammable material. In 2011, the state also began charging rural residents a fire protection fee of $150. This has brought in around $84 million for the firefighters to spend on making everyone safer.

Oregon is another state that requires the zones to be kept clear of material that could fuel a wildfire. Landowners in Oregon are given fines if they break these rules.

But for the most part, states tend to recommend fire-safety actions, rather than require them. That's the case in Colorado. But it could soon change. Two task forces are talking about protection fees, new insurance regulations, building code changes and brush-clearing rules.

Burton doesn't mince words when it comes to communities right next door to the wilderness. When wildfires threaten homes but not lives, he says a firefighting crew's best option is simple: "Just let it burn."
