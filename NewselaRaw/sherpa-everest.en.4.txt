KATMANDU, Nepal â€” Last Friday, an avalanche of ice and snow tumbled down Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain. Sixteen mountain guides called Sherpas were killed.

On Wednesday, the remaining Sherpas left the Himalayan mountain in protest.

Climbers rely on the Sherpas to guide them to the top of Everest. The Sherpas are from the Himalayas and are used to the thin mountain air.

The disaster was the worst in the mountain's history. It stirred up the Sherpas' hidden anger over their low pay and bad treatment. Without the Sherpas, it is not known if climbers will go up the mountain this year.

The government says it will encourage the Sherpas to get back to work.

Nepal has been blamed for not doing enough for the Sherpas. One top official blamed the walkout on troublemakers.

"But things are getting back to normal," said Sushil Ghimire.

The government said it would pay about $415 to the family of each Sherpa who died. The Sherpas said they want more money and more help for the victims' families. They also want new rules to keep them safe on the tallest mountain in the world.

## Climbing Trips Called Off

It's not known how many of the 400 or so Sherpas on the mountain had left work. Many expedition companies have already canceled their climbs. Most attempts to reach Everest's peak are made in mid-May. The weather is better then.

Sherpas said there are different reasons for the walkout. Some wish to honor their friends who died.

Three Sherpas were still missing. They are believed to be dead.

Dorje Sherpa is an experienced Sherpa guide. He said it's impossible for many of the Sherpas to continue climbing while three of their friends are missing.

Ed Marzec is an American climber at base camp. He said that Sherpas had packed up their tents. They were loading their equipment onto a helicopter.

"There are a lot of Sherpas leaving this morning. And in the next two days there will be a huge number that will follow," said Marzec. He decided not to climb Everest this year.

Tusli Gurung is a guide at base camp. He said that nearly half the Sherpas had left.

Family members of the dead Sherpas said they are angry at the government. They are also worried about their future.

Sherpa Ang Kaji left behind three sons and three daughters. His elderly parents also relied on him for support.

"Our father was the only one who earned in our family. We live in a rented apartment. Our grandparents need regular medication. And all of us are still in school. We have no idea how we are going to support the family," said 17-year-old Phinjum. She is Kaji's second daughter.

Dali, 28, lost her husband Pen Tenji, 27, in the avalanche.

She has a 4-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter. She does not have a job.

## A Risky Job

Friday's avalanche occurred when a huge piece of ice fell from the mountain. It happened along a dangerous section known as the Khumbu Icefall. The Icefall is field of shifting ice and deep cracks in the ground.

The Sherpas take tremendous risks on Everest. Most of the climbers have a lot of money. However, they have little or no experience at high altitudes, where it is hard to breathe. Sherpas are needed to place miles of rope. They carve steps in the ice and snow for climbers. They also carry nearly all the climbers' equipment.

At times, weak climbers are tied to Sherpas, who pull them up the mountain. Without Sherpas, it would be nearly impossible for climbers to get to the top of Everest.

Climbers pay about $75,000 each to Nepal's government. Nepal earns about $3.5 million each year from Everest climbers. Sherpas make just $3,000 to $5,000 each climbing season.

The Nepalese government said it would give about $175,000 each year to help Sherpas who are injured, or their families if they are killed. However, the Sherpas want about $1 million.

Nearly 30 climbers have died on the Icefall since 1963.

More than 4,000 climbers have reached the top of Everest since 1953. Hundreds of people have died trying.
