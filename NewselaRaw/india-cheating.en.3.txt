MUMBAI, India â€” The voice from the Internet ad sounds confident: No one will suspect anything, he says. The device has never failed.

The college student sounds young, but he assures a caller that he speaks from experience. His price: about $40. Minutes later he texts, offering 6 percent off.

That's the price to cheat on one of India's all-important tests. The stakes are high. The exam is the way to get into the country's best colleges, universities and postgraduate programs.

Anil, a medical student in southern India, was selling a tiny wireless earpiece. It is scarcely bigger than the head of a pin. The earpiece receives a signal from a cellphone. During exams, Anil says he conceals the transmitter under a loose-fitting shirt. He texts pictures of the test questions to a friend at home and receives answers over the phone.

"There's no way anyone can even make out you using the device," says Anil. He sells three or four a week on eBay to high school and college students. "I've never had any problems. You just need to have some confidence and a good friend who can help you out during the exams."

## Extreme Examples

The nationwide tests for 10th- and 12th-graders are called board exams. The scores on the tests decide who gets into the best colleges. The board exams are also important for getting into engineering and medicine programs. Pressure from parents to do well can be intense, students say.

Even for those not attending college, test results are important for entering job training programs. For many poor students, the training courses are a way to get to the middle class.

Education officials say they are trying to stop cheating. But for every device like Anil's, more extreme examples of cheating come to light.

Allahabad is in northern India. At a school there, members of an inspection team were attacked with bombs last month after catching students cheating.

At a northern Indian test center, inspectors found school staff members writing answers to an exam on the blackboard. When the inspectors arrived, the staff members tried to throw the evidence out the window.

Some schools have installed cameras to monitor testing rooms. They post armed police officers at entrances. They use jamming devices to block the use of cellphones to trade answers.

## Millions Take Exams

Still, India's elections "are likely to be freer and fairer than the exams," said Mridula Chari. Chari is a writer.

Teachers and school officials say that millions of students take the board exams each year, and very few of them cheat.

For rule-breakers, low-tech methods remain popular. Hiding cheat sheets in socks, copying neighbors' answers and scribbling notes on walls are common tactics. Tests are often sold by school employees.

One student said that just one adult watched dozens of students during a test.

"For the major part of the exam, he was not present in the class," the student said. "There was open passing of information, noise and even discussions. I remember (checking) most of my answers with my friends."

Anti-cheating measures begun this year had mixed success. In Mumbai, officials said that installing cameras reduced cheating by 20 percent. But students in at least one school broke the cameras by throwing rocks at them.

## Cheating Cases

In the eastern state of Bengal, police stood guard outside test centers. But people still tossed cheat sheets wrapped around small stones into the exam rooms.

"One hundred percent, we can stop this problem," said Lakshmikant Pande. He is head of the board of education in the western state of Maharashtra. "If we continue these types of efforts over two or three years, surely we can stop this."

Teachers don't think the cheating will stop. They say that school principals often don't report cheating. They don't want other people to know that students cheat at their schools. Also, cheating cases can last for years.

About 10 years ago, the son of an Indian Railways official hired a train conductor to take an exam for him. The scam was busted and the student was reported.

Yet long after his graduation, the case remains before the police. The teacher who caught the cheat is forced to appear at least once a year in court.

"We learned a lesson from that," said English teacher Akhil Bhosle. "If we register a case, it will be a headache for us."
