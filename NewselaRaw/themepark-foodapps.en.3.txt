ORLANDO, Fla. â€” Theme parks know that their guests do not like waiting in line. Now parks are finding new ways to use technology to keep lines moving.

Lines are getting shorter for rides and for food. Theme parks are letting guests skip food lines. Guests can order food ahead of time instead.

## Disney And SeaWorld Use Food Apps

First, parks like Disney World started letting people order food online at some restaurants. Guests could pick out what they wanted from their home computer. Now Disney is trying the same thing with food apps that let guests order meals on their cellphones.

Cathy Valeriano runs food services at SeaWorld. She says guests think cellphone ordering is very convenient. The system uses food apps. It is still very new, but Valeriano thinks it will be more popular soon.

## Wait Less, Ride More

Order-ahead programs are already used in regular restaurants across the country. Chains like Panera Bread have popular online ordering systems. They have even added computer stations in their restaurants. People can use the computer stations to spend less time in line.

Theme parks have always tried to make things easier for their guests. They want them to relax and enjoy the park. Now cellphones and tablets have become a bigger part of people's lives. Theme park restaurants are changing the way they do business. It is important for them to keep up with how their customers' lives are changing.

Online ordering systems also help parks save money. Restaurants with extra computers do not need as many workers. The computers are expensive, but restaurants do not have to pay them to work. Over a long period of time, those savings can really add up.

Robert Niles is a theme park expert. He says theme parks know that food is not what brings their guests in for a visit. Guests care most about rides. That means it is most important for parks to work on making those lines shorter. Restaurant lines are not as big a deal.

## Disney Magic: Make Reservations At Home

Still, parks like Disney want to get better at everything.

Disney has lots of ideas. There are many ways technology could make things better for guests. For example, Disney might have workers take orders from people standing in line for rides. The servers could use computer tablets to keep track of what guests want.

Niles says Disney has to be careful about plans like these. Starting something new can be tricky. People do not want to think too hard when they are on vacation, Niles says.

Disney's MyMagic+ program gives guests rewards for visiting often. The program also tries to make it simpler and more special to visit Disney.

Guests can use MyMagic+ to make restaurant reservations at home. Niles says that make sense. Guests can choose a restaurant when they are booking their hotel and buying plane tickets. They are already thinking about planning then.
