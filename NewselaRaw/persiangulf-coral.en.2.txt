The Persian Gulf's coral reefs only have 10 percent of the diversity of reefs in some other waters, and they are not quite as pretty to look at. But the waters off the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coast might contain something even more precious. Scientists think it might hold clues that could help other reefs survive the climate change that has caused ocean waters to become warmer.

Most coral reefs in mild, temperate climates can only withstand temperatures as high as 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) before they release the algae living in their tissue. This "bleaching" process causes them to turn white. More importantly, it increases their vulnerability to disease and death, because coral depends on the algae for food.

Yet, scientists have found that corals in the Persian Gulf reefs can handle water temperatures as high as 36 degrees C (97 degrees F). That is warmer than water temperatures are expected to climb in the next century. John Burt, a marine biologist at New York University, says the Persian Gulf corals "offer hope." He believes their genetic characteristics could help corals in other areas survive warmer temperatures.

## The Oceans Are Changing

Pollution, overfishing and building along coastal areas have caused reefs to lose 50 percent of their coral in some places. Still, most scientists say climate change is the biggest threat in the future.

Warming waters spark bleaching events. Along with the bleaching, the ocean is becoming more acidic. It happens as the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — also blamed on climate change. Acidification makes it harder for corals to calcify. Without enough calcium for their shells to grow, the coral has difficulty thriving. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned that warming waters could lead to a global bleaching event in 2015. It would be the third one in the past two decades.

Scientists believe most coral reefs will be under threat by 2040. Corals and the algae that live in them are adapting as the water around them gets warmer. Unfortunately, these genetic changes are not happening as quickly as the Earth is warming.

## "It's Not All Gloom And Doom"

Scientists who study the Persian Gulf are challenging ideas about where the corals are headed. They have shown that coral reefs can bounce back from bleaching events faster than previously thought. They may even be able to acquire tougher, stronger algae in a relatively short time. "It's not all doom and gloom for corals," says Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami.

Corals "have a repertoire of responses," Baker says. He added that in some cases coral can respond to bleaching "very quickly, within a few years."

Baker's work prompted Burt and several of his peers to spend the last three years studying reefs off the coasts of the UAE and Oman. They discovered a new type of algae that could handle warmer water. Their research suggested that it was unique to the Persian Gulf.

The researchers demonstrated that this new organism was the most commonly found algae throughout the gulf's coral reefs. They say it probably adapted as a result of the gulf's harsh conditions.

## What Role Was Evolution?

The real question is how that happened. Researchers are not sure whether it was evolution or if the algae was brought in by currents from outside the region and survived "a selection process." University of Southampton professor Jörg Wiedenmann hopes the latter is true. He said it would be good news because that would mean corals elsewhere might have the type of algae among them.

The other big question is how much the gulf algae might be able to help corals in other regions. Baker says no one knows whether corals can keep getting better at handling the heat as water temperatures rise. If not, he hopes the new type of algae can at least provide a temporary solution.

## Looking For Other Solutions

Critics say it is foolish to think that just algae will provide a solution. They are also doubtful about finding answers in the Persian Gulf, which has limited diversity. Some experts think researchers would be better off looking for answers in more temperate regions. They have suggested the Mozambique Channel between Tanzania and Madagascar, where corals bounced back from extreme bleaching events.

But such criticism has not diminished interest in using genes from the Persian Gulf reefs. Researchers are still busy exploring ways to use them in future conservation plans.

Bernhard Riegl of Florida's Nova Southeastern University wants to begin moving corals to the Indo-Pacific. He would create a hybrid with genetic material already there.

Baker has considered introducing Persian Gulf algae in nurseries and then reseeding areas at risk. Others want to crossbreed gulf corals with those in temperate climates.

No one denies that these plans involve risks — they are costly and could introduce disease or species that could harm the environment. The reintroduced corals might not even cope well with new environmental conditions.

But experts like Madeleine van Oppen of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, argues that it's time for humans to assist evolution. "When I first started talking about it, people would say, 'Oh God, that will never work. You can never do it at the scale required,'" van Oppen wrote. "People still have those concerns, but they can see that it's important to develop the tools and to assess what is actually possible."
