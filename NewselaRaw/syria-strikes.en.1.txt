BEIRUT, Lebanon — The U.S. conducted overnight airstrikes across northern Syria that appear to have caused major damage to the militants it targeted, according to reports Tuesday.

The airstrikes signaled that the conflict in the region was escalating. It was the first time the United States led an attack into Syria. Previously, the U.S. attacks had taken place only in neighboring Iraq. Reports said there were an unknown number of casualties.

The U.S. military planes struck across several areas of northern Syria. The strikes spanned more than 220 miles from the northwest near Turkey to the Iraqi border in the east, according to a statement from the U.S. military and activist accounts on the ground.

## Five Arab Nations Took Part

The main target was the Islamic State (ISIL). It is a group of fighters who have taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. The U.S. government says the group is a great danger to the Middle East.

The group calls itself the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

The attacks, U.S. authorities said, were aimed at ISIL targets around four Syrian cities. They are Dair Elzur, along the Euphrates River; Hasakah, in northeast Syria; and Abu Kamal, along the Iraqi border. The fourth target, Raqqa, in north-central Syria, is seen as the main base for ISIL.

The strikes were carried out with fighter jets, bombers, pilotless drone planes and Tomahawk missiles launched from U.S. vessels in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, the U.S. military statement said. Five Arab nations — Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — took part in the operation, the U.S. said.

How the Arab countries participated was not explained in detail. However, the Jordanian government said its air force had destroyed "terrorist" targets.

All the planes involved returned safely to their bases, U.S. officials said.

The strikes "destroyed or damaged" multiple ISIL targets, said U.S. military leaders from the Pentagon. The targets hit included "fighters, training compounds, headquarters and command and control facilities, storage facilities, a finance center, supply trucks and armed vehicles."

ISIL fighters have begun attacks on the town of Ayn al-Arab on the border with Turkey. Ayn al-Arab is also called Kobane in Kurdish, the language of the people who live there. The Kurds are enemies of ISIL. More than 100,000 mostly Kurdish people have fled across the border to Turkey in recent days, due to the attacks. It was not confirmed that the airstrikes targeted Ayn al-Arab.

Separately, the United States conducted eight airstrikes west of the Syrian city of Aleppo. The attacks targeted a branch of fighters called the "Khorasan Group," who were longtime members of the al-Qaida terrorist network. The Pentagon said that the Khorasan was allegedly plotting an attack very soon against the United States and Western allies. The U.S. military did not elaborate on the details of the plot.

Syrians have lived with civil war for three years as rebels have fought against President Bashar Assad's leadership. The United States has helped to support the rebel fighters. Those fighters have cooperated with the Nusra Front, the official branch of al-Qaida in Syria.

Aerial strikes hit Nusra bases in and around Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The group reported seven fighters and eight civilians killed in the strikes.

The airstrikes on Raqqa and its suburbs began around 3 a.m. local time and included more than 18 attacks, said Abu Khalil, a nickname for an activist in the city who posted some of the earliest photos of the strikes' aftermath online. He withheld his real name for safety reasons.

Seven airstrikes struck inside the city, with most targeting offices that serve as the major headquarters for ISIL fighters, the activist said. The airstrikes also struck the group's security branch building, a military training camp, a checkpoint and a pair of Syrian military bases that were recently seized by ISIL, according to the activist.

There were no accurate numbers for casualties from the strikes. Most residents were either sheltered in their homes during the predawn attacks or sought safety in basements, the activist said.

## Public Opinion Is Mixed

After the airstrikes, the fighters fled their headquarters, Khalil said.

"Of course the people are scared," Khalil said, adding that public opinion was divided about the U.S. airstrikes. "If the targeting is precise on ISIS, then I am for it."

In recent weeks, activists and others say, ISIL has been moving much of its leadership and heavy weapons out of the city of Raqqa, anticipating a U.S. airstrike. President Obama announced on Sept. 10, that U.S. forces may target ISIL inside Syria as part of a U.S. effort to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the group.
