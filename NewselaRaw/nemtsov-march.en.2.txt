MOSCOW â€” Tens of thousands of people solemnly marched through the streets of Moscow on Sunday. They had come to remember a Russian politician who opposed the government's policies. Boris Nemtsov was shot and killed on Friday. The mostly silent marchers carried flowers and tied black ribbons to railings to honor him.

The killing of Nemtsov has shaken the Russian opposition, a group of people who disagree with the Russian government's decisions. The opposition sees President Vladimir Putin as responsible for Nemtsov's death. It is unclear, however, whether the shooting will be enough to revive the weakened anti-Putin movement.

There has been tension in Russia since the country began supporting pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine used to be part of the Soviet Union, which broke up more than 20 years ago. Now, Putin has made several aggressive attempts to bring parts of Ukraine back under Russian rule, some people say.

Yet even with Russia's conflict with Ukraine and the country's economic crisis, support for Putin remains strong. In the past year, more than 80 percent of people in the country have said they support Putin.

## A Pile Of Flowers

Back in 2011 and 2012, many anti-Putin protests brought hundreds of thousands to the streets of Moscow. Since then, however, Putin has isolated and intimidated people who disagree with his political decisions. He has jailed some, pushed others into exile, and raised fines and potential jail time for people who are arrested at protests.

At 55 years old, Nemtsov was among the few opposition figures who refused to back down. Nonetheless, even as they wept at his loss, very few people at the march believed that his death would bring major change in Russia. The government's control over national television, where most Russians get their news, is just too powerful, they said.

"Maybe if 100 people were to die people would rise up, but I don't really believe in that," said Sergei Musakov, 22. "People are so under the influence of the (TV) box that they will believe anything that television tells them."

The government has called people in the opposition like Nemtsov traitors. Some officials of the government said the opposition leaders were serving the hostile countries in the West, such as the United States and parts of Europe.

About 30,000 people went to the march, making it the largest opposition rally in more than a year. The demonstrators carried Russian flags and signs that read "I am not afraid" or "Propaganda kills." In the area where Nemtsov was killed, a pile of flowers grew by the minute, as mourners threw bouquets of every color.

## Shot On A Bridge

Nemtsov was shot shortly before midnight on Friday as he walked across a bridge near Putin's official residence, the Kremlin. The killing came just hours after a radio interview in which he argued against Putin's actions in Ukraine. Russia has been giving money and support to people in eastern Ukraine who are fighting the Ukrainian government to become a part of Russia once more.

At the time of his death, Nemtsov was working on a report. He believed he discovered that Russian troops were fighting alongside Ukrainian separatists, despite the government saying otherwise.

Other opposition activists said they hoped Nemtsov's death would encourage people to take action, rather than silence them.

"Essentially it is an act of terror," said Ilya Yashin, an opposition leader and friend. "It is a political murder aimed at frightening the population, or the part of the population that supported Nemtsov or did not agree with the government. I hope we won't get scared, that we will continue what Boris was doing."

Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister who joined the opposition, told the crowd the killing should be a turning point for Russia. People should "start reconsidering everything that's going on in our country," he said.

## Who Was Behind The Hit?

Since Nemtsov's death, investigators, politicians and political commentators on state television have suggested numerous explanations for the attack. One theory seemed to be that Western secret services were behind the hit. The theory was that the Western secret services killed Nemtsov to create chaos in Russia.

Some bristled at Western media coverage that suggested Nemtsov was killed because he opposed Putin.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had no information on who was behind the shooting.

"We hope there will be a thorough, transparent, real investigation, not just of who actually fired the shots, but who, if anyone, may have ordered or instructed this or been behind this," Kerry said.

## Dim Prospects For Change

For those at the march, it is the widespread influence of state television that makes the prospects for change seem dim.

"From my experience, trying to convince people isn't possible," said Mikhail Trofimenko, a 42-year-old screenwriter. "I think things will only get worse, but I hope that by some miracle Russia will not fall apart and remain a united country."

He held up a painting of the Russian flag with four bullet holes in it, the number of times Nemtsov was shot.

Another mourning march was held earlier Sunday in St. Petersburg, drawing several thousand people.

Nelly Prusskaya, a 66-year-old doctor, said she came to pay her respects to Nemtsov. "I also came to say that I'm against the war in Ukraine," she said. "I'm against political murders."
