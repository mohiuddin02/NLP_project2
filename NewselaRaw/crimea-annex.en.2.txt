SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine — Condemned by the West, Russia seized Crimea and its vital naval port on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed agreements with the Ukrainian region's pro-Russian leaders to take possession of Crimea.

This came less than two days after Crimean residents voted to separate from Ukraine and join Russia. The vote was widely criticized.

The signing has not yet been approved by the Russian parliament and the Constitutional Court, but they are not expected to reject the agreements. The signing ceremony was held in the lavish St. George's Hall in the Kremlin, a historic fortress in Moscow. Shortly before, Putin gave a fiery hour-long speech often interrupted by applause from the jubilant crowd of lawmakers, government officials and others.

The decision was based, Putin said, on the Crimean people's "free expression of the will." In a popular vote on Sunday, more than 96 percent of Crimeans supported rejoining Russia. Russia controlled the Crimean peninsula until 1954 when the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita Kruschev, transferred it to Ukraine. Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union fell.

## Defies U.S. And Europe

In his speech, Putin blamed Ukraine's "nationalists, Russophobes and anti-Semites." Putin said they came to power in Ukraine last month when the country's pro-Russia leader fled after months of protests. A Russophobe is a person who is anti-Russian, and an anti-Semite is someone who hates Jews.

Putin claimed Russia went into Crimea at the request of its citizens. He refused to acknowledge that Russian troops had invaded Crimea weeks before the popular vote to join Russia. Last month, Putin's army, wearing unmarked uniforms, largely took control of the peninsula. The Russian soldiers have been blocking the Ukrainian military in their bases ever since. Putin — as he has in the past — referred to the invaders as Crimean "self-defense forces."

"Esteemed residents of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, all of Russia admires your fortitude, dignity and courage," he said in his televised speech. Sevastopol is a vitally important port in Crimea where the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet is based. "It is you who have resolved the fate of Crimea."

The United States and the countries of the European Union have joined together to condemn what they call a land grab and a violation of international law. They have imposed sanctions, a series of punishments that include freezing the bank accounts of Russian officials, to pressure Russia into leaving Crimea. They have threatened further sanctions if Russia does not pull out.

"I would like to know what they mean," Putin said, referring to the sanctions. "The actions ... of various national traitors?"

## "We Will React Accordingly"

Putin added, "We view such statements as irresponsible and openly aggressive, and we will react accordingly."

Russia will not seek confrontation with Western countries, Putin pledged. He said that Russia will do its best to build good relations with its neighbors and other countries.

Putin insisted that Russia would not invade the industrial southeast of Ukraine which, like Crimea, has a large Russian-speaking population. "We have always respected the territorial (unity) of Ukraine," he said to the people of Ukraine. "Don't trust those who scare you with Russia."

That said, Putin suggested that southeastern Ukraine was historically Russian territory. He blamed Khrushchev for handing Crimea to Ukraine six decades ago.

The Soviet Union broke up in 1991, which left some Russians in newly independent lands, including Ukraine. Putin once called that event "the biggest geo-political catastrophe" of the 20th century.

Last month, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled after months of violent protests against his government left many people dead. Putin once again called the change in government an illegal seizure of power. He said that Ukraine's current government was unlawful and not worth talking to.

## Blames U.S. And Europe

Putin blamed the U.S. and Western Europe, saying they encouraged those who organized the protests and had "crossed the line in the case of Ukraine."

He said, "They acted roughly, irresponsibly and unprofessionally. They knew quite well millions of Russians live in Ukraine and Crimea." Putin said the U.S. and Western Europe should known what would happen.

"Today it is necessary to stop the hysterics ... and recognize the obvious thing that Russia is an independent and active participant in the international life, and like other countries it has its national interests which should be taken into account and respected," he said.

Putin promised that all of Crimea's ethnic groups would be respected and that Crimea would have three state languages, which would be Russian, Ukrainian and Tatar.

"Crimea is ... under the strong and stable sovereignty which today in fact can be only Russian," Putin said.
