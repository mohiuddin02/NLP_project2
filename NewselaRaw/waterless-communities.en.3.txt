MADERA COUNTY, Calif. — Filiberta Sanchez and her toddler granddaughter strolled down a Parkwood sidewalk under the hot Central Valley sun. The sidewalk was lined with yellow weeds and dying grass.

"It was very pretty here, very pretty," said Sanchez, 56. Her granddaughter, Jenny, crunched a fistful of parched dirt and pine needles she grabbed from the ground. "Now everything's dry."

Parkwood is a tiny community of about 3,000 people. Its last well dried up in July. It needed help, so the city of Madera agreed to give it water for some time. But the deal doesn't allow the people who live in Parkwood to water their trees, shrubs or lawns.

State officials this year started tracking areas that could run out of water during California's drought. They made a list of water systems that could run dry within two months.

## Drilling New Wells

Parkwood is one of 28 small California communities that have bounced onto and off of that list.

After being put on the list, some communities fixed problems that some say should have been fixed long ago. Some drilled new wells, built storage tanks or connected their water systems with larger ones and got off the list. Other communities were saved by late spring rains that filled reservoirs and rivers.

Fourteen communities, though, remain on the list. They are approaching a crisis point and trucking in water while they work to find a solution.

Tim Quinn is the head of a group of water agencies. He said communities that have made the list are often small and far away. They relied on a single source of water, such as a stream, without backup sources. But Quinn warned that if the drought continues, larger communities could face their own significant problems.

"If this drought keeps on going, some larger, more sophisticated communities are going to be in trouble next year," Quinn said.

## A Resort Faded And Brown

The city of Montague — with a population of about 1,400 — is one of the success stories from the list. It had long used an irrigation ditch that transported water from a lake 25 miles away. But the ditch ran dry and in April, Montague landed on the list.

To bring in water, Montague built a pipeline that pumped water from wells near Lake Shastina into the Shasta River. Then it pumped water into people's homes.

With the pipeline built, Montague was removed from the list this month.

Arroyo Seco Resort is tucked along a winding mountainous road on the edge of the Los Padres National Forest in Monterey County. It has been on the critical list since late August.

For the last three weeks, the resort has paid $350 each for about five truckloads of water, said Glenn Dugger, 65, who works at the resort.

The one 27-foot-deep well that still works can't pump enough water for the resort.

The resort has asked for state help to dig wells as deep as 200 feet. Meanwhile, people are asked not to water outdoors, leaving the resort faded and brown.

## "It Looks Horrible"

Parkwood saw signs of trouble even before its well dried up. Water pressure in some showers slowed to a dribble and toilets barely flushed.

After the last well failed, the county passed out bottled water. In addition, the officials warned people to boil water before drinking or cooking with it.

Most lawns in Parkwood are now brown. Phil Magos, 67, has lived in Parkwood for 23 years. He said watching his yard die was painful.

"I feel bad when I go outside because it looks horrible," he said.
