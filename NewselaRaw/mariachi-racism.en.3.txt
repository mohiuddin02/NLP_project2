Sebastien de la Cruz sounded great when he sang the National Anthem last week at the Heat-Spurs basketball finals game in San Antonio. Still, some people did not like his performance. They let everybody on Twitter know it.

The 11-year-old was called an illegal immigrant and much worse. But then other people went on social media websites like Facebook and Twitter. They took Sebastien's side. Many of Sebastien's critics were shamed. They deleted their tweets or removed their accounts.

Sebastien is known as El Charro de Oro â€“ or boy with the golden voice. He sang the anthem dressed in a silver-and-black mariachi outfit. Mariachi is a type of Mexican folk music.

Some people did not like the idea of Sebastien singing the anthem. They especially did not like what he wore. Some of their tweets were captured before they were removed. They can be seen on Tumblr's Public Shaming blog.

## Some Vicious Comments

"This lil Mexican snuck into the country like 4 hours ago and now he singing the anthem," wrote @A2daO.

"Is this the American National Anthem or the Mexican Hat dance. Get this lil kid out of here," tweeted @A1R_STEVEN.

Several other tweeters were even more vicious.

Sebastien has been singing since he was 5.  He was on NBC's "America's Got Talent" program last year. He wanted to win to help his younger brother get surgery, _CNN_ said. His brother has a hearing problem.

The young singer was actually a typical San Antonio resident. More than 55 percent of people who live there are Hispanic. Ninety percent of San Antonio's Hispanics say they are Mexican. In Miami, 65.7 percent of the people are Hispanic.

Hispanics are the second-largest group in the country after whites.

## Tweeters In Uncomfortable Spotlight

The Twitter storm over Sebastien's appearance quickly became national news.  _CNN_, _USA Today_, and other outlets picked up the story. Firefighter Andrew Lacey in Georgia probably got more attention than he wanted. He tweeted: "How you singing the anthem lookin like an illegal immigrant," the _Augusta Chronicle_ newspaper in Georgia reported.

Fire Chief Chris James said the department was aware of the tweet. It was taking a look at what to do.

The firefighter "will be counseled for sure," James told the newspaper. "It's completely inappropriate and not acceptable."

The Tumblr  blog was just one example of people using social media in Sebastien's defense.

## Mayor Takes To Facebook

San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro showed his support on Facebook.

"(Sebastien), don't let a few negative voices get you down," he said. "You are a true talent and you represent the best of our nation's future!"

Actress Eva Longoria tweeted: "As a Mexican-American, I am so proud of (Sebastien) De La Cruz, a great symbol of what America is today!"

Sebastien himself took on his critics during a news conference on Wednesday. He said that his father served in the U.S. Navy.

"People don't know; they just assume that I'm just Mexican. But I'm not from Mexico. I'm from San Antonio, born and raised, a true San Antonio Spurs fan," he said.

Some of Sebastien's critics also had second thoughts.

One, @bdub58713, who also goes by the name "THE_GREAT_WHITE" on Twitter, later tweeted,"I am sorry for the racist comment I recently posted during the nba finals game. Due to the comments, I have changed my views."

## Getting The Last Word

Sebastien had the last word. He sang the anthem again at Thursday's Game 4. The publicity surrounding the Internet comments might also help his career.

On Friday, he tweeted: "My new cd will be available on iTunes by Monday. Called Sentimiento."
