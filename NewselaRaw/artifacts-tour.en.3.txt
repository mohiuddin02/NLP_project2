PITTSBURGH, Pa. — Archaeologists study ancient objects to learn about the past. Now, they have learned new things about the city Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They looked at what was buried under the city. They have found evidence that Native American traders lived on the side of an ancient river a thousand years ago. Now it is called the Allegheny River. Later, European settlers cut forests near where three large rivers meet. They also built settlements. 

One hundred years after that, more immigrants, or people from other countries, arrived. They were not rich or poor. They became a middle class. These immigrants went on to run the city.

Casey Campetti is an archaeologist. On Nov. 22, Campetti led a walking tour to look at archaeology in part of Pittsburgh. She pointed out new discoveries. They give evidence of what the city once was like.

## Digging For Road Uncovers Treasures

During the digging for a new road, about 18,000 artifacts were found. Artifacts are things used by humans long ago. Some artifacts found there include small houses. There were also outdoor bathrooms called outhouses. Archaeologists also found signs of where Native Americans lived for a short time, Campetti said.

Today, cities pick up garbage at our homes. In the past, however, things that were not wanted were thrown into the outhouse. Today, those spots can show how things have changed over time. 

People have not been studying archaeology in cities very long. It became easier to do with new laws and rules at construction projects. The rules protected artifacts.

Archaeologists do three things at construction areas, Campetti said. First, they look for any new discoveries. Second, they decide if a discovery is important. Finally, they decide what to do with important artifacts.

## Native American Tools Found

City builders used to knock a building down and build a new one right over it, Campetti said. Now they are building much bigger buildings. For that, they have to dig a big hole. Archeologists are finding artifacts from many different parts of history in the holes, Campetti said.

Archaeologists found children's toys, such as marbles and dolls. Nearby, they found stone tools and arrowheads. They said that Native Americans probably lived there briefly thousands of years ago.  

In the early 1800s, there was a big construction project. The Ohio, Monongahela and Allegheny rivers were moved higher. The entire downtown area of Pittsburgh also had to be made higher.

Artifacts in that area were buried during the project, Campetti said.

## Layers Show How Things Changed

Archaeologists can look at layers of artifacts from different periods. The layers tell a story. They show how the middle class grew. Pieces of broken plates buried under bits of fine china might show how a neighborhood changed.

Other artifacts were found before a building called 3 PNC Plaza was built. Construction workers dug 20 feet. They reached the area where downtown used to be. Artifacts found there are shown at the Fairmont Pittsburgh hotel built on the property.

The artifacts include dolls and china from stores, said hotel worker Juan Rojas. He said the hotel gives tours to show off the pieces. 

Other pieces were found near where a tunnel is being built. The people who lived in the area of the project were renters, Campetti said. If the renters had something valuable they might try to hide it, she said. Diggers found a little box. It held part of a handgun and a shaving razor with a fancy handle.
