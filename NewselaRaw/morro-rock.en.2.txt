Morro Rock, a dome-shaped rocky mass, rises 576 feet above the shore of California's coast. The mound is a sacred site for two local Native American tribes.

For more than a decade, the groups have been in a dispute over the rights to Morro Rock.

One tribe, the Salinan Indians, says the landmark may be climbed only on certain dates, according to what the heavens allow. The other tribe, the Northern Chumash Indians, believes it should never be tread upon. The Chumash believe the beauty of Morro Rock should only be appreciated from afar.

The feud has turned into a legal battle. Last December, the Northern Chumash Tribal Council filed a document in court arguing that the Salinan Tribe should not be allowed to climb the mountain. The council maintained it was a registered Chumash Nation sacred site.

## "Alive With Life"

According to Chumash tradition, the rock is called Lisamu. They believe its position, at the mouth of a magnificent estuary, is significant for tribal members.

"Lisamu is alive with life that needs to be protected and honored, not trampled upon," the Northern Chumash Tribal Council has written.

The Salinans see something different in the rock. They believe the rock is called Lesamo and located where the Falcon of ancient legend killed the serpent Teleekatapelta.

On a recent gray morning, Fred Collins stood at the base of the rock and looked skyward as a falcon glided over the jagged peaks. Collins is a member of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council.

"This is a rookery for unbelievable birds," Collins said. "And it's a migratory path for so many. Aside from the sacred issues, why would you want to interfere with that?"

## Rituals On The Peak

Morro Rock has been a state historic landmark and falcon preserve since 1968. Now, hiking is off limits to the public. However, the Salinans have been climbing it since about 2000, after an elder from the tribe sought a permit to hold rituals on the peak.  The permit was approved and permission was granted.

According to Joe Mette, a former district superintendent for the California Department of Parks and Recreation, it is normal for the department to allow reasonable requests for religious practices to take place on state park property.

Since the department approved the request, the Salinan Indians have been allowed  to climb the rock for religious ceremonies twice a year, during the summer and winter solstices.

Elder John Burch is the member who applied for the Salinans' permit. His ritual is a traditional practice that has been passed down for generations. He will sit alone at the top in blackness and starlight, asking for spiritual guidance. He finishes the night of prayer feeling as if he is "floating on air."

The rock's rugged landscape makes for a tough climb. In the past, climbers have had to be rescued after failed attempts to reach the top. Last month, three 15-year-old boys who were trying to scale the east face had to be saved. Ten days later, another climber who got stuck part of the way up needed assistance.

## Whose Mountain Is It?

The Northern Chumash Tribal Council was not pleased with the permit being granted to the Salinan tribe. The council says that it was never consulted about the arrangement. They feel they should been part of the conversation because their 35 members were directly affected by the action, said the tribe's lawyer, Dennis J. Balsamo.

According to California state law, the parks department must consult with Native American tribes when their sacred sites are affected by projects or policies.

The Chumash are trying hard to show that the Salinans have no right to claim the site as their own. They have even said that the historic boundary between the two tribes rests some 40 miles to the north at Ragged Point in Monterey County. They are hoping to demonstrate that Morro Rock does not belong to the Salinans.

"There is no historic or religious connection between the ancient Salinan People and Morro Rock," Balsamo wrote.

## "Such A Great Presence"

The Chumash don't mind if other tribes gather for ceremonies at the base of the rock, Collins said. It is the climbing they have a problem with.

"Morro Rock has such a great presence along our coast," Collins said. "Fishermen and people of old times always viewed Morro Rock as a landmark in the ocean with special energies. It's a magical place."

If the climbing argument isn't resolved by the time the summer solstice rolls around in June, the Chumash tribe says it may be forced to seek a court order to stop the Salinans from climbing the rock.

"We hope we can come to a resolution on this issue in a positive way," Collins said. "But we're willing to stand up and not get kicked around."
