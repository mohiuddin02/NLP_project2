TOPEKA, Kan. — Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed a bill into law Thursday that will establish stricter requirements for welfare eligibility. The bill sets shorter time limits for how long a person can receive the money provided by welfare. It also places new restrictions on where a beneficiary — a person receiving benefits — can spend the money they receive.

Brownback hailed the law as a way to promote self-reliance and lift people out of poverty by pushing them back into the workforce.

The Republican governor pushed back against national criticism that has been directed against the bill in recent weeks. So, too, did Phyllis Gilmore, head of Kansas' Department for Children and Families (DCF), who called the bill the most comprehensive welfare reform passed by any state in the country.

"We encourage other states to look to Kansas on how to help end government dependency," Gilmore said. She said the policies are aimed at helping low-income people achieve self-sufficiency and called government dependency a "disservice to the individual, a disservice to our culture and certainly a disservice to the taxpayer."

## Work-For-Welfare Law

The bill enshrines in law several policies adopted during Brownback's first term. Among these are a requirement that able-bodied adults work a minimum of 20 hours a week or go through a job training program in order to qualify for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the formal name for welfare. DCF credits this policy with putting more than 6,000 people back into the workforce last year.

By signing the law, Brownback ensures that the policies will continue after he leaves office.

## Bans Cruises And Movies

However, the features of the law that have gained national attention are the policies that were tacked on by the Kansas Legislature — to the noticeable frustration of Brownback and Gilmore. They include a ban against spending TANF money at a wide variety of businesses, including movie theaters, massage parlors, cruise ships and swimming pools.

"The primary focus of the law is to get people back to work," Brownback said. "Because that's where the real benefit is, getting people off public assistance and back into the marketplace with the dignity and far more income there than the pittance that government gives them."

He added, "And I hope we don't lose track of the primary focus of what we're after here."

## Tough On Liars, Drug Users

Brownback said employment is one of the main factors in lifting a person out of poverty. He added that family structure was the most important factor.

However, some elements of the law have drawn criticism for being anti-family. If a person is found to have lied to receive welfare, both that person and other adults living in the same home would receive a lifetime ban from receiving public assistance dollars. Critics say this provision would penalize people for being married if one spouse abuses the system without the other's knowledge.

Another restriction in the law would place a lifetime ban on receiving food assistance if a person is convicted of two drug felonies.

Brownback said he is open to revisiting provisions of the bill if practical problems arise.

"I'm open to revisiting all of it, if it's not working," he said. "If it's working to get people back into the marketplace and back on their feet, I want to see us to continue to be strong."

## A Mean Law, Democrats Say

Democrats have been critical of the bill, which they say is mean-spirited.

"Child poverty and homelessness in Kansas are at record levels. … And, now, the governor has signed a punitive and highly judgmental piece of legislation that imposes illogical reforms that make it harder for Kansans in need to break the cycle and climb out of poverty," Senator Anthony Hensley said. "This is just one more example of how Sam Brownback is out of touch with the real world and has our state on the wrong path."

Representative Tom Burroughs said the law "does nothing to address the root causes of poverty in our state."

"Rather than passing mean-spirited bills that demean the poor in their time of greatest need, we should focus on providing quality education and creating economic opportunity to ensure that all Kansans have a fair chance to succeed," Burroughs said.

Gilmore did not say what penalty beneficiaries would face if they tried to spend their money at a restricted business, such as a tattoo parlor. She said such spending would be a policy violation but not benefits fraud.

## Life On $25 A Day

Another provision in the law limits the amount of TANF money a person can withdraw from an ATM to $25 a day. Republican state Representative Travis Couture-Lovelady said that the purpose of this provision is to ensure that the money is spent on necessities.

When asked whether he thought that poor people could not be trusted to spend their benefits money responsibly, Couture-Lovelady responded, "Most can. Absolutely most can."

"Just because most people don't commit murder doesn't mean we shouldn't keep it illegal," he said. "The key point is that it hurts the folks who are using the program in the correct manner when the money is spent in these incorrect manners."

## Advocate: Law Hurts Mothers

Shannon Cotsoradis, president of the group Kansas Action for Children, said that the law does more than just restrict where beneficiaries can spend their money. She said the legislation would require a woman to return to work shortly after having a baby in order to keep her assistance. At the same time, she said, the bill makes it more difficult to qualify for childcare assistance.

"By signing this bill into law, Governor Brownback has added to the burden that the poorest Kansans already carry. … It's always been hard to be poor in Kansas. Now, it's going to be a lot harder," Cotsoradis said.
