LOS ANGELES — On Monday, no one in California will be allowed to eat an ancient and popular type of Asian food. One of the food's ingredients will be banned. When something is banned, selling it is against the law.

That special ingredient is shark fin. Shark fins are used in a soup many Chinese people eat at special times. In California, they had been selling for more than $2,000 a pound.

It's not the flavor of shark fin that makes people love it. In fact, it hardly tastes like anything. What diners like is that it is soft and tender. Chefs often cook it with chicken or ham to give it more flavor.

Eighteen months ago, California Governor Jerry Brown outlawed the sale of shark fins in his state. Stores were still allowed to sell what they already owned. But they only had until Monday to do that. They won't be allowed to sell shark fins after that.

Those who break the new law could be jailed for up to six months. They could also be fined up to $1,000.

## Price Slash Before Ban

Grocer Emily Gian was not happy about the ban. Her store in Los Angeles' Chinatown still had a lot of shark fins left. To help get rid of them, she lowered the price, to $599 a pound. She hoped they'd sell out before the ban began.

"The law is unfair," she said. "Why single out Chinese people in California when shark fins are legal in many other states?"

Judy Ki thinks the ban is a good idea.

Ki is a retired science teacher. She grew up in a wealthy Hong Kong family. Her family served steaming bowls of shark fin soup on special days like birthdays and weddings.

Today, Ki works for a group that tries to protect the ocean. She now sees the expensive food differently.

## A Soup For Emperors

Shark fin soup was first eaten during China's Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). At the time, it was hard for a fisherman to kill a shark. Only the emperor was allowed to eat shark fin.

Today, many people eat shark fin soup. Fishermen have to catch a lot of sharks. They really only want the fins, though. Because of this, they slice the fins off live sharks. Then, they throw the crippled animals back into the sea to die.

Around 73 million sharks are killed each year for their fins. Ninety percent of some kinds of sharks have been killed in recent years, like the hammerhead.

Ki thinks that is wrong. It's not right to kill millions of sharks for a bowl of soup, Ki said. Some kinds of sharks may [disappear forever](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) if too many are killed.

Gian and others said other states still allow the sale of shark fins. But some other states may soon follow California.

Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Maryland and Delaware have already banned the sale of shark fins. New York is trying to do so now. Other states are also thinking of doing what California did.

Gian still had a lot of fins to sell before the ban.

"Maybe we'll reduce the prices even more, or eat them ourselves." Or maybe, she said, they'll just "move them to a state where they are still legal."
