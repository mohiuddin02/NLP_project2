FRESNO, Calif. — It's been the driest winter in many years in California. And state water officials have been accused of killing salmon and destroying farming. This is at least what people say in comments posted on a state website.

The officials' job is to decide what to do with the state's scarce water. Nobody sounds very happy about their decisions.

There are a lot of big feelings about water right now in California. Farmers, wildlife groups and cities have posted their thoughts on the website of the State Water Resources Control Board. Even the Fresno County sheriff gave her opinion.

"This year is a whole new level of crazy," said Ara Azhderian. He is with the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority. The group represents many farmers who probably won't get any water for farming this year.

## Water Flow From Two Rivers

Mostly, the complaints are about the water in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.

The Sacramento and the San Joaquin are the state's two longest rivers. They flow into a network of smaller rivers in the river delta. The two rivers are the main water supply for 3 million acres of farmland. They also supply water to 25 million people.

It's a balancing act. The rivers must continue to flow out into the Pacific Ocean. Otherwise, salt water from the ocean will flow into the delta. It would make the delta water salty. And that would spoil the water for people, farms and wildlife.

But San Joaquin Valley farmers say too much water has been allowed to escape to the ocean. They feel the farming industry is being robbed of water.

Wildlife groups, though, say farmers are getting too much water. They worry the fish will suffer.

The argument heated up in February and March. Oddly, that's when rain storms finally hit the state.

The February and March storms caused the water levels to rise. And the fight over the extra water was on.

## Water War

Farmers held huge rallies. They pressured lawmakers to give them more water. Meanwhile, fishing groups wrote passionate letters to newspapers. They criticized officials who let more water be pumped out of the rivers.

The water war had begun.

"This is a big one," said Les Grober. He is with the Water Resources Control Board. The board decides what to do with the water. "We get many issues before us. But this is a very dry year. People are very worried."

Grober said the delta area needs the water to push out ocean salt.

So how much water should flow to the ocean? And how much should go into the south delta?

"Should that balance be 80-20 — 80 percent going out and 20 percent being pumped?" asked Azhderian. "That was the split in February and March."

Farmers say they do not have enough water to grow their crops. They will not be able to plant hundreds of thousands of acres this year.

## Water For Storage

Environmentalists say the plan should include water stored at huge reservoirs.

The water in storage may help in the future. But it still isn't flowing out to the ocean, said biologist Jon Rosenfield. He is with the Bay Institute in San Francisco.

People are very concerned about their communities, said Janet McCleery. She lives in Discovery Bay in the delta.

"We're just trying to protect our home and life," she wrote. "And trying to save the salmon and local delta farmers while we're at it."

Margaret Mims is the Fresno County sheriff. She wrote to the water board. She said if they don't get any Northern California river water, it can cause people to lose their jobs. In some towns, one out of two people could be unemployed.

Crime could become a bigger problem, she said. There's a clear link between unemployment and public safety, she said. And so there's a link "between water shortages and public safety," Mims wrote.
