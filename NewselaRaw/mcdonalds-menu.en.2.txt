Craving a burger off a fast-food dollar menu? Better have more than a buck.

McDonald's is updating its Dollar Menu. For more than a decade, the menu offered burgers, fries and other items for less than a dollar apiece. The menu is popular. It accounts for as much as 14 percent of McDonald's U.S. sales.

But soon, the list will change. McDonald's is calling it the Dollar Menu &amp; More. That new menu mixes the standard $1 items in with $2 goods and $5 family meals. McDonald's says it is designed to "fill the need for choice, flexibility and other preferences."

The fast-food giant isn't the only one ditching the traditional dollar deal.

## Changing Tastes Changing Menus

Rising costs and changing tastes are pushing prices past the $1 mark. The fast-food market is overrun with more upscale chains and people seeking premium ingredients. It spells possible doom for the dollar deal.

In January, Wendy's 99-cent bargain menu became the Right Price Right Size menu. It includes items that cost as much as $2 each. The Burger King value menu recently included a limited-time $1.29 Whopper Jr. deal. And Arby's last spring introduced a menu called Snack 'n Save. It included baked potatoes and other products that top out at $3.

John Gordon advises restaurant chains for a living. He said the dollar menu will have to change. Talking about the dollar too much makes customers think less of a restaurant over time, he said.

Some experts say there are few business reasons for companies to continue offering dollar menus. The items are less profitable than drinks or limited-time sale items.

More chains are experimenting with prices. They offer different levels of deals instead of a flat menu of super-cheap options. Restaurants have raised prices to cover increasing food and other costs. Some favorites have moved above a dollar.

The number of menu items priced at $1 or less plunged 26 percent at fast-food restaurants in the past three years, research firm Mintel said.

## Not As Cheap As It Used To Be

And dollar menus might not survive new laws that are in the works, analysts said. Many fast-food restaurants have warned that coming health care reforms will mean they will keep even less of the money they get for each item they sell. They could be forced to raise prices higher.

Dollar menus could face additional pressure from higher pay for workers. California will raise the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) in the state to $10 an hour from $8 by Jan. 1, 2016. Analyst Gordon said that move probably will push the fast-food industry to raise the lowest prices to $1.99 from 99 cents.

"In California, you're not going to see dollar menus for long in the big chains," Gordon said.

At least not in their traditional forms. Restaurant chains are giving their value menus a makeover to try to reverse a slide in popularity.

Budget menu orders at fast-food chains dropped 12 percent in 2011. They fell another 7 percent last year, according to NPD Group Inc., a company that studies how people buy things. Demand for combo meals slid 13 percent in the past five years.

Customers are turning away from cut-rate food in part because it isn't as cheap as it used to be, analysts said. Consumers also have begun questioning the quality of budget menus, which rarely include fruits and vegetables.

## Do You Want Salad With That?

Some formerly loyal customers such as Aesha Adams Roberts would now rather buy a bag of dried beans for dinner. The Ventura, Calif., stay-at-home mom, 35, once was proud of her ability to save money using value menus. But after being sick while pregnant, she switched to organic food.

"Dollar menus are horrifying to me now," she said. "They may be budget-friendly, but the food is just really bad."

McDonald's is trying to lure back Roberts and health-minded customers. The company plans to offer side salads, fruit or vegetables as alternatives to french fries in value meals in some cities.

Other companies are trying other tactics to boost their bargain and combo offerings. Burger King last summer introduced a $1 burger stuffed with french fries.

KFC last month unveiled a container called the Go Cup. It is targeted at consumers increasingly eating small snacks while they are driving. The container, which fits in a car's cup holder, contains seasoned potato wedges and a choice of chicken for less than $3.

KFC may be on the right track. A meal can still be convenient even if it costs more than a dollar, said William McCarthy. He teaches health policy at the University of California.

"Economics is only part of what contributes to people's decisions to eat fast food," he said. "As appealing as the low cost is, the time cost is even more important, if you ask me. Fast-food places will not lose too many customers if they do away with dollar menus."
