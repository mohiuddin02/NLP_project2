Roasting marshmallows may not have been a part of our early ancestors' lives. But telling stories and singing around a campfire may have played an essential role in early societies.

A new study suggests socializing and storytelling around a fire may have expanded the minds and imaginations of our prehistoric ancestors. It accomplished this in ways that wouldn't have been possible during the hard work and harsh light of the daytime hours.

When humans first learned to control fire about 400,000 years ago, the quality of their lives changed dramatically. Brain size and gut size increased and predators no longer posed such a dire threat. Our ancestors' biological clocks also shifted as firelight extended the day by several hours, according to the study.

The light of the fire interfered with melatonin production, allowing people to stay awake during a time when it was difficult to work. Melatonin is a hormone the body makes that helps people fall asleep by causing drowsiness. Anthropologist Polly Wiessner wondered whether this newfound leisure time caused by firelight may have created a space for different types of socializing as well.

## Criticisms, Complaints And Conflicts

In a paper, Wiessner argues that conversations that take place at night around a fire have a different quality than those during the day. People also talk about different things.

"I think people are much more open at night by a fire," said Wiessner, who teaches at the University of Utah. Her study was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). "We are always checking people's facial expressions, but at night people are mostly staring into the fire and expressions are concealed."

In 1974, Wiessner spent two months recording conversations of the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen, a group of foragers in northeast Namibia and northwest Botswana in southwestern Africa. Today they get only a small amount of their food by hunting and gathering.

Wiessner originally made the recordings hoping to learn how they created and maintained social networks across a vast area of 124 miles. Recently, she listened again to the recordings to see how their communication differed during the day and at night. She returned to Namibia three times between 2011 and 2013 and digitally recorded stories from people she knew in the 1970s.

The conversations she collected were generally among at least four or five adults and lasted for 20 to 30 minutes. Of the 122 daytime conversations she recorded, 31 percent of them were devoted to economic discussions. People spoke about foraging or hunting plans or technology. Another 34 percent were devoted to criticisms, complaints and conflict. Joking made up 16 percent of conversations in the daytime and stories made up just 6 percent.

## Storytelling Around The Campfire

At night, however, when the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen gathered around a fire, they told stories 81 percent of the time.

"During the day, the conversation was kind of nasty a lot of the time," Wiessner said, "but at night they would mellow out and talk about the past. They would space travel and talk about group gatherings happening far away. They would cross time to their forefathers, and they traveled, in the stories, to other realms."

The stories were mainly about the adventures of people they know. From these stories, the audience could get information about how their society worked, the rules of marriage and kinship, and their traditions. Also, through hearing about the experiences of other people, the listeners gained empathy, Wiessner said.

Wiessner doesn't think that the lives of the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen foragers in the 1970s were the same as our early ancestors'. But she says their experiences can help anthropologists form educated guesses about our hunter-gatherer ancestors. They probably lived under similar conditions as the Bushmen hundreds of thousands of years ago.

Next, Wiessner would like to examine how the red, orange and blue flames of firelight act on us physiologically. She would like to measure how hormone levels change when people relax and talk by the fire.

## Economic Invaders Of The Night

Wiessner hopes other researchers will contribute "ethnography of night" studies from different cultures. Other questions include how the lack of firelight and storytelling time in our modern lives affect our society and our own sense of empathy.

After all, many of us are naturally drawn to fire, especially when we crave intimacy. Think candlelight dinners, romantic rooms with fireplaces, or making s'mores during a family camping trip.

Wiessner also notes that today, long after electricity reduced the time we spend with actual firelight, our society's nighttime hours are still often involved in the stories we watch on television or read in books. Even that seems to be changing, though.

"Like hunter-gatherers, we work our imaginations, gain new perspectives and expand our horizons from stories," she writes in the paper. "Even so, artificial light and digital communication are invading the night worldwide, turning hours of darkness into economically productive time and overriding social time and story time."
