STRASBURG, Pa. â€” In 2001, Benjamin Glick was born into a Amish family in Pennsylvania. Soon after his birth, he got very sick. He threw up and passed out. He lost weight because he refused to eat.

His parents took him to 12 doctors at six different hospitals. No one could figure out what was wrong.

"He was fading out, we were going to lose him," said his father, Amos Glick.

Finally, the Glicks found a clinic that could help their son. It was located in the middle of a cornfield in Pennsylvania.

It was called the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg. It focused on treating Amish and Mennonite children with rare genetic diseases.

## Rare Genetic Diseases

Amish and Mennonites are Christians who live a very traditional lifestyle. They first came to North America in the 1700s. Amish and Mennonites do not use electricity or other modern technology.

A person's genes are the blueprint for how he or she develops. Small differences in a person's genes can cause problems. These are called genetic diseases.

Doctors at the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg examined Benjamin. They had seen children before in the Amish and Mennonite communities with similar problems. They soon discovered that Benjamin had a rare genetic disease. It caused him to be allergic to proteins in milk.

The doctors changed Benjamin's diet. He got better within a month.

How did this small medical center catch what several large hospitals had missed? They knew what to look for. The Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg studies the genes of the Amish and Mennonites of Lancaster County. Doctors there learned that some rare genetic diseases are common for these people.

## Unusual Set Of Genes

For generations, Amish and Mennonites have married only within their communities. Because they do not have children with outsiders, they have developed an unusual set of genes.

The 60,000 Amish and Mennonites, or "Plain People," in Pennsylvania are all descended from fewer than 100 Europeans who came to America in the 1700s.

In a way, the Plain People are all related to each other. They all have similar genes. Genes, which are made of DNA, are the blueprint for how a person develops.

All the people in a family, for example, may need to wear glasses. In this case, a gene for bad vision is being passed down to each generation of that family.

For the Plain People, their genes make them more likely to get some diseases and less likely to get others.

That is why Amish and Mennonite children are at greater risk for certain genetic diseases than the general population. The Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg has been working to treat these rare conditions for the past 25 years.

## Medical Center In A Barn

The medical center opened its doors in 1990. Co-founder D. Holmes Morton was working at another hospital in 1988 when he treated a 6-year-old Amish boy named Danny Lapp. Danny had an undiagnosed disease that left him brain damaged and unable to use his limbs.

Doctors thought the boy had a disease called cerebral palsy. Morton, however, identified his disease as glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). GA1 is a rare condition that attacks the brain.

At the time, there were only eight known cases of GA1.

The Lapp case changed Morton's life. He co-founded the Clinic for Special Children of Strasburg with his wife, Caroline Morton. The small medical center is run out of a barnlike building in the countryside. It was built in a single day by Amish and Mennonite craftsmen.

## Finding Cures For Deadly Diseases

Morton and his coworkers have learned a lot about the genes of the people they serve. GA1 is one of more than 150 diseases and genetic conditions they have identified that affect the Amish and Mennonites of Lancaster County.

For example, Amish babies are 100 times more likely to have GA1 than other babies. On the other hand, some genetic diseases that affect the general population do not exist in Amish and Mennonite communities.

Between their research and work treating patients, doctors at the Clinic for Special Children of Strasburg have transformed health care for their patients.

They have managed to find treatments for diseases that used to be death sentences for children like Benjamin. They have also advanced our knowledge of rare genetic diseases, possibly leading to cures for diseases that afflict the wider population.
