MIAMI â€” Archaeologists who for months have been uncovering evidence of an ancient [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) village have concluded it's probably one of the most significant primitive sites in the United States. And it's right in the middle of downtown Miami.

The archaeologists are under the direction of Florida archaeologist Bob Carr. So far they have painstakingly dug up eight large circles consisting of uniformly carved holes in the native limestone. They believe these to be foundation holes for Tequesta Indian dwellings dating as far back as 2,000 years.

They have also discovered rows of hundreds of such postholes stretching across the site. Carr believes that these mark the foundation for other structures. They may have supported boardwalks connecting the dwellings. The village site borders a rocky outcropping that his team has concluded was the original shoreline at the meeting point of Biscayne Bay and the Miami River. That spot was filled up by soil long ago.

"What's unusual and unique about the site is that it's this huge chunk of land where a major part of this ancient Tequesta village site is preserved,'' Carr said. "It's one of the earliest urban plans in eastern North America."

## "No Easy Answer"

The finds have not been widely publicized. But they're already presenting public officials and a big downtown developer with a major problem. The Tequesta village site covers roughly half of a vacant, two-acre city block on the north side of the river. A real estate developer, MDM Development Group, plans to build movie theaters, restaurants and a 34-story hotel on the site. The project would cover most of the block, including the full archaeological site.

The city of Miami granted MDM approvals for the Met Square project. Yet, it hasn't issued a final building permit. At the time of the approval, the full extent of the archaeological finds was not known. The site has now yielded thousands of Tequesta artifacts, including bone and shell tools. Remnants of industrialist Henry Flagler's 1897 Royal Palm Hotel, which gave rise to the city of Miami, were also discovered.

Historic-preservation officials are pressing the city to rethink the Met Square plans. They're hoping the city will consider alternatives that would salvage part or all of the archaeological site. Changes could require a major, costly redesign of the Met Square project.

MDM says it could lose a significant amount of money if that happens. The developer has offered to carve out the limestone holding one or two of the larger circles on the site and display those in a public square. In recent weeks, MDM officials have discussed doing more, but have made no promises.

"We will do our utmost,'' MDM director Ian Swanson said. "There is no easy answer to this at all.''

## The Miami Circle Battle

While recognizing the site's importance, Swanson said there are still questions over precisely what it was. He said the artifacts taken from the site and stored at the HistoryMiami museum will provide historians years' worth of study.

Carr was hired by MDM. By law the company must pay for the archaeological survey. Carr has recommended to MDM that as much as possible of the site be preserved in place.

"If you have a necklace filled with pearls, what makes it valuable is its entirety, not four or five pearls,'' Carr said.

Preservationists say MDM took a chance when it purchased the property 10 years ago. It knew the site was inside a designated archaeological zone. Though the site was covered by a parking lot for 70 years, Carr and other archaeologists long suspected it was once part of a Tequesta village. Burial grounds were found previously in the immediate vicinity.

The issue echoes the battle to save the Miami Circle. In 1998, a set of postholes were discovered by Carr on the south bank of the Miami River, opposite the recently uncovered Tequesta village site. Archaeologists concluded the circle marked the site of a Tequesta council house or ceremonial structure from as long as 2,000 years ago.

A real estate developer that owned the site planned to build apartments on it. After an international outcry, the developer sold the property to the state for $27 million.

## Three Historic Structures

The city's historic preservation board has legal authority over archaeological sites. It plans to debate what to do about the Tequesta site.

Preservationists and city board members say there is strong support to create an exhibit around part of the archaeological site. State officials say it would likely qualify as a National Historic Landmark, like the Statue of Liberty and Miami's Freedom Tower. Some local officials and preservationists believe it might also be named as a World Heritage site by UNESCO, an agency of the United Nations.

The site is significant for more than just the Tequesta village. Carr's team has also uncovered other artifacts at the site. Two later historic structures were built over the Tequesta village. A well and artifacts from Fort Dallas, a military base used during the Seminole Indian wars in the mid-1800s, were discovered. Also found were brick column bases of the Palm Hotel, which prompted the founding of the city of Miami.

"It's extremely important,'' said city preservation board member Gerald Marston of the site. "If they gave it a name, it's the birthplace of Miami.''
