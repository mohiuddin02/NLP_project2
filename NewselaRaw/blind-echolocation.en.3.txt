Ryo Hirosawa is blind and could not see what was in front of him. Was it a house, a car, a hedge, a fence, a tree or open space?

Hirosawa pushed the tip of his tongue to the top of his mouth. He then made a sharp click.

As its echo came back at him, he could not decide what it sounded like. Did it sound scattered, as if it hit leaves? Was it bouncing off a solid wall? Was it hitting many different objects?

As Hirosawa kept clicking, he began to see a faint picture in his mind.

"There is a tree, I think, here, which is tall, and I see a house behind," Hirosawa said.

He stepped into the yard to find out whether he was right. Brian Bushway, his teacher, tapped his cane against a tree trunk. Then he reached up to grab a branch and shake the leaves, and knocked against a wall.

"A house," Bushway said. "Awesome, very good."

## Group Teaches Blind People How Clicks Work

This quiet street in Long Beach, California, is the home of World Access for the Blind. The group teaches blind people to find their way using tongue clicks.

Their students learn to send out sonar to know where they are. Dolphins and bats use sonar to find objects by sound. The creatures make a noise. Then they use their sonar to listen to the echo to figure out where an object is.

Daniel Kish is blind and started the group. He has worked with scientists to study how the brain does this. Scientists found that when people use sonar they use the part of the brain that usually has to do with seeing. They did not use the part people usually use with hearing.

## Blind Children Often Use Clicks To Find Way

When Kish was small, he began made clicking noises with his tongue to find his way around. Many blind children often do this. Some parents worry that their child might sound strange. Kish's mother and father did not try to stop him.

He rode bikes and climbed trees. Yet he did not understand how the clicking was helping him until he was 11. A friend pointed out that he was doing what bats do.

Bushway is also blind. When he was younger, he could see pillars in his school hallway, and even count them.

When he met Kish, he told him about this. Kish told him that his brain was forming pictures from the sound reflecting off the columns.

## Brain Uses Sound To Form Images

"The brain creates images," he said. It does not matter if you send it patterns of light or sound.

Since Kish started the group in 2001, his team has traveled to more than 34 countries.

Some blind people worry that the clicking would seem strange to people.

The National Federation of the Blind, though, said all blind people use sound echos at least sometimes. Many blind people use canes to find their way around. They tap their canes for the same reason.

Brandon Shin, 17, came to Kish for help two years ago.

## Clicking Through A Canyon Alone

Now he clicks all the time, and just hiked through a canyon by himself. "Just the cane and my clicking," Shin said.

He says some kids at school made fun of him, but others have been really interested.

Shin's father said Brandon can get around objects as though he could see them.

"Sonar has given Brandon self-esteem and courage," Michael Shin said. "From a parent's point of view, we're worried he'll get hurt, but we're proud. He's doing it better than we expected."
