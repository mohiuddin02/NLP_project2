The forces behind this inconsistency are complicated: Grocery stores think they'll be legally responsible if they donate food to food pantries and it makes people sick. Farmers allow edible, but ugly fruit to rot in fear it won't sell. Bananas blacken on all our shelves.

## Frustrated Teen Has An Idea

But the reasons behind this waste didn't feel so complicated to a teenage girl named Maria Rose Belding on a chilly day five years ago.

The whole thing felt simple. It felt wrong. It felt like something had to change.

Belding, then a volunteer at a local food pantry in Pella, Iowa, had just thrown out hundreds of boxes of expired mac and cheese in front of numerous hungry people lining up outside to collect free food.

"We were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn't communicate," Belding, then a freshman in high school, remembers. That frustration would ultimately lead the American University sophomore to develop a groundbreaking advancement in the long — and often inefficient — war on hunger.

## Connecting 24 States

After years of research, Belding, 20, has founded an online network that connects thousands of food pantries in 24 states, allowing them to quickly share surplus food that might have otherwise gone to waste. Pantries simply post their excess food to the program — and someone else in the network picks it up and puts it to use. So far, the database has saved an estimated two tons of food.

L'Oréal Paris, the cosmetics company, has since praised the program, last week naming Belding one of its 10 women of worth. So has Arianna Huffington of the Huffington Post. And experts agree programs like the interactive MEANS website, which stands for Matches Excess and Need for Stability, can close lapses in communication between pantries and chip away at the country's colossal problem with persistent waste.

## Food Waste Hurts The Environment Too

Food waste "needs to be addressed on multiple levels," said Mathy Stanislaus, an official with the Environmental Protection Agency who works on ending food waste. "Part is wider knowledge of the problem, but also tools [like this] to reduce waste."

The stakes couldn't be higher. Food production accounts for around 10 percent of the national energy budget, uses half of the country's land and consumes around 80 percent of all the freshwater used in the United States, according to a paper published in 2012 by the National Resources Defense Council.

The study noted that Americans waste $165 billion every year on food destined for landfills. Inside these landfills, the food decomposes and emits 16 percent of the country's methane — a greenhouse gas that has an effect on global warming 25 times greater than carbon dioxide does.

## Launching A Website

Even people who donate to their local pantries are contributing, to some degree, to the problem. Emergency food centers have long been the last stop for whatever's lurking in the back of America's cupboards. And so, people donate an endless supply of near-expired creamed corn, beans and Honeybuns. The excess of product often does one of two things. It expires on the shelf and gets thrown out. Or it clutters the pantry so much that non-profits can't accept better donations that could immediately service a community. 

When Belding started researching the idea behind the MEANS database while in high school, she was sure someone had beat her to it. She was wrong. 

It took more than a year. She spent a year planning, researching and building program after program along with her co-founder, Grant Nelson. Then in February, the website launched.

## Cool Beans!

Months passed. In May, Belding was sitting in class when she saw one of their early users had posted an item to the site. This was the moment, she realized, when the project would either succeed or fail. A sense of panic seized her when she saw someone was giving away assorted varieties of canned beans. "They're like the off-brand Mountain Dew in the food world," Belding said. "You'll take it only if you have no other option. . . . So we were all anxiously sitting by our computers hitting refresh, and I said, 'Please, someone take this.' And then, it's gone. It just disappeared. . . . The beans had moved."

"We were kind of desperate," said Stephanie Shallah, an official with Washington, D.C.'s So Others Might Eat who had posted the item. "Beans come so often to me that I didn't think anyone would want them. So I said, 'I'm going to just post it and see what happens.' I said, 'I have nothing to lose.'" She said a Landover, Maryland pantry servicing a large Hispanic population took the goods.

## Building On Her Success

Things then happened very quickly for MEANS. The organization now commands a staff of several computer programmers paid through grant money and even a few interns whom Belding admits are older than she. The number of members on the site has grown from around 50 larger food banks in June to more than 200. 

But there's still a lot of work to do, Belding said. There are still 26 states that remain untapped. There's still the world. Belding said she had more calls to make. More connections to forge.
