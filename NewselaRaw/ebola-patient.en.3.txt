DALLAS, Texas â€” A man in Texas has tested positive for Ebola. He is the first person outside of Africa to come down with the deadly disease, health officials said.

Ebola is a deadly virus that is spreading across Africa. It has killed thousands of people in Africa since March.

The man had just come from the African country of Liberia and arrived in the United States on Sept. 20. When he was on the plane, he did not appear to be sick at all.

The man flew to visit family members in Texas. Then, days after he arrived, he began to feel sick. On Friday, he went to the hospital's emergency room and was sent home with medicine.

Now, he is extremely sick at a Texas hospital. He has been cared for since Sunday in a special area of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, said Dr. Edward Goodman. The area keeps him completely separate from people to prevent Ebola from spreading.

## "We Will Stop It Here"

"I have no doubt that we will control this importation of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country," Dr. Tom Frieden said. He is the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "We will stop it here."

Ebola is contagious. However, you cannot get it simply by being in the same room as someone with the disease. It is spread only through direct contact with the blood and other body fluids of an infected person. Frieden emphasized that the man had to have symptoms of Ebola before he could begin spreading the disease. The man was near very few people after he felt sick. Medical workers are now trying to find all of them.

Frieden said other passengers on the airplane the man was on are not at risk of getting Ebola. The patient was not feeling sick at the time of the flight. Ebola is not contagious unless the person with the disease has symptoms.

A special team of CDC "disease detectives" and other experts have been sent to Texas. They will help health workers find everyone the patient went near. Once they are located, they will be checked for 21 days. If they show signs of a fever, they will be isolated and tested for Ebola.

Dr. David Lakey is the top official of the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he thinks the man is the only person with Ebola in Texas.

Liberia is one of the three African countries fighting the worst Ebola outbreak in history. At least 6,574 people have become sick with Ebola and at least 3,091 of them have died, according to the World Health Organization. Ebola kills more than half the people who get the disease. There is no vaccine or cure.

## People In Dallas Worried

Health experts say Ebola spread so quickly because the African countries did not quickly recognize the danger. They lacked basic medical supplies and health centers. Also, the rest of the world was slow to make sure the victims stayed away from other people. They were also slow to treat the people with Ebola.

The situation in the United States is very different. Good health care in the U.S. makes a large outbreak here highly unlikely, said Dr. Anne Rimoin. She is a doctor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.

"We have the ability to trace contacts, monitor people and to act quickly if any of them should start to exhibit symptoms," Rimoin said. If West African nations had these systems, "there wouldn't be this huge outbreak in the first place," she said.

The CDC announced Tuesday that Ebola was now under control in two West African countries. It gave credit to the medical teams there.

People in the Dallas area, especially in the Liberian community, are worried that Ebola has come to Texas.

Stanley Gaye is the president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth. He said Liberians were worried about going near people who were recently in Africa. "This disease is a horrible disease," Gaye said.
