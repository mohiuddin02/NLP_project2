SAVANNAH, Mo. — At the rate Gary Silverglat is going, his Angels Vet Expresscare medical clinic may one day become the St. Jude's of animal care.

It may seem like a stretch to compare Angels Vet to the famous children's research hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. But don't tell that to Silverglat. He first opened the clinic to serve an animal rescue nonprofit he founded 30 years ago in Savannah, Missouri.

His strategy with the Angels Vet clinic is based on a high-volume, low-cost approach. Today the clinic treats 100,000 animals annually for much less than the fees charged by private veterinary practices.

No wonder pet lovers and other animal rescue operations beat a path to its door. The clinic has also captured the attention of veterinarians around the country eager to learn and duplicate Silverglat's business model.

## "The Secret Is Volume"

"The secret is volume. But the clinic was founded on the premise that no animal should fail to receive care services because the expense is too high," Silverglat said. "I guess we're like the St. Jude's of veterinary clinics by teaching and sharing our model." Although the children's hospital takes health insurance, families never receive bills for treatment.

It is no surprise that Angels Vet Expresscare has such a huge following. People love their pets, and veterinary care in the United States is big business. According to the American Pet Products Association, Americans spent $15 billion on veterinary care in 2014.

The average price in the Midwest for the most basic veterinary procedure — spaying or neutering a pet cat or dog — is $20 to $45\. The cost depends on the species and the animal's size, according to data cited by Silverglat. Something more serious, like the treatment of a heartworm infection, can cost $180 to $350\. Heartworms are long worms that can lodge in an animal's heart or lungs, causing serious problems.

## Surgery Can Cost 10 Percent Of Usual Rate

At Angels Vet, the combined cost to spay a cat, vaccinate it for rabies and feline leukemia, and deworm the animal is $67\. Major surgical procedures at the clinic can cost 10 percent of those in standard private-practice settings, Silverglat said.

Kathy Turner, an animal control officer in Cameron, Missouri, is one of Silverglat's biggest fans. She appreciates the affordable vet care she can obtain for the dogs she uses in the Missouri Department of Corrections' Puppies for Parole program.

Puppies for Parole gives some people convicted of crimes the opportunity to train rescue dogs. It's a one-hour drive for Turner to Silverglat's clinic to have the dogs treated.

"If it weren't for Angels Vet Expresscare, we wouldn't have a program," she said. "In fact, we don't have enough dogs in Cameron for the program, so we bring in dogs from around the state that would ordinarily be euthanized," or killed.

## Low Fees Help Struggling Families

The clinic's low fees help the average family struggling with veterinary care expenses, according to Jenny Hays. She is the hospital administrator of BluePearl Veterinary Partners in Overland Park, Kansas, which sends pets to Silverglat's clinic.

It gives them a way to get their animals treated "when financial hardships exist in their family," Hays said.

Building the business did not come easy for Silverglat. He estimates he has pumped several million dollars of his own money into his business over 13 years and continues to make very little profit.

Silverglat is not a veterinarian. But he has what he calls "a natural passion for animals."

When he and his wife, Lisa, moved to the rural area, they saw a tremendous number of abandoned animals. That's when Silverglat, who has worked as a cattle buyer, a meat packer and a retailer, decided that he and his wife needed to take action.

"We kept a lot of the abandoned animals at first, but then we realized we couldn't keep 27 animals and we needed to start a business to fix this," he said. "So even though we started our business rescuing animals, we figured out we could save even more animals by offering low prices."

## Some Rescue Animals Treated For Free

The clinic operates with five full-time veterinarians, two part-time veterinarians and a support staff of 30\. It also has a handful of volunteers.

Angels Vet Expresscare sees about 60,000 pets annually. The clinic treats 40,000 more –– rescue animals –– at cost or free with the goal of improving animal welfare in the region, according to dvm360, a national veterinary trade publication.

On any given day, Silverglat said, there are about 50 cars in the clinic's parking lot, owned by high-income and low-income people.

"It's difficult to pull it off," Silverglat said of his business model. "It takes a big personal investment, partnerships within the community and special pricing from (veterinary drug) manufacturers to make it work. But in the end, we figured we could do more for the animals by treating them rather than holding them."
