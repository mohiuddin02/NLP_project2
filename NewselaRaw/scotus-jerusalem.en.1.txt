WASHINGTON — On Monday the Supreme Court struck down a disputed law that would have allowed Americans born in Jerusalem to list their birthplace as Israel on their U.S. passports. The new ruling underscores the president's authority in foreign affairs.

The court ruled 6-3 that Congress overstepped its bounds when it approved the law in 2002. The law would have forced the U.S. State Department to alter its long-standing policy of not listing Israel as the birthplace for Americans born in Jerusalem.

The policy is part of the government's refusal to recognize any nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem, until Israelis and Palestinians settle their dispute over who has rightful claims to the city.

Justice Anthony Kennedy said in his majority opinion that the president has the exclusive power to recognize foreign nations, and that determining what a passport says is part of this power.

## Nation's Voice "Must Be The President's"

"Recognition is a topic on which the nation must speak with one voice. That voice must be the president's," Kennedy wrote.

The ruling ends a 12-year-old lawsuit by a Jerusalem-born American, Menachem Zivotofsky, and his U.S. citizen parents, who wanted Menachem's passport to list his place of birth as Israel.

Three of the justices dissented from — disagreed with — the majority opinion of the six justices. Justice Antonin Scalia read a summary of his dissent from the bench, saying that the U.S. Constitution "divides responsibility for foreign affairs between Congress and the president." Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joined the dissent.

## Minority Calls It "A Perilous Step"

In a separate written dissent, Roberts said the court's decision created a dangerous precedent. "The court takes the perilous step — for the first time in our history — of allowing the president to defy an act of Congress in the field of foreign affairs," Roberts wrote.

The court's consideration of the case has coincided with Palestinian-Israeli tension over Jerusalem. President Barack Obama has said he is not convinced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's efforts to explain statements he recently made that rejected the creation of a Palestinian nation.

Debate over the status — the national identity — of Jerusalem has for decades been among the most difficult issues in Israeli-Palestinian relations. Israel has controlled all of Jerusalem since the Six-Day War in 1967 when it captured East Jerusalem, and has proclaimed a united Jerusalem as its eternal capital. The Palestinians have declared that East Jerusalem will be the capital of the independent nation they hope to form.

## Case Spotlights Tensions Over Jerusalem

Indeed, Kennedy opened his opinion by noting the tensions that surround the status of Jerusalem. "A delicate subject lies in the background of this case. That subject is Jerusalem," he said.

In the voting breakdown, the court's four liberals, including the three Jewish justices, joined Kennedy's opinion, which sided with the Obama administration and against the Zivotofskys.

U.S. policy has long refrained from recognizing any nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem and has held that the city's status should be resolved through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Congress has for years tried to push presidential administrations to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The United States has never enforced the passport law, on the books since 2002.

The justices had the Zivotofsky case before them once before. In 2012, the court rejected decisions made by lower courts that called the matter a political issue that should be resolved by Congress and the president without the help of the courts.

The federal appeals court in Washington then struck down the law, calling it an unconstitutional act by Congress to overstep the president's authority over foreign affairs.

##Congress, White House Still At Odds

Congress and the White House have argued for decades over support for Israel's position on Jerusalem.

In 1995, Congress essentially adopted the Israeli position, saying the United States should recognize a united Jerusalem as Israel's capital. In 2002, lawmakers passed the law urging the president to take steps to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv and allowing Americans born in Jerusalem to have their place of birth listed as Israel.

President George W. Bush signed the 2002 law but noted that "U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem has not changed." Obama has taken the same position.

Israel's government declined to comment. Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said Israel does not comment on rulings by foreign courts.
