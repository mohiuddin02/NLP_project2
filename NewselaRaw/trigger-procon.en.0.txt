### PRO: "Trigger warnings" don't interfere with learning, they enhance it

NEW YORK — The college classroom is properly the site of serious discussion of potentially traumatic topics. "Trigger warnings" don't interfere with that process — in fact, they enhance it.

Trigger warnings' origins lie in the wilds of the Internet, where they arose as a way to alert readers about content that might be traumatic.

Their premise is that a rape survivor, for instance, might legitimately prefer to have some warning before encountering a graphic description of sexual assault. Though not entirely uncontroversial, trigger warnings generally don't spark much rancor in online spaces. Some writers use them, most don't, but they usually pass without much comment either way.

Earlier this year, though, when college students started pushing for the use of trigger warnings in classes, their demand provoked a massive, vitriolic and overwhelmingly negative response.

Unlike most faculty, though, I found the idea intriguing. As a historian I discuss some very dark and difficult material in class, and as a professor I think it's important to give students a clear sense of their rights and responsibilities.

So after a bit of thinking and a bit of discussion, I came up with a trigger warning — I actually call it a "content note" — of my own, which I incorporated into my syllabus for the first time this summer.

In my content note I warn students that some of them may find some of the material we cover disturbing.

I don't provide examples in the syllabus itself, but I do when we review it together. I let students know that I'm open to discussing their personal reactions to historical topics during class or in my office hours, tell them that they're free to step outside briefly if they find any content overwhelming, and encourage them to talk to me privately if they have any specific concerns.

A few weeks ago, after I settled on the language of my content note, I wrote a short essay on the subject for the online academic newspaper Inside Higher Ed. The response to that piece was starkly divided, and the way that it broke down says a lot, I think, about the current academic trigger warning debate.

Most of the opponents of trigger warnings who replied to my piece didn't find much to object to in the note itself.

Instead, they argued that what I'd written wasn't a "trigger warning" at all — that it was too moderate, too reasonable, too simple to fit that description. Some went so far as to predict that it would be rejected out of hand by trigger warning proponents.

In fact, the opposite happened. With one mild exception, every trigger warning advocate who responded to my piece — in comments forums, on Facebook and Twitter, on blogs, or by email — embraced it.

Several said that they would be adopting a version of it in their own syllabi or suggesting it to their professors. More than one said that it would have made a major difference in classes that they had found deeply alienating.

While trigger warning opponents rejected my approach as insubstantial, even meaningless, in other words, supporters cheered it as a significant and potentially transformative pedagogical tool.

What does this — to me quite surprising — contrast tell us?

Think at least three things: First, that the discussion of trigger warnings in the classroom is still in its early stages, and that faculty should take calls for change as invitations to dialogue rather than as ultimatums.

Second, that despite the unfamiliar terminology, trigger warnings may not represent a huge departure from what we as professors are already doing.

And third, that even minor adjustments to teaching practice can have a substantial positive impact on the classroom environment.

### CON: "Trigger warnings" shackle the free flow of ideas vital to higher education

MADISON, Wis. — Free-speech controversy is riveting higher education again. Major schools recently disinvited graduation speakers whom activists deemed "improper" to their notions of justice. And many institutions have begun formally to institute — or consider instituting — "trigger warnings."

Trigger warnings are verbal or written warnings instructors provide about material that might trigger "trauma" in students who have experienced or witnessed traumatic events, including forms of assault and war, and are sensitive about such topics as race, gender, sexual orientation, colonialism and imperialism — to name a few.

The humane case for trigger warnings is that they allegedly help protect students from re-experiencing the past trauma, which can emotionally harm the student and interfere with his or her ability to learn.

What could be wrong with that? Warnings might make outright censorship less likely, much like the movie industry avoided government censorship by agreeing to use ratings labels for films. This could even enhance freedom of inquiry while protecting emotional well-being. And have not many instructors quietly and informally engaged in such practice in the past?

Alas, many substantial problems lurk just beneath the surface — especially when one considers the intellectual climate at many colleges and universities, of which the fate of recent graduation speakers is symptomatic. Let me touch on a few.

First, as critics from across the political spectrum have averred, it is impossible to determine in advance what material merits a warning. To avoid complaints, threats and possible lawsuits because they failed to warn of some potentially offensive material, many instructors, given the general pressures at play in higher education, would likely extend warnings to large amounts of material, sending the misguided message that learning is traumatic per se.

Or they could bowdlerize the course material in the name of sensitivity. If ever the concept of the slippery slope applied, it would apply here.

Already, trigger warnings have been applied to such works as "The Great Gatsby," "The Merchant of Venice" and other classics.

"Gatsby?" Really?! What's next? "Hamlet?" And what if a student refuses to read the flagged material, however important it is to the class? Do not trigger warnings imply the right of refusal, which would open yet another Pandora's Box?

Another danger waits: formalizing trigger warnings would further empower the higher-ed sensitivity bureaucracies that are often as voracious and omnipresent as they are ignorant of basic academic freedom principles.

Most important, the rationale for formal trigger warnings is inimical to the purposes of education.

Liberal education should expose students to the depths of the human condition, which unavoidably entails matters of good and evil, life and death — what the German philosopher Nietzsche called "uncomfortable truths."

And civic education must prepare students to be mentally strong enough to handle the rigors associated with the clash of ideas that is paramount to a free society. As the great educational philosopher Alexander Meiklejohn remarked, "To be afraid of ideas, any idea, is to be unfit for self-government."

Born from the tenets of the controversial "trauma movement" in psychology, trigger warnings assume that many students are not capable of handling the responsibilities of adult citizenship.

In the name of sensitivity, the movement undermines the very equal respect it ostensibly supports, while also fostering the mentality of in loco parentis that universities properly abandoned decades ago.

To deal with occasional cases of extreme material, leave the matter where it has always resided: at the considered informal discretion of instructors.

If a formal trigger warning must be had, place these words atop a university's main webpage: "Education necessarily exposes students to ideas and experiences that are new, challenging, and sometimes painful. To be properly educated, you must learn to handle and welcome such challenges."
