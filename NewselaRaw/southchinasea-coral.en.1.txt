BEIJING — In addition to China's burgeoning economy, something else in Asia's powerhouse nation is growing fast: the physical size of the country.

China has been accused of building a "Great Wall of sand" by creating artificial islands in the South China Sea to bolster its territorial claims there. U.S. Navy Admiral Harry Harris claims the Chinese are dredging sand and dumping it on reefs of living coral. While skeptics may wonder about the U.S. Navy's dedication to the environment — top officers maintain they are serious about it — the impact of China's island growth strategy has the potential to have serious impact on the environment and coral in the sea.

The chief scientist of the National Geographic Pristine Seas Program, Alan Friedlander, told a recent forum at the East-West Center in Honolulu that dredging kills off a reef. The South China Sea is wedged in between China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. The body of water is home to an astonishingly diverse array of marine species. A factor in this flourishing underwater landscape is the shallow coral reefs that are particularly abundant in the region. Without the reefs, those fish would disappear. The area at the heart of this debate is called the Spratly Islands.

## Critics Allege Chinese Are Crushing Coral Reefs

Writing recently in Eurasia Review, a news journal, University of Singapore researchers Youna Lyons and Wong Hiu Fung allege that Chinese dredgers have been pulling up the coral itself, crushing it and using it as fill.

Harris, who spoke in Australia in late March, said China has created 1.5 square miles of artificial land in its recent move to secure possession of most of the sea. The battle for which nations own the sea has been contentious since all the countries that border it have claims. China says its sovereignty extends over almost the entire sea, a claim made on the basis of a map that was drawn up right after World War II. Understandably, tensions are increasing as countries desire more control in the region, and all sides say they fear an incident that could spark an armed confrontation.

On Monday May 11, a group of journalists from the United States and 11 other countries that lie on or near the South China Sea visited the Foreign Ministry here in Beijing. The Foreign Ministry is an agency responsible for relations between China and other countries.

## Construction An "Exercise Of Sovereignty"

Ouyang Yujing, director general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs, said China was entirely within its rights to build the new islands. The growth, he said, was "justified, reasonable and lawful."

The construction of these islands is designed to create habitable platforms for people China deploys to serve in maritime zones. Chinese citizens will be posted there, Yujing said, so they can more easily be able to carry out safety and rescue operations, scientific investigation, navigation aid, fisheries services, weather forecasting, suppression of piracy and — not least — the "exercise of sovereignty."

He does not believe the government's actions merit reproach. The country, he says, performed research before starting the construction and has a basis for these actions. Before any construction began, he said, a "rigorous scientific test" was conducted to ensure there would be no environmental damage.

## Humans To Blame For Some Reef Damage

The traveling journalists are being supported on their tour by the East-West Center. The East-West Center is a U.S.-sponsored initiative that promotes study, research and dialogue between different countries. The group dropped in to visit the Department of International Cooperation.

"China's coral reef ecosystem has been under very severe impact," said Zhang Haiwen, who serves as the director general of the Department of International Cooperation.

Humans are to blame for some of the damage to the reefs. Acidification, which occurs from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is a big environmental problem. China also blames fishing boats from neighboring countries for causing damage to the reefs. Haiwen said her agency is working on transplanting some reefs, and a government lab is developing techniques to regrow coral.

Haiwen said the Department of International Cooperation has 10 functions and that environmental protection is only one of them. The agency also promotes economic development in the maritime zone. The question they grapple with now is how to develop resources while also protecting the environment.

## Official: China In Compliance With International Law

According to Haiwen, building artificial islands "is an international norm." The growth creates a benefit for the region and the country. While there are international policies that aim to monitor such development, she claims that China has been in strict compliance with both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its own tough regulations.

Furthermore, the Defense Ministry, another government agency, has examined the issue, she said. It found the work to be permissible. "What we are doing is in line with international and domestic laws," she said. Haiwen pointed out that some of China's neighboring countries are doing the same thing by building off coral reefs. In fact, on Friday, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington released satellite photos that it says reveal two similar projects in the South China Sea carried out by Vietnam

When asked to describe the damage to the coral that her agency monitors and presumably witnessed while the Chinese military was building the artificial islands, Zhang stood up in exasperation.

"I have a plane to catch," she said, and walked out.
