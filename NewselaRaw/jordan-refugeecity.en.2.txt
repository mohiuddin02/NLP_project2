ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan â€” The Zaatari Refugee Camp has grown from a group of tents into a busy city.

The camp used to be just empty desert. In three short years, it has become the Middle East's largest camp for refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. The camp is becoming a permanent part of the landscape. Officials have plans for water treatment systems and a $20 million solar power factory.

Most of the 81,000 people living there will not be going back home anytime soon. The war between the Syrian government and rebels is in its fifth year.

Some deal with that by making the best of life in exile. A Zaatari high school senior, for instance, studied hard to win a university scholarship. A former farmer planted a garden because he was tired of looking at the desert.

But dozens of others leave every week to go back to Syria. They say it is better to risk death in Syria than live in the camp. Jobs are few, one-third of children do not attend school and thousands of young adults lack the chance to learn a trade.

## Struggle To Stay Versus Struggle To Go

Zaatari, which began on July 28, 2012, is now the ninth-biggest city in Jordan. Today the tiny Jordanian kingdom, which is next to Syria, hosts 629,000 Syrian refugees out of more than 4 million. More than 100,000 live in camps in Jordan, including 20,000 in the newer Azraq refugee camp. The rest struggle to survive in cities with money and food from the United Nations (U.N.).

The transformation from tent camp to city shows the failure of the world to find an end Syria's war.

Zaatari's solar power plant will not be ready before the end of 2016. Electricity cuts are frequent and are a common subject of camp conversation. The other big topic is whether to stay or go back to Syria.

Some 30 people are returning each day. About 120 people used to return daily, but that was before major fighting several months ago in an area where many Zaatari residents are from.

## Adjusting To Life In Exile

On July 29, Emad Issawi, his wife Nihad and their three young children stood along the camp's road with a pile of bags. They waited to catch a bus to the Syrian border. Those who leave Jordan are rarely allowed back.

"I'm scared," Nihad said.

Across the street, Mohammed Hariri said he is returning to Syria after one of his daughters told him their village is pretty safe.

Others try to make the most of life in exile.

Jumma al-Sheik planted corn, tomatoes, mint and pink althea flowers. He created a popular gathering spot for relatives to drink sweet tea and chat.

Al-Sheik and family members fled two years ago after attacks by the Syrian government. Fighting destroyed their homes.

Al-Sheik, who grew vegetables back home, said the garden "makes everything a little better."

## Surprising Possibilities In Camp

Abdel Mutalleb Hariri enrolled his six children in camp schools immediately after they arrived in January 2013. Unable to work as a veterinarian, he now sells clothes while his wife teaches English in grade school.

Their oldest child, 19-year-old Alaa, won a scholarship and finished her first year at nearby Al al-Bayt University.

"Education is the way, especially if you live in a camp," said Alaa, one of just a few in her age group to finish high school. Most drop out, some because they cannot afford the university.

The camp has opened some new possibilities.

For hundreds of girls, life in Zaatari has meant a chance to play soccer. On a recent afternoon, about two dozen girls in headscarves practiced under the watch of coach Nour al-Dhaher.

Although al-Dhaher initially enrolled in a coaching course to support her family. Now she loves watching her players go from shy to outgoing.

"Shoot! Shoot!" al-Dhaher yelled from the bench, cradling another coach's baby.

## Hope For A Bright Future

For others, doors are closing.

There's been a rise in early marriages. Some families marry off girls in their mid-teens, often so they do not have to support them.

"Here you have to get married young because the situation is difficult," said Sabrine al-Masaad, who runs a bridal shop. One of her recent brides was just 14 years old.

All the while, a new generation of Syrians is born far from home.

Maan Turkman, 31, gave birth in her shelter recently because the ambulance was late. Hours later, twins Mohammed and Ahmed lay asleep in the camp clinic's bassinets, swaddled in blankets.

Asked for her hope for them, she said, "I wish them a bright future in Syria."
