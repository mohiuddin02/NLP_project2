RAMLE, Israel â€” Israel's school year has started, but not for thousands of Arab students. They are still on summer vacation.

The students all attend Christian schools, which are closed to protest a government decision to give the schools less money. Critics say Israel is treating the schools unfairly.

The Christian schools are attended mainly by Christian and Muslim Arabs. Christian school officials say Israel is trying to force them to join the public school system. They say this would weaken the schools' Christian values. It would also have a bad effect on education, they said.

## A Long Summer Vacation And Boredom

The Israeli government and Christian officials are trying to find a solution and end the strike. About 33,000 students have been on strike since Sept. 1. A strike is when people stay home from work or school to protest something they do not like. The Middle Eastern country has 47 Christian schools.

In the city of Ramle, the three Khoury children are waiting for school to start.

"I wake up every day late," said Bashar, who is 13 years old. "I watch TV, I play, there isn't much to do."

"I miss my friends and I miss my teachers," said Loucin. She is 10 and is supposed to be in fourth grade this year.

Christian and other private schools are not part of the public school system. Each school is in charge of itself. Still, private schools in Israel receive some money from the government. This money covers about three-quarters of a school's regular costs. Israel has begun to reduce the amount of money it gives to the schools. The government still pays for the regular costs but money towards other activities have been reduced.

## Arabs Suffering Under Government, Critics Say

Critics say the government is treating Arabs unfairly. About 1 in 5 Israeli citizens are Arab Christians and Muslims. The rest of Israel's citizens are mostly Jewish. Critics of the government point out that it pays all the costs for two large Jewish private school networks. Christians school officials say they do not have enough money to run the schools. They have been forced to charge parents more tuition. Some of the parents are poor.

Khader Khoury is the Khoury children's father. He said that racism is coming from the government, not the Israeli people. He said the Israeli government is treating the Jewish majority and the Arab minority differently. "This is clear, there isn't any other explanation," Khoury said.

He added that his children have been home for 21 days. They are bored, sad, not studying, and learning to be lazy, he said. "Our wish is that they go back to school. Still we won't stop and we will continue with the strike until we get our rights," he said.

## Members Of Community Join Protest

Community members have also protested the government's decision. Earlier this month about 2,500 people gathered outside the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.

The government said it has been meeting with representatives from the Christian community. It said the Christian representatives have turned down all of its offers to end the strike.

Wadie Abu Nasser, who is with a Christian church, said the talks are "not easy."

## Few Christians Live In Israel

Even though Christianity began in Israel, there are very few followers there. Currently, Christians are less than 2 in 100 people who make up the population of Israel and the Palestinian territories. East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip make up the Palestinian territories. Israel is in the middle and controls the West Bank, while Gaza is independent. There are about 150,000 Christian citizens of Israel, while an additional 50,000 Christians live in the eastern part of Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.

In other parts of the Middle East, Christians have been violently attacked. They have not experienced this kind of violence in Israel. Still, Israeli Christians say they are treated unfairly. They have problems finding jobs and places to live. Over the years, many Christians have left to seek better lives in other countries.
