PHILADELPHIA — Amy Clipston had a new request for her daughter's first-grade teacher.

Many parents had marched in to demand that their children, even those who could not tie their shoes yet, get more homework. Clipston was the first to request the opposite — that her daughter opt out of homework altogether.

"I felt my child was doing quite fine in school," said Clipston, a chemist with three children, noting that her daughter's school day in the highly competitive Lower Merion School District, in Pennsylvania, was already 6 1/2 hours, with a 20-minute recess. "I felt 10 to 20 minutes of homework a night was not accomplishing anything."

Her request, which the teacher approved, represented one small step for a movement slowly gaining power in schools around the country: questioning, scaling back or, in a handful of schools, even eliminating the nightly homework tradition once thought as all-American as junior proms and cafeteria food fights.

## Value Of Homework Debated

For decades, homework's value has been hotly debated.

But now a growing body of critics say the notion that America can close the learning gap with countries it competes against, like China or India, by stuffing kids' backpacks with math worksheets as early as kindergarten is backfiring. Instead, they say it is creating a nation of stressed-out, sleep-deprived children, despite scant scientific evidence they are actually learning more from the reams of homework.

Some school administrators are starting to listen. Radnor School District in Pennsylvania has unveiled a policy stating that homework should not "interfere with the student's health and well-being."

Several New Jersey districts are experimenting with banning take-home assignments on designated nights or weekends and school vacations.

An elementary school in Gaithersburg, Maryland, has banned homework altogether in favor of 30 minutes of nightly reading. And under the radar, parents such as Clipston — she says there are others in Lower Merion — are quietly opting their kids out of the daily grind.

## Life Balance Urged For Kids And Adults

That is all music to the ears of Vicki Abeles, who triggered widespread debate on test and homework pressure with her 2010 documentary "Race to Nowhere." She said educators should be seeking work-life balance for students just as some high-tech companies are doing for employees.

"A lot has been written about adults having real time off from the workday, and that it improves creativity and productivity," Abeles said. "We're doing the exact opposite with kids. It's insanity."

The anecdotal complaints from parents and teachers about the harmful impact of students emailing completed assignments at 3 a.m. or kids spending sunny weekend days indoors on a laptop are increasingly supported by scientific research. In 2013, a survey from the American Psychological Association, a professional and scientific organization, found that 45 percent of U.S. schoolchildren were stressed-out by school. Homework was the leading cause.

Many schools try to stick to 10 minutes for each grade level, but some, particularly private ones, load on a lot more. For example, St. Joseph School in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, has a policy of starting with 30 minutes for first and second grades up to 120 minutes for seventh and eighth grades.

"The kids are overwhelmed," said Tom Di Giulio, a Latin teacher at Cedarbrook Middle School in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania. "It's too much. I'm getting work sent in to me at 12 o'clock at night," sometimes 1 and 3 a.m.

## Repetitive Worksheets Criticized

Zach Masterman, 15, a sophomore at Lower Merion's Harriton High School, knows what Di Giulio is talking about. After putting in a full day of school, after-school activities and choir practice, he comes home and dives into three hours of homework nightly. "I'm really busy," he said. "I have a ton of things to do."

While high schoolers are expected to hit the books every night, Stephanie Brant, the Gaithersburg elementary school principal, said she was surprised when she initially got pushback from some parents when she eliminated homework.

They were worried, she said, that their kids wouldn't be prepared for middle school. But now, not only have other schools in her district dropped the worksheets, a middle school principal also thanked her for sending him devoted readers.

"We demand so much of our students during the day," said Brant. She says that often students do repetitive homework such as addition, and "the second you do one wrong problem, you're doing 25 wrong."

## A New Look At Traditional Homework

But conventions are hard to break. Cathy Hall, assistant head of school at elite Episcopal Academy in Pennsylvania, said teachers there are keenly aware of the potential problems with homework and are being "intentional" in what they assign students. Yet at a school that boasts of its admissions to top-notch Ivy League schools, time spent on homework is ultimately a personal decision, she said.

And in Lower Merion, opting out of homework — even with a teacher's blessing — is "a violation of policy," spokesman Doug Young said. "Homework is part of the school experience."

It doesn't have to be, say some critics.

Alfie Kohn, who wrote "The Homework Myth: Why Our Kids Get Too Much of a Bad Thing" a decade ago, said that numerous studies fail to find any link to improved learning.

There is questionable "academic benefit to homework at any age, especially in younger kids," Kohn argued.

What's more, he and Abeles argue, too much homework can cause considerable harm, raising levels of frustration, anxiety and family tension while robbing kids of time for imaginative play and outdoor exercise, and — most importantly — crushing the potential to get excited about learning.

More parents are asking the same questions. "Many feel homework has kind of taken over, especially at the high school level," said Cheryl Masterman, Zach's mother. "I just had a situation with my fifth-grader the other night, and he was up really late and totally freaking out and melting down."
