WASHINGTON — Harry S. McAlpin made history in February of 1944: Despite strong resistance, he became the first black reporter to cover a presidential news conference at the White House.

Time magazine and The New York Times noted the milestone. And Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who'd opened the White House doors after serious pleas from African-American publishers, greeted the reporter as he made his way over to the president's desk, telling him, "Glad to see you, McAlpin."

It was not a sentiment shared by McAlpin's fellow journalists, who were members of the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA). For a decade, they had denied black reporters the opportunity to attend the twice-weekly news conferences in the Oval Office.

Roosevelt's invitation did nothing to change their attitude. A member of the association told McAlpin he'd share notes from the news conference with him if he didn't attend — suggesting that if he did, someone could get hurt in the crush of reporters moving into the room.

## Breaking The Color Barrier

McAlpin "ever so politely declined the offer" and stepped into the White House. With that act, he broke the color barrier, said George Condon, a White House correspondent for the National Journal.

Condon, a former White House Correspondents' Association president, has been researching the group's not-entirely-honorable history in celebration of its hundredth anniversary this year.

Now, 70 years after doing all it could to block black reporters, the WHCA is looking to make amends by dedicating a scholarship for journalism students in McAlpin's name. McAlpin, who died in 1985, will be honored at the association's annual scholarship dinner on May 3.

"Harry McAlpin was a remarkable man. We honor his role as the first black reporter to cover a presidential press conference. And we acknowledge that he did that in spite of opposition from the White House Correspondents' Association of the time," said Steven Thomma, the current association president.

"Thanks to the work of Harry McAlpin, and men and women in the decades that followed, the White House press corps and the White House Correspondents' Association is a diverse chorus of faces and voices. The country is better for it," he said.

McAlpin's son, Sherman, calls his father's history-making White House assignment just one aspect of a life well-lived.

"He has been and continues to be my hero," Sherman McAlpin, who works for the Department of the Navy, said of his father. "If I accomplished one-tenth of what he accomplished in his life, I would be a total success."

Discrimination was a persistent challenge for McAlpin, his son said. As a young man, McAlpin hoped to study journalism at the University of Missouri, but he was barred because of his race. He ended up at the University of Wisconsin instead.

## Restricted Access

Similarly, it was a "hard road to try to get a black person into the White House correspondents' circle," Sherman McAlpin said. His father told him he was warned that at the White House news conference "someone might step on your foot" and a scuffle would follow.

Not missing a beat, his father had replied: "I always thought the White House press would be the cream of the crop. I can't imagine that would happen. But if it did, it would be the story of the year and I wouldn't want to miss it.' "

Admittance to the White House came only after a decade of pressure from black newspaper publishers and editors, who began making a case for attendance in 1933.

The White House Correspondents' Association served as the gatekeeper to White House events. The organization denied entreaties from black publications, often responding with nothing but silence.

Access was restricted. More than 200 reporters jostled to attend and the room could get crowded, Condon said. Admission was restricted to reporters for daily newspapers, and most of the black publications, including McAlpin's Chicago Defender, were weeklies.

McAlpin eventually sidestepped that obstacle when he began reporting for a coalition of newspapers, including the Atlanta Daily World, the only black daily.

Once over the threshold, McAlpin attended the briefings, asking Roosevelt about an issue close to black readers: the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC). Roosevelt established the FEPC to ban racial discrimination by defense companies that did any business with the U.S. government.

The FEPC was started during World War II, when huge numbers of jobs were being created making equipment and providing services for the military. Many employers were reluctant to integrate their workforces and Roosevelt's order helped blacks take part in the opportunity that the war provided.

## Never A Member

McAlpin scored another first when he was part of the press train traveling to the 1944 Democratic National Convention and was one of the few reporters allowed to cover White House funeral services for Roosevelt.

And he made his mark with President Harry S. Truman, asking the new president at his first news conference whether he could assure African-Americans that he'd consider their views as Roosevelt had.

"He was a good writer, a good reporter who paid attention to what his community cared about," Condon said.

But he was never a member of the White House Correspondents' Association.

"They blackballed him from ever joining the correspondents' association or attending the group's annual dinner," said Condon, who recommended creating the scholarship. "The president could break the color line for his press conferences, but he could not rewrite the WHCA's membership policies."

McAlpin left the White House beat in 1945. He later served as a Navy war correspondent before moving to Louisville, where he practiced law and was president of the local NAACP branch.

Sherman McAlpin said that his father, who'd died when he was 15, had instilled a belief in him that all men were created equal, but that he was often tested.

In an essay that aired sometime in the 1950s on Edward R. Murrow's "This I Believe" radio series, McAlpin spoke movingly of the struggles he faced as he confronted racism.

"To live by these beliefs, I have found it necessary to develop patience, to build courage, to pray for wisdom," McAlpin said.
