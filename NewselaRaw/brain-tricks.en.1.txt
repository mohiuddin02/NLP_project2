To the folks at UFO Sightings Daily, NASA images of Mars from its rovers is better than a candy shop. Every visit yields a new treat.

"Alien critter found on Mars, gazing at rover," reads the headline on a post published recently on the website that features what it claims to be pictures of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO). If you squint at the accompanying image you can almost see a tiny creature with spindly arms and a pumpkin-shaped head peering out from behind a rock.

Also spotted were two alien ships, a reptile head and a face looking up. And that's just from one photo.

"There is so much evidence of intelligent life in this NASA photo," says the post's author, Scott C. Waring. "It's really amazing that the public hasn't done this kind of research long ago."

## Our Brains Playing Games

Waring is hardly the only person to make such "discoveries." In August, certain corners of the Internet were excited over what appeared to be a crab crawling up a Martian cliff face, while in June, others saw a "levitating rock."

Ashwin Vasavada, who works on the Mars rover project, insists that NASA scientists are not trying to hide evidence of alien life.

"There is no group that would be happier to see such a thing," he said. "So far we haven't seen anything that is so obvious that it would be similar to what these claims are."

When humans look at chunks of space rock and piles of sand and "see" a crab, or a lizard, or an alien spaceship, they are being tricked, he said. Not by NASA, but by their own brains.

The phenomenon is called pareidolia. It explains why humans so often find images of Jesus in our food, the Virgin Mary in tree trunks, a man in the moon and pumpkin-headed aliens on Mars.

## Not So Supernatural

Rather than being supernatural, pareidolia is deeply biological. It stems from a skill humans have honed over millions of years of evolution. It is an instinctive ability to spot patterns and find the familiar. That skill is what enables people, without thinking, to recognize things that are important â€” the sight of a smiling face, the sound of an alarmed voice, the low growl of a predator.

Occasionally it leads people astray.

"We've evolved brains that think in these quick, dirty ways that are usually right, but at times can lead us to systematically be biased," Christopher French said in 2013. He is head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths University of London. "A classic example is the Stone Age guy standing there, scratching his beard, wondering whether that rustling in the bushes really is a saber-toothed tiger. You're much more likely to survive if you assume it's a saber-toothed tiger" and get out of there. Otherwise, you may end up as lunch, he said.

## The Brain's Survival Instinct

Pareidolia comes from the human brain's instinct to seek out meaning in ambiguous or unfamiliar images. That instinct is partly about survival. When it comes to the prospect of ending up as someone else's meal, it is usually better to be safe than sorry. It is also partly social. Humans are particularly primed to find faces in unfamiliar places because the ability to recognize a facial expression is so essential to being human. Humans need to know how to understand those around them and interpret their cues. As scientist Carl Sagan wrote in "The Demon-Haunted World."

"As soon as the infant can see, it recognizes faces, and we now know that this skill is hardwired in our brains. Those infants who a million years ago were unable to recognize a face smiled back less, were less likely to win the hearts of their parents, and less likely to prosper. These days, nearly every infant is quick to identify a human face, and to respond with a goony grin," Sagan said.

People who claim to find religious icons in potato chips or aliens in NASA photographs are often mocked, but psychologists say all people think this way. A 2014 study in the journal Cortex found that this to be the case. Participants "saw" faces or letters in abstract images nearly 40 percent of the time when told that half of the photos contained more than just pure noise.

"Human brains are uniquely wired to recognize faces, so that even when there's only a slight suggestion of facial features, the brain automatically interprets it as a face," said Kang Lee. He is a psychologist at the University of Toronto and a co-author of the Cortex article.

Lee and colleagues found that an area of the brain called the right fusiform gyrus was activated when the participants thought they saw a face.

## We Want To See Things

Scientists still don't entirely understand how that process works, but they know that it is linked to dyslexia, a learning disorder that affects the brain's ability to read letters and numbers. It is also linked to synesthesia, the phenomenon that allows people to "taste" words or associate numbers with colors, and prosopagnosia, a disorder that affects the ability to recognize faces. Even when this area is working completely normally, it can lead people to see things that are not really there.

Of course, pareidolia isn't only our brain's fault.

"(It) is telling you more about what's happening with your expectations and how you're interpreting the world based on your expectations rather than anything that's necessarily in the toast," Sophie Scott, a neuroscientist at University College London, told the BBC in 2013. "It's an incredibly strong demonstration of how powerful these perceptual effects are. We really want to see things like faces, we really want to hear things like voices, and our perceptual system will set out to do that."
