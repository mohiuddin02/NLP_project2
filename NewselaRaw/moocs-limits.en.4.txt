PHILADELPHIA â€” Free open online courses are a hot thing in education. They're called MOOCs. That stands for Massive Open Online Courses. The courses have attracted millions of viewers. But not many people finish the classes.

The University of Pennsylvania is a leader in MOOCs. But the school's own study showed that the classes are having mixed results.

Education costs have been going through the roof. MOOCs have been promoted as a possible way to make education cheaper. Yet only 4 out of every 100 students actually complete the courses. This was discovered in a study by the University of Pennsylvania.

Many who sign up drop off after the first week or two, the study found. About half who signed up viewed one lecture or more.

## A Million Users Studied

Penn had released a different study last month. It showed that most people taking MOOCs already have college degrees. People are taking the courses mainly to get ahead in their jobs.

It was thought that MOOCs would help poor people get degrees. This doesn't seem to be happening.

"The technology offers some promise of a new approach" both for lowering costs and getting more education to poor people, said Laura Perna. She helped run the new study. But she said no one knows yet how well it will actually work.

The study looked at 1 million users. They registered for 16 free courses offered from June 2012 to June 2013. The classes were taught by Penn professors. They were held online.

The study looked at when users enter and leave courses. It also looked at when and how they take part in the classes. The courses varied in the use of quizzes and homework as well as instruction time. Some students took courses with smaller workloads. They were slightly more likely to complete the course.

Most courses focused on learning to improve yourself or learning new job skills. One such class was on how to save someone who is having a heart attack.

Perna said she was a bit surprised by the results.

"I didn't expect it to be quite this low," she said of the number who completed the courses.

## Classes For Fun Or Job Skills

But Ed Rock disagrees. He runs Penn's MOOC classes. He called the findings "entirely unsurprising and not at all troubling." There are 1.6 million current users of MOOCs. Yes, only 4 out of every 100 people complete them. But, that is still 80,000 people.

Rock says that "80,000 people is a huge number to educate."

He also said those who did not complete the courses had gotten something from the experience.

Most MOOC users are learning for fun or to get ahead in their jobs. So it's not surprising that few finish, said Cathy Sandeen. She's with the American Council on Education.

She says there is a place for MOOCs to help people get degrees. But it's probably smaller than expected, she added.

Rock said that educators have a way to go in learning how to fit MOOCs into the educational mission. So, Penn has partnered with 10 high schools. Teachers in those schools are using a Penn course in addition to classroom learning.

"Our hope is our material will be of value. We won't know that unless (high school teachers) try it out and tell us," he said. He thinks the classes could change education for the better. "But they're only going to work in a partnership," he said.

Perna agreed that MOOCs could benefit society. She mentioned the case of a neighbor who is taking an online class with co-workers. Each week they meet to discuss what they've learned.

"I think there is something there," she said. But we need to understand better what MOOCs' place is in education, she said.
