For Tatars, an ethnic group with deep roots in Crimea, the terms are strongly associated with Adolf Hitler's Germany and Josef Stalin's secret police. Together they bring back dark memories of war, exile, deprivation and death.

Last week's Russian takeover of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine, however, brought history flooding back to many Tatars. It reminded them of the Nazi occupation of Crimea during World War II and then the Soviet deportation of the entire Tatar people. Stalin, the head of the Soviet Union, accused the Tatars of being traitors and forcibly uprooted them.

"If somebody tells me today that another deportation is possible, I would tell him that he is an idiot and nothing of the kind can happen again," said Jafer Abdulkerimov. He is a frail 81-year-old man with bright eyes, a steady voice and a sound memory.

"But then again, if somebody had told me before last week that another occupation of our land by a foreign army is possible, I would have told him he was an idiot too," Abdulkerimov added.

## Violence And Tragedy

Few are seriously suggesting that Russia's military presence in Crimea means another deportation. So far, the occupation has not been violent. But Tatars, who are mostly Muslim, fear the consequences of Russian nationalism in the region. The Crimea is a Ukrainian republic with a large ethnic Russian population, which is angry about the ouster of Ukraine's Russian-leaning president, Viktor Yanukovych.

In February, Yanukovych, who was close to Russia, fled the capital after a series of violent protests against his government. A pro-Western government took over, and then Russia invaded part of Ukraine.

"As Moscow once again intends to gain control over the (Crimean) peninsula, the Tatars become the most (helpless) people in Crimea," said Mustafa Dzhemilev. He is a Crimean Tatar activist and member of the Ukrainian parliament. The Tatars support the Western-leaning government and the territorial unity of Ukraine, he said.

As with so many groups in this part of the world, the history of Crimean Tatars is steeped in violence and tragedy.

There are many examples in the history of the Crimean Tatars that are similar to current events, said Gulnara Abdulayeva, a Crimean Tatar historian and television anchor.

In 1783, Russia took over the Crimean Tatars' kingdom. Repression and deportation followed, and over the next half century, more than 600,000 Tatars were forced to leave, Abdulayeva said.

The modern Russian soldiers will most likely be forced to end their occupation and leave the Crimea, she said. "But our people are traditionally ready to prepare themselves for the worst."

## Trip To Hell Recalled

Abdulkerimov remembers every detail of his family's ordeal during World War II, which he calls a trip to hell. On May 18, 1944, Jafer, his two brothers and his mother were awakened at 5 a.m., along with hundreds of other Tatar families in his village. They were put into trucks and then a cargo train. Eventually, they were loaded onto a barge that took them northward on a river for more than a week.

Huddled below deck, the deportees saw daylight only when a door was opened to dump a dead woman overboard.

"Women and children were crying and wailing while old men were praying," Abdulkerimov said. "We all thought they would sink the barge with us in it."

More than 600 of about 5,000 Tatars died of starvation, exposure and disease during the first two years in the frozen woods of Siberia. Adults were put to work cutting pine trees for timber, and children tried to survive on a few ounces of stale bread a day.

Of about 200,000 Crimean Tatars deported by Stalin in 1944, up to 40 percent died within two years.

Abdulkerimov returned with tens of thousands of other Tatars in 1990. He built the home where he still lives in a suburb of Simferopol, a major city in Crimea. He fears that Russian troops and local Russian nationalists will lash out at the Crimean Tatars, who now make up 260,000 of Crimea's population of almost 2 million.

Contributing to that fear was the Crimean parliament's appointment last week of a Russian nationalist, Sergei Aksenov, as its new head of government. The parliament will hold a vote this month to determine whether Crimea should be a part of Russia.

## Tatars Patrol Their Streets

In December, Aksenov reportedly led a group of Russian nationalists who rioted through an area on the outskirts of Simferopol, where dozens of Crimean Tatars were building homes. The attackers destroyed many of the buildings with sledgehammers and crowbars, Dzhemilev said.

"Who will prevent them from doing something totally absurd like voting to expel us from our motherland once again?" Dzhemilev said.

Russian nationalists say that the Tatars want to create a separate Tatar nation on Ukrainian territory.

"The Tatars should watch their step now," said Alexander Zhilkin, who carried a Russian national flag to protest the presence of the Ukrainian army. "Now that our people are in power here we won't allow any separatism inside our republic."

A pro-Russian Crimean parliament member said the Tatars are not in danger.

The parliament member, Vladimir Konstantinov, also promised the Tatar community power that "they had never enjoyed before."

The residents of Abdulkerimov's sprawling Tatar community, though, patrol the streets at night, fearing attacks by Russian nationalists.

"When they deported my father's and mother's families in 1944, all our grown men were at the front and couldn't protect them," said Emir Shevkiev, a member of the local Tatar community. "We are here and we will fight back."
