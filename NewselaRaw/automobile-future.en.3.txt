PALO ALTO, Calif. — Ford Motor Company, a carmaker, has been in Detroit, Michigan, since it began in 1903. Now it has set up a center in Palo Alto, in the northern part of California. That area is known as Silicon Valley. There are many high-tech companies in the Valley. It got its nickname from silicon, the material used to make some high-tech computer parts.

Dragos Maciuca is the head of Ford's center in Palo Alto. Before he worked for Ford, he worked for the Apple computer company. Software, the programs that make computers run, has become a more important part of carmaking. Because of this, the move to Silicon Valley makes sense, he said.

There are 100 workers at the center. They are studying how people deal with machines, like cars. They are testing self-driving vehicles. The cars are driven by computers, not humans. 

Ford's new center opened in January. It is just one example of the growing move of carmakers to California. Other auto companies with Valley offices include Toyota, Honda and BMW.

## Trying To Help The Environment

"We have the best software engineers in the country, and the most of them," said Pasquale Romano, who is the head of ChargePoint. ChargePoint builds electric car charging stations. California has all the parts it needs to be "the next Detroit," he said.

The move of car companies to California should not really be a surprise. The state leads in making self-driving cars, auto software and "green" vehicles. The word "green" can be used to describe something that is better for the environment. California cares about protecting its air and water, and the money it offers to green car companies has helped the companies to grow.

California has long been important to carmaking and selling. Californians buy more cars than people in any other state in the United States. California is a center of style and is home to designers for Honda, Toyota and other carmakers.

The state is also the birthplace of the taxi companies Uber and Lyft. Both let users order a taxi through a cellphone app. Partnerships between tech and car companies might soon lead to a time when riders can order driverless taxis.

## More Jobs Created In State

The move to Silicon Valley by auto companies means more jobs, too. About 10,000 new auto jobs have been created there since 2011. There are now about 47,000.

With all that, the number of automotive workers there is still small compared with Michigan. The Michigan city of Detroit has more than 326,00 auto workers.

California has other challenges, too. Workers and land cost more there than in many other states. Some companies have moved some offices to states where those things cost less money.

Toyota is the world's largest car company. It is moving almost 3,000 jobs from California to Plano, Texas, over the next two years. Five years ago, Toyota closed a factory it operated in California together with General Motors. General Motors makes cars including Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick. About 4,700 workers lost their jobs.

## Some Companies Move To Nevada

Other companies have moved to Nevada. That state offers money to companies who move there. 

Still, Tesla, an electric car maker, and other electric car companies are adding jobs in California. Tesla builds cars that do not need gas. They can be charged by being plugged in, like a phone. The growth of car technology centers, and the jobs that come with them, shows no sign of slowing.

Tesla now owns the California factory once owned by Toyota. 

As cars become more and more-high tech, carmaking is changing, said Bill Hampton, who runs AutoBeat Daily. AutoBeat Daily is an online report for people in the auto business.

"You're getting way far away from bending metal and bolting cars together," Hampton said.
