John Forbes Nash Jr. roamed for years through Princeton University's math building. In empty classrooms, the "Phantom of Fine Hall," as Nash was known, muttered to himself and scribbled mysterious equations on chalkboards.

A lonely figure, Nash suffered from schizophrenia, a severe mental disease. He was unable to recognize what was real from what was false. He once turned down a job at the University of Chicago, saying he was about to be named Emperor of Antarctica.

Yet Nash was also a genius. He was a Nobel Prize winner who transformed the field of economics, the study of how money and wealth are produced and used. He was also known as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time.

His life inspired the 2001 Oscar-winning film, "A Beautiful Mind."

## Mathematics And Economics

Nash, 86, and his wife, Alicia, 82, died Saturday in a traffic accident on a New Jersey highway. They were riding in a taxi cab, returning to their Princeton home from Norway where he had won a prize in mathematics.

Nash was famous among mathematicians for his elegant solutions to many different problems. He was more widely known, though, for his work in economics.

He won the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics for his contributions to game theory, the mathematical study of decision-making. His work has been critically important to nuclear weapons talks, business and trade negotiations and elections.

Nash completed his paper on game theory when he was just 21. It was only 27 pages long, but the consequences of what came to be called "the Nash equilibrium" were huge.

Game theory was invented in the 1940s by mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern. The two were interested in "zero-sum" games — the kind with a winner who takes all and a loser who gets nothing.

Nash found ways to figure out a sweet spot — the Nash equilibrium. It allowed each side in an argument to get the best deal possible. Business owners and workers have used the Nash equilibrium in complicated contract talks, and nuclear superpowers have used it to keep world peace.

## Conflict And Cooperation

Nash's understanding of human rivalry — his theory of conflict and cooperation — was one of the most influential ideas of the 20th century, Sylvia Nasar wrote. The movie about Nash was based on Nasar's 1999 biography of Nash, "A Beautiful Mind." He transformed economics, Nasar wrote.

Nash was born June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia. When Nash was in fourth grade, his parents were told their son had no ability in math. He would always get the right answers, but approached the problems in off-the-wall ways that weren't in the textbook.

He graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh in three years with both bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics. Normally this would take about six years.

At Princeton, where he earned his doctorate at age 22, Nash seldom attended class and annoyed other students by constantly whistling classical music. He quickly developed a reputation for arrogance. After just a few weeks on campus, he asked to meet with Princeton's most famous professor, Albert Einstein.

In Einstein's office, Nash told Einstein some of his ideas on gravity, friction and radiation. After an hour, Einstein told him, "You had better study some more physics, young man."

## Lost His Grip On Reality

When Nash was 30, Fortune magazine singled him out as one of America's most brilliant mathematicians. In 1957, he married Alicia Larde, a physics student from El Salvador, and the two had a son in 1959.

However, by then he had lost his grip on reality.

At one point, he pointed to a front-page newspaper story and told his stunned co-workers that aliens were sending coded messages for him.

In 1959, he was suspended by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught, and spent time in a psychiatric hospital. He then wandered around Europe, trying to give up his U.S. citizenship and become a citizen of the world.

Although Alicia divorced him in 1962, she cared for him over the years in her home. Professors at Princeton, when they learned of Nash's illness, arranged a job for him on campus.

In the 1980s, Nash began to recover from his mental illness. He started having discussions with other scholars about math again, and some of his former co-workers began a campaign to nominate him for the Nobel Prize.

## The Struggle Of Mental Illness

After winning the Nobel in 1994, he appeared to be a changed man.

"Recognition is a cure for many ills," said Harold Kuhn, a Princeton mathematician and friend.

"A Beautiful Mind," which starred Russell Crowe, did not follow the exact story of Nash's life. It was praised, though, for how it showed the struggle of mental illness.

Alicia and John Nash remarried in 2001.

Their son is also a mathematician with schizophrenia. In recent years, John and Alicia met with New Jersey state officials to urge them to give more money for programs to treat people with mental health problems.
