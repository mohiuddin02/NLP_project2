KABUL, Afghanistan -- Mohammad Aziz Ayob adjusts his Boy Scout neckerchief, leans over and plants a sapling into the dry Kabul soil. Two helicopters pass overhead, the clack-clack clack-clack of their blades echoing off the neighboring mountains.

It may seem dangerous for young boys to wear matching uniforms in a war zone. But Afghan Scout leaders say the organization has a lot to offer. They believe community service is badly needed in a country that's suffered years of war and violence. So is learning to rely on yourself.

Ayob, orphaned as a child and raised by his aunt, can barely afford to attend high school. He worries about finding a job. Such worries disappear when he puts on his Scouting shirt. "I love my uniform; it makes me feel proud," said Ayob, 18. "Scouts are like my family."

The Scout motto is "Be Prepared." This has a special meaning here. In Afghanistan, Scouts risk death to attend meetings, and learn how to spot roadside bombs in first aid class.

## Girl Scouts Less Visible

Because of the dangers of suicide bombers, Girl Scouts are much less visible. The girls volunteer in hospitals, for example, rather than working outside. Camping and hiking are restricted to boys.

Mohammad Tamim Hamkar, Afghan Scouting's program manager, said that "it's hard to let the girls do everything."

Girls often make better Scouts than boys, organizers say. That's because girls have to grab any chances they can get in a country that is dominated by men and boys. Keith Blackey, 68, is an American helping the Scouts in Afghanistan.

He said that some girls get confidence from wearing a Scout uniform. "It's like a superhero putting on a cape," he said.

## A Hard History In Afghanistan

Scouting has sometimes been impossible to do in Afghanistan. The movement was introduced in 1931. But it has been banned several times by different governments. And sometimes, Scouts were even told  to spy on their parents.

A charity called Parsa supported the Afghan Scouts in 2009. Parsa sees the organization as a way to teach leadership to children, and prevent them from getting recruited by extremist groups.

There are Scout groups in six of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Most of these places are too dangerous for international visitors. Hamkar said that some of the Scout uniforms are very old. Some Scouting books are unfinished. There is very little money to go around.

At the moment, Scouting in Afghanistan is fully paid for by foreign grants. Still, it is difficult to train and look after local staff.

The program now has 1,062 members, 40 percent of them girls, and it hopes to have 1,500 Scouts signed up by the end of the year.

## Afghan Scouting At Risk

Extremists in Afghanistan see any involvement with foreign countries as treason. The Scout movement is linked to the Western world. This could mean danger for Afghan scouts if there is further trouble in the country. In 2014, soldiers from the U.S. and its allies will withdraw from Afghanistan. No one is sure what will happen after that.

"If things get ugly, anything with an international connection could be targeted," said Marnie Gustavson. Gustavson is Parsa's executive director. So Scout organizers are working hard to place Scouts into normal Afghan life.

In Ghor province, a Scout's volunteer work includes cleaning mosques. This shows that the organization is not trying to threaten traditions in Afghanistan. Blackey said Scouting is not promoting a different religion. "We're teaching them the same things their parents are," the adviser added.

## Will The Dark Years Return?

Afghan Scouting is making progress. But it is still years away from official recognition by the rest of the world's scouts.

During the dark years in Afghanistan, loyal Scouts were forced to hide their uniforms. "I was too scared to wear mine, even alone in my room," said training commissioner Mustafa. "Sometimes I'd peek in the drawer, though, and remember better times."

Mike Farrar, an American who helps train Afghan Scouts, said the program is invaluable.

"I never went to a Scout meeting where I had to wear a flak jacket and carry a weapon," he said. "If the Taliban comes back, obviously Scouting goes away. But if the Taliban doesn't, Afghanistan will embrace it."
