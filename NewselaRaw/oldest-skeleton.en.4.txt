Sometime soon, pieces of a very important skeleton will be reburied. The bones are the remains of a young boy. Scientists believe he lived in what is now Montana about 12,600 years ago.

The bits of the young boy's skeleton are special: They are the only human remains linked to a group of people called the Clovis. The group were ancestors of many [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) living today.

The bones were discovered in Western Montana by a construction worker in 1968.

When they were found, the bones were covered in red ochre. Scientists believe the powdered mineral was used during a funeral ceremony. Along with them were 125 tools made from stone and horn.

## Over Ancient Land Bridge

Scientists have already sequenced the genome of the boy: That is, they have studied the genes found in his bones. They believe he was between 1 and 1Â½ years old when he died.

The boy's bones can tell us a lot. They provide evidence of how humans first came to North America.

Most scientists believe that the Clovis people's ancestors came from Asia. It is thought that they got here over an ancient land bridge.

Some scientists support another theory, however: They believe the ancestors of the Clovis came from southwestern Europe.

The new study shows that the second idea is probably wrong.

"The ancestors of this boy originated from Asia," said scientist Michael Waters. And that suggests something else: The first Americans probably did not come from Europe.

## Suggests Single Migration

The boy's remains are genetically related to most modern Native Americans. He is especially like those living in Central and South America.

This suggests that most of the original population of the Americas came in a single migration, Waters said. The American continent was most likely first settled "around 15,000 years ago." This was at the close of the last ice age. The Clovis people came around 2,000 years later.

Eske Willerslev led the study. He met with several Native American tribes in Montana. Scientists and Native American groups haven't always gotten along well. So he wasn't sure what to expect at first.

"They showed a lot of interest in the study," Willerslev said. "But all of them said that now is the time for the skeleton to go back into the ground."

He added, "This was a heart blow. Being a scientist, reburying probably the most important skeleton in the history of the Americas, it's hard."

But Willerslev said it was a sacrifice that science had to make.

"We need to respect that they feel very strongly about this," he said.

## Clovis Stone Spear Points

The Clovis people are known for their unusual stone spear points. These have a slit cut into them. This slit allows them to be attached to a wooden spear or dart.

Waters said the Clovis died out about 12,600 years ago. This was around the same time the boy was buried.

Some of the tools buried with the boy were made of elk antlers. Antlers are the large horns of male elk and other deer. Back then, they were very precious. The tools date to the beginnings of the Clovis people, about 13,000 years ago. So, they were 400 years old when the boy was buried.

The difference in age, Waters said, suggests the antler tools were kept for generations. And that they were important objects. "They were something special," he said.

One of the scientists, Shane Doyle, is a member of the Crow tribe. He acted as the go-between for scientists and Native American tribes.

Doyle told reporters the child's remains would be reburied soon: this spring or summer. He also thanked the scientists for involving Native American tribes.

This discovery shows "what tribes have really never doubted," Doyle said. "We've been here" from the beginning. All the "objects in the ground" are from "our direct ancestors."
