SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. â€” Just over a year ago, Hamlet Garcia climbed up the steps of a courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, wondering if he would be sent to jail.

The resident of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his wife, Olesia, an insurance agent, were about to go on trial for theft of services, an offense usually reserved for cable service pilferers and restaurant bill dodgers. Their alleged crime: stealing an education for their 8-year-old daughter, Fiorella.

He was staring at possibly seven years behind bars.

Garcia, who came to the United States from Cuba when he was 18, remembers thinking one thing as he headed into the courthouse: "This isn't the kind of thing that happens in America."

## "Education Theft" Crackdown, And Race

Their case is one of a handful in recent years in which families living in districts with failing schools have been accused of "stealing an education." Some have been heavily fined for lying about where they live on official district documents. Others have been criminally charged and, in some cases, jailed.

Such severe measures are helping to popularize a new term: "education theft." It's not clear how many school districts are cracking down on enrollment fraud. But civil rights groups and education activists say anecdotal evidence suggests these practices may be on the rise.

"I'm hearing about it more and more every year," said Gloria Romero, a former California state senator and founder of the California Center for Parent Empowerment.

The examples are many. And while perhaps extreme, they are worrying civil rights activists, parent advocacy groups and some local politicians. They say strict enforcement strategies unfairly impact poor families of color. Poor families cannot easily pay their way out of trouble by refunding the value of their children's allegedly stolen schooling.

## Rich Schools, Poor Schools, And Quality

Jonah Edelman, the CEO of Stand for Children, a national education advocacy group, says that his group is not in favor of parents breaking the law.

"But the real crime, which needs to be prosecuted, is the glaring inequity in the quality of schools in rich areas versus poor ones," he said.

In the case of the Garcias, the father says that during the 2011-2012 school year, he and his wife had problems in their marriage and temporarily separated. During that time, his wife and daughter spent nine months living with his wife's father in Lower Moreland, Pennsylvania, a quaint suburban township. His daughter attended the district's much sought-after elementary school, where she read picture books, learned the alphabet and made friends.

The local prosecutor says Garcia and his wife were never truly separated and that they always lived in neighboring northwestern Philadelphia, where many of the schools are struggling. He says they lied to gain entry into the Lower Moreland schools.

They "essentially stole from every hard-working taxpayer" who lives in the school district, said prosecutor Risa Vetri Ferman.

The couple agreed to pay nearly $11,000 in back tuition in exchange for no charges against Olesia Garcia and a reduced charge and fine for her husband. Legal fees ran about $70,000. They are hoping to send their daughter to a private school.

## Mom Goes To Jail

In 2011, Kelley Williams-Bolar, a special education aide in Akron, Ohio, spent nine days in jail for sending her two daughters to a school in the high-performing school district where her father lived.

This winter, the school district in Orinda, California, a wealthy town near San Francisco, made national headlines after officials hired an investigator to spy on the 7-year-old daughter of a local nanny suspected of living in another town. It was later discovered the girl lived near the school in the home of her mother's employers. She was allowed to stay in the school, after her mother agreed to make the couple she worked for official caregivers.

Boston public schools have a tip line for parents to expose students they suspect are lying about where they live. And the Bayonne school district, in northern New Jersey, promises parents a $200 bounty when they provide information that leads to a student being kicked out.

Parent rights organizations that seek to protect parents from discriminatory actions say they are increasingly finding themselves advocating for parents who have been targeted by school districts that are cracking down.

In Michigan, parents convicted of providing false documents to satisfy student residency requirements can be jailed for up to 20 days. In Washington, D.C., they can get up to 90 days for providing false documentation, and in Oklahoma, the jail sentence can be up to a year.

"It's a 'gotcha' thing," said Gwen Samuel, the founder of the Connecticut Parents Union, which has helped to support a handful of families that have been criminally charged for enrollment fraud. "What's troubling now is the length that districts are willing to go. You see residency officers more than ever, and this practice of treating families like they've robbed a bank. It has become the norm to treat them like criminals."

## The Power Of Publicity

During her time as a state senator, Romero authored a 2010 California law. It permits parents of students attending one of a thousand California schools identified as poor performing to transfer their children into higher quality schools anywhere in the state, if there is space.

California's Department of Education does not keep track of how many families make use of the law, but Romero says many parents aren't aware of it.

"A lot of parents think they are trapped in these zones," she said.

Around the country, parent groups are fighting back: by publicizing the cases and lobbying against jail time. The groups argue that school residency laws are unconstitutional because they discriminate against parents in struggling school districts.

"The real issue is how do we provide quality schools for all children so parents don't have to make decisions that ultimately break the law," said Ryan Smith, director of The Education Trust-West, a foundation that works to improve schools in poor communities.
