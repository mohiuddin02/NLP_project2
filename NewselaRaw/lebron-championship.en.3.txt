In July, basketball superstar LeBron James rejoined his home team.

The words of President Theodore Roosevelt guided him back.

In 1910, a year after Roosevelt left the White House, he gave a famous speech in Paris, France. Roosevelt said that it is easy to criticize and point out what someone else should have done. Roosevelt said it is better to try and fail than never try at all.

"The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood," Roosevelt said. "If he fails, at least (he) fails while daring greatly."

James thought about Roosevelt's words during and after the 2010-2011 basketball season. The season was his first with the Miami Heat. James was criticized for leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he got his start, and joining the Miami team. In Miami, James posted Roosevelt's words on his locker in large letters.

## Back Wearing No. 23

On July 12, James, who is 29, went back to the Cavaliers. He was soon wearing his familiar No. 23 Cavaliers basketball shirt. Basketball insiders think James went back to help get the Cavaliers their first National Basketball Association (NBA) championship.

"He left (Cleveland) to win a championship," said James Jones, one of James' closest basketball allies. The Miami Heat won two NBA championships while James was there.

The only thing missing, Jones said, was the chance to win one at home.

"LeBron is very driven and he takes that challenge seriously," he said.

"Even if it's not what other people thought or expected, he expects to be the guy to bring a championship to Cleveland," Jones said.

James was born in Akron, Ohio. He said he knew he could win even more championships in Miami. He sacrificed that to go back home and help his old team win. Cleveland has never won even one NBA championship.

"What's funny is the team was a small [part] of me coming back," James said. "It had nothing much to do with the team. It was more about these fans and the city and the people here."

## Playing For His Hometown Team

On July 11, James announced he wanted to return to the Cavaliers. The same day, the Cavaliers sold out of season tickets.

When the lunch crowd at the Harry Buffalo sports bar heard the news, the place exploded. They celebrated as if the Cavaliers had already won a championship.

The night James left Cleveland for Miami, "people in here were running into the streets crying and screaming," said Caitlin Cassidy, manager of the sports bar. "When he announced he was coming back, people did not go back to work."

Tyson Chandler is a basketball player with the Dallas Mavericks. He won a gold medal with James in the 2012 Olympics. Chandler said there are not many players that start so young and understand how important they are to their team and city.  "With that comes a lot of responsibility and he's never (avoided) it," Chandler said.

Some players don't like to play for their hometown team. James, though, loves it.

"It takes a special player to be able to do that," said Milwaukee Bucks coach Jason Kidd. "But if there is someone who can do it, he can."

## Carrying Cavs To Glory

There was a time when all James wanted to do was win a championship. He foolishly proclaimed the Heat would win "not five, not six, not seven" championships. That was before he truly understood how difficult it was to win just one.

"It's the hardest thing you can ever do in your basketball career," James says now.

Chandlers knows that deep down James wants to bring a championship to Cleveland.

"I'm pretty sure that's why he came back," Chandler said. "He felt like it was the right thing to do."

James stopped caring what others thought about the time he started listening to the words of Roosevelt's speech.

To use Roosevelt's words, the dust is on James' face. The sweat is on his brow. The most powerful man in the NBA will soon discover whether he's strong enough to carry his hometown team to glory.
