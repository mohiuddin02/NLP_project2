High school students in Virginia are learning how to handle their money.

Virginia started to offer more classes about money after the Great Recession. The recession happened from 2007 to 2009. The number of jobs in the United States shrank during that time. People had less money.

The classes are called personal-finance courses. Virginia students have to take one to pass high school.

## Avoiding Parents' Money Mistakes

Many parents had money problems during the recession. Virginia wanted students to avoid those mistakes. The classes will teach them to be smart about their money.

A 2012 study looked at what teenagers in 18 countries knew about money. U.S. teenagers were in the bottom half. They knew less than teenagers in Russia and China. 

Now 17 states make high school students take personal-finance courses. Only seven states did in 2007.

Many people in Northern Virginia did not want students to have to take the class. They thought each school should decide what classes are taught. Students were also already very busy. Some people worried about making them take another class.

## From Mad To Glad

Some students at John Champe High School were not happy. The school is a very good school. Almost all of its students graduated last year.

Jisoo Jang is a student at Champe. She was angry that she had to take the class. Now, she likes what she learned. She learned how credit cards work. She also learned about how people can cheat you out of your money.

The class is taught by Mary Doherty. Her students learn about things they need to know for their whole lives. Many already have jobs. They will get help filing tax forms for the first time. When people earn money, they give some of it to the government by paying taxes. Roads, schools and parks are among the things that are paid for by taxes.

## Credit Cards And College Costs

The students will learn about problems that could come with using credit cards. They also are taught to plan ahead about using their money.

They will learn about how to borrow money for college. They will discover how much college costs.

The high school students will learn about different ways to save money for retirement, too. Retirement comes when you are older and stop working.

The class shows many students what things really cost.

Toni Fasan is another teacher. She used to be a banker. She said the biggest surprise for students is learning how much raising a family costs. One student guessed it would cost a family of $75 in a month. It costs much, much more.
