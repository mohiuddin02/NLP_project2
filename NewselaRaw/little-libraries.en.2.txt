CHICAGO — On a recent afternoon, a group of children gathered around a blue and white box full of free books on Eve Pulver-Johnson's front lawn in Aurora, Ill. They peeked inside and some grabbed a book to go.

"The kids are excited about it," Eve said. She believes her Little Free Library is the first in her hometown. "It's really fun to see them digging through and looking for something" they are interested in.

Who knows? Maybe someone put one of Mo Willem's popular children's books inside.

Little Free Libraries are handmade structures filled with books for children and adults. It started a free books movement that has spread onto lawns around the world. Little Free Libraries are designed and decorated by their owners, and generally contain about 20 to 100 books. They stand on lawns, in parks and gardens, even in coffee shops where people passing by can "take a book, leave a book."

## Little Works Of Art

Little Free Libraries began in Wisconsin in 2009. The feeling of community they create is as important as how the libraries encourage people to read, said co-founder Rick Brooks of Madison, Wis. Interest in the libraries only seems to be speeding up, he said. Brooks and co-founder Todd Bol, another Wisconsin resident, predict there will be at least 15,000 Little Free Libraries in 55 countries by the end of the year.

"It's always amazing," Brooks said.

Book lovers can find little libraries in their area online at www.littlefreelibrary.org.

The libraries themselves look like large dollhouses or birdhouses.

"Some are stunningly beautiful," Brooks said. "Others are clever, funny or so skillfully painted that they are like sculptures more than just boxes of books."

But just because you take a book doesn't mean you have to leave one, Brooks said. Most people do leave one, though, so that there will always be enough books, as well as a good selection.

Eve's little two-story library — with books for adults on the top shelf and children's books below — was a birthday present from her dad. Her mother, Karen Pulver, said people come to their free library every day.

"I have talked to a number of parents who say that's often their destination on their walk, to bring a book or take a book," said Pulver, who is a librarian. "It's handy. It's a good incentive to read."

## The Self-Made Librarian

Martha Martinez enjoys visiting the library at a nearby home with her 8-year-old daughter, Barbara, who loves to read. Barbara was on the lookout for "The Cat Who …" mystery books.

"This is a very beautiful idea and it's very nice of them to offer it for the neighborhood," Martha said. "The kids are always excited to see what's in there, but it's actually nice for all of us."

Mary Anne Mohanraj frequently sees adults stop at her blue-and-purple Little Free Library in Oak Park, Ill., on their way to the train.

Now an English professor and writer, she remembers that the public library was her haven as a child.

"I wanted to be a librarian when I was a kid … well, until a librarian told me that librarians don't get to read all the time," she said. "Luckily, English professors have to read."

So many people check the box on her lawn that the books change almost every day, she said.

"We get a good mix of books," she said. "Popular fiction tends to go the fastest."

## Connecting People Through Books

Mohanraj, who tends a flower garden around her library, enjoys neighborly chats with people who stop by. These encounters are one of the best things about Little Free Libraries, Brooks said.

"It's about relationships as much as it is about the books and the box," said Brooks. That sense of community is very important, he added.

"It's a great tool for promoting literacy, reading and public libraries. But we have a yearning for a good feeling about neighbors and living in a society where we are not alone," Brooks said.

Little Free Libraries began when Bol, a retired teacher, built the first one in the form of a miniature schoolhouse. It was a memorial to his mother, who was a teacher. Now Madison and the Minneapolis-St. Paul area are little library hot spots, each hosting about 1,000 Little Free Libraries.

The idea has spread around the world. El Paso, Texas, for instance, has more than 60 little libraries. In Seattle, bicycle tours take people from library to library. Outside the U.S., there are many little libraries in countries such as Italy, Ghana and Ukraine.

Su Erickson, president of the Illinois Library Association, said the libraries are a wonderful way for people to do something nice for their communities. They also let people share new thoughts and ideas.

Little libraries can be especially useful in areas that lack a public library, said Erickson, a branch library coordinator at Robert Morris University in Aurora. Brooks said he and Bol are currently focusing on those small towns without a public library.
