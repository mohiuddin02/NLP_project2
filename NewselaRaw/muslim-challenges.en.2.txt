PITTSBURGH — At the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh volunteers manned booths before and after the weekly prayer service. They recruited people to work with children, run a food bank, participate in adult education, and recite the Muslim holy book, the Quran, with others.

This push for more volunteers was not linked to the terror attacks in Paris earlier this month. It had been planned earlier. But for Muslims at this large mosque, the recent attacks were on their minds.

They hoped getting young people more involved in mosque activities would help them to learn true Islam. They aim to fight back against violent messages put out by Muslim extremists.

These extremists include the ones who attacked the Charlie Hebdo paper in France. Other groups in the news include Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Iraq and Syria, and al-Qaida, which was behind the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States. All these groups commit acts of violence in the name of Islam.

## Separating The Good From Bad

Esra Daghestani, 29, was working at a booth to recruit volunteers for children's activities. She recently graduated from Duquesne University with a nursing degree.

"Everything that's going on around the world is sad," she said. "The best thing you can do is try to help with the generation that's coming now."

She added, "It's important to tell the youth that ISIS and al-Qaida and all these aren't really related to Islam. They're just people who use the name of Islam to get attention."

Sheikh Atef Mahgoub, the imam of the mosque, leads the weekly prayers. He hit on the same theme during his Friday sermon, which was attended by about 500 people.

The terror group in France claimed they were fighting on behalf of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. The prophet had been drawn in a cartoon in the paper Charlie Hebdo.

The men "were not defending the honor of Islam," Mahgoub said. "They did exactly the opposite. They have done nothing but defame the image of our prophet. Muslims all over the world are suffering because of this. Innocent people were killed, including a policeman who was a Muslim."

## More Education Is Needed

Mahgoub said he is concerned that violent groups like the Islamic State are trying to recruit people to attack targets in Europe and the United States.

Recently, a 20-year-old man from Cincinnati who supported Islamic State was arrested. He was allegedly plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C.

The best cure for messages of violence is more education, Mahgoub said.

"Go to scholars, go to people who have more knowledge," he said.

The Prophet Muhammad was a ruler who would sometimes use force to keep public order, Mahgoub said. Still, the prophet never responded to personal insults with violence.

Those who "really want to defend the honor of Allah" should live according to Muhammad's teachings, Mahgoub said. They must show "mercy" and "gentleness."

## No Excuse For Violence

Most Muslims do not show Muhammad in art at all, because they do not want to commit idolatry, which is worshipping an object instead of God. The French paper Charlie Hebdo published cartoons mocking major religions, including cartoons showing Muhammad in negative ways.

These cartoons offended many Muslims. Mahgoub said this is understandable, but it does not excuse violence.

"You definitely have the right to be offended, but you don't have the right to respond physically," he said.

This Pennsylvania mosque, which is the largest in the region, operates a food bank once a month for the needy. It hosts interfaith events where Muslims, Jews, Christians and others can talk together. It also coordinates with other mosques in the area.

"Oftentimes, Islam is on the defensive," said Shahid Madni, who runs the mosque. He meant that Muslims often have to explain that Islam does not teach violence. "We always tell people we're not this, we're not that."

By reaching out to the community "we don't have to tell people what we're not, because people already know us," he said.

## Knowledge Beats Propaganda

Groups such as Islamic State produce and distribute propaganda online— videos or articles pushing their message and calling for violence.

Several young Muslim men at the mosque said they had never seen, or been sent, any of the propaganda.

"I've never come across any video, email, message" where such views were discussed, said Wasi Mohamed, a University of Pittsburgh student who helps coordinate the food pantry program.

Mohamed guessed that groups or individuals that were becoming more extreme were probably isolated and on their own.

Niaz Khan, 23, recently graduated from the University of Pittsburgh and is planning to go to medical school. He said young Muslims are working to fight against this propaganda by encouraging their friends into mosque activities. The mosque has a study room for students, and many of the food-bank volunteers are students.

"Come to their local mosque and talk to leaders like Sheikh Atef," Khan said. "Here they'll get the appropriate Islamic knowledge to handle those kinds of things. In Islamic teachings there are so many examples of oppression being met with forgiveness. That's the biggest message."

Ahmad Ali, one of leaders of the mosque, cautioned against seeing moderate, peaceful Muslims the same as extremists who use violence.

"When we start fighting among ourselves, the bad guys win," he said.
