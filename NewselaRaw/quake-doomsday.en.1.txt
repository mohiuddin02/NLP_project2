PORTLAND, Ore. — As military helicopters ferry search and rescue teams over the Pacific Northwest, below them are scenes of devastation from a giant earthquake that could strike the area at any time.

Tsunami waters surge through coastal communities. Buildings, bridges and roads lie in ruins. Fires burn out of control. Survivors are stranded on rooftops, cling to floating debris or are trapped inside wrecked buildings.

Scientists fear the possibility of such scenes and say a great crack in the 650-mile-long offshore fault running from Northern California to British Columbia and the tsunami that follows could come in our lifetime, so emergency officials are busy preparing for the worst.

## Officials Prepare For Catastrophe

Federal, state and military agencies are working together to draft plans to be followed when the "Big One" happens.

These plans reflect the deep concern about the looming disaster: the possibility of more than 14,000 people dead, 30,000 injured, thousands left homeless and the region's economy set back for years, if not decades.

The planners see the deployment of civilian and military people and equipment that would be greater than any response to any natural disaster that has occurred thus far in the U.S.

There would be waves of cargo planes, helicopters and ships. Tens of thousands of soldiers, mortuary teams, police officers, firefighters, engineers and medical workers would be called in.

## Response Team Includes Military

"The response will be greater than that for Hurricane Katrina or Super Storm Sandy," said Lt. Col. Clayton Braun of the Washington State Army National Guard.

Since 2013, Braun has led a team working on a military response plan for Washington state that will be coordinated with other government agencies.

Oregon's response plan is called the Cascadia Playbook, named after the threatening offshore fault. The plan, unveiled last year, has been handed out to key officials so the state can respond quickly when disaster strikes.

"That playbook is never more than 100 feet from where I am," said Andrew Phelps, director of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management. When he goes out to dinner, he keeps the playbook in his car.

## Japan Quake Was Wake-Up Call

A measured 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of Japan in 2011 showed what the Pacific Northwest needs to do to improve its readiness for a similar disaster. Scientists say there is a 10 to 14 percent chance that a magnitude 9.0 earthquake could hit the Pacific Northwest in the next 50 years.

"The Japanese quake and tsunami allowed light bulbs to go off for policymakers," Phelps said.

Emergency planners and military officials have been meeting to plan ways to save lives and speed recovery.

Much still needs to be done, and it is impossible to fully prepare for a catastrophe of this size. But those responsible believe they are making headway.

## Delivery Of People, Critical Supplies

The plans call for action levels to deliver people, gear and supplies into the devastated region.

Large cargo planes, like the military's C-5 Galaxy, would land at airports or air bases capable of handling them. Then progressively smaller aircraft would be used to get workers and supplies to smaller airfields close to devastated areas.

Helicopters would play a major role, especially in coastal communities, isolated by destroyed bridges and roads. Ships would likely be needed to assist with the delivery of emergency supplies and to assist with the injured and homeless.

Emergency medical facilities to treat the injured would be set up because hospitals on the coast would probably be too damaged to use. Collection points for bodies would be created. Hotels, motels, college dorms, sports arenas and government facilities would be used as temporary shelters.

## Bridges, Roads Would Be Destroyed

Military and civilian engineers would be sent in to begin repairing an infrastructure that could be shattered in the most populated areas.

Worst-case scenarios show that more than 1,000 bridges in Oregon and Washington state could either collapse or be so damaged that they would be unusable.

The main coastal highway, U.S. Route 101, would suffer heavy damage from the shaking and from the tsunami. Traffic on Interstate 5 — one of the most important thoroughfares in the nation — would likely have to be rerouted because of large cracks in the pavement.

Base camps would be set up for emergency workers coming in from across the country, planners say, as would areas for the distribution of critical supplies such as water, food, tents, blankets and medical supplies.

Transportable water purification systems and emergency communications units would be deployed.

Seattle, Portland and other cities could suffer considerable damage, such as the collapse of structures built before codes were updated to take into account a mega-quake. Specially trained city search and rescue teams would be sent to look for survivors in the ruins of destroyed buildings.

Phelps said he has learned to live with the threat of an earthquake from the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Still, he said, "it's a little unsettling to know that in five minutes I might have to grab that playbook and call the governor," among others.
