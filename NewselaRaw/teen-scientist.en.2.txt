WASHINGTON — After teenager Elana Simon survived a rare form of cancer that attacks the liver, she did something about it — she studied it. The 18-year-old's work has helped scientists find a strange problem in certain genes.

Genes are the building blocks of the human body. They determine what color eyes we have or how tall we are. But they also decide whether we might get a certain disease. Finding the problem in Simon's disease may play a part in learning how the disease strikes.

Age 18 is pretty young to be listed as one of the writers of a study in the highly respected magazine Science. The high school student's efforts are bringing new attention to this mysterious disease.

"It's crazy that I've been able to do this," said Simon of New York City, describing her idea to study the rare form of cancer. The disease affects the liver and can spread and become deadly. It mostly hits teenagers and people a little older.

## Uncovering An Oddity

Making her idea to study the disease happen required a lot of help from scientists, including her father, who runs a science lab that studies cells at Rockefeller University. Her doctor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center also helped. Experts at the New York Genome Center, which studies genes, assisted. A second person who survived the cancer also co-authored the study.

Together, the team reported Thursday that they uncovered an oddity: A break in genetic material would leave the "head" of one gene fused to the "body" of another, resulting in an unusual protein. It doesn't form in healthy livers but only in tumors, growths which form in people who have cancer. So the problem in these genes might have something to do with cancer growth, the researchers wrote. They've found the evidence in all 15 of the tumors tested so far.

There's more to be done. It was a small study and more work is needed to understand this gene problem, cautioned Dr. Sanford Simon, the teen's father and the study's lead author.

Scientists at the government's National Institutes of Health (NIH) are involved. They are advising the Simons on how to set up a list of people with the disease. NIH's Office of Rare Diseases Research has posted a YouTube video on its website. In it, Elana Simon and another patient who survived the disease explain why teen patients should get involved in the tests.

"Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Not easy to pronounce. Not easily understood," the video says about the disease.

## Weird Change In A Gene

Simon was diagnosed at age 12. Getting an operation is the only effective treatment. Doctors called surgeons removed her tumor. Her tumor was caught in time. If the cancer spreads, the effects can be deadly. Simon knows other patients who weren't lucky enough to have the cancer caught early.

During her second year in high school, she had an internship at a laboratory studying another type of cancer. She used computers to help scientists sort information about genes with unusual changes, or mutations.

Simon wondered, why not try the same approach with the liver cancer she'd survived?

One hurdle was finding enough tumors to test. Only about 200 people a year worldwide are diagnosed with the disease, according to the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation, a group that helped pay for the new study. There was no place that kept samples of the disease after an operation for testing.

But Sloan-Kettering's Dr. Michael LaQuaglia, who does operations on children and was Simon's doctor, agreed to help. Simon spread the word to patient groups, and finally, samples trickled in. Sanford Simon said his daughter used her computer skills to help examine the differences in the tumor cells.

The New York Genome Center zeroed in on the weird change in the gene.

Sanford Simon said other researchers then showed that the unusual protein really is active inside tumor cells. He calls it "an exciting time for kids to go into science." There's so much they can research on a computer.

As for Elana Simon, she plans to study computer science at Harvard next fall.
