Last week, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told the world that he is gay.

The technology industry in California's Silicon Valley has fought for gay rights in the United States for years. Cook's announcement may now push the industry into the global fight for gay rights.

Cook announced he is gay in an essay for Bloomberg Businessweek. His declaration was about far more than revealing his own sexuality. It was a declaration that a business leader is not defined by whom he dates. It announced that companies can innovate whether the chief executive is gay or straight, and that the tech industry is at its finest when its leaders are their true authentic selves.

"Everyone is saying, 'Look at the most valuable company on the planet, and it's run by a gay man,'" said gay-rights activist Chris Sinton. "Maybe someday, some kid in Russia will read that." It might "change his view on what sexuality is and what a gay person can accomplish."

## Wealth And Power Equals Influence

Tech companies are some of the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the world. After Cook's announcement, they have a new opportunity to push for equality. Their influence could be valuable in countries such as Russia and Pakistan, where gays and lesbians are discriminated against — or worse.

"These big tech companies have offices overseas," gay-rights activist Leanne Pittsford said. They "sell products in places where there are not only not enough women as business role models but definitely not a lot of lesbian role models." Cook's announcement, she said, could motivate tech companies "to get more involved overseas."

Tackling gay rights around the world may be a natural next step for the tech community. Many tech companies have a very open-minded attitude toward gays and lesbians. This is partly because they are often staffed by highly educated young people.

## Open-Minded Industry

Tech companies have fought for gay rights more openly and aggressively than most other kinds of businesses. Apple, for example, marches in the annual San Francisco Pride parade, which celebrates the gay community. Google has its Legalize Love campaign, which promotes gay rights in countries where homosexuality is illegal.

The tech industry has always been open to new ideas, says gay-rights activist Jonathan Lovitz, and that makes it more likely to be open-minded in general.

"You're watching banks and law firms that are now playing catch-up" with the tech industry, Lovitz said. Tech "has been way out in front" when it comes to gay rights.

Leading tech companies, including Google and Apple, are highly rated for their treatment of gay workers. Compared with most businesses, tech also has more workers who are comfortable telling coworkers they are gay.

Researcher Christie Smith points to one reason for tech's open-mindedness. Tech leaders, she says, tend to be more honest about themselves than executives in other industries.

## "You Can't Unring That Bell"

Before Cook's announcement, a number of prominent tech leaders had already come out as gay. Among them are Megan Smith, who oversaw Google's experimental projects and recently joined the White House as chief technology officer of the United States; Peter Thiel, PayPal cofounder and billionaire investor; Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator; Wesley Chan, an early Google product manager and a major investor in tech startups; and Nancy Vitale, an executive at Genentech.

Even the technology these companies create — social media networks, dating apps, video-sharing platforms — has helped to reduce intolerance and homophobia. In an information-based culture, everyone has seen a LGBT group's Facebook page, or a "coming out" video on YouTube.

"Once you have the Internet of people connecting with each other, and whether that's on Facebook or people connecting on apps, you can't reverse that," said Kenji Yoshino, a New York University professor who is writing a book on this topic. "You can't unring that bell. The fact that gay people exist is everywhere, and you have to decide whether or not you're going to treat them as brothers and sisters. And I think tech — Google, Facebook and Apple — had a lot to do with that."

## The Work Has Only Just Begun

However, activists say there is still plenty of work to be done before tech companies can be considered truly fair.

While tech companies have embraced the gay community, they've done little to bring more women, blacks and Latinos into their workforce. Apple's employees, for example, are 70 percent male and 55 percent white.

Still, Cook's announcement may provide inspiration to many both inside and outside the tech world, said diversity consultant Jennifer Brown. It may help move us one step closer to a world where workplaces embrace every kind of person — not just straight white men.
