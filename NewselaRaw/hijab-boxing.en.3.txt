Amaiya Zafar is a 15-year-old girl who found a sport she loves. She hopes to test just how good she can become.

Yet there is much that stands in her way. For one, the sport that she fell in love with is boxing. In it, two people fight each other in a ring. More importantly, she follows the religion Islam. She is a Muslim. Amaiya wants to wear a hijab under her boxing helmet and uniform. A hijab is a head covering for Muslim women.

The problem is that boxing rules do not allow her to wear a hijab during matches. Maybe, the 10th grader thinks, boxing rules should change.

Amaiya said the rules are old-fashioned. "I don't think there's anything wrong with getting them changed."

## The Small, But Tough One

Amaiya fell hard for boxing two years ago when she saw the boxing ring at a gym. Her father, Mohammad Zafar, suggested that she take up fencing, a type of sword fighting. It was just not for her. "I'll box before I'll fence," she told him. So Amaiya's father helped her to understand boxing. He showed her videos about the sport. Finally, she went from the gym to stepping into the ring.

"Everyone was like, 'That's Amaiya. She's the small one,'" she said.

Her mom, Sarah O'Keefe-Zafar, was worried at first. She feared for her daughter's safety. "When she first trained, I came into this as a mom and a nurse," O'Keefe-Zafar said. The teen trained hard for a year before she even fought a practice match. Over that time, Amaiya's mother saw her "go from a timid little girl to a confident young person." Now her parents are excited about her boxing. 

At first, some boys did not think a girl could fight in the ring, but eventually they accepted her. "Now they're my team," Amaiya said.

## Questioning Uniform Rules

Rules about the hijab are not her only problem. Amaiya is just 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 106 pounds. There are not many women she can box with. There is always the hijab. Amaiya cares deeply about her religion and will not take it off.

International boxing rules say that she cannot cover her arms or her legs below the knees. Amaiya would like to wear a long-sleeved shirt and leggings. USA Boxing has asked AIBA, the international boxing group, if that is OK.

"We have 30,000 amateur boxers in the United States," said Michael Martino. He is in charge of USA Boxing. "So if you make allowances for one religious group, what if another comes in and says we have a different type of uniform we have to wear? You have to draw a line someplace."

Jaylani Hussein is in charge of Minnesota's Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said that USA Boxing did the right thing by asking AIBA to decide. He said that Amaiya should have the chance to box like other teenagers.

## First Soccer, Then Boxing Could Change

Amaiya is not the first athlete to fight to wear a hijab during sports. FIFA is the world soccer group. In 2014, it allowed players to wear religious head coverings during games.

Amaiya pays a lot of attention to her training. It helps her to feel better if she is in a bad mood or not having a good day. 

On Saturday mornings, Amaiya teaches a boxing class at the gym. She has eight students who wear a hijab in the class, she said.
