WASHINGTON â€” Russian trade sanctions announced this week against U.S. and European agricultural products may be small change in the grand scheme of global trade. Yet, they're hardly paltry for poultry producers in the Carolinas and across the South to Texas.

Russia imposed the sanctions after the U.S. and European Union imposed their own sanctions against Russian companies and high-ranking Russian individuals. The U.S. and Europe initially were looking to punish Russia for taking Crimea from Ukraine. They added further sanctions against Russia after the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. The U.S. and Europe blamed the downing of the plane on a Russian missile system used by pro-Russia rebels inside Ukraine.

The sanctions amount to roughly $1 billion in annual U.S. farm exports to Russia. But experts say that figure pales in comparison with the isolation many Russian energy and financial firms are now feeling. The blacklisting by both Europe and the United States has had an impact several times greater.

Yet Russia's actions in response carry some bite. They hurt everything from salmon roe exports from Washington state to almonds and pistachios grown in California. It's especially true for chicken and turkey raised or slaughtered in the Carolinas, Mississippi and Texas.

## U.S. Poultry Will Go Elsewhere

"Fortunately, Russia is not as significant to us as an industry as they were," said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms, a large poultry producer with operations in North Carolina, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. "In 2008, they represented about 20 percent of our industry's exports."

That's not to say Russian sales are inconsequential. Sanderson Farms shipped 87.5 million pounds of product there last year, worth about $40 million.

"Forty million dollars is certainly a lot of money, but at the end of the day we and the industry will seek out alternative markets for our product," said Cockrell. He noted that the $40 million represents about 1.5 percent of his company's total sales.

Tyson Foods is another major poultry and meat exporter to Russia. Its website notes that Russia accounted for 3 percent of all its chicken exports in 2012 and 9 percent of its pork exports.

Worth Sparkman, a company spokesman, said, "We're disappointed about the loss of the Russian market but don't expect the impact to be significant since the volume we ship there can be absorbed by other global markets."

## Russia Has Banned Poultry Before

After the U.S. and the European Union ratcheted up sanctions against Russia last month, retaliation was expected. Sanderson Farms sought new markets for dark chicken and turkey meat for weeks before Wednesday's announced retaliation.

"You don't find alternative markets for 87.5 million pounds of chicken overnight. It will take us some time to do that," Cockrell acknowledged, adding, "We've done a pretty good job diversifying our exports."

The Russian ban on poultry is not a first. U.S. poultry was banned during the Bush administration in 2003 and 2004 when Russia objected to trade penalties levied against Russian steel. Poultry was again targeted briefly in 2010.

While an inconvenience for U.S. exporters, the poultry sanctions ultimately hurt the Russian consumer. Russian poultry is more expensive because the country has to import feed for chickens.

"We don't sell chicken to Putin," Cockrell said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "We sell chicken to Russian consumers, and they are going to be the ones that suffer from this," he predicted. "If that's what Putin wants to do, it's his consumers suffering as a result."

## Russian Roller Coaster?

The United States chose not to impose sanctions that could hurt ordinary Russians. Russia's announcement Wednesday does, however.

"What the Russians have done here is essentially to impose sanctions on their own people," said Treasury Department official David Cohen.

Russia's government is limiting access to food, a move, said Cohen, "that the U.S. and our allies would never do."

Russia has had a checkered history of using poultry imports as a political weapon. It's previous actions spurred other U.S. poultry companies to steer clear of that market.

"It was just such an up-and-down market," said Mitch Mitchell, vice president of sales for Case Farms in Morganton, North Carolina, which had already decided to avoid Russia. "We just got tired of the roller coaster."
