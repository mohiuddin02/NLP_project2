CHICAGO — In less than two months, President Barack Obama is expected to choose the site for his library. Chicagoans got into a bitter fight over a plan to place it in a public park. But this was not the first time that a presidential library was at the center of a land dispute.

In rural College Station, Texas, residents fought Texas A&amp;M University over plans to move a pig farm to make way for the George H.W. Bush presidential library.

People in Atlanta, Georgia, tied themselves to trees and lay down in front of bulldozers. They opposed the city's plan to build a two-lane highway through a public park leading to President Jimmy Carter's library.

The University of Chicago was in a similar dispute. Its plan to build the library on 20 acres in either Washington Park or Jackson Park on the South Side made some people angry.

## Parkland Plan Approved

Last week, the Chicago Park District approved a plan devised by Mayor Rahm Emanuel that would allow the transfer of parkland to the city's control if the University of Chicago is chosen to host the library.

The University of Chicago was seen early on as the most likely winner in its competition against three other universities to host the Obama library. But it wanted to build the library on land it did not own. Some people thought this might cause the university to lose the competition.

"It's often tricky finding real estate and making it all work," said Benjamin Hufbauer. He is the author of "Presidential Temples: How Memorials and Libraries Shape Public Memory."

The University of Chicago's plan to use parkland made it just the latest in a long and complicated history of land fights involving presidential libraries, Hufbauer said.

The two most recent presidential libraries built — for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — faced long and expensive court battles over eminent domain. Eminent domain is a legal tool. The government can use it to take over a property if it deems there is a more important use for it.

## Washington Or Jackson Park?

According to University of Chicago officials, the library building would take up 3 to 5 acres of the parkland. In comparison to the rest of the park, the library would be small and the rest of the land would be preserved as open space. If the university is selected to host the library, the Obamas would decide whether to build it in Washington Park or Jackson Park in Woodlawn.

People argued about the university's plan. Those against it have threatened to sue the city to stop the transfer. Residents of the Washington Park and Woodlawn neighborhoods embraced the plan because it would bring more jobs and tourism to the area.

The dispute put the university in a controversial light. Some people said it might make Columbia University in New York look like a better spot for the library. Columbia is the biggest rival for Obama's library. Along with Colombia, the University of Illinois at Chicago remains in the running to build the library on the Near West Side, as does the University of Hawaii, which wants to build it in Honolulu.

The park board approved the future transfer to the city of 20 acres from whichever park is chosen by the Obamas. The transfer would take place only if the University of Chicago is selected to host the library. If the university does not win the bid, the Park District would keep control of its land.

## Little Rock And Atlanta

In Little Rock, officials argued over the definition of a park. The city had plans to build the Clinton library in a decaying warehouse district on the edge of downtown. This sparked a court battle that lasted nearly five years. The city argued that it could acquire the private land for a park and then build the library in that park.

But landowner Gene Pfeifer disagreed. He refused to give up his 3-acre riverfront property in the middle of the proposed library site. In the end, the state Supreme Court allowed the city to acquire the property through eminent domain.

Chicago's 350-acre Washington Park was designed by legendary landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. But Chicago isn't the only city where a fight has been waged over an Olmsted park.

When Carter was about to build his presidential library in the 1980s, he found conflict, too. For him, it was over a decades-old plan to build a roadway through Olmsted Linear Park in Atlanta. The two-lane highway, then called "Presidential Parkway," would wind through the park and encircle the Carter library, which sat atop the hill where Union General William Sherman watched Atlanta burn during the Civil War.

"The original plan would have completely ruined the park," said Jennifer Richardson, an Atlanta resident who participated in the protests. "It gave President Carter a black eye, but he never spoke about it or returned any of the letters we wrote to him. But he never backed down."

The case was in the courts for more than 12 years. In the end, the Carter library was built, but the highway ended at the park.
