CROW AGENCY, Mont. — The Crow Tribe and the Lummi Nation live nearly a thousand miles apart. Still, the two groups are locked in an intense conflict.

At 2.2 million acres, the Crow's Montana reservation is one of the largest in the country. It is also rich with coal, which is used to produce electricity. Recently, the Crow signed an agreement to mine 1.4 billion tons of coal from their land.

The Crow hope to sell their coal to Asia. In order to get it there, they plan to transport the coal by rail to the coast of Washington state. Trains would unload the Crow's coal at a new shipping station that would be built in a deep-water port just north of the Lummi reservation.

## Planned Mine's Location On Lummi Burial Grounds

The Lummi occupy a 13,000-acre peninsula north of Seattle. Plans for the Crow's shipping station show that it would be built on the Lummi's historic burial grounds. The Lummi say the station would damage the fishing area they have depended on for thousands of years. Now they are leading dozens of other tribes in a campaign to block the Crow's project.

"Everyone says it's Lummi against Crow," said Johnny Felix, a member of the Lummi tribal council and a commercial fisherman, as he watched his son and others practice for wooden canoe races against other coastal tribes this summer. "It's not. It's not a tribe against a tribe. It's a resource against a resource. That's our resource — out there in the water. And their resource is coal."

In this case, the Crow's resource is a controversial one. President Obama's new Clean Power Plan will put strict limits on power plants that burn coal. The plan says coal-burning plants give off hazardous pollutants and greenhouse gases. Both are thought to be connected to global warming.

## Climate Change Concerns Leave Coal's Future Up In Air

Other countries do not have to follow American laws, but many are still concerned about climate change. The Crow's future trading partners in Asia might decide to use a different kind of fuel. It is unclear how much longer they might be interested in buying coal from the Crow.

For the Crow, the mining project is a matter of survival. There are no hotels on the reservation, and its casino brings in very little money. The tribe also has a very high unemployment rate. Leaders say the new mine will create high-paying jobs for many years to come.

Members of the Crow tribe who did not get jobs in the mine would still make money from the project. Each of the more than 13,000 members of the tribe would receive as much as $5,000 extra each year.

## Lummi Use Treaty To Defend Position

The Lummi say they are fighting for survival, too -- and they have a big advantage in the fight. They were one of several tribes in the Salish Sea region to sign the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliott with the United States. It says the Lummi must always be able to use their usual fishing areas.

Earlier this year, the Lummi used those treaty rights to try to stop the mining project plans. The move made Crow leaders furious.

Crow leader Darrin Old Coyote says the Lummi are letting other people influence them. Environmentalists "are going out there saying all these horrible things are going to happen," he said. "Those people are going home and plugging in their cars and their iPads and their iPhones and still depending on electricity."

## Crow Nation Feels Snubbed, Misunderstood

Old Coyote has visited the Lummi several times and even went fishing with Felix. He says the Lummi still refuse his invitations to come to Montana. "They don't want to understand where we're coming from," said Old Coyote.

"When we go to D.C., coal's a bad four-letter word," said Old Coyote. In his home state of Montana, Old Coyote has found more support for the Crow mine. Montana Senators Steve Daines, a Republican, and Jon Tester, a Democrat, both want to renew a special Indian mining tax credit that expired in December.

## Past Land Restoration Signals Good Intent At Proposed Site

Old Coyote wants people to notice that his tribe has done a good job restoring land at an existing Crow mine called Absaloka. He pledged to do the same thing at the new mine. "We're the ones who are going to live here, to stay here," he said.

The Lummi say the same. Many years ago, two other stations were built in the same area where the Crow station might go. Now the Lummi regret not fighting harder to keep them out of the area.

"That's what I've never understood," Felix said. "Why did our leaders in the past let that happen? But now is a different time and I'm saying no — no to everything."
