WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama's popularity has slipped in surveys of Americans. But he is still popular with one group: the leaders of the 566 big Indian tribes.

"I'd rank him as high as I can go; a 10, really, to be honest with you," said Leo Lolnitz, first chief of the Koyukuk Native Village in Alaska.

Brian Cladoosby has headed up Washington state's Swinomish Indian Tribal Community for the past 17 years. He said Obama was "second to none" when compared with other U.S. presidents.

Tribal leaders consider the president one of their own. To them, he's Barack Black Eagle Obama. A couple on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana gave him his Indian name in 2008 when they adopted him. They got a chance to meet with him again on Wednesday. The president hosted his fifth White House Tribal Nations Conference.

## Native Nations Hit Hard By Shutdown

He gave a 14-minute speech to the tribal leaders. Obama said he'd make his first visit to [Indian Country](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) as president sometime next year. But, he didn't say where he plans to go. He visited the Montana reservation when he challenged Hillary Clinton to be the Democratic choice to run for president in 2008. That was during his first run for president.

Tribal leaders tell the government what they want at the yearly meeting. For 2014, tribal leaders want to end cuts in government spending. The cuts are called sequestration. Last month the government shut down for 16 days. That hit Indian Country hard. It stopped money from getting to the tribes for things they needed.

A dozen members of Obama's team met with the tribal leaders. They promised more help for fighting crime, fixing schools and getting better health care.

But some tribal leaders said the president and his team had promised a lot, and that they had been slow to deliver.

"He's reaching out to us. We really appreciate that, but there's not a whole lot of things that have happened," said Bryan Brewer, the president of South Dakota's Oglala Sioux Tribe.

Obama and his team said they've done a lot to help. They've supported a law that makes it easier for tribes to charge non-Indian people for attacks against women. They've arranged for 230,000 acres of land to be given to the tribes. They're spending more on police, schools and emergency relief.

## Creating More Jobs In Indian Country

Only one-third of tribal members have health care now. But, more than nine in 10 would be covered either under changes to Medicaid, or the new national health care program. Medicaid is health care that poor people can use. The president's new health program is the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

Attorney General Eric Holder said the government wanted to do more to lower crime in Indian Country. There are a lot of attacks on women and girls there. He said that was "unjust and unacceptable" and can't go on.

Obama said poverty was too high in Indian Country. He wants the government to help produce jobs there. He also said he wanted to build stronger ties between tribes and the government, "based on trust and respect."

Tribes had a long list of their own desires. They want more help with projects that help their community. They need more money for housing and to collect better information to track tribal members. They'd like more tribal members to be made judges, and to get more tribal members into good government jobs.

Arlan Melendez is the leader of the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony in Nevada. He said tribal leaders wanted the government to stop checking into how money is used on Indian land. The tribes have their own nations and are legally allowed to make their own laws and elect their own leaders on their land. They have some freedom from the U.S. government.

The tribes think it's unfair for the government to inspect how they run things on their land, he said.
