An Illinois lawmaker wants to prevent hunters from using drones. She believes using the unmanned planes to spot animals is unfair.

State Senator Julie Morrison proposed a law this month. It would prevent the use of the unmanned aircraft to hunt and fish. The new law would add to one that already prevents drones from being used in Illinois to interfere with hunters or fishermen. The current law also limits the use of drones by police.

Morrison decided to propose the law after talking to state wildlife officials.

## Fair Chase For All Animals

Illinois already takes several steps to preserve what is known as "fair chase" in hunting. Fair chase is the idea of giving hunted animals a chance. The state also does not allow using bait to lure animals, dogs to kill and certain lights to see animals at night.

Chris Young is a spokesman for the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Young said there have been no reports of people using drones while hunting. However, he said drones have become cheap to buy. The state is trying to make a law before there are any problems.

Hunters might use drones to make wildlife come to them, Young said. They might also use drones to locate wildlife. Then they could go to that spot to hunt.

Young said fair chase is "an important principle of hunting."

## Hunting Is Not High Tech

Other states already limit the use of drones in hunting. They include Montana, Alaska and Colorado. Both animal-rights supporters and hunters in those states are in favor of the limits.

John Bostic owns a business that guides hunters. He has been hunting for more than 40 years. He said he is in favor of banning drones for hunting in Illinois.

"I believe in doing things the old way, and it's not hunting to me if it's too easy," Bostic said. "Get out and do your legwork, that's what hunting is about."

Linda Estrada said she also agreed with preventing hunters from using drones. Estrada runs the Animal Welfare League in Illinois.

"The animal wouldn't have a chance whatsoever," she said.

## Not Everyone Agrees With A Ban

Some people with hunting guide businesses disagree. They want to be able to use drones to scout for animals.

Scouting involves exploring a hunting area ahead of time. Hunters do this to gather information about animals. That is the most likely use for a drone in hunting. Video cameras can be attached to a drone. The cameras would send images and information from the wilderness back to the person flying the drone from the ground.

Jason Parent is a New Hampshire lawmaker. He also owns a hunting guide service. He says hunters should be able to use drones. It could be good for business, he said. Customers could save time and money and increase the chances of getting close to animals.

He compared using drones for scouting to other devices. Parent said hunters already use cameras set up in the woods to watch for animals. They also use stands in trees that allow hunters to spot animals from up high.

"Tell me, where does the cheating start?" he said.

## Hunting Laws Will Be Clearer

Young said the Illinois wildlife department wants to make changes to the proposed law. They want to prevent scouting with drones within 24 hours of hunting. Drone scouting would still be allowed before then.

With fair chase in mind, Illinois already outlaws some things. Hunters cannot use animals called ferrets to frighten or drive wildlife from their hiding places. They also cannot use dogs to chase, bother or kill deer. Those are just some examples.

Illinois law already limits using vehicles in hunting. Some people thought that law also meant drones cannot be used to hunt. Young said the new law would make things clear.

The law would also allow drones used for hunting to be taken away by the state. The hunter could be charged with a crime for breaking the law.
