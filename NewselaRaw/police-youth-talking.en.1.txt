ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — On a chilly evening, a panel of police officers met with citizens at the Rocky Mount City Hall to talk about a subject that has come up in almost every city in America. What happens when a young African-American man is stopped by the police? What makes an ordinary traffic stop turn fatal?

Rocky Mount, a former tobacco-growing town on North Carolina's flat coastal plain, has a population that is 61 percent black. It has never experienced a deadly confrontation between a police officer and a young black male, and residents say they want to keep it that way.

"We're trying to be proactive," said Archie Jones, the African-American director of Rocky Mount's Human Relations Department who helped organize the "Know Your Rights" event.  "We know what happened nationally could happen right here."

## Recent Deaths Have Intensified Issue

In August, unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown's death prompted cities and towns across America to re-evaluate the way police deal with African-Americans — especially young black men. The decision not to prosecute the officer — and not to prosecute a New York City police officer when an unarmed black man died after being placed in an apparent chokehold in July — has intensified the issue.

Though Rocky Mount, which has 57,000 people, has not experienced a similar situation, a few young black men have been profiled or harassed by police, said the Reverend Andre Knight. He is the local chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Profiling is when a police officer stops, searches or arrests someone based on their race, and it is illegal in many areas.

"Just because you have a badge and a gun, you don't have the right to abuse your authority," Knight said. "You need to know your rights, but the officer does too."

## Time To Bring Police, Community Together

Jones said he became concerned about potential problems between police and African-Americans after he attended a national conference in October on the events in Ferguson. He said he approached Rocky Mount Police Chief James Moore, who told him he had been discussing the same concerns.

"We decided it was time to bring the police and the community together to head off any conflicts," Jones said. Some people may fear the police, he said, "but in some cases, the police are as fearful as the citizens."

Because of concerns about potential conflicts between police and young black men, Knight said, his chapter has long sponsored similar "Know Your Rights" sessions for black residents. "The chief apparently think it's a good idea," he said.

## Presentation Helped Refresh His Memory

At the City Hall meeting, Khristian Roberson, 18, listened intently as several police officers — most of them black — answered questions.

Roberson, who is black, said he thought about Ferguson when he was stopped by a police officer one night last month for allegedly running a red light.

"I stayed calm. I wasn't rude — I didn't want to antagonize him," Roberson said. He said his parents had often given him "the talk" — the careful instructions on dealing with police, which have been delivered by worried African-American parents nationwide.

Roberson said he gave permission to the officer, who was also black, to search his car, and was then let go without a traffic ticket.

"I thought I was treated OK," he said, "but my mom thought I might have been profiled."

After listening to the police presentation, Roberson said it helped refresh his memory about how to behave when stopped by police. People should show their hands, not reach for anything and not make sudden movements, police said at the meeting.

"It was a good reminder," he said.

Ormani Muckle, 17, who attended the meeting with Roberson, added, "It was good to hear the police position straight from them."

## What Have Police Learned?

Some of the written questions submitted by audience members were pointed. They asked, How can you tell if you're being profiled? What's a "threatening motion"? Can you videotape an encounter with police? Should you tell the police if you have a weapon? What have police learned from the deaths in Ferguson and New York?

The officers answered carefully. Yes, you can videotape the police, they said. No, police aren't permitted to profile citizens. A "threatening motion" is any sudden movement, especially in the dark. Yes, you should tell police you have a weapon.

As for the Ferguson and New York question, police Lieutenant Henry King responded, "To have programs like this and partner with the community."

Someone asked whether police were permitted to draw a weapon on an unarmed suspect. King said officers may use deadly force if physically threatened by a suspect who is bigger and stronger, or by someone who tries to disarm the officer.

"Remember, police officers do not have to absorb a severe beating in the line of duty," King said.

Audience members, most of them black, nodded, and no one seemed to disagree.

## TV A Source Of Misinformation

Afterward, Chief Moore, who is black, said those who attended seemed genuinely interested in "the dynamics of police work." He said people get a lot of wrong information about policing from television.

To close the event, the chief looked out at the crowd and slowly said, "The police are the public, and the public are the police."
