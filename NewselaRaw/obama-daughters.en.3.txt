WASHINGTON — Politics can get ugly, with candidates trading insults and saying mean things. The children of politicians, especially presidents, often receive a lot of attention.

Sometimes it is negative attention.

This week, Barack Obama's two daughters, Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, were in the news after they were harshly criticized by a Republican congressman's aide.

"Try showing a little class," she wrote on Facebook. "Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar."

## Mean Post, Then Apology

The aide, Elizabeth Lauten, was writing about an event last Wednesday. Malia and Sasha stood to the side as their father went through a yearly presidential tradition: pardoning a Thanksgiving turkey at the White House.

On Friday, Lauten apologized on Facebook. "I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged as a teenager," she wrote.

Lauten, who was communications director for Representative Stephen Fincher, a Republican from Tennessee, quit her job on Monday.

"The Obama girls are untouchable," said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African and African-American studies at Duke University.

The criticism of Malia and Sasha was offensive, Neal said, because the Obamas are seen as a role model for families.

## People Can Be Cruel

Patti Davis, a former first daughter, wrote a public letter to Malia and Sasha on Sunday. She said that she was criticized for an outfit she wore to an event with Queen Elizabeth II when her father, Ronald Reagan, was president.

"There were 150 people there; 149 of them were properly dressed," she said the journalist wrote.

"As first daughters, you can't win," Davis wrote to the girls. "There will always be (mean) people sitting at their keyboards, seething with anger at their own lives, ready to take it out on you."

As the first African-American president, Obama carries with him important symbolism, said James Peterson of Lehigh University. The symbolism is powerful, he said.

## First Children In The Spotlight

In the last couple decades, many daughters of presidents have been criticized in the media.

Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh once called Amy Carter the "most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country." He later apologized.

Later, Limbaugh attacked 13-year-old Chelsea Clinton. Holding up a picture of her on his 1993 TV show, he asked viewers, "Did you know there is also a White House dog?"

Speaking to a group of college students this year, Clinton said she has developed a thick skin as a way to deflect attacks.

"That was not about me, that was about him," Clinton said

President George W. Bush's twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, were criticized for underage drinking and for sticking out their tongues at photographers.

Historian Doug Wead wrote about first families in the book "All the Presidents' Children." He says the attacks on first families stretch back into earlier eras.

## Sometimes You Just Can't Win

In 1966, Lyndon Johnson's 18-year-old daughter Luci complained that "we don't get paid, but we sure get criticized."

She noted that when her grades "weren't so good, complete strangers scolded me. And they got better and we sort of leaked the news about my B average — people said I was bragging."

Susan Ford was criticized for wearing blue jeans in the White House and had her high school dates judged.

"I kept thinking, 'I want to be normal. But I can't be normal,'" she said at the time. "Everyone was watching."

One famous first daughter is Alice Roosevelt, daughter of Theodore. She moved in to the White House when she was 17. Her behavior shocked people and brought her lots of attention. She smoked and drove a car by herself.

At one point, President Roosevelt told a visitor: "I can run the country and I can be a father to Alice Roosevelt, but I can't do both."
