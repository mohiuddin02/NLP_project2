SAN FRANCISCO â€” Gay people cannot be excluded from serving as jurors on a trial just because of their sexual orientation, according to a federal appeals court Tuesday.

The landmark decision expands juror protections beyond race and gender. The ruling also will provide a legal basis to challenge other laws that limit gay rights, say gay rights activists.

Until Tuesday's decision, gays could be prevented from serving on juries in federal courts in California and other Western states.

The unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a jury verdict in a case involving an AIDS drug. The judges said the case would have to be retried because a gay juror was excluded from the jury without a good reason.

## Activists Applaud Ruling

California state courts already prohibit excluding jurors based on sexual orientation. Tuesday's ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states, lawyers said.

The decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays and lesbians differently from other people. This includes bans on same-sex marriage, lawyers said. Gays are fighting laws in Nevada, Oregon, Idaho and Arizona that prohibit men from marrying men and women from marrying women. In those states, only men and women may marry each other.

Discriminatory laws must be closely evaluated to "ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status," wrote Judge Stephen Reinhardt. He was one of the three judges who handed down the decision Tuesday. Excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection under the law.

Gay rights activists applauded the ruling. They predicted that it would help them win marriage rights in other Western states besides California, where same-sex marriage is legal.

"This is really a very big deal," said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. "It is likely to have a significant impact on other cases."

David Codell serves as the constitutional legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights. He said the decision would make it "exceedingly difficult" for states to justify discriminating against gays.

## GlaxoSmithKline Vs. Abbott Laboratories

The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by drug company SmithKline Beecham Corp., now GlaxoSmithKline, against Abbott Laboratories, another drug company. The case involved a decision by Abbott to raise the price of an AIDS drug. This move infuriated the gay community. AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is a deadly disease transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, including sexual contact. In many developed countries, AIDS has affected the gay community disproportionately and has been a source of discrimination.

During the 2011 trial, a lawyer for Abbott prevented a man from sitting on the jury who had revealed that he had a male partner and had friends with HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus. SmithKline said this was discriminatory.

The Abbott lawyer said he had "no idea" whether the man was gay, but did not give another reason for keeping him off the jury. Before a jury trial begins, the lawyers for both sides pick the men and women of the jury.

After a four-week trial, the jury decided in favor of Abbott, but awarded GlaxoSmithKline $3.5 million in damages. Abbott appealed the award, and GlaxoSmithKline cross-appealed, which means it appealed Abbott's appeal. GlaxoSmithKline said that a new trial was necessary because Abbott unconstitutionally excluded the juror based on sexual orientation.

On appeal, Abbott provided several neutral reasons for excluding the man. One of them was that he was a computer technician for the 9th Circuit and knew many lawyers. But the 9th Circuit noted that two lawyers were permitted to serve as jurors and called it just an excuse.

"Jury service is one of the most important responsibilities of an American citizen," Reinhardt wrote. "It gives gay and lesbian individuals a means of (expressing) their values and a voice in resolving controversies that affect their lives as well as the lives of all others."

The court said that gay and lesbian jurors will not be obliged to reveal their sexual orientation. But if they do, they cannot be prevented from participating in a jury because of it.

## Ruling Could Be Challenged

Preventing a juror based on sexual orientation sends a false message, according to Reinhardt. It makes it seem as if "gays and lesbians could not be trusted to reason fairly on issues of great import to the community or the nation," he wrote.

Lambda's Davidson said he did not know how often gay prospective jurors were removed, although the issue has arisen in about half a dozen cases across the country. Lawyers do not need to give a reason for not picking a particular juror, but they must provide a nondiscriminatory explanation if challenged.

"People have stereotypes," the gay rights lawyer said. "They think gay people will be liberal or, if it is a police case, may think gay people are against the police. Or a lawyer might think, 'I just don't think I will relate well to a gay person on a jury.'"

But the point is, he said, the legal system should not be part of anything that treats people as stereotypes, not as individuals.

Lawyers can often get around the anti-discrimination requirement by providing an acceptable reason for a juror's removal. But "if the real reason is bias, they have to be quick on their feet to come up with another reason, and it has to be consistent with how they treated other jurors," Davidson said.

A representative for GlaxoSmithKline said the company was pleased with the court's decision calling for a new trial. Adelle M. Infante, a representative for Abbott, said, "We are reviewing the opinion and evaluating our options."

Abbott could challenge the ruling by asking a larger panel of the 9th Circuit to reconsider the case or even taking it to the Supreme Court.
