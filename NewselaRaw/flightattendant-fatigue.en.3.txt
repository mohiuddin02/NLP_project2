Henry Lund was beat after a long day as a flight attendant when he arrived at his Alaska hotel desperate to sleep. He had a 4 a.m. wake-up call for the trip back to Minnesota. He remembers taking a sleeping pill — maybe two.

The return trip ended his long career at Delta and Northwest airlines.

Lund, 49, says he has no memory of the event that got him fired last summer: shoving and insulting another flight attendant.

His experience brings up a larger problem for U.S. flight attendants. They work with less rest than foreign flight attendants. And they can rely more on sleeping pills than pilots do. Yet they are responsible for passenger safety, just like pilots.

## Exhaustion Leads To Error

Exhausted flight attendants have forgotten to carry out safety duties. In some cases they've forgotten to secure emergency exits and baggage. The federal government says mistakes may have increased as airlines cut rest periods to save money.

"They're showing up to work impaired," said Peter Roma. He does research for the Federal Aviation Administration on loss of sleep and fatigue.

The dangers of fatigue appear in flight attendants' own words.  Dozens of voluntary reports have been filed with the FAA.

"If there were an evacuation, I doubted my abilities," wrote one about the effect of working 12 hours without a break.

Another injured a foot after she was struck by full coffee pots she forgot to secure. "This occurred because I was very tired," the flight attendant wrote. "I did not sleep well the night prior … constantly watching the clock in anticipation of my early wake-up call."

There has been plenty of concern about tired pilots. The FAA in 2011 toughened its rules for pilot rest. This came after a flight crashed in upstate New York. Safety investigators determined that pilots in the crash were affected by fatigue.

The FAA set a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots prior to duty. It goes into effect next January.

## Should Get More Rest Between Flights

But the government has paid less attention to flight attendants. That's even though the FAA calls them "safety professionals" and the first line of defense in an emergency.

"These are not just cocktail waitresses," said Jim Oberstar, a former congressman who now works on transportation issues in Washington, D.C. "If the flight attendant has to get you out of that plane in 90 seconds, they have to be alert. They can't be run down."

One aviation expert thinks flight attendants should have as much rest as pilots.

"Why would we not want to keep fatigue managed to the same degree?" asked John Cox. He is a pilot and the CEO of Safety Operating Systems, an aviation safety company. "The stresses are different, but the days are equally long or longer."

Rest times for many Northwest Airlines flight attendants have been shortened. This happened after Delta Airlines bought Northwest. "Our duty days have gotten two to three hours longer in a lot of cases," said flight attendant Julianna Helminski.

The FAA typically requires at least nine hours' rest. That can be cut to eight hours on occasion.

## Findings of FAA Studies

FAA studies were conducted from 2008 through 2012 by its Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. The studies surveyed thousands of flight attendants. They focused on sleep patterns of 200 men and women working domestic and international flights. They revealed that:

—U.S. flight attendants catch fewer than six hours' sleep a day. That's the average on domestic routes. They get fewer than five hours' sleep on international layovers.

—Sleep times declined during the bad economy. Airlines routinely scheduled flight crews "up to the regulation limits," the FAA researchers wrote. The change "could increase the likelihood of … fatigue-related mishaps."

—Four of every 10 flight attendants used sleep aids during layovers.

An American Airlines flight attendant says this is familiar. He flies between Miami, the Dominican Republic and Panama. He says he often works 14-hour days with a 10-hour layover twice a week.

"By the time you close that door behind you at the hotel, it's usually 9:30 or 10 o'clock," he said. He had a wake-up call at 6:30 the next morning.

"The first thing I do when I get to the hotel is take my Ambien because it takes a good hour to kick in," he said. Ambien is one of the more popular prescription sleep aids. "I can't sleep without it."

On short sleep, he said, he'll sometimes fail to make sure that carry-ons are stowed in overhead bins. He asked to not be named for fear that his airline would fire him.

Under FAA rules, pilots are generally banned from "using prescription or over-the-counter medications for sleep," a spokesman said. But airlines can decide rules on sleep aid use by flight attendants.

## Bad Side Effects From Sleeping Pills

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned about Ambien and other sleep aids with the ingredient Zolpidem. They've been linked to rare but "serious side effects" including "more outgoing or aggressive behavior than normal."

That described the behavior Lund supposedly showed on his final flight. According to his file, attendants and passengers saw Lund shoving a colleague and calling him a jerk.

Lund's reported behavior was out of character for the 14-year veteran, said Tim Oyler, a former Northwest manager who oversaw flight attendants. "He was known as an excellent flight attendant. … I was shocked when I heard."
