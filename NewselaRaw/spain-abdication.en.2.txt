"A new generation demands, with justice, the leading role," he said.

He said the younger generation deserves to take over. He called it "one with new energy, willing to tackle with determination the transformations and reforms that the current situation demands."

His message was broadcast after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced the king's decision to resign.

Juan Carlos said his son is mature and well-prepared. He "has the sense of responsibility necessary to become head of state and launch a new stage of hope," Juan Carlos said.

## Reigned Since 1975

Juan Carlos once said that he wanted to be remembered as an "honest king who did his duty."

All signs show that he will do just that. But there have also been clouds for the king, who has reigned since 1975. More than other European monarchs, he had to fight for his popularity.

Juan Carlos was born in Rome on Jan. 5, 1938. He was the son of Don Juan of Bourbon and Battenberg, the heir to the Spanish throne. The Bourbon family was overthrown in 1931. Dictator Francisco Franco became the sole ruler of Spain after the civil war of 1936 to 1939.

When Franco decided that, upon his death, the country should have a king, he picked Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos was 10 at the time and returned to a homeland he did not know.

Juan Carlos was educated in military colleges and at the University of Madrid. But he was not a popular choice and was seen as Franco's puppet. He was once pelted with tomatoes when touring Spain. When he was crowned, many people didn't pay much attention.

Still, Juan Carlos won the hearts of Spaniards by fighting for democratic values. He supported the democratic prime ministers. In 1981, he helped defeat an attempted coup when members of the military tried to take over the government.

During the coup, the king rallied loyal generals and gave an inspiring televised speech to the nation. Of all the European modern kings or queens, he may have had the greatest impact on his country's history. The king was said to have turned Spaniards into "juancarlists" rather than monarchists. A monarchist believes in rule by a king or queen.

## Loved Sports And Fast Cars

"You have to earn your crown every day," Juan Carlos told his son and heir, Felipe.

He did not forget that his position wasn't secure. He lived a relatively modest lifestyle in the Zarzuela Palace. The palace is not much bigger than a large home.

Juan Carlos' friendly and easy-going personality created an atmosphere of an exceptionally unstuffy monarchy.

The king loved sports and fast cars, and had a good sense of humor.

His relaxed style was balanced by his more formal wife, Greek-born Queen Sofia. His three children — Prince Felipe and Princesses Elena and Cristina — shared their parents' popularity.

The press was thankful for the democratic freedoms, which it partly saw as the work of the king. So, it initially protected the royals and did not publicize its scandals.

But recently it stopped protecting the king. In 2012, news about a luxury hunting expedition to Botswana appeared in Spain's newspapers. The elephant hunting trip took place in the middle of an economic crisis, which left nearly a quarter of the Spanish workforce without jobs. Juan Carlos apologized.

## Corruption Case Clouds His Reign

But earlier this year, his daughter, Cristina, was charged with cheating on her taxes and hiding money. The alleged crimes were in connection with a long-running corruption case focused on her husband, former Olympic handball player Inaki Urdangarin.

Next came questions about the royal family's finances, and so earlier this year, they were given salaries.

Nor was the king's political role always appreciated. Separatist groups in several regions in Spain want to secede, or separate, from Spain and form their own independent countries. The groups have long called Juan Carlos a symbol of a country to which they do not want to belong.

There were also other mistakes, such as the infamous 2007 exchange between the king and former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez who had just called Juan Carlos a fascist. "Why don't you shut up?" was the king's off-the-cuff response.

Health issues also might have played a role in Monday's decision. Juan Carlos has had multiple surgeries in recent years, including hip replacements. However, even as his health became worse, the monarch had, until Monday, insisted he would not be forced off the throne.

But through it all, the king remained popular and was called a role model for other European royals. He was said to know something that every royal family should remember — that kings are not born, but made by the people.
