WASHINGTON, D.C. — As first lady, Michelle Obama has spent years trying to make school lunches healthier. After half a decade of trying to pull apart her efforts, Republicans have compromised with Democrats to preserve much of what the first lady wants. The deal also loosens some rules in ways that benefit major food companies.

The agreement is part of a five-year bill that covers $30 billion annually for school nutrition and related programs. It eases whole-grain requirements and sodium limits while preserving fruit and vegetable standards and keeping junk food off menus. Both sides claimed victory, urging Congress to pass the rare bipartisan deal and move on. The Senate Agriculture Committee is voting on the 200-page plan Wednesday.

## "Beneficial For The Kids"

"School nutrition policy can't thrive with just part of the country behind it," said Parke Wilde, a nutrition policy professor at Tufts University in Boston. "Even if some of the compromises were painful, it seems hugely beneficial for the kids involved to have bipartisan legislation moving forward. This still is better off than where we started."

The compromise keeps most of a nutrition policy that the first lady has fought for. Tighter rules that she championed took effect with the last child nutrition legislation, passed by a Democratic Congress in 2010\. Since then, giant food company such as Pepsico Inc. and General Mills Inc. have spent millions of dollars lobbying, or trying to influence, the latest legislation. 

Republicans have fought the regulations, which began to be implemented in 2012, claiming the federal government is overreaching. They also say the program costs schools too much money and discourages children from eating the meals. The School Nutrition Association is an organization of food service professionals that lobbies the government on school food aid. The group sided with Republicans.

## Is Healthy Food Too Expensive?  

Senator Pat Roberts, the Republican chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Senator Debbie Stabenow, the panel's top Democrat, negotiated the agreement. It lowers the requirements of what portion of grain products must be whole grain to 80 percent from 100 percent. For the past two years, schools that claimed they could not meet the requirement could seek an exemption. It allowed the schools to serve 50-percent whole-grain products, which led many schools to follow a lower standard.  

Sodium also gained breathing room in the proposal. Under the 2010 law, the amount allowed in meals was to be cut in half. The pace of the reduction has been slowed by two years but it is still scheduled to take effect. The government must also study the effects of such a move on cost and product availability. A report is due in 2020 before the next nutrition bill debate.

Both changes make it easier for food companies to sell schools inexpensive food while meeting nutrition standards.

## Fruit And Vegetables

Other rules were preserved, including a mandate that schools serve a half-cup of fruit and vegetables with each meal. Reimbursement for meals served in summer school-feeding programs was expanded. This was a top goal of the administration.

The White House has signed off on the compromise, according to Agriculture Committee staff. The first lady's office referred questions to the White House, where an official said that while the administration was still reviewing the legislation, it shares the goals that Roberts and Stabenow have set out. The official was not authorized to speak on the record.

In a statement, the nutrition association praised the agreement. "(It) eases operational challenges and provides school meal programs critical flexibility to help them plan healthy school meals that appeal to students."

## "Top Chef" Judge Is Pleased

Meanwhile, Food Policy Action, a healthy eating advocacy group founded by "Top Chef" head judge Tom Colicchio, also lauded the agreement. It said in a statement that the deal was "a huge step in the right direction" that "protects the progress we made on nutrition standards in 2010."

Wilde, the nutrition professor at Tufts, said support from the School Nutrition Association was probably key to winning Republicans over. "Once there was enough compromise to get their support, attacking the program ran the risk of a legislator looking anti-child," he said. The association represents educators who have to follow the federal rules.

Michelle Obama has actively sought ways to combat obesity. The condition now affects more than one-third of American adults and 17 percent of children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

## Healthy Food And Exercise

Her Let's Move! program is geared toward making kids more physically active, while the nutrition guidelines show her involvement in policy that affects initiatives including the school lunch program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says more than 31 million children each school day take advantage of the program, which offers nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches. 

The full Senate may take up the bill as soon as next month. The Senate bill closely resembles a joint House-Senate proposal that was almost included in spending legislation passed in December. The House may simply take up the Senate version, though Republicans haven't been clear on that, according to a Democratic committee aide who requested anonymity.
