NEW YORK â€” There are bugs everywhere. There are bugs on the trees, on the shrubs, on the grills and on the front steps. There are crunchy shells of bugs on the ground. Bug bodies with dead orange eyes cling onto leaves.

There is a large live bug on John Kempf's collar, and a dead one in his 6-year-old son Aren's hand. Neither seems to mind.

"I love them; it's nature," said Kempf, a Staten Island resident. Kempf  recently collected 300 bugs in a cooler to bring to his yard, in the hope they would multiply. "It's only once in 17 years, you have to enjoy it while they're here."

He is referring to the cicada species that descends on parts of the East Coast every 17 years. The bugs make a high-pitched screech, mate like crazy, and then die. Cicadas leave their eggs on twigs that fall to the ground. The tiny babies then crawl into dirt holes for 17 years. Then it happens all over again.

## 600 Bugs To Every Human

Cicada sightings stretch from North Carolina to Connecticut. But in New York City, they are usually just found on Staten Island, the city's least populated borough. It is estimated that there are about 600 bugs to every human on Staten Island while the cicadas are above ground. Cicadas are very loud. On some blocks, the bugs make more noise than air conditioners, radios and small screaming children who don't like insects at all.

The Staten Island Museum has 35,000 dead cicadas. It's the world's second-largest cicada collection. Ed Johnson works as director of science there. But for a few weeks this summer, he gets to lead cicada tours and hold cicada parties. He even eats fried cicadas, coated in flour and breadcrumbs.

On a walk through a muddy woodland full, he stops at a clearing to appreciate their short adult lives. Cicadas live above ground for three weeks, maybe.

"We have a pair of mating cicadas on this plant over here," he shouts back to the group that is following him. The mating cicadas look like a two-headed mutant.

One cicada lands on a person's ear, and another flies at a small child's head. It is a bit like being in a Disney movie. But instead of bluebirds on your shoulder, there are flying black-and-brown bugs with orange eyes.

## Here For A Short Time

Fun facts: Cicadas can breed for 96 hours straight. Little is known about what they do for the 17 years they live underground. All scientists know is that they eat tree sap. They are much more interesting above ground. Or at least, they are easier to study.

The pilgrims thought that cicadas were locusts, like from the plague in the Bible. The American poet Thoreau wrote about them in a letter to his mother. People sailing past Staten Island in the 19th Century could hear them.

The bugs have their fans. They include scientist Greg Plowman of Manhattan. He spent Father's Day on a cicada walk on Staten Island. Plowman has a dead cicada in the bug collection in his study.

"Let me know if you find one with white eyes," he tells his son. "Those are rare." His teenage son, Max, is not impressed.

"It's not worth it," Max says of the insect. "They exist to turn tree sap into noise."

## But The Smell Lingers

Dan Dellaratta claims that six bugs coordinated an attack on him. Five cicadas distracted him while one bit him. If only he had a truckful of cats or birds, he says, he'd unleash them on the bugs.

"A noise like that ... It's like the sound of a war cry," he says. "It's like some crazy movie."

People on Staten Island have another problem.

Ray Matarazzo's home is full of the bugs. Matarazzo loves cicadas, even if he has had to sweep them off his stairs to avoid crunching them. He looks twice before he sits anywhere outside. Sitting on cicadas is not very pleasant.

Now, their corpses are beginning to pile up. And so is the smell. Matarazzo likens it to the odor of a dirty, wet dog.

"It's just decomposition," he says. "The ants and bacteria will break them down eventually. I just hope that happens soon."
