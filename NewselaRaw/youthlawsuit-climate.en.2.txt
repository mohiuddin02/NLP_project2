SEATTLE, Wash. — Dozens of young people want a say in the planet's future. To make their voices heard, these young people — though not old enough to vote — have been suing states and the federal government to force action on climate change.

The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, creates greenhouse gases that heat up the Earth and change the climate. These youths say global warming will harm their generation the most. They believe the government should protect natural resources, including the atmosphere, as a "public trust" for future generations.

In Seattle, eight youths between the ages of 10 and 15 are represented by the Western Environmental Law Center. They petitioned the state of Washington, arguing that the state has failed to reduce carbon emissions based on the best available science. The youths say the government has violated its duties under the state constitution and the public trust doctrine. This policy requires the government to protect shared natural resources.

## Bringing Legal Action All Over America

Our Children's Trust, a nonprofit organization based in Oregon, has been filing lawsuits or petitions in every state and against the federal government. Some of the youth-led cases have been dismissed. Others are awaiting a decision in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oregon.

The United States courts have so far not wanted to change the laws on climate, said Michael Gerrard. He is a professor and director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.

Other experts say it is unclear how a state can combat a global problem.

The eight Seattle activists who petitioned Washington state last year are fighting for the state to adopt stricter regulations to protect them against climate change. Their case has been moving through a state court.

## Acid Oceans. Warm Earth. Unhappy Youth.

"We're the ones who have to live with it if the oceans are acidic and the planet is 5 degrees warmer," said Gabriel Mendell, 13, an eighth-grader and plaintiff in the case. "The snowpack is melting. Ocean is acidifying. The Earth is warming. Everything that can go wrong is going wrong, and we need to fix it."

Court documents provided by the state said that the Washington Department of Ecology was working on adopting a rule to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

"Climate change is the most important environmental problem," said Stu Clark, Washington's air quality program manager. "We are doing what we can with what we have."

## An Uphill Battle To Win Legal Change They Want

Nationwide, the cases need to pass certain legal hurdles. They need to establish that the public trust doctrine applies to the Earth's atmosphere. They also need to establish whether the law allows minors to sue.

"I don't think this litigation is going to be successful because climate change is a global problem, and it's not clear what a state could do," said Richard Stewart, a law professor at New York University. While a state has certain powers, it can only make a tiny contribution to a global problem, he added.

In Oregon, two Eugene teens are appealing after a state judge rejected their petition in May. The judge ruled that Oregon's public trust does not apply to the atmosphere, water, beaches and shorelines. The teens will take their case to a higher court in hopes that the judge's decision will be reversed.

## Making A Federal Case Out Of It

In August, 21 youths across the country sued the federal government. They claimed that approval of fossil fuel development has violated the fundamental right of citizens to be free from government actions that harm life, liberty and property.

"The government isn't doing the best to assure that we have the best quality of life," said Aji Piper, a 15-year old high school sophomore from Seattle. He is a plaintiff in that case and the one in Washington state. "It holds more urgency for us. Our future is at hand."

Julia Olson is the executive director for Our Children's Trust. She says the Washington case has gone the furthest because a judge in King County Superior Court will be hearing arguments on the merits and worthiness of the petition, rather than on a procedural issue.
