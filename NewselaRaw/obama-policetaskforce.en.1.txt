WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama said this week that police departments need to change their policies to build trust in minority communities. After the deaths of unarmed black men in Missouri and New York, a White House task force studied the issue and called for independent investigations when police use deadly force.

The deaths last year of of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City exposed "deep-rooted frustration in many communities of color around the need for fair and just law enforcement," Obama said.

He said a policing task force that he appointed found it is important for law enforcement to improve training, data collection and cooperation with the communities they cover.

"The moment is now for us to make these changes," Obama said. He was at a White House meeting with members of the task force. They worked for three months to develop the recommendations. "We have a great opportunity coming out of some great conflict and tragedy to really transform how we think about community law enforcement relations so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel — rather than being embattled — feel fully supported. We need to seize that opportunity."

## Independent Investigations And Accountability

The task force held seven public hearings across the country that included testimony from more than 100 people. The panel also met with the leaders of groups fighting for the rights of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, veterans, gays, the disabled and others.

In the end, the task force made 63 recommendations.

One recommendation was calling for more police training to reduce bias and help officers deal with stressful situations, Obama said. Another recommendation from the panel would be controversial, the president recognized — independent investigations after fatal police shootings.

"The importance of making sure that there's a sense of accountability when in fact law enforcement is involved in a deadly shooting is something that I think communities across the board are going to be considering," Obama said.

Today, when police use force that results in death, or someone dies in police custody, the investigation is often internal, run by the police department itself.

The task force recommended external independent criminal investigations and review by outside prosecutors in these cases. To do this, investigations could be run by state and local investigators, a neighboring city or county, or the next highest level of government.

"But in order to restore and maintain trust, this independence is crucial," the report said.

## Sending The Right Message

Bill Johnson is the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations. He said an outside investigation of a police-involved shooting may make sense in limited circumstances when a police department has few resources. But in the vast majority of cases, he said, it is unnecessary and perhaps even counterproductive, doing the opposite of what it is meant to.

"I think it helps to drive a wedge between a local police department and the community it serves, which is exactly contrary to what the intent of this police task force was supposed to be," said Johnson, whose organization is an umbrella group of police unions. "I think it sends a message that your local police can't be trusted."

## Better Record-Keeping

Aside from investigations of police killings, the task force also focused on record-keeping. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director James Comey have called for better records to be kept on police-involved shootings across the country. Currently, local police report these incidents voluntarily. There is no central or reliable collection of these statistics.

"There's no reason for us not to have this data available," Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, a task force co-chair, said, adding that he was surprised to learn that there were no reliable records kept. "Now that we know that this does not exist, it is our responsibility to do everything we can to develop that information."

Another recommendation from the task force was separating local police from immigration duties. This way, people in immigrant communities will not fear calling for help if they or a family member are in the country illegally. Still, information on immigrant felons would remain available under the panel's recommendations.

## Relationship-Building

Earlier, Obama had called for Congress to help pay for 50,000 body cameras for police to wear. These cameras would record the way police interact with the public. But the task force found that the cameras raise extremely complex legal and privacy issues.

"There's been a lot of talk about body cameras as a silver bullet or a solution," Obama said. "I think the task force concluded that there is a role for technology to play in building additional trust and accountability but it's not a panacea," — a cure-all. "It has to be embedded in a broader change in culture and a legal framework that ensures that people's privacy is respected," he said.

Laurie Robinson, a professor at George Mason University and co-chair of the task force, told reporters that it will take time for police to develop good relations with the communities they cover.

"It takes time, it takes relationship-building and it doesn't happen overnight," she said.
