TRENTON, N.J. â€” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a bill that makes it against the law to try to change children from gay to straight. The governor said Monday that he signed the bill even though he was not very willing.

Some people believe treatment can change to whom a gay person is attracted. Others say its not possible and that it does harm. The topic has been the subject of many arguments lately.

Christie said he had concerns about the law. He did not like limiting parents' choices of care and treatment for their children. Christie said he decided to sign the bill after looking at what doctors said about the treatment.

He pointed out the American Psychological Association's opinion. The group says the treatment can lead to a lot of problems. Children can become very sad for a long time. They can abuse drugs and they can think about harming themselves.

## May Run For President In 2016

Christie is a Republican. The decision comes at an important time. He runs for re-election in New Jersey this year. He also may be getting ready to run for president in 2016. His past comments make him different from some important members of his Party. They consider homosexuality a sin. They think that people choose to be homosexual and are not born gay. Christie does not.

Christie was asked about signing the bill at an event on Monday. He did not answer the questions. He referred reporters to a written statement.

Christie's office also gave out a 2011 video. It showed the governor being interviewed about homosexuality on CNN. He was asked if homosexuality is a sin. The governor is Catholic. He responded that his religion says it is.

But Christie also said he believed that people were born with the likelihood to be gay. "And so I think if someone is born that way, it's very difficult to say then that's a sin."

## Concerned About Parents' Rights

The bill won wide support from New Jersey lawmakers. But some people said the law interferes with parents' rights.

Christie said he was concerned about that.

The law says licensed counselors cannot try to change a gay child to straight. Counselors include psychologists, social workers and therapists.

Lawmakers held hearings before voting on the law. Witnesses at the hearings described very bad childhood experiences in which people tried the therapy on them.

The law passed the Assembly by a 56-14 in June. Seven lawmakers chose not to vote. The Senate approved it by a vote of 28-9 that same month.

## Praised By Gay Supporters

A group that supports gay rights issued a statement Monday praising Christie's decision to sign the bill.

The group said it hoped that Christie would realize that the best way to protect gay youth was to make sure they were treated equally.

Christie has mostly been criticized by supporters of gay people. He stopped a bill last year that would have allowed gay marriage in New Jersey. He insists that voters should be the ones to decide instead. Others argue that gay marriage is a civil right. They say such rights should not be decided at the voting booth.
