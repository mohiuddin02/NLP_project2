LOS ANGELES â€” Santa Catalina Island is one of the Channel Islands. It is off the coast of California. People often call it just Catalina.

Scientists have been arguing over Catalina for years. Some say it is sinking. Others say it is rising.

A new study on Catalina has just been released. It says the island is sinking. But it is sinking very, very slowly.

## One Day, The Island Could Be Gone

The study was done by scientist Chris Castillo.

Castillo says Catalina could be completely underwater someday. It could take 3 million years to happen.

Castillo's study is based on underwater pictures of Catalina. The pictures were taken last year.

The pictures show beaches that are underwater. Castillo thinks the beaches used to be above water. He says the pictures prove Catalina is sinking.

Castillo says there is another problem. Catalina is not sinking evenly. It is tilting to one side. The tilting could lead to underwater landslides. Huge rocks and lots of dirt would fall to the ocean floor.

## Let's Study It More

The landslides could cause a tsunami, he said. A tsunami is a giant wave.

The tsunami would put parts of California in danger, Castillo said.

More studies are needed now, Castillo said. Scientists must learn how likely a tsunami is.

"If you see something that could be dangerous, you need to find out more about it," he said.

## More Questions To Answer

Some scientists do not think Castillo is right. They say Catalina is rising, not sinking.

Scientist Randall Schumann did a study of Catalina in 2012. His study shows that the island is rising.

Schumann said it does not matter that beaches around Catalina are underwater. The underwater beaches are not proof that Catalina is sinking, he said. The island could still be rising. It is just that the ocean has risen too.

No one really knows if Catalina is rising or sinking, he said.
