### PRO: Islamic State fighters may get in

There is a terrible war going on in Syria. It began in 2011. Since then, millions of people have left the country. Many of these refugees are still hoping to find a new home.

Different groups are fighting in Syria. One is known as the Islamic State or ISIS. Islamic State has taken over parts of Syria. It wants to push its kind of Islam on the country. 

Islam is a religion, just like Christianity. Its followers are known as Muslims. Most Syrians are Muslims.

Most Muslims do not like Islamic State. Many refugees left Syria to escape ISIS.

## Governors Don't Like The Plan

The United States is now fighting Islamic State in Syria. Many worry that Islamic State fighters could attack this country.

The U.S. government wants to help the Syrian refugees. The refugees just want a safe life.

President Barack Obama says the U.S. will take in 10,000 Syrian refugees. They are supposed to go to many different states.

The president has a problem, though. The governors of 31 states are not going along with his plan. They do not want Syrian refugees in the states they lead. They worry that Islamic State fighters could sneak in with the real refugees.

President Obama says there is no reason to worry. All the refugees will be checked very carefully, he says.

The governors and many other Americans do not believe Obama. They do not think the screening will be careful. 

## Not Keeping U.S. Safe

Obama caused the problem. He said too many things that turned out not to be true.  For example, he said Islamic State was almost beaten. Then, the group attacked again. 

What if there are problems with the refugee checking?

Many people no longer believe Obama. They think the screening will not work well. They worry fighters will slip in unnoticed.

The president says the refugees are mostly women and children. They could not be fighters, he says. Anyone who watches TV can see that is not true. Many of the new Syrian refugees are men. Also, some Islamic State fighters are women.

I hope we can take in the refugees. Most people trust them. The problem is that many people no longer trust the president. He may not do enough to keep us safe.

### CON: U.S. cannot turn away refugees

Thirty-one U.S. governors do not want Syrian refugees in their states. The governors are the top leaders of the states.

The Syrians the governors want to keep out are refugees. They escaped Syria's bloody war. Now they are looking for a new home.

The governors are making a big mistake. They are wrong not just because they should help people in need. What they are doing is helping the Islamic State group. 

Islamic State, also called ISIS, has conquered parts of Syria and Iraq. The group's fighters are trying to spread their own kind of Islam. 

## What Islamic State Wants

Islam is one of the world's main religions. There are many kinds of Islam, just like there are many kinds of Christianity. Believers in Islam are known as Muslims. 

Many of the Syrian refugees are Muslims. Most Muslims have nothing to do with groups like ISIS. They want nothing more than to live in peace like anyone else.

Islamic State fighters say they are at war with the West. They say they will strike at Westerners in the United States and Europe.

The first thing we need to understand is that Islamic State is weak. Most Muslims do not like the group at all. 

Islamic State does not want us to know that. The group wants us to believe their fighters are everywhere. They want us to be afraid. 

The group also wants us to turn against Muslims everywhere. They want us to hate all Muslims. They believe if that happens millions of peaceful Muslims will join them.

Islamic State also wants us to turn away Syrian refugees. Doing that would make it look like we are against all Muslims.

## U.S. Should Not Be Afraid

The war in Syria began in 2011. Since then, 11 million Syrians have been forced to leave their homes. More than 250,000 people have died in that war.

Many Syrians left the parts of Syria that Islamic State took over. They were afraid for their lives.

The U.S. government promised to take in 10,000 new Syrian refugees. They are supposed to be spread out among the states.

Many state governors are trying to block those plans. 

The governors say Islamic State fighters may sneak in among the refugees. They should not be worried. The U.S. government screens refugees very carefully. 

About half of these refugees are children. Another quarter of the refugees are elderly. 

We should not be afraid of them. They need our help.
