ST. LOUIS — High school agriculture programs are sprouting across the nation's Midwest, teaching many teenagers living in cities that careers in the field frequently have nothing to do with cows and plows.

The agriculture courses are being offered at the same time as school budgets are being cut and the number of farms in the United States declines. The courses are rich in science and are being considered as stepping stones for students thinking about careers including city forestry, natural resources and the genetic engineering of crops.

Agriculture-minded students are in luck: Tens of thousands of jobs open up each year in the field, and almost half go to college graduates with agriculture-related degrees, analysts say.

"There's a shortage of workers in a number of careers, and the numbers of those jobs are staggering," said Harley Hepner, the Illinois State Board of Education's chief adviser for agriculture education. "Schools that understand we can get students in the agriculture program know they're going to be taxpaying citizens with good-paying jobs."

## FFA Is Thriving

In addition to the school programs, membership in Future Farmers of America (FFA), a national organization, also jumped. FFA has about 580,000 members now, almost double the amount in the mid-1980s. That increase dispels the notion that only farm kids are joining the organization, because the number of U.S. farms has been declining steadily. Between 2007 and 2012, the number of farms fell 4 percent, according to government figures.

Many FFA members have little to do with farms, as Rebecca Goodman illustrates.

In Indiana, where corn is king, the 18-year-old junior is her school's active FFA president but no one would mistake her for a country girl. Goodman has lived in Indianapolis since she was 3 and before she joined FFA had never been on a farm. Her experience with animals is limited to cats and dogs.

"The only thing I planted was a small garden, and the only thing that grew out of it were weeds," she admits.

But Goodman would like to work with conservation efforts. She credits the agricultural sciences program at Beech Grove School with pointing her that way.

## Another Way To Connect

The Beech Grove's Applied Life Sciences Academy was launched in November 2012, aiming to be a place of hands-on and mostly technical exploration of live plants and animals. Teachers say the Academy helps students, who struggle with some subjects in traditional math and science classes, to make a connection with the real world.

"We live on the motto that 99 percent of the population doesn't have anything to do with (farm) production," said Chris Kaufman, a former state education department agriculture specialist who helped set up Beech Grove's program.

Classes include animal science, plant and soil science, as well as separate offerings of advanced animal and plant science, natural resources, and an introductory course. Some of the courses earn the students high school science credits.

## More Schools Taking Part

Such offerings have increased in recent years in many states in the U.S. Midwest. Seven high schools in Kansas and four in Nebraska joined the group in the past school year. Since 2011, Missouri has added seven schools to bring its statewide total to 331 — up from 82 just 20 years ago. Illinois added another 10.

Beech Grove's program, among 13 the state has added since 2010, has two middle school and two high school teachers for nearly 500 students, a number that helps the program pay for itself thanks to a state fund that gives districts a per-student allowance depending on the class. Those payouts range from $375 to $450 per student, accounting for what Kaufman says has funneled $180,000 into Beech Grove's coffers.

"Beech Grove needed more electives and teachers, and this was a perfect fit that didn't cost much," he said. "This is about understanding the environment and the world around you as it relates to animals, plants and food, then going out with those skills to get a good career."

## An Eye-Opening Experience

It's appeared to have connected with Goodman, who remembers "kind of having a hard time with what I wanted to do with my life and was going by the book — be a nurse or something. It kind of made me boxed in, made me feel depressed."

She added, "Before this (program) came, I was in a dark place. It's helped me find my way back."

Classmate Alicia Perez once dismissed learning about agriculture, convinced "this is gonna be for people who wanna be farmers." Not so, she now believes.

"It's an amazing program, really life-changing," the 17-year-old junior said of learning about plants and food, which feed her dreams of becoming a chef. "My heart is in culinary arts, and there are so many different careers you can pursue in agriculture."

Perez added, "This is definitely something you have to go into to realize it's so much broader."
