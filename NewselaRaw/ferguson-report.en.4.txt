FERGUSON, Mo. â€” The Ferguson Police Department has treated black people unfairly, according to a government report released Wednesday. It found that police officers searched black people without a legal reason. They arrested people just for walking down the street. They used too much force and often ignored people's rights.

Also Wednesday, the Justice Department announced that a white Ferguson police officer will not be charged with a crime. On Aug. 9, the officer killed an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown.

The teen's death caused months of protests. Many people in Ferguson shouted in the streets and carried signs. They were upset with their police and wanted to let people know how angry they were. The protests led to a six-month government investigation of the Ferguson police.

## Destroyed People's Faith In Justice

Attorney General Eric Holder is the head of the U.S. Department of Justice. He said that the Ferguson police and court system destroyed people's faith in justice. The police treated black people unfairly. Blacks felt like they were under attack.

Now it is up to the city to respond.

Will leaders agree to make the changes the Justice Department recommended? Could the city afford to change how its police department and courts are run? Could it afford not to? Officials of Ferguson would not say on Wednesday.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said the city fired some workers in the police and courts for writing racist emails. The city also stopped charging some court fees. It also hired three black women.

"We must do better," Knowles said, "not only as a city, but as a state and as a country."

## Arrested To Pay Fines

The report said the police arrested people only so that they would have to pay fines to the city government. Many of the people who were arrested for what the report called no real reason were black and poor.

On Tuesday, Justice Department officials went over the report with Ferguson officials. Both sides must agree on the reforms. If they do not, the government department can ask a judge to force the city to change.

The report listed dozens of examples of the police treating blacks unfairly.

In one of them, a black man was sitting in a car after playing basketball. A police officer stopped him because his windows were too dark. The officer kept him from using his phone. The officer also ordered him out of the car and asked to search it.

The man refused. Police officers normally need to give a reason to search someone's car. Still, the police officer arrested the man.

## Blacks Got Most Traffic Tickets

About two-thirds of Ferguson's residents are black. Only one-third are white. Yet, police stopped black drivers far more than they stopped white drivers. Blacks received most of traffic tickets. Also, nearly all the people arrested by Ferguson police over the last two years were black. Many of them were stopped just for walking down the street.

The police department "enforces the law more harshly against black people than others," the report said.

The Justice Department found seven racist emails sent among police and court workers. One of them described President Barack Obama as a chimpanzee.

A month ago, police ignored people's right to protest, the report said. Several people were peacefully protesting outside the police station.

An officer announced, "Everybody here's going to jail." A man recorded the scene. He was himself arrested. Officers pushed him to the ground and began handcuffing him. Video showed the man did nothing wrong.

## Changes To The System

The Justice Department suggested 26 changes to the city's police and court system.

Officials said Ferguson has already started training police to treat blacks equally. It also changed some of its police and court rules.

Justice Department officials said they know that police departments are short of money. Making the changes will be expensive.

The cost of not doing this, though, is "pretty severe," a Justice Department official said.
