JOINT BASE LANGLEY-EUSTIS, Va. — In a huge windowless room in Virginia, several dozen intelligence analysts studied incoming video on their computer screens. It was streaming from U.S. spy planes and unmanned drone aircraft flying over Iraq and Syria. The analysts were tracking Islamic State fighters in a war zone about 6,000 miles away.

Islamic State is an extremist group. It has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It wants to set up its own country governed by Islamic law. Islamic State fighters have captured about one-third of Syria and much of northern and western Iraq.

One team searched the incoming video. They found a firefight underway between Islamic State fighters and Iraq's military near the city of Mosul in northern Iraq.

The analysts studied the images for four hours before identifying 20 positions where the fighters were dug in with machine guns and other weapons. The analysts called in the coordinates for the fighters' location to pilots. Soon after, 15 jets from five countries pounded the targets with more than two dozen bombs.

## Aiding Airstrikes

The airstrike was just one of 462 in December. It shows the U.S. military's increased use of analysts far from the battlefield. Improved spy systems over the last 10 years have boosted intelligence gathering from the sky and allowed President Barack Obama to avoid sending in combat troops.

Instead, Air Force analysts in Virginia watch the war zones. After the work day is done, they head home to their families and kids' soccer games.

"It's strange because we live in different worlds," said an Air Force sergeant named Jennifer. "There's a home life and there's this war."

After the airstrikes, they count how many people died and how much damage was done. Some of the analysts say they have trouble sleeping at night. Like other troops, they can go and see doctors and other professionals trained to listen to their worries.

"This job isn't for everyone," said Colonel Timothy Haugh, commander of the Air Force unit. "We make life-and-death decisions every day."

## Long Days And Boring Deserts

But watching the video of an endless desert and working 12-hour shifts can be boring at times. It is so dull that many analysts chug sodas and energy drinks to stay awake. They drink so many sugary beverages that the unit has the highest rate of tooth cavities in the Air Force, doctors here say.

The office in Virginia is one of 27 Air Force sites that do similar work. Together, they act as the control centers for the growing fleet of U.S. spy planes and unmanned drones flown around the world. The analysts do not fly the aircraft or launch the missiles. They provide information to commanders and pilots who do.

Since last summer, much of their attention has been focused on the goal of destroying the Islamic State fighters.

The United States and nations it works with fly an average of more than 110 missions a day to support the operation to wipe out the Islamic State fighters. Most of the missions just gather intelligence. About three-quarters of the aircraft return without dropping bombs.

In past wars, U.S. troops on the ground helped provide information and intelligence to find targets to bomb. Today, commanders in the battle against the Islamic State group rely mainly on analysts to study communications chatter, signals and other material that gets captured or recorded.

## Knowing Who The Fighters Are

U.S. officers said the analysts working in Virginia are no match for troops feeding intelligence from the front lines.

"We don't have anywhere near the level of intelligence we used to," Lieutenant Colonel Marc Spinuzzi, an intelligence officer, wrote in an email from Baghdad. The analysts are under "a lot of pressure … to clearly distinguish friend from foe" and pick out who is a fighter and who is a civilian.

Activist groups such as Human Rights Watch and the Syrian Network for Human Rights say the U.S. airstrikes have killed dozens of regular people. The U.S. military has repeatedly denied causing such deaths.

Analysts can watch a location for days trying to figure out whether it belongs to the Islamic State group.

"Unless ISIS is actually flying a flag that says 'ISIS' across the top of it, then it's sometimes … difficult to tell … whether they're combatants or not," said General Herbert Carlisle, the head of Air Combat Command, which oversees nearly all U.S. warplanes.

Possible targets are anything that benefits the Islamic State group: an oil rig that generates money for it or a communications system used by the group to position its fighters.

"It's like a police stakeout," one analyst said. "You have to connect all the dots. That takes patience."
