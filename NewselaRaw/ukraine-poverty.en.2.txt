KIEV, Ukraine — To understand the seriousness of the crisis Ukraine faces today, simply visit historic St. Volodymyr's Cathedral.

Under blue and gold onion domes, the cathedral's leader prays for "calm and security for all Ukraine." Church-goers visit two donation boxes. Each box is labeled. One is "For the church." The other is "To support our armed forces." On a recent night, the church visitors typically slid folded bills into each.

Boxes to support Ukraine's armed forces can be found seemingly everywhere. They are in shops, along Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, and in thousands of other spots around the country. In the past month, they've gathered about 116 million Ukrainian hryvnia. That comes to $10 million in U.S. dollars.

For a modern military, that amounts to pennies. But Admiral Ihor Kabanenko, Ukraine's deputy minister of defense, used a news conference this week to express the gratitude of a traditionally woefully underfunded military.

"The money will be used to support our forces, with equipment and ammunition, uniforms," and food, Kabanenko said. "It has been a great help."

## Begging For Bullets

Located between Russia and the European landmass, Ukraine has been worried about a Russian invasion. A popular uprising forced its pro-Russia leader to flee the country in February. In response, Russian forces moved in to take Crimea, a peninsula in what was the south of Ukraine.

It might seem odd that Ukraine's military has to go begging just to afford bullets during a time of crisis. But to those who study the military here, there's no surprise.

Ukraine presented a list of needs to NATO, the military alliance between the United States and Western Europe. The list contained basic military items such as helmets, body armor and field radios. But Ukraine also asked for camouflaged netting, tents, sleeping bags and ground cover tarps.

"The NATO response was 'Are you really so poor as this?'" said Serhiy Zhurets. He is the director of the Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, a research center in Kiev, and a longtime top adviser to the Ukrainian military. "The answer was yes. It still is yes; the situation isn't getting better."

How bad is it? Only 1 in 10 Ukrainian soldiers staring across the border at Russia are protected by body armor. The country has lost at least three helicopters trying to take a better look at the setup of pro-Russian militias. It can't afford to replace a single one. Zhurets said that outside of a U.S. donation of 300,000 ready-to-eat meals (MREs), nobody has offered much help.

## "We Need More Money"

Anton Mikhnenk is the editor of Defense Express, a Ukrainian defense magazine. He said the numbers were easily interpreted. The Ukrainian military has come up with a budget plan in recent years to update its old weapons and machinery. The plan calls for about 131 billion hryvnia a year, about $11.3 billion.

Last year, Parliament reasoned that Ukraine faces no threats from the outside. So it allocated just 15.6 billion hryvnia — $1.3 billion. In previous years, it had been as low as 9 billion hryvnia.

For comparison's sake, in 2011 the U.S. military spent more than $700 billion. Ukraine's neighbor Poland has recent defense budgets of about $10 billion. Russia's defense budget is about $75 billion.

"We have old weapons and soldiers in need of better training," Mikhnenko said. "It's simple: We need more money. We do today, and we have for years."

Dmytro Tymchuk runs Ukraine's Center for Military and Political Research. He said the state of the Ukrainian military was so bad that it couldn't even afford to take some of the help it needed.

For instance, he said Ukraine would like [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), remote-controlled pilotless aircraft. Recently, Ukraine has lost three helicopters. It even had one pilot and one crew member killed on spy missions over the locations of pro-Russia separatists.

## No Operator For Its Drone

"Drones would mean we wouldn't have to put our people at risk," Tymchuk said. "But we don't have anyone with the training to fly the drone. Do we ask the United States to loan us drone pilots, have them be involved if a war with Russia erupts, and thus start World War III? Of course not."

Ukraine does own one drone. But it's never flown, and no one is trained to operate it.

When the situation became critical in March, it was hardly news to those who work in and around the military. Ihor Teniukh had tried to raise the alarm last year. Teniukh was once the chief commander of the Ukrainian navy. He was minister of defense when Russia occupied and then annexed Crimea without serious resistance. He wrote last year that a plan for a "large-scale downsizing of the military" was dangerous.

Ukraine had a policy to "avoid spilling first blood and give Russia an excuse for further action" when Russian forces fanned out across Crimea in March. But beyond that, the military didn't react because the military couldn't react, some experts believe. The country's tanks, trucks, jets and ships were in such bad repair that many weren't operational. When the equipment was working, the troops didn't have enough training to operate it. Some couldn't find the necessary fuel to start the engines.

The country also had no line of defense between Crimea, now part of Russia, and the rest of Ukraine. "If we'd started shooting Russians in Crimea in March, their tanks would be in Kiev today," Kabanenko said.
