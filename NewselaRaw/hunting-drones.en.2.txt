There are several steps that Illinois takes to preserve what is known as "fair chase" in hunting. That is, giving animals a chance against hunters. The state bans using bait to lure wildlife, dogs to kill and certain lights to search for animals at night.

Now, a state lawmaker wants to ban something else: using drones, or unmanned aircraft, to track animals.

State Senator Julie Morrison proposed a law this month. If it is passed and becomes permanent, it would prevent the use of drones to hunt and fish. The proposed law would build on an existing Illinois law that prohibits using drones to interfere with hunters or fishermen. The law also restricts the use of drones by police.

## Other States Lead The Way

Morrison decided to propose the law after talking to officials at the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The law would make it illegal to use a drone to hunt animals on land or that live in the water. Drones also could not be used to hunt any species of wildlife protected by Illinois law.

Chris Young is a spokesman for the department. Young said the Illinois wildlife police have not yet received complaints or reports of anyone using drones while hunting. However, Young said, drones have become more affordable to people. The state is trying to act before any problems do come up, Young said.

Hunters might use drones to drive wildlife to them, Young said. They might also use drones to locate wildlife beforehand and then go to that spot to hunt.

"So the use of drones would basically reduce the element of fair chase, which is an important principle of hunting," Young said.

Other states, including Montana, Alaska and Colorado, already limit the use of drones in hunting. The moves have been widely embraced by animal rights activists and hunters.

## "Do Your Legwork"

John Bostic owns a guide business and has been hunting for more than 40 years. He said he would be in favor of banning drones for hunting in Illinois too.

"I believe in doing things the old way, and it's not hunting to me if it's too easy," Bostic, 56, said. "Get out and do your legwork, that's what hunting is about."

Linda Estrada said she also agreed with banning drones to hunt. Estrada is the director of Animal Welfare League in Chicago Ridge, Illinois.

"The animal wouldn't have a chance whatsoever," she said.

Some hunting guide businesses, however, are in favor of being able to use drones to scout for animals.

Scouting involves exploring a possible hunting area ahead of time to gather information on animals. Currently in hunting, that is the most likely use for a drone. The drone can be outfitted with video equipment to send images and information from the wilderness back to an operator flying the drone by remote control from the ground.

## Scouting Is The Gray Area

Jason Parent is a New Hampshire state legislator who also owns a hunting guide service. He is strongly in favor of being able to use drones for scouting in his state. He said using drones to scout could be good for business, saving customers time and money and increasing the chances they would find an animal.

He said using drones for scouting is similar to other devices. Parent said hunters already use stand-alone cameras to watch for animal activity and tree stands that allow hunters to gain a better view of an area from up high.

"Tell me, where does the cheating start?" he said.

Illinois wildlife officials say Morrison's proposed law would not prohibit the use of drones to scout for animals before hunting.

But Morrison said that was her intent. She said she would amend the legislation if needed.

Young said the Illinois Department of Natural Resources is in favor of adding details to the legislation that would ban scouting with drones within 24 hours of hunting. Drone scouting would still be allowed outside that time period.

## Drone Law Would Be Specific

In keeping with the fair-chase idea, Illinois already outlaws such conduct as using ferrets to frighten or drive mammals from their dens or hiding places; having dogs pursue, bother or kill deer; using lights connected to a vehicle to hunt at night; baiting deer and turkey; and shooting most birds when they are not flying.

Using any computer software or service to remotely control a weapon is also banned.

Some have thought that an Illinois law already restricting the use of vehicles applied to using drones for hunting. Young said the legislation would make things clear.

"This would be specific to unmanned vehicles pursuing animals," he said.

The law would allow the Department of Natural Resources to take away drones that are used for hunting. The hunter could be charged with a crime for breaking the law.
