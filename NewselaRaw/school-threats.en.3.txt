HARTFORD, Conn. â€” State lawmakers are taking threats against schools seriously. They were once seen as childish pranks. Now, lawmakers are proposing stronger punishments.

On Tuesday, Los Angeles schools were closed after someone emailed a threat. That incident showed how a threat can interrupt schools and scare students.

Most states already have laws that make school threats a felony. A felony is a serious crime. Recently, though, there have been proposals across the United States to make punishments even stronger, said Michael Dorn. He is in charge of the school safety group Safe Havens International.

## Pranks Against Schools Raise Anxiety

"These things keep happening, and they're happening too often," said Wisconsin state Representative Ed Brooks. "This isn't child's play anymore. This is serious stuff. Every threat is real until it's disproved. There's a high level of anxiety."

Brooks has suggested a law that would make a public death threat a medium felony. The punishment would be stronger if anybody is hurt while students and staff members leave the school. When a school receives a threat, usually everyone has to evacuate while police check the school. Brooks suggested the proposed law after hearing that someone threatened a school on Facebook. The law said the suspect had to be charged with a minor crime and was not punished severely.

Threats can be especially upsetting in areas that have been recently attacked. Two weeks ago, a couple killed 14 people at a holiday lunch in Southern California.

No one knows who sent the email that shut down the Los Angeles schools, which is in Southern California. The district took the threat seriously.

## Threats Are On The Increase

In Connecticut, state Senator Tony Hwang said that he wants to change his state's school threat law. He wants the punishment to be stricter. His own son's high school was locked down following a threat in October.

Hwang is 51 years old. He said when he was a kid, people thought that threats were just childish pranks. He added that he believes that people's thinking has moved forward since then.

National School Safety and Security Services is a school safety group. It looked into school threats. It found that the number of threats went up more than twice as much in a five-month period in 2014 compared with the previous year. About 1 out of 3 of the threats were sent by email. Nearly one-third of the schools were cleared out. Also, almost 1 out of 10 threats closed school for at least one day.

## Sending A Message To Troublemakers

Some states have laws that deal with threats at schools. These include Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Virginia and Washington, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other states have laws that do not mention schools specifically. However, they would cover threats to schools.

New York, Pennsylvania and Maine want to increase the punishments for school threats.

Dorn said school threats are often made by people who want to make trouble. Dorn is a former school district police chief in Georgia. When a person who threatens a school is charged with a crime, other people are not as likely to do something similar.
