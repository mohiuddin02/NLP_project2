YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — In 1997, black bears broke into more than 600 cars in Yosemite National Park. Searching for food, they wandered into tents and knocked over garbage cans. On rare occasions, they injured park visitors.

"You'd drive your car to the park and then it got destroyed because you left a candy bar in the door," said Mike Tollefson. He used to be in charge of Yosemite.

Today, bears have become one of Yosemite's greatest success stories.

They are behaving better. Reports of bears damaging property or injuring people have really dropped off. In 1998, there were 1,584 reports. There were just 120 last year.

Experts say the change came through training. Park rangers are training the bears to stay away from people. Perhaps more importantly, they are training people to keep food away from bears.

"The numbers are down, and that's awesome," said Ryan Leahy. He is an expert on bears at Yosemite. "More and more people are doing what they are supposed to do."

## The Problem Started Long Ago

Yosemite has between 300 and 500 black bears. Thousands more live in the rest of California and other Western states.

From 1923 to 1971, park workers regularly left food out for bears so tourists could take pictures. Park visitors hand-fed bears until the 1930s. Until 1972, there were open garbage dumps. They were like candy jars for the bears.

Black bears became a growing problem in Yosemite during the 1980s and 1990s.

"Have you ever been in a vehicle or house that a bear has been in it? It's not pretty," Tollefson said. "They just don't poop in the woods. The big ones weigh 400 pounds. They can run as fast as a horse, and they're strong."

To solve the bear problem, park officials started a new program.

## A Step-By-Step Plan

First, they brought in many more people to work on bear behavior. The park also made campers store food in bear-proof lockers.

Next, the park began educating visitors. Campers must sign forms saying they will not feed bears. They also are not allowed to store food — not even toothpaste or deodorant — overnight in vehicles. Visitors are shown videos on bear-safe camping tips. Rangers patrol campsites every night.

Third, everyone on overnight trips must rent bear-proof containers. All food must be stored in them. "People were hanging food on ropes in trees," Tollefson said. The "mother bears taught their cubs how to climb up and get it."

Finally, park officials began tracking bears that became troublesome. A new program uses GPS collars. The Global Positioning Satellite device can locate the bears at all times.

## Bears Head Back Into The Wild

Bear experts will yell and chase bears that are near campsites. Sometimes, they will shoot a small bean bag or ball to scare them.

"We are trying to teach them that people should be feared," Leahy said.

The result is that bears in Yosemite are becoming wild again.

A study found that bears are eating much less human food. Damage from bears has also dropped off. Nobody has been injured by bears in the past two years.

Campers say they are noticing a difference.

Steve Johnson has seen dozens of bears in the park since he first came here as a 12-year-old in 1971. In 1999, he was camping with his two sons. He had to chase a bear away.

"Bears that get too (used) to people lose their fear of people," Johnson said. The less humans and bears meet, "the better for everybody."
