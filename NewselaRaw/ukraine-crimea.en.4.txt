PEREVALNE, Ukraine â€” A new government came to power in Ukraine last week. It happened after months of protests against Ukraine president Viktor Yanukovych. People in Ukraine did not like that he decided to build closer ties between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainians had wanted their country to be more friendly with Western Europe instead.

Yanukovych ran away to Russia after more than 80 people died. Most of them were protesters killed by police. Yanukovych claims he's still president of Ukraine.

Since then, things have gotten much worse between Russia and Ukraine. Russia has taken over Crimea. The region of Crimea is an important area in Ukraine. The Russian soldiers took control without firing a shot. The takeover has angered the United States and other Western countries.

The Western countries want Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull Russian soldiers out from Crimea. They say that Russia is illegally invading Ukraine.

## Ukraine Warns Of "Disaster"

Putin insists that Russia has a right to protect its military base there. He says it is also protecting Russian-speakers who live in Crimea.

Russian lawmakers gave Putin permission to use military force in Ukraine on Saturday. Thousands of people marched in Moscow Sunday. They supported Russian soldiers going into Crimea. Meanwhile, dozens of people demonstrated against Russia sending troops in. They were quickly arrested.

President Barack Obama had a phone call with Putin Saturday. The conversation lasted 90 minutes. He expressed his "deep concern" about the situation, the White House said. Obama said that Russia was breaking international law.

John Kerry is the U.S. Secretary of State. His job is to manage the U.S.'s relationships with other countries. Kerry spoke about the Crimea situation on Sunday. He said the U.S. may not go to the G-8 summit. It is a meeting between eight of the richest countries in the world. This year it is to be held in June in Sochi, Russia. Kerry also talked of possible ways that Russia could be punished.

The Ukrainian government said there was no reason for Russia to invade Ukraine. It warned of a "disaster."

But so far, Ukraine's new government and other countries cannot stop Russia. Armed men in unmarked uniforms have moved freely in Crimea.

Russia has long wanted to take back Crimea. The area was part of Russia until 1954. Part of Russia's navy is based there. It's called the Black Sea Fleet. More than half of Crimeans consider themselves Russian.

## Soldiers In Standoff

There are 46 million people in Ukraine. The people are divided. Much of western Ukraine wants closer ties with the European Union. Yet, eastern and southern regions like Crimea side with Russia.

Ukraine has a military base at Perevalne on the Crimean peninsula. The base has been surrounded by armed men. They have no badges on their uniforms. It's not clear from where they come. They arrived in at least 13 trucks and four armored vehicles with machine guns on top. The trucks carried 30 soldiers each. The trucks had Russian license plates.

A dozen Ukrainian soldiers placed a tank at the gate of the base. The two sides are in a standoff. It feels like fighting could start at any moment.

Ukraine's new president is Oleksandr Turchynov. He announced late Saturday that he had put Ukraine's soldiers on full alert.

There is not a lot the U.S. and European governments can do.

A leader in Crimea said the people in power there refuse to accept the new Ukrainian government. The leader said Crimea would vote on March 30 about the region's future.

"We are on a very dangerous track," German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. "(But) it is still possible to turn around. A new division of Europe can still be prevented."
