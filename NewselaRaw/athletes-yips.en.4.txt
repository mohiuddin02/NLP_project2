Chey Castro plays golf. He has a problem when he plays. When he tries to hit an easy shot, he gets something called the yips.

An example came in a recent game. The ball was only 5 feet from the hole. He used his putter to make a short shot, or putt. His hand shook when he tried to hit the ball. He missed the putt.

"I know I'm good, and I know I can make these putts," says Castro. "I used to always make them."

The name the yips might make the problem sound small. In fact, the yips can ruin an athlete's career.

## Many Golfers Get It

When golfers get the yips, their hands shake uncontrollably. It happens right before the club hits the ball, says Dr. Debbie Crews. She helps athletes train their minds so they can play better. Crews has helped Castro and others treat the yips.

The yips affect many kinds of athletes, including baseball players. Even piano players can get the yips. However, golfers are most known to have the problem.

Around 4 in 10 golfers will experience the yips at some point in their career, Crews says. In the past, most golfers refused to admit they had it. Today, scientists like Crews are trying to understand what causes the yips. They also want to figure out how to treat it.

## Two Causes Of The Yips

Scientists say there are two types of yips. One is neurological, or physically related to the nerves and the brain. The other is psychological. It is not physical and is in the player's mind.

A small number of golfers who come down with the yips have a problem in the brain. It causes the muscle to get stiff even when the golfers do not want them to. For most though, there's nothing physically wrong. This is what makes the yips so mysterious.

Some golfers have the yips only under certain conditions. For example, they may get the yips if they're playing a game for a lot of money. Others might have it on and off for a few months. For some, it might happen all the time.

## A Lack Of Confidence

Castro first had the yips more than 10 years ago. He had played golf since he was 6 and played a lot in high school. When he went to college, he stopped playing so often. That's when he first got the yips.

Castro says the reason is a lack of confidence. In high school, he was practicing every day. Now, he just plays for fun several times a week. The lack of practice makes him less confident.

Crews says being nervous can make the problem worse. Crews used exercises to help make Castro less nervous. She had him concentrate on a spot past the ball and make small changes to how he stood over the ball.

## Training The Brain

Crews also suspects that you can train the brain to work differently. People can do this by making small changes to where they place their feet and hands.

When a golfer putts, the brain relies on a model it created. The model figures out what signal is sent to which muscles to tell them what to do. With the yips, this model stops working. Crews says making a small change in hand position seems to adjust the brain.

"People think they've got to do this one perfect motion this one way, but that's not true,"  Crews says. "There are many ways."
