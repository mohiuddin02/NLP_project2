Weeks after a clothing factory collapsed in Bangladesh, rescuers are still pulling out bodies. Meanwhile, lawmakers and clothing companies are asking themselves hard questions: what is the human cost of cheap clothes?

The eight-story Rana Plaza factory complex crumbled on April 24. Nearly 3,000 workers got trapped inside. More than 1,100 were killed. It is the worst-ever accident in the clothing business. Reports from the disaster area have been dramatic.

A baby boy was born under the rubble just after the collapse. The baby's 26-year-old mother survived the falling concrete, mortar and bricks.

Another worker, Sonia Akthar, was sewing a shirt when the ceiling collapsed on her, Al-Jazeera reported. Her leg became trapped under heavy concrete. Rescuers were forced to take off her leg to save her. Other workers were luckier, and acted heroically to save others. Rescuers pulled out Reshma Begum after 17 days. The 19-year-old survived on four packets of cookies she had in her backpack and some water.

## Owner Arrested Trying To Flee

The building owner was Mohammed Sohel Rana. He was arrested as he tried to flee the country. He is a local politician, but was also known as a neighborhood gangster. Police, engineers and workers warned him that the building's pillars were near breaking. Workers say Rana ordered them back inside the factory. The building crumbled the next day.

On Tuesday, survivors protested near the factory. They blocked traffic, demanding their pay. The government has agreed to improve the factories and its building inspections. But labor experts say the government is part of the problem. In the past, factory owners could just pay officials to look the other way. That is why so many safety hazards were ignored.

Bangladesh needs garment factories. Clothes are the country's top export. It is the world's second-largest clothing producer. Almost half the population of 150 million lives on less than $1 a day. Factories create much-needed jobs, especially for women. But about half of the nation's factories are unsafe, said Kalpona Akter, who represents workers. Akter started working in garment factories at age 12.

## Eastern Workers Sewing For Western Brands

Workers at the factory were sewing clothes for Canadian and European stores when it collapsed. Western companies choose Bangladesh for its low wages and fast work. But the cheap cost and quick delivery comes at a human cost: factories often use child workers, and force pregnant women to work until just before their due dates.

Europe is one of Bangladesh's biggest customers. European officials may take action against local producers. It wants to force them to obey building safety codes. Target, Gap and J.C. Penney met with workers rights groups last week to discuss safety conditions. Adidas said it set up a hotline for workers. They can send a text message to report abuse. But some do not believe that Western brands will help. The brands are the ones demanding quick, cheap production from the factories.

"How can a garment businessman keep up with this ever-increasing demand?" said Shahidullah Azim, a representative for Bangladeshi garment factories. "By using every opportunity to minimize production costs -- paying workers less and not caring about workplace safety." He suggests big clothing chains should agree to pay higher prices. That would cover the cost of improving factory safety.

The government has so far taken nine more people in for questioning. On May 1, workers rallied in the capital. They demanded Mohammad Sohel Rana be put to death. There are rumors the construction workers built the factory with shoddy materials. They also may have cut safety corners because they knew Rana would not pay for them. Rana's case may show other factory owners that they are responsible for what happens in their buildings.

Customers shopping for budget fashions may think twice when they see a "Made in Bangladesh" label. A low, low price tag may not be enough to make them forget the image of the crushed workers. Some activists say shoppers should refuse to buy Bangladesh-made clothes. That will put pressure on the factory owners to change.

The Bangladeshi workers themselves may force changes. One woman who came to lay flowers on the unmarked graves told Al-Jazeera that "garment factories are prisons, they are like hell. I will never work in one again."
