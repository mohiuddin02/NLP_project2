LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Real estate agent Ed Kaminsky has been calling anyone he might know who has an in with a Rams player or two.

The Los Angeles-area agent says he's been on the phone nonstop. "I've been on the phone with the Rams' offices, sports agents, business managers, players, players that aren't on the team but that have relationships with players on the team," he said.

Kaminsky helps people buy and sell homes. Since the Rams' return to Los Angeles became official, he and other real estate agents have been hopping. They hope all the dialing will lead to return calls from the dozens of players, coaches and team officials who will be looking for a place to live.

Kaminsky is one of only a few agents in town who specialize in working with professional athletes. The agents help them find new places to live as they move from team to team. All are competing to get part of the bonanza that comes with the relocation of an entire NFL organization.

## Agency Beefs Up Its Team

There are 53 players on a team. Add in coaches and assistant coaches and there will be more than 100 people looking for homes, said Kofi Nartey, an agent at The Agency, a Beverly Hills real estate company specializing in high-end properties. "That's a lot of people looking for places."

The company will be adding employees just to work on moving the Rams. They will help players hire moving companies, have cars shipped across the country and research local schools, he said.

NFL owners approved the move from St. Louis just last week. In anticipation of the newcomers, some agents started reaching out to their contacts months ago.

"Within the last six to eight months we've really revved up our conversations," said Ikem Chukumerije. He is the boss at Westside Premier Estates. "It's all about relationships. If we don't have connections to a player but someone else does, they get the business."

## Most Rams Players Will Rent

That business probably won't be worth much at the beginning. Real estate agents make the big money when clients buy or sell. Most agree that Rams players are more likely to rent than buy.

Many players are on short-term contracts and NFL careers are notoriously brief. They average a little over three years, according to the players union. So if players have permanent homes in the St. Louis area or elsewhere, they may think twice about buying into the Los Angeles real estate market — especially given how expensive it is.

The median, or middle, home price in the Los Angeles area is $506,800\. That is more than three times the median price of $160,000 in the St. Louis area, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Chukumerije recalled working with an NBA player who was renting a 4,200-square-foot home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He wanted to find something similar in Los Angeles' pricey Brentwood area.

"They were leasing in Fort Lauderdale for $5,600 a month, but in Brentwood, you're talking over $12,000," he said. "We had to shift our search a little bit."

## Agents Hope For Future Payoff

But even the lowest-paid NFL players make a league-minimum salary of $435,000, so they can afford Los Angeles-area prices. Still, the agents probably will line up a lot of rental units but arrange relatively few sales.

An agent might get paid 2 percent to 3 percent of a lease they help arrange. Even on a $10,000 a month lease, that's an annual commission of just $2,400\. The rewards are tiny compared with the hundreds of thousands an agent might make on the sale of a multimillion-dollar home.

But agents say it's worth the effort. They hope to build up relationships with players now, which could lead to more business later on.

"You can do 10 leases that don't net much, but those lead to one sale that makes up for all of them," Nartey said.

## Many Seek Home Near Training Site

Aside from the question of whether to rent or own, players will also have to decide where in Southern California they'd like to live.

Agents think that Rams players will be interested in a few areas popular with pro athletes. Manhattan Beach has scenic beachfront property, and Calabasas has huge homes in secure, gated communities. Manhattan Beach is close to both Los Angeles International Airport and Inglewood, where a new stadium is being built. 

Other areas could see interest from players, too.

"For younger guys, the 21- to 25-year-olds who are single, I see them gravitating toward downtown LA and maybe Hollywood," Chukumerije said.

More than almost any other factor, agents said players will decide where to live based on the location of the team's training facility. That's where they will go for daily practice.

NFL coaches are strict about players showing up on time at practices. Being even a few minutes late can cost a player hundreds of dollars, depending on a team's schedule of fines. Los Angeles' heavy traffic makes that a real possibility.

"The ballplayers are going to want to be somewhere convenient to the training facility. If the training facility is in whatever city, you might find players congregating there," said David Carter, who runs the Sports Business Institute at the USC Marshall School of Business.
