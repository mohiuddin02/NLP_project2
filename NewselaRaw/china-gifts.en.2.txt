BEIJING — Want a full-time teaching job, instead of the part-time position without health benefits that you're currently stuck with? Luo Chunlei advises that you buy the school principal a box of mooncakes. Then follow that up with an envelope full of cash.

Having an operation? Better slip the surgeon some money. Don't forget the doctor giving the painkilling medicine, either.

"I'm absolutely disgusted by it, but this is how our system works," said Luo, a 32-year-old math teacher turned activist. Luo is campaigning against what he sees as Chinese society's widespread culture of corruption.

Gift-giving has long been a major part of Chinese life. These days, though, it is increasingly colliding with modern anti-bribery laws.

## Crackdown On Corruption

This year, the government has turned party pooper, railing against excessive gift-giving.

"Gift-giving is a must, but you should avoid extravagance," advised the official state paper, the People's Daily. Gifts of luxury brands, wine, expensive cigarettes, large amounts of cash, and sex were all warned against.

The new standards on gift-giving are part of an overall anti-corruption campaign launched by China's new president, Xi Jinping. The crackdown started in earnest last month with the Sept. 19 Mid-Autumn Festival that begins the holiday season. The holidays conclude with the Lunar New Year at the end of January.

Wang Qishan, the government's new anti-corruption czar, warned that "increasingly extravagant gifts" have "polluted our festival culture in recent years."

"China has always been a society of guanxi," or connections, said Hu Xingdou, an economist at the Beijing Institute of Technology. "Treating people to meals, giving people gifts, is all part of the Chinese lifestyle. This is something that goes way back and definitely clashes with the rule of law."

The crackdown has forced the Chinese to ask tough questions about how much is too much.

For the Mid-Autumn Festival, businessmen generally trade hockey-puck-shaped mooncakes that sometimes cost $200 per box.

## Gift-Giving To Gain An Advantage

Luxury Panda brand cigarettes wrapped for holidays are designed less for smoking than as fancy gifts. Prices can reach up to $50 a pack. In southern China, cash is slipped in red envelopes known as hongbao. Gift certificates are another popular choice since they can be readily traded for cash.

Parents are also expected to ante up a gift on Teachers' Day, a public holiday in China on Sept. 10, to help ensure that their children get good grades.

Such gifts are chicken feed compared with expensive Montblanc pens and $10,000 Rolex watches.

Or a $3 million villa on the French Riviera, the key piece of evidence in the bribery trial of former government official Bo Xilai who was recently sentenced to life in prison.

Last month, the Chinese government banned spending public money on harvest festival mooncakes. Government officials had been using public money to buy expensive mooncakes. They gave the cakes to superiors in charge of promotions.

China's population is enormous, which means competition for education, health care and jobs can be intense. Gifts are widely seen as a way to gain some advantage.

Activist Luo said that his family paid 100,000 yuan — about $16,000 — in cash at a public hospital two years ago when his grandfather was having an operation. They did this even though the operation was covered by insurance.

Parents in his hometown, he added, have to pay at least $3,200 if they want to transfer their child to a better school.

## "These Campaigns Come And Go"

Gift-giving is a popular subject on the Internet. Both those giving and those receiving gifts often express mixed feelings. One teacher, for example, complained about the pressure of constantly being invited to meals by parents.

In fact, turning down gifts can prove risky: A doctor who rejected a red envelope of cash from the family of a man injured in a car accident was beaten up by the family and suffered a broken skull. It turned out they had assumed he must have gotten a bigger bribe from the driver of the car.

Chinese activists are particularly concerned with the bribing of government officials. Some have published photos of officials wearing expensive watches they shouldn't be able to afford. Civil service salaries, after all, run no more than $850 per month.

One mid-level official was discovered to have a collection of timepieces that included a $62,000 Vacheron Constantin. This earned him the nickname "Brother Watch." It also got him a 14-year prison sentence.

Sales at luxury shops in Beijing spike in March, when delegates to the National People's Congress seek to earn favor with their superiors. Under the law, officials are not supposed to take gifts valued at more than 5,000 yuan, about $820 each. But the law is widely disregarded and unevenly enforced.

President Xi is not the first Chinese leader to speak up about corruption.

"There is a pattern in China. Each time a new leader comes in, he sets a fire and starts to crack down very hard on corruption," said Qiao Xinsheng, a professor at the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law. "These campaigns come and go. But over time," China will have to become more open, with "less tolerance for corruption."

Hu, the economist, said that enforcement of anti-corruption laws in China remains selective at best.

"It has to be selective. We couldn't possibly hold all Chinese officials to the same standard because if we did, there would be no officials left standing," he said.
