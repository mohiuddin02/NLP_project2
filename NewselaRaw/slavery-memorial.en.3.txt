The United Nations dedicated a memorial on Wednesday to the millions of victims of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

The new memorial is called The Ark of Return. It remembers the  15 million African men, women, and children who died under slavery. It also honors the millions of people forced into slavery to work on plantations in the Americas

During the ceremony, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the memorial encourages the world to think about the consequences of slavery. "Above all, it ensures that we never forget," he said.

The memorial was designed by Haitian-American architect Rodney Leon. He competed against 310 architects and designers for the chance to design the structure. The memorial is located is on the visitors plaza of the New York headquarters of the world organization.

## Reminder Of A Cruel Journey

The marble structure is shaped like a triangle. Maps of the trans-Atlantic slave trade are carved into it. Leon said the theme of the memorial was "acknowledge the tragedy, consider the tragedy, lest we forget." Leon said he also was inspired by the ships that carried African slaves across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe and the Americas. He also imagined the experiences of people going through the "door of no return" at a castle on Goree Island in Senegal. Many slaves were kept at the castle before they were shipped to the Americas.

Ban said the memorial is a reminder of the cruelty of the slaves' journey to the Americas. They were kept in terrible conditions at the bottom of the ships and millions died. He said the memorial also recognizes "the significant contributions that slaves and their descendants have made."

Ban called the memorial "powerful." He said it helps people understand that slavery destroyed millions of lives.

## Thinking About Causes, Consequences of Racism

The United Nations has declared the years 2015 to 2024 as the International Decade for People of African Descent. Ban called slavery "a stain on human history." He said the monument will make people think about the causes and consequences of racism. It will help people treat each other more fairly and with respect.

Ban said he hopes the memorial will become a call to action against modern-day slavery.

The memorial project began more than five years ago. It was led by African and Caribbean nations. Several countries, along with the United Nations, helped raise more than $1.7 million to build the memorial.

## Caribbean Countries Seeking Compensation

Jamaica is a member of the 15-member Caribbean Community. The group wants European nations involved in the slave trade to compensate or give money to the descendants of the slaves.

At the ceremony, Jamaica Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller noted that Britain outlawed the slave trade on March 25, 1807. Yet, slavery continued. In the United States, slavery did not stop until 1865, when the Civil War ended.

"For us, freedom came after a long journey," she said. "Freedom was not gifted to us but rather earned by the sweat, blood, and tears of millions of our forebears." The New World was built by their slave ancestors, she said. The New World is a term referring to the North and South American continents.

## Memorial Also Honors Those Who Fought Against Slavery

Jean Crusol is a professor in Martinique, an island in the Caribbeans. He said the memorial also honors the many people who struggled to end slavery. Among them were Louis Delgres and a woman named Solitude, who fought against slavery in the Caribbean. He also singled out Queen Nanny in Jamaica and Toussaint L'Ouverture of Haiti, who led a slave uprising. In 1804, Haiti became the first nation to end slavery.

In 2001, France declared slavery a crime against humanity. Crusol said it was time for all the countries of the world to recognize slavery as a crime against humanity and the world. "This is our challenge," he said.
