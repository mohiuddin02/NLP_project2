WASHINGTON â€” On Tuesday, a controversial report came out about the CIA. Some lawmakers put out an extremely critical report about how American spies questioned enemies.

The CIA is the U.S. agency that spies on groups and countries. Its job is to gather information to keep the U.S. safe. It can do this by sending out spies, or bringing in people for questioning. The lawmakers said the CIA hurt prisoners during interviews in a way that is against the law. The CIA claimed that the harsh questioning saved American lives, but lawmakers said the CIA couldn't provide proof of that.

On Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing thousands of Americans. The CIA started questioning people it thought might be enemies of the United States.

The lawmakers said spies would torture the enemies without telling lawmakers or the public. Only some of the parts of the report were published, including a summary of what they found and a conclusion.

## Torture Didn't Work, Report Says

President Barack Obama said the torture was "contrary to our values" and promised he would make sure spies never used the hurtful methods of getting information again.

Democratic lawmaker Dianne Feinstein was on the committee that wrote the report. She said the findings are a stain on the country's history.

The people captured by the spies were "tortured," she said.

The spies forced the prisoners to stay awake without sleep. They hurt them by throwing them against walls. They also put them in small boxes and threatened to kill them.

In the report's conclusion, the lawmakers said the torture also didn't get the spies any more helpful information. They said the torture did not help stop terror plans or save American lives.

## Report Has Errors, CIA Says

In a statement, the spy agency said the report "tells part of the story." It also said it had some errors.

Some Republican lawmakers didn't like the report and did not want it to be made public. They challenged the report's claim that the tough tactics didn't work.

The spies and the tools they used to make people talk helped the U.S. find enemies. The tactics helped stop their plans to attack the United States, and kill al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, said two Republican lawmakers.

Not all Republicans felt this way, however. Republican lawmaker John McCain was tortured during the Vietnam War as a prisoner of war. He was glad the report was released and agreed with what it said.

The report was released after months of debate about what should and shouldn't be made public. The government was concerned about people overseas becoming upset at the United States. American government buildings all over the world were trying to increase security.

## Threatening Prisoners

People who used to work for the spy agency said the report's findings were false. So did some Republican lawmakers. They accused Democrats of not being accurate and of only choosing to release evidence that supported what they wanted to find. CIA officials still say they gained a lot of important information that still guides counterterrorism efforts.

President George W. Bush approved the program in 2002 but didn't learn about the details until 2006. At that time Bush said he was uncomfortable with one of the images of a prisoner who was being tortured.

After a terror suspect was arrested in Pakistan, spies got permission from the government to torture him. They were not going to let him sleep, keep him in a small space and make him think he was drowning. The report says that spies used even more ways to torture people than the ones that were approved.

Other prisoners had to take baths in ice. The spies threatened to kill their families.

## 6 Million Documents

The suspect was held in a secret building in Thailand. The spies thought he had information on another terror attack. He was left isolated for 47 days without questioning, the report says. Later, he was tortured many times. He later suffered mental problems.

Another terror suspect was tortured at least 183 times. The spies noted that he wasn't giving them any more information, but they still tortured him for 10 more days. They even tortured him to get information about a terror threat that they later found out was fake.

After reviewing 6 million documents from the spies, lawmakers said they couldn't find proof that any of the information saved lives and protected the United States.

The spies had said that torture helped them find out where bin Laden was hiding. The lawmakers say their report found this was false. The questioning of a prisoner revealed a known person who was taking messages to and from bin Laden.
