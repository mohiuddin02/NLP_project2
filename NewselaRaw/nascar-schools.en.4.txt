WASHINGTON — It takes a lot of math and science to drive a race car.

NASCAR, the racing organization, wants to show kids how.

Recently, NASCAR announced a new project to teach kids the science behind racing. It is called NASCAR Acceleration Nation.

The project will focus on the laws of motion. NASCAR calls them the three D's of speed — downforce, drafting and drag. Downforce is the downward force created by a moving car. Drafting is the idea that two or more cars move faster when they are lined up one in front of the other. Drag means resistance. Race cars have to push through a lot of air to get around a track. So there is a lot of resistance, which slows the cars down.

## Racing Around The Track Is A Math Lesson

NASCAR wants to show the fun side of engineering and math, said Brent Dewar. He is a top official with NASCAR. Dewar also wants to encourage fans to see NASCAR in a new way.

"They love the sport for the sporting element of cars winning, and racing and passing," Dewar said. "Behind all of that is pure science."

Carl Edwards was a substitute teacher in Missouri long before he became a race car driver. He is known for doing back-flips off cars after winning races. As a teacher, he had a tough time keeping students interested. He hopes that racing will do the trick.

Edwards said that science is involved in every lap around the track. Drivers must think about how to avoid crashing. They also must figure out the amount of fuel used by the engine at different speeds. Edwards still uses the science and math he learned in school. He wishes he had learned even more.

You can take any part of a race car and talk about its design, he said. "There's a physics or a math or a science lesson in any of that."

## Mini Facts And Race Quizzes

NASCAR has teamed up with Scholastic Corporation. The company publishes books for kids. They will put together fact sheets and quizzes mainly for middle school teachers. One question asks why do race cars in a drafting formation go faster? A drafting formation is when cars line up one in front of the other.

The answer is that the air acts like a vacuum. It sucks the cars in the back toward the front. Leading cars also get a boost.

NASCAR plans to mail more than 7,400 kits to teachers. Teachers can also download the material online. A website will feature math and other games. There will be special activities on race days.

There has been a lot of interest in math, science and tech education. Some people are worried that the United States is falling behind other countries in these areas. Also, many new jobs will be created in these fields. The United States needs people to fill the jobs. NASCAR hopes that their lesson plans will get kids excited about working in these types of jobs in the future.
