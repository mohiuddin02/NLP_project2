WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” A $60 million project to repair the U.S. Capitol dome started with a coffee can full of rust.

Alan M. Hantman, who was the Capitol's architect from 1997 through 2007, put some rusty parts from the dome in the can. Congress meets in the Capitol building. He used to carry the can to meetings held by lawmakers, to show them that the dome was crumbling above them.

Many of the bolts that held the iron dome together had fallen off. The metal straps that held the dome's metal sheets together had cracked. The Capitol's dome was built more than 150 years ago and weighs nearly 9 million pounds,

"Cast-iron parts were basically holding each other in place," Hantman said.

He built a wooden rail just below the Statue of Freedom, which sits on top of the dome. He wanted to make sure that tourists who climbed near the top on tours would not shake anything loose.

"We didn't want people leaning on the railing up there," he said.

## Decades To Secure Money For Repairs

Still, it would take an additional 10 years before the architect who followed Hantman could get the money to begin fixing the dome. The new architect was Stephen T. Ayers. He had to rebuild ornaments, strip away layers of paint dating from a century ago, and replace some heavy glass windows.

The dome had not been repaired in more than 50 years. Since then rust has built up. Rain and snow worked their way into tiny holes in the cast iron, enlarging them, leaving more than 1,000 cracks.

In May 2014, workers began erecting the 1.1 million pounds of scaffolding. The scaffolding is a temporary structure built around the outside of the dome that lets workers fix it. It has become part of the view of the city. In the evening, it gives the Capitol an eerie glow.

Inside the dome, workers installed a puffy cloth just below the ceiling. It has a doughnut hole in the middle that allows visitors to see the mural painted on the inside of the dome.

## Capitol's Unique Needs, Purpose Complicate Work

The repairs are being done a little at a time. Members of Congress want to be able to use the Capitol building during construction. They still need to get to their meetings there and also want the people back in their home states to be able to take tours of the building.

To make sure the project does not get in the way of those activities, much of the work has been done on nights and weekends. The rotunda is the large room under the dome. It has largely remained open to visitors and staff, closing for only a few weeks in April 2014.

Even with all the work, few people argue that the cost and trouble is not worth the effort.

Democratic Representative Zoe Lofgren from California is on the committee that oversees the project. Lofgren said that lawmakers have to make sure that the dome doesn't get to the point where it falls apart. "That's what this is all about."

## But Schedule, Budget Are On Track

Lofgren said the project, so far, is on time. Workers have begun removing some of the scaffolding and plan to finish in time for the 2017 inauguration, the ceremony when the next president is sworn in. The project is on budget too, not costing more than planned. In addition to about $60 million for the dome repairs, the project includes $16 million to fix the inside and $21 million for work on the rotunda.

"We'll see if that can be maintained," she said about the repair cost. "It's a major project."

## Capitol Follows Washington Monument's Repair

Washingtonians are used to monuments wrapped in scaffolding. Beginning in 2013, the Washington Monument, which honors George Washington, was wrapped in a metal frame so workers could fix damage from an earthquake. Unexpectedly, the scaffolding's geometric shape became a beloved part of the capital city's skyline.

The scaffolding around the monument was lit from within, which made it look like a glowing rocket ship. Some wanted the metal frame to stay there even after the work was complete, but it was removed in May 2014.

Lofgren thinks the Capitol scaffolding also looks like a spaceship.

"Obviously, it's not as beautiful as the building itself," she said.
