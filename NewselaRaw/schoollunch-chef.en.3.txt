It has finally been discovered how to get children to eat more fruits and vegetables. Schools should hire trained chefs.

When the chefs made lunch, kids ate more healthy foods, a new study found.

But getting them to drink plain milk instead of chocolate milk was tougher.

The study was done by a group from Harvard University in Massachusetts. They studied what more than 2,600 students ate for lunch. The students were in third grade to sixth grade and attended schools in poor areas. Most of the children were Hispanic, and the average age was about 11 1/2.

## Tasty Food Was More Popular

The chefs went to some of the schools to make healthy lunches. They used low-fat, low-salt recipes. In some of the schools, they also experimented with how the food was displayed in the lunch line.

The study group figured out how much the students were eating. They weighed the food the kids took. Then they weighed the food left over after the students were finished eating. The food was collected before children tossed it into the trash.

The results were not surprising. When kids were given tasty food, like broccoli in garlic or vegetable soup, they ate more, said Juliana Cohen. She is one of the Harvard researchers.

The study showed how to get kids to eat more of what is on their plate, Cohen said. Children "are going to like the foods and they're going to eat the foods."

This is no small matter. As the study points out, 30 million children eat meals at school each day. It matters what they eat. Eating junk food for lunch makes too many children overweight, the study said. Nearly one-third of children in the United States have too much body fat, which is not healthy.

## It Took Time To Catch On

The study said that how the food looked was also important.

It found that kids did not eat more of their main course when chefs prepared it. That did not bother the researchers, since the food was healthier. After three months, schools did not see students taking more fruits and vegetables. Yet after seven months students did take more. They also chose more fruit when it was placed in the lunch line where it could easily be seen. When the fruits and vegetables tasted and looked better, students ate more.

Schools need to be patient, Cohen said. It may take a while for a trained chef to make a difference. Eventually, kids will start eating more fruits and vegetables.

## Milk Did Not Pass The Test

Plain milk was the experiment's only failure. They were not able to get kids to choose plain milk over chocolate. They tried putting the plain milk out in front where kids could see it. That just did not work, Cohen said. To get kids to drink more plain milk, schools might have to remove chocolate milk from cafeterias.

Chefs can be expensive to hire. Yet, they can actually save money for schools, Cohen said. Chefs go to cooking schools where they learn to make food that tastes good and looks good. Also, they learn how much food to order. This avoids wasting food and saves money.
