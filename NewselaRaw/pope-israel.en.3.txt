JERUSALEM â€” The ancient building on Mount Zion has been holy to three religions.

According to tradition, Jesus ate a Passover meal there the night before his crucifixion.

On the first floor is a Jewish shrine to the Biblical King David, who is said to be buried below. The minaret of a former mosque rises from the top floor.

The building is also a modern example of how much trouble competing faiths can cause.

On Monday, Pope Francis said Mass in the room of the Last Supper, also called the Cenacle. Pope Francis' visit to the room followed weeks of protest rallies by ultra-Orthodox Jews. Ultra-Orthodox Jews follow the strictest interpretation of Jewish law. They fear the Roman Catholics want to take over the building, which is also holy to them.

Individual Christians can say private prayers in the Last Supper room any time they want. But organized Catholic services can usually be held only twice a year.

## Anger Against Christian Clergy

Israel and the Catholic Church are discussing allowing more Catholic services in the room.

And that has set off a religious firestorm in the area. Christian clergy say there has been increasing anger against them.

"I've been spat at. I've been cursed in the street," said the Rev. David Neuhaus, a Catholic priest in Jerusalem. "I think most Christians who walk around in traditional Christian garb have met with this kind of behavior."

Israel officials say there is no truth to the rumor that the Cenacle will be given to the Catholic Church. Yigal Palmo is the Israeli Foreign Ministry. He called it "crazy."

"We've been dealing with it for years and denying it time after time," Palmor said. "We've been negotiating church prayers. They want access for organized religious (services), and it has nothing to do with property rights or ownership."

The Catholic Church used to own the sacred building. That passed to the Ottoman Turks, who controlled the area for four centuries. When Israel took control of Mount Zion in 1948, it kept the traditional regulations governing Jerusalem's holy sites. That included the limits on Catholic services in the Cenacle.

## Where Christianity Began

Franciscan Friar Alberto Joan Pari would like Christians to be able to attend regular services there. The room of the Last Supper is where Christianity began. It is where Jesus is believed to have said "This is my body" and "This is my blood." His words are used in the Consecration at Mass.

"It's exciting. It's very deep," Pari said of the room. "If you think that everything started from here. This is a place where you feel a lot of energy."

Little remains of the original room. Pari said one wall contained several bricks from the first building dating back to the time of Jesus. The room smelled of wet paint from last-minute improvements before the pope's visit.

To enter, Pari rang a hidden doorbell. If the doorbell was more obvious, unfriendly neighbors would ring it day and night, he said.

Jerusalem City Council member Arieh King sees things differently. King is the head of the United Jerusalem party. He arrived at David's Tomb on a motorcycle and wore a black biking jacket and a crocheted skullcap.

King spoke about Judaism's historic connection to the land.

He pointed to a smooth paved courtyard. Underneath, he said, were the tombs of David and several other ancient Jewish kings. A doorway from the courtyard led to a small synagogue, where men prayed in Hebrew.

## Room Above, Shrine Below

King is opposed to adding more Christian services in the Last Supper room. It would become like a church, he said. Under the most strict interpretation of Jewish law, Jews would not be able to pray in their shrine below.

"Jews will not be able to pray here. And this is something no Jew can accept," he said.

Hana Bendcowsky is the program director for the Jerusalem Center for Jewish-Christian Relations. She is worried about the atmosphere in the area.

Posters warned that the pope was coming "to pass the Tomb of David to the hands of the Christian Church." Recently, Jewish troublemakers wrote anti-Christian slogans on a church. They also scrawled graffiti on the hotel where the pope stayed.

Pari said he was a bit afraid of what will happen after the pope's visit.

"If I have a possibility to meet personally the pope, I will ask him to please pray for us," Pari said. "Because when he leaves Israel the situation will change."
