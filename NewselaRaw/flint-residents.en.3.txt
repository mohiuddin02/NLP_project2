FLINT, Mich. — Ariana Hawk heated a bowl of bottled water in the microwave. She dipped a washcloth in the water. Then she wiped her 2-year-old son's red and itchy skin.

Hawk said she has been cleaning his body with bottled water since last summer. The boy's doctor does not want him bathing in the tap water. The doctor said there are problems with the tap water that comes out of the sink. 

The boy's name is Sincere Smith. His skin problem started with a rash on his stomach after Flint switched its water supply in April 2014. The city used to get its water from Lake Huron. To save money, the city began using water from the Flint River, which is polluted.

Hawk blames the water for the child's suffering.

"We get treated like … we don't matter," she said. "That's how it's been feeling."

## Metal Pipes And Polluted Water

Other people in Flint also feel frustrated. Some of then stopped using the water immediately after the change because of its smell, color and taste. Others continued to drink and cook with it.

People, pets, even plants have been affected.

People in Flint feel betrayed, worried, angry, sad and stressed. The city has a population of 99,000. About 40,000 people in Flint are poor.

Flint River water is poisoned with lead. It came from the metal pipes that carry the river water.

People who have been exposed to lead may have health problems. Lead can affect intelligence. It also can cause problems with speech, learning and behavior. Lead affects children more than adults.

The city has found a dangerous rise in lead in children's blood.

## Concerned About Children's Health

Pamela Battle has seven children. Before Monday, she was using water from her faucet to cook. She also used the water to make bottles for her two youngest children.

"We were drinking it regularly," Battle said. "The whole family."

Battle went to a school last Tuesday with her kids to get their blood checked for lead. She learned about lead poisoning and its effects on children.

"I'm really concerned now," she said.

Rick Snyder is the governor of Michigan. On Jan. 5, he declared an emergency in Flint.

The state is passing out free bottled water and water-testing kits. Members of the military from the Michigan National Guard have been sent to Flint to help.

President Barack Obama has declared an emergency in Flint. He ordered the national government to help.

## Free Water And Supplies

Throughout last week, people lined up to pick up free water and testing kits at fire stations. More free supplies have been passed out door-to-door.

Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said more people are needed to help.

In October 2015, the city began using Lake Huron water again. People are still worried that the water is poisonous. The water from the Flint River damaged the pipes. There needs to be a major fix of the pipes and water system.

Snyder has repeatedly apologized, but many say he has not done enough.

The apology is not going to help these kids, Hawk said. She said she does not know what dangers her children may face because of the lead.

Weaver said that people no longer trust the government. Right now, the water system needs to be fixed, she said. There also needs to be long-term help for people in Flint for the future, the mayor added.

"We didn't deserve to be in this position, in this situation," she said."And what happened here in Flint should never happen to any community."
