PRIVAS, France â€” In 1994, Jean-Marie Chauvet noticed air coming out of a crack in a rock. He and two other explorers went to investigate.

Chauvet is still amazed by what they discovered that day. They found a huge cave covered with ancient paintings of horses, bears and rhinos. The paintings were so bright, he said, it felt like the artists had just put down their paint and brushes and walked away.

French officials quickly closed the cave to the public. They worried that too many people in the cave could destroy the pictures. Even breathing on them could cause damage.

## New Cave Looks Just Like The Old Cave

Most modern humans will never get to see the paintings. But soon they will get to see the next best thing. France has spent about $60 million to make an almost perfect copy about a mile away. It includes more than 400 paintings of ancient animals, as well as handprints and carvings. Experts even copied the shapes of the rocks from the original cave.

The copy of the cave will open for people to visit this month.

Chauvet described what it was like to discover the cave. He spoke about digging through narrow tunnels guided only by a flashlight. Suddenly, another explorer saw two lines of red paint on a wall.

Chauvet said that the paintings looked like the artists were just there. The deeper the explorers went, the more amazing the paintings became.

"It's really an art gallery," Chauvet said.

## Protecting The Prehistoric Art

The cave was well-preserved because about 23,000 years ago, rocks fell in front of the entrance and hid it. The drawings stayed in perfect condition. Some experts even doubted that they were real.

"It was preserved, like in a jar," Chauvet said.

The paintings are believed to be between 30,000 and 37,000 years old. At the time they were found, scientists believed they were the oldest human cave drawings. Now scientists think that cave drawings in Spain were done earlier, at least 40,000 years ago.

For years, Chauvet fought with the French government over the caves.

Today the government calls the cave Pont d'Arc Cavern. It is not named after the men who found it, even though most people call it Chauvet's Cave. Chauvet is not happy about that and believes the French government owes him money for discovering it.

Pascal Terrasse is a French lawmaker in charge of the project to make the copy of the cave. He was the first government official to enter the cave after it was discovered. "We understood that we had to quickly protect it, and ensure that it was never opened to the public," he said.

## It Feels So Real!

Experts have recorded more than 1,000 paintings from the cave. Last year, it was listed on United Nations' World Heritage List of international treasures. A famous German filmmaker made a 3-D movie about the Chauvet Cave called "Cave of Forgotten Dreams."

The new cave tries to look as much like the original one as possible. Modern-day artists used the same tools and methods scientists believe were used 30,000 years ago.

The new cave feels strange at first, a bit like a theme park. Yet, France has made copies of cave paintings before. The most famous cave paintings in France are in the Lascaux Cave. A copy of the Lascaux paintings opened in the 1980s and about 300,000 visitors go there every year.

Organizers are also hoping for large crowds at the copy of Chauvet's Cave.

The next step, Terrasse said, could be a virtual, 3-D version that people around the world could see without visiting France. It would bring prehistory to life for generations of people, he said.
