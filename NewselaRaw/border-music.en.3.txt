SASABE, Ariz. — On a windy day near the Arizona border with Mexico, Glenn Weyant had everything he needed to make music. He had his cello bow and a hammer. But, he wasn't going to play a musical instrument. He plays the fence dividing the United States and Mexico.

Weyant's music is low-tech. He's turned a tin can into a microphone. He presses it against the fence. Wires attached to the tin lead to an amp to make the sound louder.

Desert grasses, some trees and rocks were his only audience.

"Nobody thought of the border wall as possibly anything other than something to separate people," he said.

He wants his music to spark conversation between people on both sides of the fence. Weyant says people view the fence with fear.

## Playing The Fence

The fence was built up to keep people from coming into the U.S. Often people try to enter the U.S. even if they aren't allowed to. Many are just searching for better jobs. Worries about terrorism have led to the fence getting built up even more.

For eight years, Weyant has tapped, banged and stroked the fence to produce haunting sounds. His songs can last a minute, or more than a half hour.

Weyant, 50, moved to Tucson 19 years ago when much of the border fence in southern Arizona was barbed wire. It seemed forbidden.

It's not against the law to touch it. But people tend to stay away from the fence anyway.

He had been drawn to unusual sounds his whole life. When he was a boy he enjoyed listening to the noise of his grandfather's electric fan. One day in 2005 he decided that he wanted to hear what sounds the fence could make.

In Nogales, he played a fence made of old helicopter landing pads. He'd record the noise from birds landing on top of the fence. The sounds of cars passing through the border checkpoint also got picked up.

In Sasabe, he created a delicate raspy sound. He played rusty mattress wires with his cello bow. Ranchers had stretched the wires between fence posts to keep their cattle from straying into Mexico.

## An Armed Audience

Weyant is more interested in creating effects than melodies. His songs can last a minute — or more than half an hour.

For the most part, Border Patrol agents have left him alone.

"I'm a white male playing the border wall," Weyant said. He says he believes that is why he's allowed to keep playing.

Some agents have greeted him with friendly curiosity.

"Why are you playing a wall?" one asked.

Another radioed his boss: "There's a guy playing the wall. Is he allowed to do that?"

A few agents have warned him about people on the southern side of the fence.

"Hey, you know they throw rocks," one told him.

"Usually," Weyant said, "when you play in a venue, you don't have people with guns watching you." Still, he's never had any dangerous run-ins with people on either side of the fence.

## Harsher Border Than Before

About once a month he gets to the border to play. He has spoken about his music at universities. Videos of his music are on YouTube. Musicians have added his border sounds to their own works. Weyant sells his music, and sometimes donates it.

Sections of the fence were once weak and thin. Now they've been built into tall, strong structures.

After the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, crews installed a fence near Sasabe made of steel columns.

Few have heard the border change, but Weyant has. The sounds, like the fence, are often harsher than before.

Weyant said the border wall is a fitting place to make music. It's haunted with stories.

"This section is where hundreds of people die," he said. The people sometimes starve to death or die from lack of water.

Dusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe. "Was it just a kid who jumped the fence? So many stories," Weyant said.
