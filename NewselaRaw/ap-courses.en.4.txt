ORLANDO, Fla. â€” Students go to college after they finish high school. Some students get started early. They take very hard classes in high school. These count as college classes.

They are called Advanced Placement classes. They are also known as AP classes for short. AP classes are harder than other high school lessons. Students take a test at the end. If they get a good grade, they will get college points. Then they can take fewer classes in college. Many students in the United States take AP classes.
