For months, they worked together in the cave where the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island may have lived. Slowly, painstakingly, they removed bucket after bucket of sand — 40,000 in all.

Navy archaeologist Steve Schwartz was leading the project. He was impressed by one of the California State University students taking part in the dig: Tom Holm, a filmmaker eager to make a documentary about the excavation of the cave.

Holm felt lucky to be working shoulder-to-shoulder with experts, impressed with their knowledge of the Native American woman who survived on the island for 18 years, abandoned and alone, in the 1800s.

## A Sudden Stop

In April 2012, they were finally getting close to the historical relics that would shed light on the real-life story of the woman who inspired "Island of the Blue Dolphins," which was one of  the 20th century's most popular novels for young readers and required reading in many California schools.

Then, Schwartz was ordered to stop digging by the commanders at the naval base on the island.

The archaeologist was especially shocked by a blunt question contained in the order: "Is the work you're doing out there legal?"

Something else stung as well — the shutdown grew out of claims made by Holm. Becoming concerned that the archaeological dig was breaking laws designed to protect cultural resources, Holm brought members of the Pechanga Native American tribe to the island.

The closure interrupted research on one of the most significant historical finds in California history. It led Schwartz, 57, to retire early in anger and frustration.

"It's a heartbreak. A travesty," Schwartz said recently. "We may never learn what archaeological riches that cave is guarding."

## Woman Of Legend

Very little is known about the Nicoleno Indians, who, in the early 1800s, suffered huge losses in repeated fights with Russian fur traders and Alaskan sea otter hunters.

After a particularly brutal battle in 1814, the Nicoleno population, which had been about 300, dropped to a few dozen.

In 1835, a ship was sent by Franciscan fathers at the Santa Barbara Mission to bring the few remaining Nicoleno back to the mainland. All but one made the trip aboard the Peor es Nada — loosely translated as "better than nothing."

According to legend, a woman jumped overboard and swam for shore after realizing that her baby had been left behind. A sudden storm forced the ship's captain to leave without her.

Her baby didn't survive, according to the legend.

"What actually happened to her remains a mystery," Schwartz said.

He was determined to find out.

## Finding The Cave

By 2012, Schwartz had already spent more than 20 years searching for the cave. Then, a breakthrough — the precise location of the case was confirmed in the notes of a 19th century government surveyor. One of his field stations on the island was, he wrote, "100 yards eastward of the large cave formerly inhabited by a wild Indian woman who lived there alone for 18 years."

Schwartz discovered the cave — 20 feet high, 75 feet long and packed with sand — under a rock overhang. Digging out the sand, Schwartz and his team uncovered two sets of initials and a date etched near the cave's mouth: "September 11, 1911." They also found two glass bottles, left by late 19th century sailors.

At first, Holm was excited to be taking part in the dig, led by Schwartz and Rene Vellanoweth, Holm's archaeology professor at Cal State.

Holm's views began to change after he met with Pechanga elders who questioned the archaeologists' explanations of artifacts they had found. He also disliked T-shirts worn by Vellanoweth and his team members that said "San Nicolas Cave Archaeology." As Holm put it, "we did not have permission to do anything other than remove sand."

Later, teams of archaeology students were stunned by heated arguments between Holm and Schwartz and Vellanoweth in the cave and elsewhere on the island.

## A "Wasps' Nest"

Eventually, Holm invited three members of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians to accompany him on a tour of the cave. A few weeks later, the tribe sent letters demanding that the Navy stop archaeological research in the cave and at 549 other sites across the island.

Now, the cave is closed indefinitely. Its fate is being negotiated between the Navy and the Pechanga tribe, which is claiming a connection with the island's mysterious ancient people, who for 8,000 years survived eating mostly shellfish, sea lions, small fish and roots.

"We're only trying to do what's right by our ancestors," Mark Macarro, the tribe's chairman, said in an interview. "We must ensure that all applicable federal laws are followed."

Among the losers in the dig shutdown is Holm himself, who says he invested $100,000 in a film project that may never be completed.

Holm, 53, said he didn't know that bringing Pechanga tribal members to San Nicolas would stir up a "wasps' nest." Still, he says he believes the Navy made the right decision.

## The Mystery Remains

Schwartz has retired, but said he wishes the research could go on. "If the Navy hadn't stopped us, I'd still be out there continuing the research," he said.

For now, at least, the mystery of the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island will remain unsolved.

In the years after she was left behind, fishermen occasionally reported seeing a person running along the deserted island's windy beaches.

In 1853, the woman — about 50 years old — was skinning a seal and living in a nearby cave when she was found by Santa Barbara fur traders.

She sailed to Santa Barbara with them and died seven weeks later of dysentery. On her deathbed, she was baptized and named Juana Maria.

She is buried at the Santa Barbara Mission. One hundred and sixty-two years after her death, she remains as alone and mysterious as ever.
