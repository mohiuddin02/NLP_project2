California has been in a drought for quite awhile — and it's causing major problems for the nation's top producer of fruits and vegetables.

In 2014, the drought forced California farmers to stop using 500,000 acres of land, resting the soil in an attempt to increase moisture levels. Experts now say that farmers might need to rest twice as much land in 2015.

"2015 is going to be significantly worse than 2014," said Richard Howitt, an agriculture expert at the University of California in Davis.

## Not Enough Winter Relief

Winter is California's wet season, but this year, it did not bring any relief. Though California is the third-largest state in landmass, nearly all of the state is abnormally dry at best, and in an exceptional drought at worst.

California has experienced some level of drought for the last few years. "It doesn't look like it's going to be ending anytime soon," meteorologist Jason Meyers said.

Wendy Fink-Weber is the senior director of communications at Western Growers Association, a California-based trade organization. She says an estimated 17,000 farm jobs were lost in 2014.

Fink-Weber says that other states can start growing some of the crops California will not be able to produce, but only the ones that have quick growing cycles. For crops like almonds, it can take three to seven years of work before the first harvest is ready.

If California farmers decide to rest the land where almonds are grown, they might have to rip out the trees and start over from scratch.

Fink-Weber says farmers will try to avoid doing anything that extreme.

"You can have a plan where you just want to keep them alive," Fink-Weber said. "The yield will be pretty puny, smaller fruit, you have less of it. But you can keep the trees alive. … And that's probably what they're planning to do right now, but some of them will have to be destroyed."

## The Drought That Won't Quit

California is not new to droughts. The state has gone through several recent dry periods, said Thomas Harter, a professor in the department of land, air and water resources at UC Davis.

But this drought has gone on longer than most, so California has started using pools of water located below the Earth's surface. These natural storage places are known as groundwater reservoirs and they are very difficult to restore.

Farmers can usually count on two other natural water sources, surface reservoirs and melting layers of condensed snow called snowpack. This year's snowy season left California with just 6 percent of its typical snowpack.

The disturbing lack of snow prompted California to put water restrictions in place. The state aims to cut water use 25 percent, but the restrictions do not apply to farmers.

Professor Harter says that even though this year was a tough time to have a small snowfall, the snowpack and surface reservoirs can bounce back with just one good season. For example, he said snowpack recovered well in 2011 after the 2007-09 drought.

"We had a huge snowpack," he said. "I was skiing at the end of June. There were 8 feet of snow at 7,500 feet of elevation.

"The (surface) reservoirs were full to the brim by the end of 2011."

## What's Happening With The Groundwater?

Though vast in comparison with the state's surface reservoirs, the groundwater reservoirs take much longer to return to normal levels. And those groundwater reservoirs are getting sucked up, Harter said.

In a typical year, farmers use about 32 million acre-feet of water and another 8 million acre-feet of water goes to cities. Groundwater usually makes up 12 million to 15 million acre-feet of those totals, but Harter says he has seen a big jump in recent years. Now groundwater makes up 20 million to 25 million acre-feet of total water use.

It doesn't look like that's going to change anytime soon.

"We have a significant amount of groundwater left in the state," Harter said. But "we'll have additional thousands of wells dry out this year because of this additional drought," he added.

## Balancing Crops

Howitt says drilling new wells could reach additional pockets of groundwater, but it is an expensive process. A new well could cost $250,000 and the wait could be months.

Farmers must think differently about water for both the short term and long term, Howitt says. He reminds farmers to not to put all of their eggs in one basket.

Howitt says it's OK for farmers to raise some crops that need a lot of water and make them a good living. They just need to balance things out by raising other crops that require less water. That way, they will still be able to make money as droughts come and go.
