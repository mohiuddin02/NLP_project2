<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140221_SILVER.jpg" />CHICAGO â€” Silver has long been known for its ability to kill some of the nasty microbes that can make people sick. In hospitals, it's used to help burn victims, and to combat germs on medical equipment. It can even wipe out dangerous "superbugs" that have grown resistant to traditional antibiotics.

Now, companies are profiting on consumers' fear of germs. They're adding the tiny, powerful silver particles everywhere. They're on cutting boards, underwear, yoga mats, running shirts, socks and an expanding array of other "antibacterial" goods.

Such products are made possible by recent advances in technology that allow manufacturers to create nano-sized silver and put it into various materials. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter; a human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide.

But some scientists and environmental watchdog groups say putting nanosilver to widespread use may pose risks. No one knows how heavy exposure to the particles may affect human health or the ecosystem in the long run.

## "Explosion Of Products"

They also worry that silver may lose its power to fight infections. Bacteria could become more resistant, like they have with other antibiotic drugs and with triclosan, an ingredient added to antibacterial soaps, make-up and other store-bought goods.

"Some humans are quite frightened of bacteria, and the tendency to over use silver is likely," said Samuel Luoma, in a report published by the Pew Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies. Luoma was a researcher for the Geological Survey.

"What concerns me is the explosion of products which we don't know are effective and that are not necessary," Luoma said. "It's important to prove it's worth taking the risk before we put it in the environment."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began requiring nanosilver manufacturers to register their products, saying the particles could pose different risks than regular silver. But critics, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, say the agency's process is flawed. It allows the products to be sold in stores several years before safety studies are completed.

Consumers, meanwhile, often can't tell whether products contain nano-sized silver. Nanomaterials aren't required to be labeled.

"The presence of nanotechnology in consumer products has gone underground," said Emma Fauss, who in 2008 compiled an inventory of commercial nanotechnology products for the Pew Project. "Manufacturers shy away from labeling things in their products unless it's trendy." People tend to worry that if it's labeled, it could be dangerous.

Silver kills germs when it oxidizes and releases silver ions, which are deadly to bacteria and yeast. Ancient civilizations used the metal to treat open wounds. American pioneers tossed silver coins into water storage barrels to keep water fresh.

Nanoparticles of silver can occur naturally, and are more powerful than bigger particles. Their large surface area relative to their mass increases the number of ions released.

## Unintended Consequences?

The silver industry says concerns about nanosilver are unnecessary. They point to silver's history as an effective antibiotic agent and note that most products use very small quantities.

It also says nano-sized silver has been used for more than a century. Nanoscale silver products have been safely used in swimming pools and to purify water since the 1970s, said Rosalind Volpe, executive director of the Silver Nanotechnology Working Group.

Swiss company HeiQ produces nano-sized silver, primarily for use in medical products. HeiQ's CEO, Carlo Centonze, says silver is the most researched and safest germ-killer on the market.  He also points out that it's a sustainable resource.

Some manufacturers also argue that treating textiles with silver nanoparticles benefits the environment. That's because it reduces the need for washing, allows for cleaning at lower temperatures and makes the products more durable.

In general, experts agree that humans can safely withstand fairly high doses of silver. What's new is that over the past decade, nanoparticles have been manipulated and put in places where silver has never been before.

Some fear the nanoparticles' small size and high surface area may have unintended consequences in the human body and the environment.

Animal studies and computer models have found that nanosilver and other nanoparticles can spread throughout the body into organs and tissues.

"Nanoparticles are little bundles of pure metal that can dissolve within the body if taken up as a particle," said Luoma.

"To me," he added, "the big risk is to ingest or breathe nanosilver when we don't know for sure if there's a unique risk in this form."

## Kills Both Good And Bad Bacteria

Nanosilver could upset the delicate balance of bacteria inside the digestive tract, said Marina Quadros, associate director of the Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology. Silver nanoparticles are effective in killing both good and bad bacteria,  she said.

Beyond the possible impact of nanosilver on human health, environmental concerns loom large.

Potential sources of nanosilver pollution include landfills, wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities. Several lab studies also have found that nanosilver can leach out of products when washed.

"If we start using tons of silver nanoparticles and a lot more are going down the drain, then we might start to have an effect we haven't seen in the past," said Amy Pruden. She is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech.

"Silver was and continues to be a valuable tool," said Andrew Maynard, director of the University of Michigan Risk Center. "There is a real fear that if we are indiscriminate with use, we could accelerate resistance."

But Maynard also said people may have taken the assumption of harm too far, in the absence of more concrete evidence. Using nanosilver in a product may make sense if it serves a medical purpose and proves effective, he said.

Instead of just being a gimmick to sell products, it should be something that will benefit people, Maynard said. "We've survived for many years without having antimicrobial shirts and tools."
