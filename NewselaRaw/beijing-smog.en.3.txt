BEIJING, China — Many people in this city took a vacation from the smog on Tuesday. They wanted to be somewhere else as the Chinese capital launched its first red alert for pollution. Schools closed, factories stopped their work and half of the cars were kept off the streets. 

This was the first time pollution has triggered a red alert. An alert is announced when weather forecasters think there will be heavy pollution for 72 hours straight.

Dangerous smog has continued here even though the Chinese government has promised to clean it up. Smog is a mixture of pollution and fog. It comes from years of fast growth. China has been building new cities and factories at great speed. Most of the smog is blamed on power plants that use coal. Cars, construction and factory work are also to blame.  

## Masks Help To Keep Out Dirt

"This is modern life for Beijing people. We wanted to develop, and now we pay the price," Beijing office worker Cao Yong said during a break from work.

A gray, soupy haze surrounded Beijing's buildings. Convenience stores sold masks that remove some dirt from the air. Health-food stores sold pear juice as a traditional Chinese medicine for the lungs.

From Tuesday through Thursday, schools were closed. Some people grumbled about the closings. A few non-Chinese schools sought permission to reopen Wednesday.

## Clean Air Is Many Miles Away

A large number of Beijing residents posted online that they planned to escape the gloom. They needed to travel far, however, because nearly all of China's northeast was affected. Many cities were even worse than Beijing.

After hearing of the school closings late Monday, Beijing resident Jiang Xia decided to leave town. She booked tickets for a 2,000-mile flight to Kunming. Compared with Beijing, it is a relatively clean city in southwestern China. She brought along her 8-year-old daughter who she said suffers nosebleeds in the smog. She and her daughter quickly packed before dawn Tuesday for their flight.

"But when we arrived in Kunming and breathed in this clean, fresh air, I was very glad I made this move," Jiang said.

The pollution reached dangerous levels in some parts of Beijing Tuesday. It was expected to get even worse before improving Thursday.  

## Many People Work From Home

This city of more than 22 million people is taking several steps to cut the pollution. It is stopping some factories from operating for some time. Beijing is also only letting people use their cars every other day. 

Some businesses closed. Others said workers could do their jobs from home.

One man from Beijing was taking advantage of the empty streets. He strolled around while snapping pictures. 

"I like this kind of haziness," he said. "It gives a blurry feeling and makes you feel like you're in a dream."

## Smog Shortens Lives, Study Says

In the past, there have been periods of severe smog in Beijing without a red alert. Officials said at the time they did not think the pollution would be that bad. Some critics said officials just wanted to avoid an alert so people would not get angry. 

China's polluted air has been bad for people's health. Experts say it causes more than 1 million people each year to die younger than they might otherwise.  

China is the world's biggest emitter of carbon. When people burn oil, gas and coal, carbon goes into the air. China plans to upgrade coal power plants over the next five years. It should help the problem. Emissions are expected to keep rising until around the year 2030. After that, they should go down.

China has strengthened its rules on emissions. It has also put a great deal of money into solar, wind and other renewable energy. The country, however, still depends on coal for more almost two-thirds of its power.
