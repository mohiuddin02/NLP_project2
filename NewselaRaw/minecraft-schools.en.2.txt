He didn't need to search Wikipedia for historical information or look through old news videos on YouTube. Instead he is building it with the help of one of the world's hottest video games: "Minecraft."

"It's really a great visual tool for presenting our knowledge, just like you would use something like PowerPoint to show off your research," said Arie Estrin, who is 12 years old. "That's what we do with 'Minecraft.' It's a good way to channel your thoughts into understanding how something might have actually looked or happened."

A game like "Minecraft" might seem more appropriate for the family room than for the classroom. Still, more and more teachers are using its creative power to teach students subjects from history to science.

## More Than 100 Million Users

It's part of a movement that aims to inspire kids through familiar and well-loved technology. Teachers are using games such as "Assassin's Creed" to illustrate the American Revolutionary War. They are using "World of Warcraft" to encourage creative writing. Nothing has had the impact of "Minecraft," which has more than 100 million registered users worldwide.

"It's virtual Legos," said Zack Gilbert. He is a sixth-grade teacher in Normal, Ill., who is an expert on gaming in education. When parents question him about using video games in class, he asks them if they played Legos as a kid.

"That's what this is, except it's virtual and there's more building and creating than you could ever do (in the real world)," Gilbert said.

"Minecraft" was the brainchild of Markus Persson. He is a Swedish game designer who loved the simple graphics and the creative play of the games when he was young. "Minecraft" lets users build almost anything they can imagine out of multicolored cubes. It was released in 2009.

The results are often stunning. YouTube is filled with guided tours of entire worlds made with "Minecraft." The worlds range from university libraries and New York City buildings to fantasy lands.

Northwestern University student Ben Rothman built his school's campus on "Minecraft."

## A Life Of Gaming Pays Off

Rothman had been spending 20 hours a week playing video games. "I figured, 'I'm going to do this anyway. Why don't I do something that will let me play but also get something out of it?'" he said.

That basically answers the question why "Minecraft" has caught on at hundreds of schools worldwide. Joel Levin is a former teacher who helped create a version of the game for teachers. He said his young daughter picked up math skills such as estimation and proportion by building a "Minecraft" house.

"The secret sauce is that kids are engaged," said Levin, whose company, TeacherGaming, has sold the "MinecraftEdu" version of the game to 2,500 schools around the world. "They love it. They want to do it."

Some kids want to play so much that they sign up for weekend or summer classes that use "Minecraft." Dana Stewart at Northwestern University has her students build ancient Egyptian structures with the game. The project makes them think about design issues and building materials.

"It's an experience you can't replicate any other way," Stewart said. "It's kind of, sort of, like walking through it in real life."

## "Make Your Imagination Fly"

The idea is to use a game that kids love to introduce them to real-world science and engineering problems, said Jana Sebestik. She is with the University of Illinois.

"Middle school is the place you can catch a kid and create enthusiasm," she said.

Fifth-graders at Quest Academy in Palatine, Ill., use the game as part of their lesson on J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit." Since November, students have been building their own fantasy worlds — complete with virtual dragons — and writing about their adventures.

"'Minecraft' is a nice way to make your imagination fly a little bit better," said Amelia Landau. She is 11. "If you want to create a huge sculpture, you can do that easily with thousands upon thousands of materials."

Maria Cipollone is a graduate student at Temple University. She found that "Minecraft" helps students develop math skills, such as estimating proportions. Unfortunately, it still doesn't boost their math test scores.

Dan Rezac, who is with the Northbrook school, said "Minecraft" can be amazing.

"With 'Minecraft,' they can build anything," he said. They can learn social skills so they can work together with other people, who may not be in the same room. They can build worlds and lands and objects. They can even re-create the human body so they can test diseases on it.

There's no end to what a kid can do on "Minecraft," he said.
