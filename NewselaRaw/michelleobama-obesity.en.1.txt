WASHINGTON â€” Shortly after she launched her anti-obesity campaign more than three years ago, Michelle Obama signaled she would take on advertising for snacks, soft drinks, sugary cereals and fast food aimed at children.

The foods have been blamed for making many American kids overweight, or even obese.

Since Obama launched "Let's Move!" in February 2010, White House officials have insisted that working with the food business is the only way to end childhood [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) in a generation. That is the first lady's goal.

She denounced ads that use cartoon characters to push junk food to children. She bluntly told executives of food companies "to step it up" to improve the foods they sell to children.
## Guidelines On Selling Food To Kids

Obama and White House officials promoted a federal effort to come up with voluntary marketing guidelines for the food business. Marketing is how a company sells its products, like commercials on television.

But when food and media companies fought against the guidelines in 2011, the first lady went silent. It wasn't until earlier this year, after the guidelines had been blocked, that Obama resumed her call for more responsible ads.

Nutrition advocates disagree over how to rein in food and beverage company practices that they believe contribute to obesity. The companies spend about $1.8 billion each year on selling to kids.

Obama prefers persuasion. She has used her celebrity as the nation's first lady to reward companies that join her campaign to encourage children to eat healthier and exercise more. And she has avoided public fights that could pit her against the companies.

Administration officials say she has notched some notable successes. They blame Congress for killing the marketing guidelines.

But some who see themselves as Obama's allies in the fight against obesity disagree. They believe her desire to create partnerships with industry kept her quiet when her voice would have counted most.

"The White House got cold feet," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. He supported the guidelines. "It sort of undermines everything that the first lady was doing."
## Limiting Food Ads To Children

Food companies did support a requirement that restaurant menus list calorie information. And the first lady rallied support for a 2010 law that expanded the [free school lunch program](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch) and set nutritional standards for food sold in schools.

But many public health advocates believe a more forceful approach is needed to limit food ads.

Obama has worked through the Partnership for a Healthier America, which was set up to get pledges from food companies to fight childhood obesity. The companies have agreed to improve children's menus and cut calories.

The organization, however, has secured only a few pledges to change the way the companies advertise food. Obama is urging companies to limit their ads aimed at kids.

A report by the prestigious Institute of Medicine found in 2005 that television advertising influenced children to seek out unhealthy foods.

"This is one of the easiest areas where we could take action and have a very powerful effect," said Dale Kunkel, who studies the effect of advertising on children.

In 2009, Congress approved a measure to set up a group to write voluntary nutrition standards for products advertised to children. The White House monitored the group's progress. So did the food industry.
## Food Firms Fight Federal Guidelines

General Mills Chief Executive Kendall J. Powell met with White House officials. In a letter to the White House in September 2010, he argued that no evidence linked obesity to ads. General Mills sells such cereals as Cheerios, Lucky Charms and Count Chocula.

Powell suggested the group should "be put on hold" while food companies improved the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, which was set up in 2006.

Still, the group released draft guidelines in April 2011. Foods advertised to children should have minimal levels of sugar, salt and fat, and make a "meaningful contribution" to diets by containing nutrients.

The group proposed that its standards apply to all ads aimed at children 17 and younger.

Public health groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics embraced the guidelines. But food manufacturers, television companies and trade associations attacked them.

A July 2011 meeting at the White House included General Mills' Powell and top executives from Nestle, Kellogg, Disney, Time Warner and Viacom, the parent company of the Nickelodeon network. The companies all supported the first lady's anti-obesity initiative. But they opposed the group's guidelines.

Two days later, top food makers rolled out a more rigorous version of their own effort. The companies pledged to limit the levels of sugar, salt and fat in products targeted at children.

The group gave itself until the end of this year to make the changes.
## SpongeBob SquarePants Popsicles

The industry program does not limit sponsorships of after-school events or on product packages, as the guidelines had proposed. And it applies only to foods advertised on programs for which at least 35 percent of viewers are children under 12.

A study by Yale University found that half the food and drink ads seen by children in 2011 were not covered by the pledge because they aired on shows, such as "Family Guy," that are seen by both children and adults.

For a fee, Nickelodeon lets the Popsicle company sell a frozen pop that looks like the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. In 2011, the network aired a quarter of the food ads viewed by children ages 2 to 11, according to Yale.

Nickelodeon recently turned down a request by four Democratic senators to set stricter nutrition standards for the products that are advertised on its network.
