WASHINGTON - It's 10 a.m. Monday. The call center of Connecticut's new insurance exchange is busy with questions.

The insurance exchange was set up under the Affordable Care Act, the federal health law. About 25 operators in blue shaded cubicles are talking on telephone headsets. A dozen more callers wait on hold.

"It's controlled chaos," said David Lynch, the call center manager.

The call centers are getting more traffic than expected. People were supposed to be able to shop for health insurance online. The federal government set up healthcare.gov for people to browse and sign up for plans that would cover their expenses when they go to the doctor or hospital. However, the website has been working poorly.

## Obama Gives Out The Number

President Barack Obama mentioned call centers like this last week. He said they were one of several alternatives for people having trouble getting health insurance through healthcare.gov. "The call centers are available," he said, giving the telephone number.

But experts who fight for the rights of everyday people say the centers were never meant to be used that way. They were only supposed to be an option to help some people understand their choices.

"The telephone call center is not a realistic alternative to the website," said Adam Linker. He studies health care issues for the North Carolina Justice Center. Healthcare.gov was supposed to be the place to easily shop and compare plans. There is no way to do that on the phone, he said.

Others agree that the call centers' representatives can provide only limited help to those who want to shop for coverage. That's because some states have dozens of plans to choose from. The process could take hours to sort through on the telephone. The representatives are also having trouble getting information from healthcare.gov. So it is difficult for them to check people's information.

## Operators Stuck With Same Delays

Call center operators face many of the same delays as customers, said John Foley. He is a lawyer with a group paid by the government to help people figure out how to sign up.

"We are facing the same glitches on the telephone," he said. He tells people to wait until the website becomes easier to use.

There are 17 call centers with more than 10,000 trained representatives. They are managed through a $530 million one-year contract with a company called Vangent. States such as Connecticut have set up their own state marketplaces. They also have their own call centers.

Timothy Jost is a law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. He said that young and healthy people may be less motivated to sign up. They probably won't wait through hours-long phone calls, he said.

The situation is easier in the Hartford call center. Connecticut has set up its own exchange. Its website is also working. Since Access Health CT opened on Oct. 1, an average of 1,300 people a day have called or asked for help. Over 10,000 people in Connecticut have started forms to get insurance. More than 4,200 are now in plans.

## Scary To Shop For Insurance

"Telephone assistance is something that people really want," said Lynn Quincy with Consumers Union. "Many people are intimidated by the task of buying insurance on their own."

Benjamin Hunnicutt manages the Hartford call center. He said most callers are older or poorer than people using the website. The top questions are about costs and how to figure out what discount they may receive from the government. The operators also can tell callers which doctors and hospitals they will be able to visit with a particular plan.

Some do sign up over the phone. It can take about 50 minutes. The exchange did not know how many had signed up online.

Signing up by telephone is easy in Connecticut. Just three companies are selling plans there. In states such as California and Florida where more than a dozen companies are selling plans, that could take much longer, Hunnicutt said.
