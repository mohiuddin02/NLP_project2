A gunman opened fire on a group of worshippers gathered inside Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday. Nine people were killed, including the church's minister, the Reverend Clementa Pinckney.

For many, it was as though history was repeating itself. The church had already seen more than its fair share of troubles throughout its history. It was founded by worshipers fleeing racism and was burned to the ground once after a failed slave revolt. For years its meetings were held in secret after all-black services were outlawed. It was jolted by an earthquake in 1886. Black leaders have spoken there and have led marches from its steps. For nearly 200 years it has been at the center of black struggles in Charleston.

"It's not just a church. It's also a symbol ... of black freedom," historian Robert Greene said. "That's why so many folks are so upset tonight, because it's a church that represents so much about the rich history and tradition of African-Americans in Charleston."

## Church's Ties To Southern History

In Charleston, the church is affectionately known as "Mother Emanuel." It is a place in which people take pride, said the Reverend Stephen Singleton, who was minister there from 2006 to 2010.

The church is "a very special place," Reverend Pinckney said two years ago. It has been "tied to the history and life of African-Americans since about the early 1800s."

The church was founded by Pastor Morris Brown in 1816. At the time, most of Charleston's black population were still held as slaves. Brown had become weary of the racism he experienced in Charleston's churches. Around 4,000 people, or three-quarters of the city's black community, quickly joined his new church.

From the beginning, the church was a center for the anti-slavery struggle. The city's white population soon became suspicious and fearful of the church. Worshippers were sometimes arrested.

Whites had some reason for alarm. Denmark Vesey was a leader in the church. Vesey fiercely preached that the enslavement of African-Americans would be punished with death. In 1822 he and other leaders began plotting a slave uprising.

## Uprising Leads To Restrictions

The revolt was planned for June 16. However, a slave named George Wilson told his master about the plot. Vesey and about 36 others were put on trial and executed. Another 60 were forced to leave the city.

Following the uprising, South Carolina introduced new laws aimed against African-American churches. Black churchgoers were no longer allowed to hold services without a white person present. The Charleston A.M.E. membership was disbanded. Their church building was burned to the ground.

The A.M.E. membership soon began holding services in secret. Then came the Civil War (1860â€“1865) after which the slaves were freed. The A.M.E. membership was able to worship openly again and a new church was built on Calhoun Street.

In 1886, the wooden building was destroyed in an earthquake. The church's members replaced it with the beautiful building seen today.

By the 20th century, Emanuel A.M.E. was once again a center of black struggle. A civil rights movement had sprung up, which aimed to win equal rights for African-Americans.

Booker T. Washington spoke at the church in 1909. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech there in 1962. In 1969, Coretta Scott King led a march from Emanuel A.M.E.'s steps.

Civil rights protesting in Charleston "was almost always centered around that church," Greene said.

## Churches Have Been Targets

But many were very shocked by the recent shooting.

The suspected gunman, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, was captured less than 24 hours after the shooting, police said.

"If we're not safe in the church, God, you tell us where we are safe," mourners said.

African-American churches have been targeted before. The 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, was bombed in 1963, for example. Over the years, many other black churches have also been attacked.

Even so, the attack should be seen as a single crime, Reverend Singleton said. It should not be seen as part of a pattern.

Emanuel A.M.E. "won't be destroyed because of this," he said. "Chances are it'll probably come out stronger."
