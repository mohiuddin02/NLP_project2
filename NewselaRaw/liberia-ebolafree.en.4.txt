JOHANNESBURG â€” Liberia has been declared free of Ebola.

More people died of the deadly disease in Liberia than in any other country.

The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the danger for Liberia is not over. Other countries in West Africa still struggle with Ebola. Infected people could go to Liberia and spread the deadly disease.

## It Was A Very Bad Year

The Ebola outbreak began in Guinea in December 2013. It spread to Sierra Leone and then skipped across the border into Liberia.

The first case in Liberia was reported in late March 2014. At first, only a few people caught the virus. By June, Ebola was making people sick in the capital city of Monrovia. It marked the first time Ebola ever spread to a city with a lot of people living close together.

Thousands died from the disease.  In August and September, 300 to 400 people got Ebola every week. For a while, health experts feared Ebola was out of control. They worried it could not be stopped.

In October, the number of infections finally began to drop. The last victim was buried on March 28, 2015. It was almost exactly one year after the first case in Liberia.

## Many People Got Sick Very Fast

More than 11,000 are believed to have died from Ebola in West Africa. More than 4,700 of them died in Liberia alone. It has been the world's worst outbreak of Ebola.

The virus spread so quickly from people crossing over borders. Also, in West Africa, it is the custom for friends and family members to touch the dead person before they are buried. People traveled to other countries to attend funerals and returned home with Ebola. They made other family members and neighbors sick.

Patients also sometimes thought they had other illnesses. Many of them did not go to the doctor quickly enough.

Many of those who died were health workers, community nurses and healers. In Liberia, 375 health workers got sick from Ebola and 189 died. More than 860 health workers became sick in the area. Of the 860, more than 500 of them died.

Ebola treatment centers had more sick people than they could take care of. In many cases, there was no room inside to care for them safely.

## Liberians Never Gave Up

To help stop the spread of the virus, schools were closed. Public gatherings were stopped. Ambulances struggled to reach patients in time. In some cases, family members carried their loved ones to hospitals in wheelbarrows.

For many months, the world reacted too slowly.

At one point, there were not enough hospital beds for Ebola patients in Liberia.

Ending Ebola in Liberia was a huge achievement, the WHO said. It praised Liberia for never giving up and having courage. Doctors and nurses treated patients even when there was not enough protective clothing.

The WHO also gave credit to volunteers. They worked for no pay at treatment centers, on burial teams or as ambulance drivers. They felt responsible to help end Ebola. The WHO said they brought hope back to people.

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is the president of Liberia. She said it will take many years for the pain and grief from all the deaths to heal.

The American government also sent a letter. It said the world must not let Ebola return to Liberia.

"We must not let down our guard," it said.
