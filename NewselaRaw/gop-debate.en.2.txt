CLEVELAND, Ohio — The leading Republican presidential candidates gathered for their first debate last Thursday. The crowded race now features 17 candidates, so for many it was their first chance to stand out. Each is hoping to win their party's nomination as the candidate who will run against a Democrat in next year's general election. To get to that point they must first compete against other Republicans in the primaries.

On Thursday many of the candidates chose to attack one candidate in particular, billionaire Donald Trump. Despite having no political experience, Trump is now the top-polling Republican contender. The candidates accused Trump — and each other — of straying from conservative principles. In general, conservatives support old-fashioned values and traditional ways of doing things.

## Worried About Trump

Trump made news Thursday before even uttering a single word. The candidates were asked if they would pledge to support whoever ultimately wins the party's nomination for president, as well as rule out an independent bid. Trump raised his hand to indicate he would not.

"I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee," he said. When pressed, however, he repeated: "I will not make the pledge at this time."

Republicans fear that the popular Trump could end up running as a third-party candidate if he does not win the Republican nomination. They worry that he could take away votes from the Republican nominee during the general election, and so make it easier for a Democrat to win. At this point in time, the most likely Democratic nominee is Hillary Rodham Clinton. She was secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and before that she was a U.S. senator from New York state. She was also first lady for eight years when her husband, Bill Clinton, was president.

## Sorting Out 17 Candidates

Trump's surprise ascent has complicated an already unruly Republican field. Debate officials separated the 17 candidates into two groups to provide some order.

The top 10 candidates, ranked based on national polls, took the stage — with Trump at the center — before a crowd of 5,000. Seven others debated earlier on the same stage.

For most Americans, it was their first real look at many of the Republicans contenders.

Mostly the candidates promised to push the country in a more conservative direction if elected. Most said they would reverse many of President Barack Obama's key accomplishments if they made it to the White House.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush had been seen as the party's most likely nominee earlier in the campaign. Bush has slipped in the polls over the last several months, in part because many Republicans do not consider him to be conservative enough. On Thursday, he sought to regain his footing.

## Bush And Trump Clash

"I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively," he said. "We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles" in the right way.

Bush also carefully addressed the questions of Trump's ascent in the polls. He indirectly referred to comments Trump has made about Mexicans, which many people found racist.

"Mr. Trump's language is divisive," and not good for Republicans, Bush said. "We're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message."

Trump, though, made no apologies.

"We don't have time for tone. We have to go out and get the job done," Trump said.

Ohio Governor John Kasich said Trump had hit a nerve among Americans. People "who want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake," he said.

## Businesswoman Fiorina Won't Pull Punches

"Now, he's got his solutions — some of us have other solutions," he said, before discussing his record as a governor and congressman.

The only woman on either stage was businesswoman Carly Fiorina, who appeared in the earlier debate. Fiorina outshone her rivals with sharp and lively attacks on Hillary Clinton and former Governor Bush, who many still think is the most likely Republican nominee.

"We need a nominee who is going to throw every punch, not pull punches, and someone who cannot stumble before he even gets into the ring," Fiorina said.

Trump had tried to play down his debut, saying he did not have as much experience debating as others. Still, his presence dominated the night, even when he was not on the stage.

## Trump Insults Women? "It's Kidding"

In the prime-time debate, Trump sparred with moderator Megyn Kelly of Fox News. Kelly asked Trump whether insulting comments he had made about women in the past made him unelectable, particularly if he was pitted in the general election against Clinton.

Trump said people were wrong to take his comments seriously, and that it was a waste of his time to worry too much about the effect of such remarks. "It's fun, it's kidding, we have a good time," Trump said. "If you don't like it, I'm sorry."

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie got into the nastiest fight of the night. The two argued over whether the U.S. government was wrong to secretly record millions of phone calls and email messages. The Kentucky senator believes they were.

When Paul said he wanted to collect records from terrorists, not innocent Americans, Christie called it a "ridiculous answer." Christie accused Paul of "just blowing hot air" and talking too much about the issue for political purposes.
