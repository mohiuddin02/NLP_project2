DETROIT â€” The Detroit Institute of Arts normally houses paintings. Now, the museum will house a very different sort of art.

Some of the world's greatest artists like Vincent Van Gogh will share their home with Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.

"Watch Me Move: The Animation Show," is an exhibition that organizers are calling the biggest animation show ever created. It will have clips of Mickey Mouse, Bart Simpson and other famous cartoons. It will also have lesser-known animated works from over the past century.

The show puts the original cartoonists together with modern artists. Then it adds in big studios such as Walt Disney, which used a lot of cartoon characters in its movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" and Pixar.

## Wait, Which Nemo?

"Watch Me Move" takes its name from the movie "Little Nemo."

No, not "Finding Nemo." "Little Nemo" is more than 100 years old. The movie has an on-screen message inviting viewers to "Watch Me Move."

At the show, visitors can look at 100 animated clips. It would take someone almost 12 hours to watch all of them.

The show includes all different types of animation, from hand-drawn to computer-generated. It's split into six sections meant to bring in art lovers and pop-culture fans alike.

Couches and chairs are placed around the show with headphones. It is designed to allow visitors to relax and watch the cartoons. Some may sit back and take their time. Some may only want to watch parts of the clips.

## From "Beginnings" To The Future

For people who want to learn more, the museum is offering a special pass.

The pass allows them to see the show as many times as they want to. It also lets them go to the related movies and talks.

One talk will be delivered by Leslie Iwerks, an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker. Her grandfather, Ub Iwerks, was an early animator for Disney. A clip of his is shown just after "Little Nemo" in the show's "Beginnings" section.

The "Beginnings" section is at the start (where else?) of the exhibition. It is about the first animated movies.

There is a lot to watch. But the show has more than movies.

Visitors can try an interactive video game. The show ends on a futuristic note.

## Eek! Creepy Crawling Spiders

In the "projection mapping" room, a program projects pictures on different surfaces. In one part of the room, light falls across jagged-edge shapes. The way the light hits makes it look like spiders are crawling all over the place.

The museum wanted to bring everyone together at the start of the show to learn about early animation. Then, people experience the art at their own speed before coming together again to learn about modern animation.

The goal is for people to enjoy the first and last parts of the exhibition together. They can explore the changes in technology over the years.

"This is where the technology is now," said Holly Harmon, who works at the museum. "When you walk into this room, you really don't know how it's done."

And as Porky Pig would say: "That's all folks."
