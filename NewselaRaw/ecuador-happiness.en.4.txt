## Will More Stuff Make People Happy?

Ehlers says many people have the wrong idea about being happy. They try to "live better." For most people "living better" means getting more money. It means buying more things.

Trying to "live better" never works, Ehlers says. You are never happy with what you have. You always want more. People just end up feeling unhappy.

Countries have a problem too, he said. They try to grow richer. They try to build more and more. All that building hurts the planet. We are making the air and water dirty.

## Thinking In Different Ways

We must start thinking differently, Ehlers said. We must find different ways to be happy. If we do not change, we will ruin our planet.

Ehlers' office has made television programs. They show people ways to be happy.

You might think everyone would like what Ehlers is doing. In turns out that is not true. Some people are angry at him.

## Will He Help Make People Happy?

They say what Ehlers is doing is silly. People cannot be told how to be happy, they say. They think Ehlers is just throwing away the country's money.

Ehlers says he is not spending a lot of money. He says what he is doing is very important.

People should be nicer to each other, Ehlers says. It would make the world a happier place.
