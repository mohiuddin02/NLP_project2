WASHINGTON, D.C. — After the massacre in Paris, France, last month, Lena Badr Abdelhamid's husband sat her down and warned her that the top suspect in the attack happened to share a name with the couple. Even the spelling of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the alleged mastermind of the attack, was the same.

Abdelhamid said she instantly recognized the likelihood that fellow Americans might target her just because she shared a name with a suspected terrorist.

## "Crimes That We Haven't Committed"

"I wonder often how long will we have to pay for crimes that we haven't committed. I immediately began to dread the hate crimes that were sure to follow," said Abdelhamid, 25, who works for a refugee agency in Washington, D.C.

The anti-Muslim hate speech that followed the Paris attacks has had a chilling effect on Muslims in the United States, according to interviews this week with Muslims across the country. Some women say they face a wrenching dilemma over whether to remove their headscarves. Students avoid walking across campus alone. And commuters in big cities say they have begun standing back on subway platforms for fear that a revenge-seeker will push them into the path of an oncoming train.

Older Muslims sense a depressing return to the days after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It reminds them of hateful voicemails, vandalized mosques and slurs shouted at the grocery store. Members of a younger generation who do not remember that era are getting a jarring introduction to a world where some presidential candidates call for bigotry, and social media platforms are plastered with calls for the death of an entire faith.

## More Tension After California Shooting

Things have gotten even more tense for U.S. Muslims. A Muslim couple in California went on a shooting rampage in California, killing 14 people and wounding 21 others. Before they went on their killing spree, the woman made a Facebook post pledging allegiance to the extremist group Islamic State. The group is trying to set up its own country governed by extreme Islamic law. The couple died in a shootout with police on Wednesday.

Aysha Khan, 20, said she has been dismayed over the years to see anti-Muslim attacks move from isolated incidents to the mainstream, fueled by anger over the rise of extremist groups such as the Islamic State. The group's fighters have taken over parts of Iraq and Syria, and were responsible for the Paris attacks.

Recently, Khan called her parents to tell them about a job interview that would require her to travel from Baltimore to Washington. Her father warned against taking the subway and offered to drive her. She refused.

"Ordinarily, I would feel like they were being paranoid, but they are actually not," she said.

## Fears Are Justified

Muslim advocacy groups and hate crime trackers say that those fears are justified.

The FBI's latest roundup of hate crime statistics, released recently, shows that only anti-Muslim incidents are on the rise; incidents involving other minorities declined in 2014. The number of anti-Muslim incidents grew from 135 in 2013 to 154 in 2014, according to the FBI's figures. Advocacy groups consider them on the low side because many more incidents go unreported. That number is expected to increase this year, as attacks by the Islamic State and other extremists stoke anti-Muslim sentiment.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has compiled lists of apparent revenge attacks. They include terror threats to Florida mosques, vandalism at a Nebraska mosque and shots fired at a Muslim family's home in Florida. The group also recorded hate graffiti targeting a Connecticut Muslim student, an arson attack on a Canadian mosque, a tweet threatening Michigan Muslims, and countless hate messages.

## Some Non-Muslims Are Supportive

CAIR reported that not long ago,"Middle Eastern" passengers were also removed from a flight because the crew felt 'uncomfortable." 

Muslims say they have been grateful to non-Muslims who have offered their support in interfaith services and in phone calls and emails of solidarity. The story of Jack Swanson went viral. The Texas boy donated the piggy-bank money he was saving for an iPad to a mosque vandalized in Pflugerville, Texas. Arsalan Iftikhar, a prominent Muslim magazine editor and human rights lawyer, mailed Jack an iPad with a note of thanks signed, "Love, The American Muslim Community."

But the feel-good stories are easily forgotten when politicians suggest a Christians-only refugee policy or that all Muslims should register with the government. Badi Ali is the religious leader, or imam, of a mosque in Greensboro, North Carolina. He said he tells nervous members of his congregation that the best approach for now is to keep a low profile.

## "Become Like The Palm Tree"

"You have to become like the palm tree. When the wind comes, you have to bow down a little bit until the wind goes away," Ali said.

By now, American Muslim groups have gone through the post-attack period enough times to have developed a playbook. First, they immediately issue a statement of condemnation. Then they sponsor an interfaith program. And finally they hold a news conference or go on TV to reinforce the teaching that Islam is a peaceful, tolerant religion.

But that approach just does not cut it anymore for many young Muslims. They argue that condemning deadly attacks as Muslims only reinforces the idea that there's something in common between the extremists and ordinary believers. They favor condemning the attacks as Americans, as human beings. They say the Muslim community should not go out of the way to "apologize" for behavior that's just as foreign to them as a violent white supremacist is to the majority of white Americans.

## "Guilty Until Proven Innocent"

"I saw an immediate trend of Muslims condemning the terrorist attacks," said Uzma Hussain, 23. Hussain herself has changed her routines since the Paris attacks. She has not been to the gym, because her hijab, the heard scarf some Muslim women wear, just makes her too conspicuous. She said she's "received a few looks at work." She pours out her feelings in journal entries.

"Here we go again, guilty until proven innocent. We might as well have every Muslim sign an affidavit stating that they are not a terrorist."
