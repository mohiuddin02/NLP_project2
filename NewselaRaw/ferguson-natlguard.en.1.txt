FERGUSON, Mo. â€” Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard to Ferguson early Monday, hours after police use tear gas to disperse protesters. The arrival of the National Guard followed a week of demonstrations against the fatal shooting of a unarmed black Missouri teenager by a white police officer.

In a statement, Nixon said the National Guard would help "in restoring peace and order." Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, has been filled almost nightly with angry, defiant crowds since 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed Aug. 9.

"These violent acts are a disservice to the family of Michael Brown and his memory," Nixon said. They are also a disservice "to the people of this community who yearn for justice to be served and to feel safe in their own homes."

Also on Sunday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a federal medical examiner to perform an autopsy on Brown to help determine how he died. An autopsy requested by his family found the teen was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. Results of a state-performed autopsy have not been released.

## Police Disperse Protesters

As night fell in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street and authorities pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas. Officials said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled flammable Molotov cocktails. The streets were empty well before a state-imposed curfew took effect at midnight.

"Based on the conditions, I had no alternative but to elevate the level of response," said Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is command in Ferguson.

At least two people were wounded in shootings by civilians, he said.

The circumstances surrounding Brown's death and a request by his family led to the Justice Department's decision to conduct another autopsy, agency spokesman Brian Fallon said Sunday. The results would be taken into account in the Justice Department's ongoing civil rights investigation into the shooting, Fallon said.

## Results Of Private Autopsy

Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner who conducted the private autopsy for the Brown family, told The New York Times that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown's skull. Baden said the position of the entry wound suggests his head was bent forward when he was shot.

Brown also was shot four times in the right arm, and all the bullets were fired into his front, Baden said.

A federally conducted autopsy "more closely focused on entry point of (bullets), defensive wounds and bruises" might help the Justice Department's investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor. A defensive wound is an injury that takes place while a person is defending himself.

A federal autopsy is "not that unusual," Weinstein added.

Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that nothing will be done in the case, Weinstein said.

## Clashes Before Midnight Curfew

Sunday's clashes in Ferguson erupted three hours before the midnight curfew imposed by a day earlier by Nixon.

Officers in riot gear ordered all protesters to leave. Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until they got hit by tear gas.

Protesters laid a line of concrete blocks across the street near a convenience store that was burned down last week. It was an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, but the vehicles easily plowed through. Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire. The crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.

Within two hours, most people had been cleared off, and the streets remained quiet as the curfew began.

Earlier in the day, Johnson said he had met members of Brown's family and the experience "brought tears to my eyes and shame to my heart."

"When this is over," he told the crowd, "I'm going to go in my son's room. My black son, who wears his pants sagging, who wears his hat cocked to the side, got tattoos on his arms, but that's my baby."

Johnson added, "We all need to thank the Browns for Michael. Because Michael's going to make it better for our sons to be better black men."

## Shooting Death Heightens Racial Tensions

The protests have been going on since Brown's death heightened racial tensions between the predominantly black community and the mostly white Ferguson Police Department. The demonstrations led to several run-ins between police and protesters and prompted Missouri's governor to put the state's highway patrol in charge of security.

Ferguson police waited six days to name the officer who shot Brown. They also released documents alleging that Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before he was killed. Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer did not know Brown was a robbery suspect when he encountered him walking in the street with a friend. Brown allegedly stole a $49 box of cigars.

Police have said little about what happened between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot. Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple bullets at him.

Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is a six-year police veteran with no previous complaints against him. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. The department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts.

About 150 people gathered in St. Louis on Sunday to show support for Wilson. Some members of the group, composed mostly of police and relatives of officers, carried signs urging people to wait for all the facts in the case before they make up their minds.
