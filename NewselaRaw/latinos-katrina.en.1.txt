PASCAGOULA, Miss. â€” Many hardworking Hispanics with skills in construction and roofing poured into the Gulf Coast for jobs after Hurricane Katrina, which hit 10 years ago this summer.

They would sleep in their trucks in parking lots, in tents and on the bare ground because there were no rooms to rent. They helped tremendously in rebuilding the coast.

Their nail guns pounded from sunup to sundown, seven days a week in the early months.

Without the Hispanic labor force, crawling out from under the debris would have taken considerably longer. These workers, many of them immigrants, were willing to endure conditions that many American workers might not have accepted.

## Flowing In To Help A Wounded Coast

They came from large cities around the United States and from Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona. They also came from home countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico and South and Central America. There are 21-plus Latin American countries or regions and today, each one of those is represented on the Gulf Coast, according to organizations that work with the community.

Many workers moved on. Early estimates from the Hispanic community were that south Mississippi's Hispanic population tripled to 60,000 (one-third of them living in the United States without documentation) and then settled closer to 30,000 in the years after the storm. Census figures list the numbers considerably lower, but there is much doubt that the census can accurately estimate the somewhat-elusive population.

Those who stayed have taken root and the population is growing, no matter how you count it.

When the construction jobs dried up, some Hispanics opened businesses in areas such as landscaping, real estate and auto sales. Some of the most popular businesses were restaurants and groceries, so they could have authentic, native food.

## Forging A Lasting Legacy After Disaster

Those who sent for their families have changed the face of the coast forever.

Census data showed that between 2010 and 2013 in Harrison County, Mississippi, the Hispanic population increased nearly 8 percent. In Hancock County, it was up 13.5 percent, and the boost was largest in Jackson County with a 15.5 percent jump.

In the Pascagoula-Gautier School District, the population of English learners more than doubled from 196 in 2005 to 463 in 2007.

In the following years, the district has seen a steady climb in enrollment that reached 708 this past school year, said Frank Catchings, director of federal programs for the district. While not all of these students are Hispanic, more than 90 percent of them are.

The Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, the Gulf Coast Latin American Association and El Pueblo stepped up to address the needs of the community, connecting new immigrants with local resources.

## Catering To Growing Hispanic Population

The Diocese of Biloxi in Mississippi has Catholic churches that now offer Mass in Spanish at nine services from Pascagoula to Wiggins. This year, the diocese has ordained two new priests from Mexico, bringing the number of Hispanic priests to five.

"They are very much better at taking care of the (Hispanic) community than I was," said the Rev. Paddy Mockler, pointing out jovially that he speaks Spanish with an Irish accent.

Mockler served after the storm at Our Lady of Fatima in Biloxi, where he saw the church attendance swell with Hispanics and then ease off. Thirty percent of the 380 families at Sacred Heart in Pascagoula are now Hispanic. The church has a Spanish service on Saturdays and offers classes in English as a second language. It and other parishes have for years taken turns hosting the annual feast day and pageant for Our Lady of Guadalupe and Saint Juan Diego.

But one of the more obvious changes has been in the schools along the coast, where the number of Hispanic students grows steadily.

Susan and Gustavo Santos lead a Hispanic mission church on the grounds of the much larger Crossroads Church of the Nazarene in Vancleave, Mississippi.

It's family friendly and lively, and the congregation has reached 100. They are pastors-in-training for the faith, and their mission church El Taller Del Maestro, which means the master's workshop, has grown to the point where there is now a sister church in Gulfport, Mississippi, with a congregation of 50 to 60.

## Pursuing The American Dream

Gustavo Santos came nine years ago, not because of Katrina, but for the work in shipyards and other industry. He had learned welding in high school in Puerto Rico. Susan Santos wanted to raise their children speaking English.

What has evolved for them is a new business, Quality Marine Staffing. The company is aided by the skilled Latino workers who came to the area during Katrina. Santos, with his connections in the community, now hires crews and connects them with local industry.

"We've been praying for this since 2012," Susan Santos said.

She said they want to offer benefits and fair wages, and "do everything legally and good."

And it happened. He processed the first payroll last month.
