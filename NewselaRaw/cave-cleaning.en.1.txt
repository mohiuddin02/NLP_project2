BAKER, Nev. — Down here in the stillness deep under the earth, the beam from Paul Kemp's headlamp slices through the gloom like a lighthouse beacon. It is his tool to unearth evidence of the explorers who have long descended into this strange world.

The 67-year-old retired rocket engineer uses his tiny brush with the care of an archaeologist. He gently clears away the brownish fluff and grit coating a clutch of icicle-like stalactites hanging from the ceiling of Lehman Cave.

It is man-made grime — clothing fibers, hair, dead skin and dust left by 28,000 annual visitors — and it's everywhere. He carefully collects his catch in a blue dustpan and puts it in a plastic bag the size of an office wastebasket. It's filling fast.

"Oh, my God," Kemp says. "These formations are terrible. They're simply covered with dust."

## Underground Housekeeping

Kemp and his 14-year-old son, Simon, are volunteers in a National Park Service program known as Lint Camp. They perform one of America's strangest natural housekeeping chores: cleaning a handful of caves popular with throngs of tourists.

The father-son team from Sandy, Utah, had joined several cavers — people who explore caves for fun. Together they left the warm outdoor sunlight to go down into this deep cave full of mysterious shapes and shadows. They entered a silent temple of limestone and marble. Inside, the temperature is a cool 52 degrees and bats often lurk, as do scorpions (without stingers) and tiny armored creatures called springtails.

Wearing kneepads over their jumpsuits, the pair duck beneath low-hanging ledges to reach a bedroom-sized area known as the Wedding Chapel. There, the elder Kemp hops atop a ledge to reach toward a strange grouping of ancient formations more than 1 million years in the making. They are not only stalactites and stalagmites — icicle-like rock formations coming up from the ground — but others with names that recall their color or shape: cave bacon, draperies, shields and popcorn. Lit up by the cave's ceiling lights and his headlamp beam, dust particles hang in the air, barely moving in the stillness.

## Cave Freaks Unite!

Each year, scores of cave freaks gather at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and here in Nevada. Their job is to pick and wipe away buildup that can threaten both the formations and the cave's inhabitants.

The cave is part of Great Basin National Park, in the desert between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. Prospector and miner, Absalom Lehman, officially discovered it in 1885, but many believe Native Americans used the cavern ages before that.

Lehman and later caretakers offered candlelight tours long before the cave became a national monument in 1922. During Prohibition, when liquor was banned in America, Lehman Cave served as a secret bar and a dance floor. The 2-mile-long cavern is 200 feet below ground at its lowest point and government officials later used it as a well-stocked fallout shelter in case of nuclear war.

Officials once brought in masses of sandbags to protect formations as they broke down walls for a new exit — that left sand everywhere.

## Humans Cause It, So Humans Clean It

Every so often, the cave must be cleaned of its trash. During the three-day Lint Camp last month, two dozen volunteers from three states took out a ton of scrap. The trash  included concrete chunks from paths removed during cave repair work.

Visitors are not allowed to touch the formations. However, fibers, skin cells and hair build up anyway. Ben Roberts, the park's chief, calls lint a human problem that humans must clean up.

His feeling about the cave is that "it's just like any camping trip — if you pack it in, you pack it out." The volunteers trudge deeper into the earth. They wear miner's helmets and carry large paint cans filled with brushes, gloves and tweezers.

## Lint Pickers, Onward!

It's a Friday morning and just eight cavers are here. Another 20 will arrive the next day. Roberts leads some cavers for the more important repair work."Lint pickers follow me," park official Gretchen Baker says to the rest.

Park workers explain the rules: Don't touch anything without gloves. Oils from human skin can alter the growth of the delicate formations, already slow at one inch a century. And no food — one dropped crumb could cause an explosion of bacteria and affect the cave's formations.

As Baker's group settles in, she suggests a contest to see who can fill the most bags of dust and lint. This is detail work that often requires a magnifying glass and tweezers when the lint has become moist and sticks to the formations like cobwebs. The volunteers start slowly, touching the rock as though petting a nervous cat.

They quickly get the hang of it. Randi Poer, a circuit board designer from Orange County, California, who began caving in 2001, asks, "How clean do I need to make this?"

"Just the major stuff," Baker says. "Don't go OCD."

"I just don't know where to stop," Poer added.

As she brushes off the lint, the formations seem to come alive. No longer a dull bone color, many seem to sparkle.
