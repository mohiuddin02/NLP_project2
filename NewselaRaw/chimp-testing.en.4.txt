WASHINGTON â€” The U.S. government wants to give better protection to chimpanzees.

Right now, only chimpanzees in the wild are listed as endangered. Captive chimps, like pets and those in research labs, are only listed as threatened.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed a plan. It wants to count both wild and captive chimps as [endangered](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species), because animals of the same species should have equal protection.

The plan aims to keep the animal from being used in experiments. Scientists have used chimps to study disease and invent new medicines.

Animal rights groups applauded the plan. The treatment of chimps has been argued about for years.

## Used In AIDS Research

In the mid-1980s, scientists were trying to understand HIV. The HIV virus causes AIDS, a deadly disease. Since humans and chimps are closely related, scientists infected chimps with HIV. The researchers hoped doing so would lead to a cure.

At least 198 chimps were infected with HIV. But only one got an AIDS-like disease, and died.

Chimps don't react to infection the same way humans do. Scientists developed a vaccine for HIV, but it only protected chimps, not people. An article in the British Medical Journal wrote: "When it comes to testing HIV vaccines, only humans will do."

In 2011, a scientist at the University of California found that diseases work differently in chimps and humans. That made scientists wonder if chimps were a good model for humans.

## A Population Drop

About 2,000 captive chimps live in the U.S., Fish and Wildlife said.

Since 1960, the number of chimpanzees has shrunk. The latest count put the number of chimps in the world at 300,000 to 430,000. Humans are building more and more in the chimps' native habitat. And some people hunt the animal.

Chimpanzees are also being caught as pets. Killing a female chimp who has an infant means twice the pay for a hunter. The mother's body is sold as meat, and the infant gets sold as a pet.

If the plan goes through, there will be more rules about chimps.

For example, buying a chimp from another state will require permission. Taking a chimpanzees to another country will require a permit. So will activities that could harm or disturb a chimpanzee in research experiments. Selling chimpanzee blood will require permits too.

## Research To Help Chimps OK

Some medical research could still be allowed under the new plan. But Fish and Wildlife said such research will be limited. Only studies that help the chimpanzee species will be allowed.

People have argued about using chimps in science for years. But the conversation is changing. New technologies are helping researchers. Once, the only way to learn certain knowledge was to test a live animal.  Now that same knowledge can be learned in a test tube. In addition, more and more evidence shows that chimpanzees don't work as well as human models in research.

Feelings about animal research also have changed over the years. More people believe that chimps should be spared the pain and stress of research experiments.

Dr. John J. Pippin was happy about the move. He works to end animal testing.

When it comes to human diseases, chimps just make bad test subjects, Pippin said.
