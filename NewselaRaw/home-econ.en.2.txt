Internet developer Rudo Boothe and his daughter are very into shapes and word association games these days.

Together, they count down along with the microwave timer. When they go to the grocery store, they add up the cans of tomato sauce in the supermarket cart. Boothe's daughter may be just 19 months old. But he believes it's not too early to introduce educational ideas to her at every turn.

"My attempt is to make numbers very important," said Boothe. The Florida man says his professional success — anyone's professional success, actually — is due to learning to read and perform basic math at age 4.

"Greatness is the objective," he said. He wants his daughter to be amazing "at age 7."

## Do The Math, Early

Boothe may seem like the kind of super competitive parent who wants his child to learn to read before her classmates. Instead, he is investing in his child's future ability to make money — at least if you believe researchers at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.

They say that increased reading and math ability at age 7 means bigger paychecks later in life. And those educational skills better predict future income than even factors like intelligence, education, and family wealth.

American educators agree that early childhood education is critical for a lifetime of success. But they say that other factors shouldn't be discounted.

Good things happen to children who are able to read better at age 7, said Timothy Bates, a University of Edinburgh psychology professor. By adulthood they "are earning significantly more."

How much more? An increase of a single reading level at age 7, for example, meant an extra $8,000 more per year at age 45. Bates studied 17,000 people in the United Kingdom for four decades. Youngsters who were better at reading and math had higher incomes, better housing and better jobs in adulthood.

This held true even compared to people who were more intelligent or had richer parents, but read or performed math at lower levels.

## Reading Too Much Into It?

Bates also said that here in the United States, we'd see the same effect, only stronger. The United States is a merit-based system, where effort and hard work are rewarded.

The findings mean that basic educational skills will be important throughout a person's life. This is  independent of how smart you are, how long you stay in school or how much money your parents have,  Bates said.

Hold it right there, say a chorus of U.S. educators. They agree that early learning is critical to career success. They also say that early learning produces kindergarten-ready kids who become career-ready adults when they get older. But the U.S. educators also point out that the amount of money a child's family has most certainly affects the outcome.

For starters, only 40 percent to 55 percent of American children attend high quality pre-kindergarten programs, said Libby Doggett who works on policy and early learning for the U.S. Department of Education.

Kids learn the basics of reading and math at those programs, of course. But they are also introduced to executive function skills -- such as motivation, persistence, and self-control -- that help people achieve goals. Executive function is also tied to future success.

"It's not about ability," Doggett said. "We create ability. And we create it early on."

## Money Is A Big Factor, Many Say

The kids most likely to skip quality pre-K programs are — you guessed it — poor children, said Greg J. Duncan of the University of California-Irvine. This fact partly explains a gap in educational abilities. Between the national's richest 20 percent and the poorest 20 percent of kindergarten-age kids, there's a gap of about about 20 IQ points. The difference is 120 SAT points in reading and math skills.

Even worse, American schools fail to erase this gap between rich and poor, he said. Schools in low-income areas tend to have students with behavioral problems that slow down entire classes and families that move around more, he said.

"Most of the gap comes from what goes on in the home," Duncan said. That doesn't mean intelligence plays no role, he said. "But much of the gaps are caused by differences in parenting practices."

Reading and math lessons are easily disguised as exciting activities, said Silvia P. Tarafa, principal of the Key Biscayne K-8 Center in Florida. Tarafa said parents can play a role in introducing educational activities into the daily routine. For example:

When parents read with their children, they should choose nonfiction books their children are interested in, such as sharks, cooking, outer space or dinosaurs. Likewise, bake cakes often, using the measuring cup and sticks of butter as tools to teach fractions. At the store, compare prices, and pay in cash in order to count your change. Show that four quarters make a dollar. And when they paint pictures, frame the masterpieces, which requires measuring the length, width and perimeter.

When a child hears an idea at an early age,  Tarafa said, "that child will make a connection" when a teacher introduces the same idea.
