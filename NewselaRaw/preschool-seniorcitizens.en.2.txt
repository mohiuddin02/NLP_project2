SEATTLE, Wash. â€” The little boy in a bright-green shirt tightly grips a sandwich bag and asks, "Can you open this for me?" He gives the bag to the elderly man seated at his right.

"Sure I can, buddy," says 92-year-old David Carriere. The man's wrinkled hands reach for the bag and slowly tear at the opening.

## Youthful Zest, Experienced Hands

Satisfied, the little boy starts stuffing sandwiches into the bag.

"I haven't worked with him in a while," Carriere says. "He's smart."

Carriere is an elderly man who lives at Providence Mount St. Vincent retirement home in West Seattle. It is also known as "the Mount." On a recent Friday, a group of older people and some children packed sack lunches that would be delivered to the homeless.

It's one of many projects that bring the elderly and the young together through the Intergenerational Learning Center, or ILC. It's a day care center located inside a retirement home for older people.

## "Where People Come To Live"

Five days a week, children ages 6 weeks old to 5 years old interact with people who live at the Mount. Their average age is 92. Activities range from musical hour to story time to art classes.

Charlene Boyd, who runs the Mount, says the ILC was developed 23 years ago.

"We wanted this to be a place where people come to live, not come to die," Boyd said.

She says interacting with children cheers up the older people. It also helps young children learn about the good and bad parts of aging.

"It's normal for someone to use a wheelchair or a walker, and that's just part of life," Boyd said. "It's not out of sight, out of mind. It's right here. These kids see that every day, and they're not afraid."

## Every Stage Of Life

The ILC has become a popular program. Currently, there are 125 students in the day care center, which has a waiting list of 2-1/2 years.

People who work at the center believe the mixing of the generations helps children, even outside of the classroom. Eileen Hirami, who has taught there for 13 years, says it makes children more "emotionally aware."

"From the time you're a baby to the time you die, you... want to be recognized and respected," Hirami said.

She says the children start to understand this through their daily dealings with different age groups.

## "It Made Me More Aware"

Ryan Smith, the son of administrator Charlene Boyd, was one of the first children enrolled in the day care center. Now 23 years old, he says the program made him feel that he needed to help others.

Smith recently graduated from Washington State University and is studying to become a firefighter.

Looking back, Smith says he realizes the program had a big effect on his life. "It made me more aware of my surroundings and of elderly people."

Eileen McCloskey organizes activities for the elderly people who live at the Mount. She says it's unlike any other long-term-care job she's ever had.

She says the older people's "eyes light up" when they interact with the children.

## "Let This Magic Happen"

"You just step back and let this magic happen," McClosky said. "It's textbook-- that's exactly why we have this program, and it's happening right here."

Victor Warkentin has two children, ages 2 and 5, enrolled in the program. He thinks the center has had a big effect on the way his kids see the world. He says it has helped them solve problems, be more comfortable explaining their feelings and take new chances.

Warkentin says the mixing of the generations makes the program even better.

Recently, Warkentin and his family moved from West Seattle to Issaquah, Washington. But he continues to make the trip to West Seattle.

"It's worth it to me," he said. "I haven't found anything that comes close."
