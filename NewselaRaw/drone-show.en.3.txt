WASHINGTON â€” Drone aircraft were not just firing missiles in Yemen last week. The unmanned craft were also on display in a convention hall less than a mile from the White House.

It showed that unarmed [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) are coming to America's skies soon.

There were all kinds of unmanned aircraft packing the huge Washington Convention Center. They ranged from bird-sized craft to a scale model of a giant Air Force MQ-9 Reaper, known as a hunter-killer drone. The drones and other gadgets being shown have both government and private uses. Organizers called it the largest drone show in the world.

The three-day show featured nearly 600 exhibits. Companies were there to demonstrate how drones can help in all sorts of things. Law enforcement, search and rescue, selling real estate and checking pipelines were all covered. So were fighting forest fires and protecting wildlife.

## Fear Of Flying Drones

But first the industry has to ease the public's fear of drones.

Most of the companies won't even use the word. They prefer names like unmanned aerial vehicle or remotely piloted aircraft. When people hear the word drones, they think of deadly strikes by the U.S. against suspected terrorists from Pakistan to North Africa. Companies want to avoid that image.

Some Americans also worry about something flying overhead and spying on them.

"Obviously the public is concerned," said David Ison. He is an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

In the giant convention hall, sensors scanned people's body heat invisibly. Convention goers could operate simulators. These machines let them pretend they were flying drones  over the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Some states promoted places to test drones. Colorful banners from big companies hung from the ceiling. Dull gray models of unmanned aircraft hung next to them.

## Stored In A Backpack

Drones for business are supposed to be flying over the country by September 2015. Experts estimate that 10,000 unmanned aircraft could be flying five years later. Big and small companies want to sell low-cost portable aircraft. There might be a lot of money to be made.

"This is a growth industry," said conference spokeswoman Melanie Hinton.

Drone technology is developing quickly. In fact, so quickly that aerospace company Aurora Flight Sciences showed off a craft that did not cost that much. It could be used in firefights, forest fires or other tasks where it might be ruined. It's made of plastic foam. Magnets attach propellers and a camera to a two-foot wingspan that can be folded and stored in a backpack.

IRcameras builds video cameras that can "see" heat. Jeff Leake, who works for the company, pointed out footprints on a screen from people walking past.

"You can see the heat from their feet left on the floor," Leake said. The camera can pick up a temperature change of less than 1 degree Fahrenheit, he explained.

Richard Becker spun a computer ball in the booth for Corsair Engineering and hit a button. The screen showed a small, gray drone flying over a rocky valley in Afghanistan. A thin column of smoke could be seen at the end of a box canyon. "All this is exactly as you would see in real life," he said.

## Simulator For Drone Flight

The machine is used to teach soldiers how to fly the ScanEagle. The craft is a drone used by the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. Its wings stretch 10 feet. Indiana State University and the University of North Dakota have purchased simulators, for about $65,000 each. They will be used to teach aviation students about drone operations, Becker said.

Panels at the conference discussed challenges facing the industry. Those include shrinking defense spending and possible legal suits if fleets of drones start flying over America.

Lt. Gen. James Barclay recalled how the Army initially did not want to even conduct research about using drones.

"I can remember back to early on in Army aviation, we said, 'Unmanned systems, no way; it's got to have a man in it,'" Barclay said. "Everyone was scared that ... at the end of the day, everything would become unmanned, and it would do away with our jobs and stuff."

He added, "But I will tell you that that's not the case. We know that it will bring better capabilities to our force. And that is the future of our Army."
