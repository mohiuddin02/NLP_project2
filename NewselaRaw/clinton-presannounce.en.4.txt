WASHINGTON â€” On Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that she will be running for president. Clinton made her announcement in a video.

"Everyday Americans need a champion. I want to be that champion," she said.

It will be the second time Clinton has run for president. The first time she lost to President Barack Obama.

## Touring The Country

Clinton said she now plans to head to Iowa and New Hampshire. She will be looking to talk with voters directly. She will visit coffee shops, day care centers and people's homes.

"So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote. Because it's your time. And I hope you'll join me on this journey," Clinton said at the end of the video.

Clinton is a Democrat, like President Obama. She was secretary of state during President Obama's first four years in office.

Clinton was also once a senator in Congress. She served as first lady when her husband Bill Clinton was president.

Clinton said she will help average Americans and working families if she is elected.

"You can do more than just get by. You can get ahead and stay ahead. Because when families are strong, America is strong," she said.

## Republicans On The Attack

Republicans did not wait for Clinton's announcement to begin attacking her.

Reince Priebus is the Republican Party's leader. He said Clinton is too much like Obama. President Obama is very unpopular with Republicans. If Clinton becomes president, it would be like giving Obama a "third term," Priebus said.

Republican Senator Rand Paul also criticized Clinton. Paul announced last week that he is running for president.

Paul pointed to a foundation the Clinton family runs. The foundation was started by the Clintons to raise money for good causes. Paul said it has taken money it should have turned down.

Paul said the foundation should not have accepted money from Saudi Arabia. Women in that country are not allowed to drive.

Clinton is a strong supporter of women's rights. She should have turned down Saudi money, Paul said. "Instead, she's accepting tens of millions of dollars."

## Challengers To Come

Clinton is the first Democrat to get into the race. Other Democrats will decide to run soon too. Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee could be some of them.

Clinton must first run against the other Democrats in the primaries. If she wins, she will then run against a Republican in the general election.

So far, it seems like Clinton will win the primaries.

The 2016 presidential race will probably be the most expensive ever. This weekend, the Clinton team began calling supporters. They asked them to give money to Clinton as soon as possible. With their help she will have a chance of winning.
