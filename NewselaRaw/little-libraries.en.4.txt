CHICAGO — A group of children peeked inside a box of free books. Some of them grabbed a book to take home.

"The kids are excited about it," said Eve Pulver-Johnson. The box is called a Little Free Library. It stands on Eve's front lawn in Illinois. Eve likes seeing the kids dig through the box and look for a good book.

Little Free Libraries are boxes filled with books for children and adults. Each one contains about 20 to 100 books. People can take books from the little libraries. They also can leave books for other people to take. The little libraries stand on lawns, in parks and in gardens around the world. They are even in coffee shops.

## Dollhouse Or Library?

In 2009, two men began Little Free Libraries in Wisconsin. The first little library looked like a small school house. Their goal was to get people to read more. They think there will be at least 15,000 Little Free Libraries in 55 countries by the end of the year.

"It's always amazing," said Rick Brooks. He helped start the little libraries.

Book lovers can look for a little library at www.littlefreelibrary.org.

The little libraries look like large dollhouses or birdhouses. Some of them are really beautiful. Some even look more like art than a box of books.

## Books Bringing Neighbors Together

Eve's dad made her little library as a birthday present. Books for adults are on the top shelf. Books for children are below.

People come to to "take a book, leave a book" at her little library every day.

Martha Martinez enjoys visiting the library with her daughter. Her daughter, Barbara, is 8 years old. Barbara loves to read. She looks for "The Cat Who …" books.

"This is a very beautiful idea," said Martha. "It's very nice of them to offer it for the neighborhood." The kids are excited to see what books are in there. But it's nice for adults also.

Mary Ann Mohanraj sees many adults at her little library.

Mohanraj cares for a flower garden around her little library. She enjoys talking with people who stop by.

This is one of the nicest things about Little Free Libraries, said Brooks. It helps people get to know their neighbors.
