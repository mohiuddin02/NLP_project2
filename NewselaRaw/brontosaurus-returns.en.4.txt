The Brontosaurus died out millions of years ago.

About 110 years ago, scientists doomed it to another kind of extinction. They decided that it was the same as another dinosaur. They took away its name.

A new study found that the Brontosaurus really existed. Now it has its name back.

The Brontosaurus was a long-necked, long-tailed dinosaur. It was one of the largest creatures to ever walk the earth. The Brontosaurus ate plants and lived about 154 to 150 million years ago. It lived in the Jurassic Period.

## Its Name Taken Away

The first Brontosaurus was named in 1879 by Othniel Charles Marsh. He was a famous paleontologist. He studied fossils, which are the bones and other remains of once living things.

In 1903, another paleontologist decided that the Brontosaurus was the same as another dinosaur called the Apatosaurus. Since the Apatosaurus name came first, scientists kept that.

Now a new study says that Marsh was right. Brontosaurus was the correct name all along. Scientists found that the two dinosaurs were actually very different.

For example, the neck of the Apatosaurus was lower and wider than the neck of the Brontosaurus.

Both were huge animals, but Apatosaurus was even bigger, says Emanuel Tschopp. He is a paleontologist at the New University of Lisbon in Portugal. He wrote the new study.

The scientists looked at 477 different parts of 81 fossils. It took five years and many visits to museums in Europe and the United States.

## Will Others Get New Names?

At first, the scientists just wanted to understand the family tree of the dinosaurs. Their report ended up almost 300 pages long. It was published online April 7 in PeerJ, a magazine for scientists.

Tschopp said they would not have been able to do the study 15 years ago. In recent years, many dinosaur bones have been found. These discoveries let scientists compare them and see how different the two dinosaurs actually were.

The Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus belonged to the sauropod family. Taylor said that sauropods were much more different and interesting than many people realize.

Taylor said the scientists will likely start looking at other sauropod dinosaurs. He expected that many others will need to be renamed.

"The Late Jurassic of North America in which they lived may have been a weird time," said Mathew Wedel. He is with the Western University of Health Sciences in California. Many new types of animals came into being at that time. Wedel wondered how they all found enough food to survive.

Now, scientists have another mystery to solve.
