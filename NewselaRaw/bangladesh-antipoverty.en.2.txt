DES MOINES, Iowa â€” The winner of the 2015 World Food Prize goes to a man who created a nonprofit organization that helped more than 150 million people out of poverty.

Fazle Hasan Abed, 79, of Bangladesh, is the creator of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC). Originally, BRAC was supposed to be a temporary organization. It was started to help the country recover from the 1970 typhoon and the war of independence in 1971. Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan, and fought a war for its freedom. The end of the war resulted in Bangladesh becoming its own country.

Today, BRAC has grown into one of the world's largest NGOs focused on helping the poor. NGO stands for nongovernmental organization. As its name implies, an NGO is an organization that is not part of any government and is a non-profit business, which does not work to make money, or profit, for the people who run it. It is estimated that BRAC has helped more than 150 million people out of poverty in Africa and Asia and is now expanding to 10 additional countries.

## Poverty Is A Complicated Problem

Abed believes that poverty is a very complicated problem. "It's not just lack of income or lack of employment," he said. "It's also lack of opportunity, lack of education, lack of opportunity for health care and so on," he said.

The World Food Prize was created in 1986 to award scientists and others who have improved the quality and availability of food. The foundation that awards the $250,000 prize is based in Des Moines, Iowa.

The president of the World Food Prize Foundation is Kenneth Quinn. According to Quinn, what distinguished Abed from all other contenders was that he created an extremely effective nonprofit organization in the incredibly difficult environment of Bangladesh. Quinn stressed that it was Abel's ability to reach out to those in desperate need and create real change that set him apart.

## BRAC's Main Purpose

Abed's original focus of BRAC was to lower the high child and infant death rates in Bangladesh. Abed also wanted to empower women. He wanted them to see that they could contribute to the business world. He taught women how to farm efficiently and grow extra crops to sell.

More than a billion people in the world live on less than $1.25 a day. The organization has created an experimental program to help them. It seeks to help those in extreme poverty work their way out. It will be used in eight other countries to see if its results can be reproduced. Participants will receive a weekly check so they have enough money and won't need to beg. The money will go into a savings account and people will be trained to manage the money. The organization also provides families with an animal like a cow, goat, or chicken to help make them financially independent, and not have to rely on other people for money.

## Helping The Poor Solve Poverty

"In many countries, poor people are not seen as a solution to the problem," Abed said. Usually, they are seen as just the problem. "Poor people can be organized and become the solution to the poverty themselves. All we need to do is provide them opportunities and conditions and give them the tools."

He added, "The hard work is done by the poor themselves to defeat poverty."

The United Nations reports Bangladesh has reduced poverty from 57 percent of its people in 1991-1992 to 32 percent in 2010.

Abed will be awarded the World Food Prize at a ceremony in October in Des Moines.
