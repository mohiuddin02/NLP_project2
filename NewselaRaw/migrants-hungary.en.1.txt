BUDAPEST, Hungary â€” Hundreds of migrants chanted defiant slogans outside Budapest's main international train station Wednesday. For the second day, Hungarian police were blocking them from seeking asylum in Germany and other wealthy European Union (EU) countries.

"What we want? Peace! What we need? Peace!" the migrants shouted outside Keleti train station. It has become the latest focal point for European tensions over the unrelenting flow of migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa fleeing war and poverty.

Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, will take a "clear and obvious message" to his meeting Thursday with EU chiefs about migrants, a government spokesman said.

## European Union Struggles With Influx

"We have to reinstate law and order at the borders of the European Union, including the border with Serbia," Zoltan Kovacs said. "Without re-establishing law and order, it will be impossible to handle the influx of migrants."

The 28-nation EU has not been able to agree for months on how to deal with the tidal wave of 332,000 migrants who have entered Europe so far this year. Nations on the front line of the problem like Greece, Italy and Hungary have pleaded for more help. Meanwhile, Germany, which expects to take in 800,000 migrants this year, the most in the EU, has demanded that other nations step up and take in more asylum-seekers.

At another pressure point along the route into Europe, Turkish media reported that 11 migrants drowned as they tried to cross the sea to Greece. French authorities said Eurostar trains between England and France were returning to normal Wednesday. They were stopped overnight following reports of migrants running on the tunnel tracks and trying to climb atop trains.

## Some Rescued, Some Missing As Boats Capsize

On a beach in Turkey, people pulled the bodies of migrants out of the water, including one of a little child, and clothes from migrants washed up on the sand. Six other migrants were rescued and five remained missing after two boats carrying them from Bodrum in Turkey to the nearby Greek island of Kos capsized Wednesday. The dead apparently included a mother and three children.

The Greek coast guard also recovered the body of a man south of the tiny island of Kalolimnos, but it was unclear if he was connected to the Bodrum deaths.

Hungary's police said they intend to station more officers outside the Keleti terminal as the number of migrants arriving from Serbia grows by the hour. An estimated 3,000 already are camped near the station. Officers working with colleagues from Austria, Germany and Slovakia were searching for migrants traveling on Hungarian trains.

## Hungary Builds Fence On Serbia Border

The Hungarian government did not explain why hundreds of migrants were allowed to leave Budapest by train on Monday but not Tuesday or Wednesday. It insisted it was complying with EU rules on migration.

"(Migrants) are not entitled to move freely within the European Union even after entering Hungary," Kovacs said. "If the migrants don't comply with the very basic rules that are in place in the European Union, there is no solution to this problem."

Kovacs also defended Hungary's 13-foot-high fence being built on the border with Serbia and the tougher migration laws it expects to pass in a couple of weeks. Those new laws allow authorities to make quick decisions on asylum requests. They will also make it illegal to cut through the new fence or cross the border except at designated areas.

"We're going to thwart any effort to come to Hungary by illegal means," Kovacs said.

The clampdown has had an immediate effect in the migrants' primary target country, Germany. German police reported Wednesday that only about 50 migrants arrived on the morning trains to Munich, compared to 2,400 on Tuesday.

## Greece Flooded With Refugees

The Greek coast guard, meanwhile, said it had rescued 1,058 people in 28 Aegean Sea locations over the past 24 hours. More than 200,000 migrants have reached Greece this year. They have come chiefly from neighboring Turkey, where more than 1 million live in refugee camps and are fleeing from wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Greek police also arrested six suspected smugglers in northern Greece, after finding 103 migrants, including 19 children, hidden in a truck.

In France, passengers aboard one Paris-to-London train said it was stopped because migrants trying to climb aboard the train had damaged fire safety equipment. In tweets, passengers also described seeing migrants running along the roofs of another train near the migrant-besieged French port of Calais.

In Iceland, which does not belong to the EU, people are using social media to challenge the government's pledge to host just 50 Syrians, urging their government to do more. Some residents went online to announce they will open their homes to war refugees. Others have urged the government to turn an unused army base into migrant housing.

Naval vessels from several nations patrolled Mediterranean waters off the coast of Libya on Wednesday. They were hoping to preventing more mass drownings of migrants jammed onto flimsy smugglers' boats. A Norwegian vessel was carrying about 800 rescued migrants, including 11 pregnant women and more than 30 children, to Cagliari on the Italian island of Sardinia.

One migrant spoke wearily about missing his family.

"They call me every day and they say to me that they miss me. And I say I miss you. But there's no way to see them," Afghan migrant Abdullah Bakhshi said, as he walked along a road on the Greek island of Lesbos.
