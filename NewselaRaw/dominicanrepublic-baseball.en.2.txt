The streets are dusty and busy. Honking cars and buzzing scooters cram the roads. Walking around San Pedro de Macoris, a town in the Dominican Republic, you might not think you're in a baseball city.

But walk a little further and you'll hear and see the game in action. Past the one-room concrete buildings with old paint, and beyond the roads full of garbage and stray dogs, you'll see a big park. Kids there stand around old baseball fields and shout in Spanish. Bats crack and baseballs thud when they hit leather gloves.

One player on the field today is Richard Paulino. He stood along the first-base line. Paulino was muscular and a bit taller than his teammates.

"I want to play in the major leagues, of course," he said, his braces showing as he smiled. "I am passionate about the game. I am focused."

## The Sport Is Thriving

Baseball plays an important role in the Dominican Republic. The United States even relies on the country to support the major leagues in America. The Dominican Republic sends more players to the major leagues than any other nation besides the United States. Kids from the Dominican Republic are four times more likely to reach the major leagues than kids from America.

"The Dominican's tremendously important and that's why we just opened a brand-new office down there," said Kim Ng, who is in charge of international operations for Major League Baseball (MLB).

There are many reasons that the sport is able to thrive in the Dominican Republic. Talent is a big part â€” kids regularly drop out of high school to play. Major league teams from the United States send a lot of money to the country to train kids.

The sport also gives kids hope. It gives them a chance to escape poverty, which is common in the country. One in 3 people living there are considered poor. Baseball also creates jobs for more than just the players. The money created by baseball provides jobs for landscapers who care for baseball fields, cooks and housekeepers, even real estate agents who find homes for players.

## "Everybody Now Plays Baseball"

There is a lot of money supporting this growth. In fact, 20 players from the Dominican Republic who now play for the MLB were paid a total of $105 million in MLB salaries. All major league clubs operate academies throughout the year to train up-and-coming players.

The major leagues are a diverse place to play, with many foreigners coming to the United States. The Latino player population in the big leagues has steadily increased. Now, Latinos make up about 27 percent of players in the MLB.

By 2013, there were 510 Dominican player signing to be in the MLB, which is more than 10 years ago, when 432 plays signed. These players are earning more money than before, too.

Numbers alone aren't the only evidence that baseball is an important part of the culture in the Dominican Republic.

There are many opportunities for athletes to make it big in the country, thanks in part to the support from American leagues. There are player showcases, many different training academies, and professional leagues.

"It's a lot easier than when I used to play," said Moises Alou, a former Chicago Cubs player and now the general manager of a Dominican team. "Everybody now plays baseball. There's a lot of programs and tryouts and there's a lot of teams competing to sign the best players available."

## A Packed Stadium

On a recent afternoon in the Dominican Republic, thousands of people packed into Estadio Tetelo Vargas, a concrete stadium in the town of San Pedro. With nearly 10,000 people there to watch the game, it was filled to capacity.

Kids wearing local teams' uniforms shouted in Spanish as they scrambled up the walls, trying to get a view of the action. Some people climbed over the walls or perched on the top of the dugouts to watch the game. Above them, professional recruiters from the MLB observed the players.

"In the Dominican, there's not a lot of ways for you to go in life," said a general manager for one of the teams. "Baseball is life."

Just before the game started, Richard Paulino walked into the stadium with his friends. He pushed through the crowds and passed girls selling popcorn out of a plastic garbage tub and a woman selling soda from a shoebox.

He was asked by a reporter if he was going to take the field.

He smiled. "Someday."
