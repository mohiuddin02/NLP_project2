BEIJING â€” China launched a rocket to the moon early Monday. It carried a buggy-like vehicle that is expected to roam and explore the moon's surface for three months. China hopes to make sure that the next man on the moon is Chinese.

The Long March rocket lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center on schedule at 1:30 a.m. Monday, Beijing time, China's official news agency reported.

A landing vehicle and the rover should touch down on the moon's surface in about two weeks. That is the plan. It would be the first soft landing on the moon since 1976, when the Soviet Union landed the Luna 24 spacecraft. A soft landing is a landing in which the vehicle does not break up.

The unmanned rover is gold-colored. It looks like a dune buggy. The rover is expected to conduct scientific projects like planting a telescope on the moon's surface and exploring under the surface of the moon. It will send photographs back to Earth.

## Aims To Put A Man On The Moon

Experts believe the real reason for the mission is to gain expertise. China would use the knowledge to eventually put a man on the moon, experts say.

"China sees the possibility of leading," said David Whitehouse. He is a British scientist who has written a book about the moon. "It will upset the Americans because the Americans think they own the moon."

The public relations value of the mission is huge in China. The rover is named Jade Rabbit. The name was selected by the public. The name refers to the pet rabbit of the Chinese moon goddess, Chang'e. Chang'e is also the name of the landing vehicle. Two previous Chang'e missions circled the moon in 2007 and 2010.

The rocket launch was broadcast live on Chinese television. But the early-morning timing reduced the number of viewers.

The launch itself was relatively uncomplicated, said Morris Jones. He is a space analyst from Australia. So as is the task of getting into orbit around the moon. China has already done that twice. But the landing could be more difficult.

"Landing on the moon is far trickier than simply going into orbit," Jones said. You cannot make mistakes in the landing,  he said.

## A Waning Moon?

The mission is the "most complicated and difficult task in China's space exploration," China's official news agency said.

Only the United States and the Soviet Union have successfully landed on the moon in the past. The U.S. is the only nation to land people on the moon.

The launch comes as India has a spacecraft on its way to Mars. China and India are rival superpowers in Asia. The Indian orbiter fired engines early Sunday that enabled it to leave Earth's orbit and begin its long journey to the Red Planet.

There was a burst of moon exploration in the 1960s and 1970s. The big moment was the 1969 landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. But since then, the moon's appeal has gone down. People want to explore planets and asteroids instead. In 2010, President Obama killed plans for the Constellation program that was supposed to return Americans to the moon by 2020.

"People wanted to explore the planets. We wanted to see more distant worlds," Jones said. "But even though there was so much exploration of the moon in the 1960s and the 1970s, in recent years we have found out things about the moon we never suspected when astronauts went there. We have found areas where there is water ice and regions colder than Pluto. There are still many surprises."
