In March, 36 teachers and employees filed a complaint against the school and students. Children were attacking adults, taking drugs in school and making rude noises in class. By the end of the school year, more than 40 percent of the students had been suspended for a total of more than 800 days.

"When someone says Spurgeon, it's like the worst thing in the world," a parent told the school's new principal Todd Irving. Spurgeon is in Santa Ana.

On the first day of school, Irving met with dozens of parents. Many of them don't speak English, so a translator stood at Irving's side.

## Principal's Two Big Goals

One of the mothers told Irving that her boy was teased so relentlessly that he was treated in a hospital for depression, because he was so sad and unhappy.

"I came to complain five times, and no one paid attention to me," said the mother, Eliazar Arines. Her voice cracked with grief.

Irving was hired over the summer to get Spurgeon under control. Irving, a former college basketball player, had two major goals: first, make sure students obeyed the small rules; second, give the troublemakers some attention.

Before school began, Irving asked the school to put together a list of the school's 50 most difficult students. Then he promised to be responsible for them.

Spurgeon is located in a very poor area. At Spurgeon, "you aren't going to have that kid who has a desk to work at at home. You aren't going to have that kid who has the laptop at home. So what are you going to do to make the playing field even for them?" he said.

## Problems At Home

Over the summer, he met with each of the 50 students and their parents. The meetings gave Irving a glimpse into the problems they faced at home.

Some of the students have trouble waking up for school because they don't have beds to sleep in. There are boys whose fathers are serving life sentences in prison. Others have mothers who are being deported back to their home country, because they don't have permission to live in the U.S. Other students not yet teenagers and already are addicted to drugs.

Teachers and administrators say that certain students are a problem. "But they come to us with problems," he said.

Irving loves bow-ties and likes making lists. The white board in his office often has dozens of bullet points, outlining goals and responsibilities. He took the same approach with the 50 troublemakers.

Each was asked to sign a contract promising to come to class every day and to follow rules, like being on time. If they behave well, they could leave the program.

"One thing I firmly believe is kids make mistakes," Irving said.

## Like A New School

The second morning of the school year, Irving explained a long list of rules to students. They are expected to pick up their own trash and get to class on time. There is also no fighting, no gangs, no lighters, no stink bombs, no matches.

No one will be threatened by students, Irving told them.

That afternoon, a father told Irving his son was being bullied. The father was so angry he was almost crying.

The troublemaker was a tall, skinny eighth-grader with braces and spiked hair named Ernesto. Irving called Ernesto into his office, along with his mother, a translator and school police officer.

The police officer stood over the boy and put his face a few inches from his. He told Ernesto Spurgeon has become like a new school.

"Who's the man in charge?" the officer asked.

"Him," Ernesto said quietly, looking at Irving.

Irving asked Ernesto to sign the contract.

## Biggest Problem Is Learning

Irving usually greets students in the morning with a handshake.

Throughout the day, students are in and out of Irving's office. He has frequent meetings with parents, and sends administrators and counselors to visit students who don't show up for school. Sometimes he pulls troublemakers out of class and lets them sit in his office, doing homework or just talking.

So far, suspensions are down. Also, 38 of the 50 students identified as troublemakers have done well enough that they don't need to check in with teachers every period.

Susan Mercer, the president of the teachers union, said the school was getting better.

Still, the biggest problem is learning.

Irving wants the school to improve its testing scores by 50 points this year. That would be a major achievement. But it is still far below state targets.

Irving said that students are on their best behavior at the beginning of the year. By spring, if the rules aren't enforced, things can get out of control.

So Irving is trying not to get comfortable.
