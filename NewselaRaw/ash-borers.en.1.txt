The emerald ash borer, a tiny, glitter-green insect from China, is expected to kill virtually all ash trees in the eastern United States, unless they are treated with expensive chemicals. Now, there is more disturbing news: The borer may have found a new target.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that the borer had attacked the white fringe tree, which is in the same family as not only the ash, but forsythia and lilac.

Experts don't know quite what to make of the find yet, other than that it is worrisome.

"This is bringing up more questions than answers," said Tom Tiddens, supervisor of plant health care at the Chicago Botanic Garden.

## Little Green Bug, Big Tree Problems

The Botanic Garden has 42 "beautiful" fringe trees of its own to fret over.

Will the half-inch insect be a major fringe tree pest, or a minor one? Will it kill fringe trees, as it does ashes, or just damage them?

Maybe the insect was merely taste-testing a close relative of the ash because, by now, so few ash trees are left alive in Ohio. That's where the discovery was made by a college science professor who walked passed a fringe tree and decided to examine it — bingo! There the bugs were.

As Tiddens put it, "If the buffet is crowded at the prime-rib station, it seems logical that the meat loaf station may get some visits."

A much scarier possibility is that the insect is adapting and is now developing the ability to live off of other kinds of trees.

"I think the finding has some significance," Tiddens said, adding that researchers have wondered for years what would happen after the borer swept through an area, killing all but a few ash trees. "It makes sense they would begin feeding on other stuff in the same family."

## Bark Connoisseurs

The recent discovery showed that the insect's attack on the fringe tree was not brief. It completed its life cycle on the tree — adults laid eggs, which hatched into larvae, which pupated and re-emerged through D-shaped holes as adults.

New Jersey bug expert Paul Kurtz said he knew of just a few small pockets of fringe trees in the southern part of the state.

"I can say with confidence, this will not really affect the forest diversity in New Jersey," he said.

Forsythias or lilacs, he said, would not be likely targets because they do not have the quantity of bark that the insect needs. Neither "has enough meat on the bones, so to speak," Kurtz said.

## They Arrived Via Ship

What the Ohio discovery has done, he said, is open a re-evaluation of the borer. Only research and time will tell if the insect has changed its diet.

Likewise, Don Eggen, a Pennsylvania bug expert, said that in his state the unwelcome development is "early on ... something more to keep a lookout for."

The emerald ash borer — one of many borers that attack trees — has been chomping its way south and east from Detroit, where it was discovered in 2002. It is believed to have entered the Detroit port on wooden packing crates.

The borer lays its eggs on the bark of ashes. Eventually, the larvae girdle the tree, cutting the flow of needed chemicals and minerals and killing it. For local authorities and homeowners, taking down dead or dying trees in yards and along streets, where they are a safety hazard, has been a huge expense.
