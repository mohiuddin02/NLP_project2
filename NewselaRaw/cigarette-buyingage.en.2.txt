CHICAGO, Ill. — Teens and young adults are likely to stop smoking if they have to ask someone who's 21 or older to buy cigarettes for them. Perhaps they may never even start smoking.  

That's the premise of new research from the Institute of Medicine, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C. The research supports a plan put forth by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel last week. The plan would raise the legal age for buying tobacco from 18 to 21.

Experts say the idea is gaining popularity around the country. The research suggests that such laws would discourage smoking at an age when many people first get addicted. Chicago would join a list of more than 100 cities nationwide that have already raised the age for buying tobacco.

## Better Chances For Quitting

Carol Southard is a tobacco treatment expert at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. She says it's easier for older smokers to quit than younger smokers. She also says older smokers are more likely to get help. "The literature has been so consistent that if we can ... (delay) the kid from starting in the first place, or at least get the kid to stop before they're 21, we've done something significant."

Most states long ago set the legal tobacco age at 18\. But the study, which came out last March, caused people to look at the issue again. 

The study found that if people aren't able to buy tobacco until they're 21, they're more likely to delay using it. Almost 90 percent of adult daily smokers say they began smoking before they were 19, according to the study.

Researchers also said middle- and high-schoolers typically aren't friends with 21-year-olds. This means they would be less able to obtain tobacco if laws were changed.

## Fewer Teens Would Smoke, Study Concludes

The study predicted a 12 percent decrease in tobacco use among today's teenagers if all states immediately raised the minimum age to 21\.  

Young adult smokers in Chicago were recently asked about the idea. They were found puffing on cigarettes at DePaul University.  

One 19-year-old said the change might make her kick the habit she picked up when she started college last fall. The woman declined to give her name because her parents don't know that she smokes.

"I wouldn't go out of my way to get people (21 and over) to buy them for me," she said. 

Others, like Joseph Saye, 22, said younger smokers will be able to find ways around the law. Saye has smoked since he was 19\. He said he doubts an older age rule would have much effect.

## Better Protection Of Young Adults And Health

Lila Johnson disagrees. She works at the Hawaii Department of Health. She said the new study helped to convince officials there to establish a legal age of 21 for buying tobacco. Hawaii's law, the only one of its kind in the country, kicked in this month.

"The scientific basis landed right in our lap," Johnson said. "We don't see the negative side effects because it's going to protect young people, it's going to protect our vulnerable populations. We hope to be able to show the difference that it makes."

Chicago's mayor is taking other steps as well. He has announced plans to raise taxes on tobacco products. He also wants to set minimum prices for tobacco and minimum quantities that can be sold. These steps would probably make it harder for young people to buy tobacco.   

## Fatalities Dropped After Legal Age Raised For Alcohol

Efforts to raise the tobacco purchasing age evokes a similar effort nearly 40 years ago. That's when some people wanted to raise the legal age for drinking alcohol.

In the 1960s and 1970s, several states lowered the legal drinking age to 18, according to the National Institutes of Health. That is a government agency that conducts medical research.

That change had deadly results. Fatal alcohol-related traffic crashes went way up.  

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed a law that held back money from states that did not raise the legal drinking age to 21\. Since then, drunken-driving deaths have been cut in half.  

The federal government recently conducted a survey on raising the legal age for buying tobacco. It found that 75 percent of adults, including many smokers, liked the idea.
