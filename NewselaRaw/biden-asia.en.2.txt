BEIJING — China accused Washington on Wednesday of taking Japan's side in a fight over islands in the East China Sea.

China declared a restricted flying zone in an area over the islands on Nov. 23. Japan claims the islands as its own.

China said any planes flying through the zone must file flight plans with Beijing. Japan has been nervous since then.

The United States refuses to file flight plans.

## China Daily Criticizes U.S.

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was in China on Wednesday, meeting with the country's leaders. But Biden avoided calling publicly for Beijing to change its mind about the zone. He was wary of making demands that China is likely to ignore. Rather, the vice president hoped to persuade China not to enforce the zone or declare similar zones over other territories.

Biden had a private meeting with President Xi Jinping that went on for much longer than scheduled. When he came out, Biden appeared somber and subdued. In a brief appearance before reporters, Biden did not go into details on differences over the restricted flying zone. Instead, he spoke of a "new model of major country cooperation." U.S.-China relations depend on trust, he said.

Earlier Wednesday, Biden urged young Chinese citizens to challenge the way things are. The vice president's description of U.S. culture where people are free to question the government contrasted with China, where the government has strict control over the country.

Neither Biden nor Xi made public mention of the clash over disputed territory. That fight has pitted China against the United States and its Asian allies.

But an editorial in the China Daily said that Washington ignored Japan's attempts to provoke China. It said that "the United States is wrongly pointing an accusing finger at China." China Daily is a newspaper run by the Chinese government.

## Two Meetings With Chinese Leaders

Biden told reporters after his first talks with Xi that the relationship between the China and the United States will make a big difference in what happens in the 21st century. If the U.S. and China can get that relationship right, the possibilities are limitless, he said to reporters.

Biden said he came to Beijing because involved relationships require continuing contact at high levels. He said Xi was open and constructive.

Openness leads to trust, Biden said. "Trust is the basis on which real change — constructive change — is made."

The two leaders had a second meeting. More people were to be involved in that meeting. A working dinner was also planned for later Wednesday.

Biden did not say anything public about U.S. concerns over China's new air defense zone. Only a day earlier, Biden pledged to raise those concerns with Xi and other Chinese leaders. He said on Tuesday that China's move was deeply concerning.

Setting up the air defense zone made the region more tense, he said. It also "increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation," Biden said in Tokyo on Tuesday. He met there with Japanese President Shinzo Abe.

## Challenges And Regional Problems

After meeting with Biden, Xi said the U.S.-China relationship had gotten off to a good start this year. But he said the global situation is changing. Tougher challenges and regional problems keep cropping up, he said.

"The world as a whole is not tranquil," Xi said through a translator. He also said that the United States and China carry important responsibilities for upholding peace. "To strengthen dialogue and cooperation is the only right choice facing both of our countries," Xi said.

Added Biden: "The way I was raised was to believe that change presents opportunity."

Biden spoke earlier to young Chinese citizens waiting at the U.S. Embassy to get visitor visas processed. He said: "I hope you learn that innovation can only occur where you can breathe free, challenge the government, challenge religious leaders."

He said, "Children in America are rewarded — not punished — for challenging the status quo."

Biden's comments were not immediately reported by Chinese state media. They were not likely to be widely known in China. A one-minute portion of his speech posted by the Sina news website included Biden's comment about challenging the "status quo." It left out the comment about challenging the government.

Biden went later to the Great Hall of the People, a ceremonial building steps away from Tiananmen Square. Any tensions between the United States and China were papered over. Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao welcomed him with an elaborate honor guard. A military band played the two countries' national anthems as Biden and Xi stood amid the massive hall's marble floors and crisscrossing red carpets.
