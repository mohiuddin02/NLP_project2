LOS ANGELES — Help wanted: At least 130 veteran military pilots. Must make a nine-year commitment to fly fighter jets.

Salary: Pay range $34,500 to $97,400. Plus good benefits like health insurance. And a bonus of $225,000 upon signing up — guaranteed.

Contact: U.S. Air Force by Sept. 30.

That offer comes from the U.S. Department of Defense. It is so short of Air Force fighter pilots that it is offering more money than ever before to help attract pilots.

It's hard to imagine that not enough people want to be fighter pilots. What they do seems so thrilling to many. But this year, the Air Force has a shortage of 200 fighter pilots. And if something isn't done, it may be short 700 pilots by 2021. Currently, it has about 3,000 fighter pilots.
## Many Fighter Pilots Leave

Empty cockpits are bad news for the military.

Officials said there are many reasons for the shortage. Pilots are leaving the military to take better-paying jobs with airlines. They are leaving because life in the military can be hard for people with families. Many have been given a new duty: operating remote-controlled planes called [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone). Combat drones have changed the way modern wars are fought.

From 200 to 250 fighter pilots fit the job requirements. The Air Force wants to get as many as possible to take the deal. Some already have signed on.

There have been fighter-pilot shortages in the past. But things may soon be worse than ever. Airlines are eagerly looking for young pilots because many of their older pilots will be retiring in the next few years.

A report was released last year about the number of available pilots. It found that 460,000 new airline pilots will have to be hired around the world over the next 20 years.

Neither US Airways nor American Airlines has hired pilots in more than 10 years. They are now beginning a big effort to find new people.

US Airways and American expect more than 2,100 of their pilots will retire within the next five years. Pilots must retire at the age of 65.
## Co-Pilots Will Need More Hours

"The airlines are going to have more money to pay for pilots than the government," said Rob Streble of the US Airline Pilots Association. Airline pilots and co-pilots typically make around $103,210 a year. After 11 years, Air Force pilots typically earn around $90,000.

Streble himself left the Air Force in the early 1990s to take a job with US Airways.

"The military is difficult on the family with all the moving around," he said. By working for an airline, his home life became more steady.

Because of a new government rule, airlines are more eager than ever to hire military pilots. Soon co-pilots will have to have 1,500 hours of flying experience, the same as captains. Currently, only 250 hours of flight time are necessary to be a co-pilot.

Dennis Prokopowicz is a pilot with Jet Blue Airways. He says it will be difficult for non-military pilots to achieve that many hours. It is much easier for military pilots to gain that level of experience.

"That kind of experience ... is hard to come by" for a civilian pilot, he said. "Renting a Cessna [airplane] can cost around $100 per hour. You don't have to pay for that in the Air Force."
## Drone Duty

The Air Force said part of its problem is training new pilots. The shortage of veteran pilots has resulted in a lack of trainers.

Another problem is the heavy use of drones. After the Sept. 11 terror attacks they became the fastest growing part of the Air Force.

Fighter pilots were moved away from flying and put in control of drones. In all, 153 fighter pilots were permanently shifted over to drone duty.

Recently the Air Force has stopped using fighter jocks for drones because of its pilot shortage.

John Wigle is a former fighter pilot who still works for the Air Force. He said the problem is simply that it is hard to find enough people with the training to be pilots. And life as a fighter pilot is difficult.

"People have no idea how hard it is when you have to move your family all the time," he said. "Military life is not for everyone."
