EARLYSVILLE, Va. â€” Last year, Chris and Annie Newman quit their jobs and became farmers. They are trying a new approach to farming that imitates nature.

The hens on their farm run free and lay their eggs anywhere they please. As a result, the Newmans have to play a kind of farmer hide-and-go-seek.

They squat and squint, reach and grab for those hidden brown eggs. That beats their poultry processing duties, though, which are messy and bloody.

About a year ago, Chris, 32, and Annie, 28, put $27,000 of their life savings and some money they raised from Kickstarter.com into a beyond-organic approach to farming. That means they are trying to create a farm that looks out for the environment, animal well-being and people's health.

## Some States Welcome New Farmers

Farming newbies like the Newmans face a number of challenges. They did not grow up on a family farm. For young people like them, it is difficult to find affordable land. The days of being able to buy some cheap land in the country are gone.

Young farmers often find themselves trying to buy the same land as rich land developers. Money is another problem. Getting a loan is not easy, particularly for young college graduates with big student loans to pay off.

Some states recognize these problems. They have created programs to provide the next generation of farmers with the skills and land needed to be successful.

Missouri, Maryland and Virginia are among the states that help new farmers find available land. Massachusetts, Minnesota and Delaware offer money to help independent farmers who are just starting out.

The future of young farmers has great importance for states, says Holly Rippon-Butler. She works for the National Young Farmers' Coalition (NYFC). Farmers can help protect the local food supply and strengthen communities.

## Very Few U.S. Family Farms Are Left

Rippon-Butler is worried about what will happen if young farmers cannot get started in the industry. Who will older farmers sell their land to when they retire?

"We will lose the ability to produce our own food," she said.

For years, the small family farm has been slowly dying out. Large companies, such as Monsanto and Perdue, are increasingly taking over farming in the United States.

Every week, about 330 farmers leave their farms for good. Today, fewer than 1 percent of Americans are farmers. The fastest growing age group of farmers and ranchers is 65 and older.

The second-fastest growing age group is young farmers and ranchers who are under 35, but there are only about 110,000 of these young farmers nationwide. No other age group is growing.

Most of the young farmers are new to it and trying to earn a living on small farms. Most did not grow up on a farm.

## Land Is Not Cheap

For most new farmers, getting land is a scary challenge. Seventy percent of farmers under age 30 rent farmland. That is compared with just 37 percent of farmers older than 30. Farmers who were raised on a farm were much more likely to own land than farmers who did not grow up farming.

More than two-thirds of American farmland is currently being farmed by people who are 55 and older. These farmers will be retiring from farming over the next 20 years.

Another problem is that land changes hands quickly. Most young farmers struggle to find loans to buy land, Rippon-Butler said. Between 2000 and 2010, national land prices doubled. Now, an average-size farm can cost more than $1 million.

## The Farming Lottery!

As Chris Newman sees it, he and his wife "hit the lottery" when it came to getting land. Chris is a Piscataway Indian. He was eager to farm as his ancestors once did. That means avoiding loans, pesticides, fertilizers and expensive equipment.

His wife's parents happened to have a house on 26 acres of land here in Virginia. Annie's parents were going to sell the land. But they agreed to let the young couple use the land for a year or so.

Eventually, the Newmans hope to find another property. They plan to move once they have made a name for themselves in the business.

"It's not easy when you're trying to learn a new career on the fly," Chris said.

Chris quit his job as a software engineer to launch Sylvanaqua Farms. Annie used to run an art gallery.

"Farming's not simple. You've got to be smart to do it," he said. "When the pigs escape or you're killing a chicken and you get poop in your mustache, you say, 'Well, people really appreciate what we're doing.'"
