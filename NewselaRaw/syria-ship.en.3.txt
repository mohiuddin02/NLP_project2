WASHINGTON â€” The Pentagon is getting a special cargo ship ready to be used to destroy hundreds of tons of deadly poison gas and chemicals. The materials were collected in Syria after a deadly gas attack last summer. The attacks made people all over the world angry.

Two machines have been put on the ship called the Cape Ray, officials said on Thursday. The machines use water or bleach to destroy the chemicals that produce nerve gases.

The system should be able to get rid of Syria's gas supply and chemical ingredients in 45 to 90 days, the officials said. The chemicals can be used to make more poison gas. No chemicals will be dumped at sea.

Syria is in the middle of a civil war. That means that the biggest challenge could be moving the deadly material to the U.S. naval ship.

## Chemicals Loaded Into Containers

The plan is to take the gas and chemicals by truck to Latakia. That is a port in Syria. There it will be loaded into 150 containers. Pentagon planners fear that even a heavily guarded group of trucks could be attacked on the way to Latakia.

"Obviously, it's a challenging environment," said a U.S. official. The official did not want to be named.

Poison gas rockets hit a rebel-held area east of Damascus on Aug. 21. More than 1,000 people were killed, according to U.S. officials. The U.S. threatened to lead an attack in response. Instead, President Bashar Assad agreed to surrender his poison gas weapons.

Over the last few months, teams from around the world have destroyed the places where Syria made poison gas. They also destroyed the weapons. Now they must get rid of liquid chemicals that are mixed to form the nerve gases.

No country would let the chemicals be destroyed on their land. So the chemicals will be destroyed at sea. Norway has offered to take the sealed containers from Latakia to a port outside Syria. The containers will be transferred to the Cape Ray there , the officials said.

The U.S. officials refused to say if the Cape Ray would stay in the Mediterranean Sea while the chemicals were being destroyed. It could sail elsewhere. They also would not say how the ship would be protected.

No U.S. government workers will be in Syria to assist with the operation. Also, no U.S. military forces will be involved in protecting the Syrian trucks on the way to Latakia.

## Hydrolysis Machines To Be Used

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is working with the United Nations to destroy the weapons. The most dangerous material must be removed from Syria by the end of this year, the group said. The U.N. Security Council says the entire supply must be destroyed by mid-2014.

The newly changed ship is expected to be tested at sea this month. It should be ready to sail early next year.

The ship will have a lab. It will also have a protective system that includes a large tent. The tent is supposed to prevent hazardous material from escaping the hold if an accident occurs. Workers will wear protective suits.

The machines that will make the chemicals safer are called hydrolysis machines. The Pentagon used the machines to help destroy some of its own chemical weapons. But it has never done so on a ship. The machines get rid of almost all of the chemical agents. The leftover liquid is considered hazardous waste. But it is not as poisonous, according to one of the U.S. officials.

The liquid will later be destroyed at a waste treatment plant. It will stay on the Cape Ray until then. The ship will be manned by about 60 Defense Department workers.

Most of Syria's chemicals are in liquid form. They need to be mixed to produce a usable weapon, officials said. This makes it easier to neutralize them instead of destroying them by burning them, which would have to happen on land.
