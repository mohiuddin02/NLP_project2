BOSTON, Mass. — The deadly attacks in Paris, France left schools and parents around the world with a difficult task. They needed to know what to say to children, and how to say it.

Many teachers were not sure whether to discuss what happened in Paris on Friday night with their classes. Also, parents wondered whether to talk about the violence or how to explain it. From country to country, the topic was tackled in different, and similar, ways.

Many schools held moments of silence to honor the hundreds of people who were killed or injured by gunmen during attacks at a half-dozen sites in Paris. The sites included restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium. Some schools held open discussions about terrorism and the Paris attacks. Many teachers of younger children tried to shield them from the topic.

At Miami's George Washington Carver Middle School, teacher Sindy Garcia started her eighth-grade social studies class with a moment of silence. She then showed a video designed to teach students about the attacks. During a discussion afterward, some in the class asked what ISIS stands for and why the group wanted to attack France. The Islamic State extremist group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.

## Teachers Take Cautious Approach

The group is trying to set up its own country governed by Islamic law. It has captured parts of Iraq and Syria. The extremists are also called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

"I tried to give them just enough facts that they're informed but not enough to overwhelm them," said Garcia. She is head of the school's social studies department. "They'll know the number of deaths they'll know the number of injured, but I won't show more than that."

At the Lycée Français de New York, students were called into assemblies by grade. There, they could discuss the news and their reactions.

"We took a really careful approach," said Elisabeth King, a spokeswoman for the French-language school in New York City. "It's really about listening and alleviating fear."

## French Newspaper Prints Children's Edition

In Paris, schools reopened Monday with normal routines. In one public school, a teacher drew a classroom of 7-year-old children to a corner, had them sit close together on the floor and explained there were attackers at a stadium. The teacher said there were more and more police coming every minute to protect people.

A French newspaper, Liberation, published a special children's edition Monday.

At Downtown Magnets High School in Los Angeles, social studies teacher Daniel Jocz dropped his lesson plan to discuss the attacks. He asked his 11th grade students if they had any questions. Then, he went on to teach them the basics of the history and politics of the Middle East and North Africa.

"I want them to have a clear picture of the complexity," he said. "And I realize it's a daunting task because many of them have not had any historical background."

In Toronto, the school district issued guidelines Monday to help teachers and parents talk about the attacks with children. Tips included addressing students' concerns about the events and asking questions about their feelings.

## Kids Should Share Thoughts, Educator Says

"It is normal for people to try to make sense of things when a serious loss occurs. Allow your child to share his or her ideas and speculations," Donna Quan, director of education, said in the guidelines. "Help them to separate what they know from what they are guessing about."

Experts say parents should avoid talking about the attacks with children younger than 6. For older children, parents should invite them to watch the news as a family and then discuss it, said Dr. Steven Berkowitz, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania. He studies how children and teens think and behave.

"For a lot of kids this is part and parcel of the world they've grown up in," he said. "Often, kids may have less of a reaction to these events than we do as adults, and sometimes we're surprised by that, and we shouldn't be."

Berkowitz said parents should be careful to avoid passing their own anxiety on to their children.

"A lot of adults are pretty overwhelmed and scared by this, and they have to be aware of their own feelings," he said. It's important that adults "get support from somebody else and not put it onto the kids," Berkowitz said.

## Some U.S. Schools Cancel Trips To D.C.

In the United States, each school decides on its own how to respond to the news. Hartford, Connecticut, distributed suggestions from the National Association of School Psychologists to principals on how to help children cope with terrorism.

Some schools canceled or postponed trips to Washington, D.C., for fear of similar attacks.

In other countries, government officials may decide how schools should handle the subject. In Italy, the minister of education asked schools and universities to devote a minute of silence and at least an hour of reflection to the attacks.

Minister Stefania Giannini said that educators must help students "reject, today more than ever, any temptation toward xenophobia or racism." Xenophobia is the hatred and fear of people from other countries.
