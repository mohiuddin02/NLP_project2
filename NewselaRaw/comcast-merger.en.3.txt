LOS ANGELES  â€” Comcast Corp. will buy Time Warner Cable Inc. for about $45.2 billion. The deal would combine the nation's top two cable TV companies.

The combined company would very important in both creating TV shows and movies and delivering them to U.S. homes. Comcast is not just a cable and Internet company. It also owns television networks like NBC. Universal movie studio is also part of Comcast. That studio makes movies like "Despicable Me."

Because of this, some groups do not want the deal to happen. They think the new company would be too powerful. They are worried that when the two companies become one, they won't have any choices. Most people only have one or two choices in cable companies. The choices usually depend on where you live.

The deal with Time Warner is expected to be done by the end of the year. The people who own parts of the companies and the government have to agree to the deal.

The price beats an offer from another cable company. Charter Communications Inc. offered to buy Time Warner Cable for about $38 billion.

## Comcast's Better Offer

Charter had tried to buy Time Warner Cable for months. Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus consistently rejected the offer. He said it was too low. Marcus said he would make a deal for more money.

For a time, Comcast stayed in the background. It waited to purchase any groups of subscribers that a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable would sell. Subscribers are the people who pay for cable television.

Charter had planned to borrow money to pay for Time Warner. It would take on $25 billion in new debt. To help pay off the debt quickly, the company considered selling off some of the places where it had customers after a deal had closed. Time Warner Cable's Marcus was against the idea of being part of a company with huge debt.

Comcast now plans to sell off 3 million pay TV customers after the deal closes. It has 22 million  pay TV customers. Time Warner Cable has 11.2 million. So the combined company will end up with about 30 million customers after those 3 million are sold.

People do not think that having that many customers will worry government employees who look at mergers. Their job is to make sure that a company does not become too big. If it did get too big, a company could raise prices without having to worry about competition.

## Power In Many Markets

Comcast argues that Comcast and Time Warner Cable don't operate in the same places. That means after they become one company, it won't reduce competition, Comcast says. Comcast operates mainly in the Northeast. It offers cable in its home base of Philadelphia and places such as Boston, Washington and Chicago. Time Warner Cable has strongholds around its headquarters in New York. It is also big in Los Angeles, Dallas and Milwaukee.

The combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable will face competition from AT&amp;T and Verizon in many of those cities. Both AT&amp;T and Verizon are growing quickly. AT&amp;T ended 2013 with 5.5 million TV customers. Verizon had 5.3 million.

Charter agreed that it lost the takeover in a statement on Wednesday.

Some groups opposed the Comcast-Time Warner deal. Public Knowledge is a Washington-based  group that helps protect people from getting cheated. It said Wednesday that the government must stop the deal, because it would give Comcast a huge amount of power "in several important markets."

It said, "An enlarged Comcast would be the bully in the schoolyard."
