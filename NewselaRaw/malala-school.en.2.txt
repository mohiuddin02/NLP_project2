[Malala Yousafzai](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Malala), the 15-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the head by the Taliban, is back in class. She is attending a new school in England.

Malala became an enemy of the Taliban by campaigning for education on behalf of Pakistani girls. Gunmen opened fire on her, but she was quickly airlifted to a hospital. Five months later, she is fully healed. Now she is attending Edgbaston, a girls school in Birmingham, England.

## Bulletproof Determination

Malala made a quick recovery from surgery. Doctors fitted a metal plate to her skull and installed an implant to help her regain her hearing. After only five months in the hospital, she was strong enough to return to school. She did not go back to school in Pakistan. But Malala showed it will take more than a bullet to keep her from getting her education.

"I am excited that today I have achieved my dream of going back to school," Malala said to Time magazine. "I want all girls in the world to have this basic opportunity. I miss my classmates from Pakistan very much, but I am looking forward to meeting my teachers and making new friends here in Birmingham."

Malala thanked her supporters in a video released on the Guardian website. She also discussed her plans for the future. She was proudly wearing a pink backpack over her school uniform. Her uniform was a green sweater with the Edgbaston insignia and a blue skirt. She also wore a headscarf. She called her first day back at school her "happiest moment."

## Learning How To Change The World

"I will hold my books, my bag, and I will learn. I will talk to my friends, and I will talk to my teacher. I think there's no more important day than this day," Malala said. "I want to learn about politics, and about social rights, about the law. I want to learn how to bring change into this world."

Malala is already off to a good start. She became famous in Pakistan and beyond while she was only 12. She wrote a popular blog about her experiences as a schoolgirl in the Swat Valley. The Swat Valley is a region of Pakistan. When Malala was writing, it was under Taliban control. The Taliban banned education for girls. They began bombing girls schools. Malala wanted to go to school. She stood up to the Taliban's intimidation of ordinary people.

## Targeting A Schoolgirl

After the Pakistani army won back control of the region, Malala put her international fame to work. She campaigned for the right to an education for all girls. But there still remained some Taliban fighters in Swat. There were too few to strike against the army, so they targeted Malala. On Oct. 9, gunmen stopped the school bus Malala was riding. They asked the other children to point her out, and fired a bullet into her skull. Two other girls were wounded.

The Pakistani government sent Malala to specialists in Birmingham. Politician Altaf Hussain called the gunmen "beasts." Hussain called Malala "a beacon of knowledge" and "the daughter of the nation." Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said it was "an attack on all girls in Pakistan, an attack on education, and on all civilized people."

## A Nation Rallies In Support

The public outcry scared the Taliban. They scrambled to try to justify their attempted murder of a child. "She was pro-West, she was speaking against Taliban and she was calling President Obama her ideal leader," a Taliban spokesman said in a statement. Millions of Pakistanis disagreed, rallying and marching to support Malala's cause and pray for her recovery.

The Taliban's attempt to silence Malala's call for girls' education backfired. Not only is Malala alive and bravely continuing her campaign for what she believes in, but Nov. 10 was named Malala Day in her honor. People are encouraged to think about the 32 million girls worldwide who are denied schooling. Malala is now the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee ever. She recently announced that she is writing a book about her life and the struggle for girls' education. But first, there is homework to be done.
