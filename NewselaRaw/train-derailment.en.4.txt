NEW YORK  â€” A New York City train came off the tracks Sunday. Four people died and more than 60 were injured. The train was coming around a curve near a river when the accident happened.

Passengers were thrown from the cars. The crash left twisted wreckage just inches from the water.

The crash happened at 7:20 a.m. About 150 passengers were on the train heading to Manhattan. Some were asleep. They were awakened by screams. The passengers felt their train car rolling over. The wreck happened on a bend in the Bronx where two rivers meet. When the motion stopped, four or five of the seven cars had jumped off the rails.

"Four people lost their lives today in the holiday season, right after Thanksgiving," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.

## Train Was Half Full

The train operator was among the injured, Cuomo said.

The governor said the track did not appear to be broken. But, the train appears to have been speeding. That might be a possible reason for the crash. Investigators will have to figure out what happened.

Thomas F. Prendergast runs the agency that operated the train. He said investigators would look at many things. Among those will be the train, the track and signal system, the operators and the speed of the train.

The speed limit on the curve is 30 miles per hour. The limit is 70 mph in the area before the curve. The train has a machine that should be able to tell how fast it was traveling.

Frank Tatulli was a passenger on the train. He told a television station that the train appeared to be going "a lot faster" than usual as it approached the sharp curve.

The train was about half full at the time of the crash, rail officials said. Some passengers were probably heading to the city for holiday shopping, they said. If it was a weekday, the train would have been full. The accident could have been even worse, officials said.

## "I Heard People Screaming"

Joel Zaritsky was sleeping on the train when the accident happened.

"I woke up when the car started rolling several times. Then I saw the gravel coming at me, and I heard people screaming," he said. His right hand was bloody. There was smoke and wreckage everywhere, he said. "People were thrown to the other side of the train."

A huge boom shook nearby buildings. Angel Gonzalez was in bed when he heard the roar.

"I thought it was a plane that crashed," he said.

Firefighters smashed train car windows to reach passengers. Rescuers also searched the water and nearby woods.

Investigators planned to turn the train cars upright. They want to be certain no one was trapped beneath.

Three men and one woman were killed.

The wreck looked like a twisted toy train, the governor told CNN.

## Second Accident In Six Months

Accident investigators who work for the government have been asking railroads to use special equipment. The equipment can stop accidents caused by a train going too fast.

Congress passed a law in 2008. It gave railroads until the end of 2015 to put in the equipment.

But the systems are expensive and complicated. Railroads want another five to seven years to put in the safety systems.

The railroad that had the accident in New York is starting to put in the technology. It now has what's called an "automatic train control" signal system. The system automatically applies the brakes if an engineer doesn't answer an alert he gets when the train is going too fast.

Such systems can slow trains some of the time. But it will not stop them completely, said Grady Cothen. He used to work on railroad safety for the government.

Sunday's accident was the second time in six months that one of the trains run by the New York company came off the tracks.
