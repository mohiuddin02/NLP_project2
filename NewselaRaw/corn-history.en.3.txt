In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Europe with amazing news. He had learned of many things during his travels to the New World. Back then, America was known as the New World. One of the most exciting things Columbus found out about was a grain called corn.

Corn was delicious, Columbus said. It could help feed a lot of people back in Europe.

Corn never really did get that popular in Europe. Columbus did not bring back the knowledge on how to grow and cook it.

In the New World, the story was very different. Corn was used more and more over time. It eventually found its way into many of the things Americans eat.

## Corn Found In Many Foods And Drinks

Today, the United States uses far more corn than other country in the world. Corn is in the sodas Americans drink and the potato chips they munch on. It is in hamburgers, french fries, sauces and salad dressings. It is in bread, cakes and breakfast cereals. It is in almost all chicken and turkey, and even most fish. There are more foods with some corn in them than there are foods without any.

It was not always that way, however. It took some time for corn to become popular.

Until the 1800s, corn was mostly eaten by the poor. Over time, it caught on more and more. Soon, it was on dining tables all over the country.

## Easy To Grow, And Cheap

Corn is easy to grow. It is also very inexpensive. A bushel of corn costs about $4, much less than soybeans or wheat. Corn's cheapness explains why it has spread everywhere.

Corn is not just found on the dinner table. In fact, less than one-tenth is directly eaten by humans. Much more is fed to the hundreds of millions of animals we raise. Cows, chickens, pigs and even fish are all fed corn. Together, animals eat several times the amount of the grain people take in each year.

There are three commonly grown types of corn. One is grown much more than the other two.

## Less Used As Corn On The Cob, Popcorn

The first is sweet corn. Americans grill sweet corn in the summer, and boil or bake it during the rest of the year. Sweet corn is the most loved kind of corn. We eat it on the cob and get it stuck in our teeth. It is what most people think of when they hear the word "corn." However, very little of the corn we grow is sweet corn.

A second type is called flint corn. It has a soft center and a harder outer shell. Flint corn is the kind of corn used to make popcorn. Like sweet corn, not much of the corn grown here is flint corn. It makes up only a small part of the U.S. corn crop.

Then there is dent corn, the most important kind. By far most of the corn grown in America today is dent corn.

Without even knowing it, Americans eat a huge amount of dent corn. It is in most animals we eat because corn is fed to them. It is added to many drinks as a sweetener. It is even in our cheese, because our cows munch on it instead of grazing on grass.

Today, corn makes up a huge part of what Americans eat. It is everywhere even if we often do not notice it. Corn has come a long way since Columbus first tasted it.
