According to a new study, Oreos may be as addictive as cocaine — for rats, anyway.

The study was run by Connecticut College professor Joseph Schroeder and his students. It was designed to look at how addictive foods with high fat and sugar content are. The results? The rats liked cookies as much as cocaine.

The study also found that rats were just as attached to the place the cookies came from as the place where they were given cocaine.

The study shows that the brain reacts to high-fat, high-sugar foods in the same way it reacts to drugs, Schroeder said. "It may explain why some people can't resist these foods" even though "they know they are bad for them."

## Rats Devour Oreos To The Last Crumb

The original idea for the study came from college student Jamie Honohan.

Honohan wondered why so many people in poor communities are [obese](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) — that is, very overweight. She wanted to test the idea that foods with lots of fat and sugar are as addictive as drugs.

There was a reason Oreos were chosen rather than a high-fat, high-sugar rat chow, Schroeder said. The researchers wanted something that was tasty for humans as well as rats. That way the study would say something about "a problem facing humans."

Honohan said she also wanted to use something common in grocery stores. Plus, she noted, rats like Oreos.

The researchers set up two chambers for the rats. Then, they tried several different experiments using the chambers.

In one experiment, rats were given Oreo cookies in one chamber and rice cakes in the other. It was clear, Honohan said, that the rats preferred the Oreos. They split the cookies apart and devoured the cream. Then, they went on to eat the cookies. Often they didn't bother to finish the rice cakes. But that was never the case with the Oreos.

## Rats Get More Pleasure From Oreos

Just like humans, Schroeder said, rats don't seem to like rice cakes much.

Then, the food was removed. The rats were given the choice of spending time in either chamber. The rats spent far more time in the chamber where the Oreos had been.

In a second experiment, rats were given a shot of cocaine in one chamber. And in the other chamber, they were injected with salt water. Then the shots were stopped. The rats were given the choice of which chamber to spend time in.

The cookie-eating rats went back to the chamber where they had received Oreos. The rats that got drugs went back to the cocaine chamber. They both spent the same amount of time in those chambers.

Then the researchers looked at what was going on in the part of the rat's brain where it feels pleasure. They measured how active their neurons were in both cases. Neurons are specialized nerve cells that carry "messages" in both human and rat brains. The cookies actually activated many more neurons than the drugs. In other words, the rats got more pleasure out of Oreos than cocaine.

This supports the idea that "high-fat, high-sugar foods are addictive," Schroeder said.

## One Of The Reasons For Obesity?

Honohan said she hopes the study will help people understand how hard it can be to quit eating some foods that can cause obesity.

"Maybe we can approach obesity the same way we address people addicted to drugs," she said. "Oreos and other high-fat, high-sugar foods" can be just as addictive as drugs.

Honohan said that in some ways, junk foods may be "more dangerous to society than drugs." This is because "you don't have to go (into) a dark alley to buy them. You go into any grocery store or bodega, and they are highly available and affordable. They target kids and families on a budget."

As for Oreos, Honohan is done with them. She used to eat them before her research. "Now I can't even look at them," she said.
