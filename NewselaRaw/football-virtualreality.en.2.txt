STANFORD, Calif. â€” Former quarterback Trent Edwards is back in the game. At least, it seems that way. He is actually standing on the stage of a Stanford University lecture room and showing an audience the future of football.

Edwards is wearing a virtual-reality headset. Everything he sees through his goggles is shown on a big screen. Virtual reality is a type of technology that lets users enter new worlds. The worlds are created by computers. Putting on a headset lets one step into these computer-created places.

Waves of "whoa" and "no way!" spread through the crowd as Edwards turns to his right and his left. Surprisingly, it looks and sounds as if he is in the middle of a football practice. Something shakes in Edwards' voice. In his mind, he is a college quarterback again.

"I'm feeling it right now," he says.

## A New Kind Of Playbook

Edwards gets so involved in this alternate universe that he forgets where he is. He takes a step forward and nearly falls off the stage.

Virtual-reality football technology could begin changing football this fall. A number of college and NFL teams, including the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys, have signed up to use the whiz-bang product.

Players, especially quarterbacks, can practice complicated plays they would only see on game days. For coaches, it is a way to allow backup players to get experience off the football field. For the football community, it is a way to reduce contact between players. There has been a lot of worry about players getting head injuries.

## Classwork Sparks An Idea

Stanford coach David Shaw said he has been rejecting technology like this for 20 years. Older versions were "terrible, terrible," he said, because they looked like video games.

The idea for the technology began with, of all things, a Stanford class. In 2005, Stanford football player Derek Belch took a class on virtual reality. It was taught by professor Jeremy Bailenson, one of the world's leading experts on virtual reality. His class explains how our brain works in a virtual environment. After class, Belch said to him: "Wouldn't it be great if we could use this to train football players?"

Bailenson thought it was a great idea, so he, Belch and Edwards got together to work on it. They brought Shaw the 3-D technology. Shaw was so impressed he even gave some money to help start the company.

It led to the start of a new company called STRIVR Labs. The ST is for Stanford, and the VR is for virtual reality.

## "If It Exists, We Can Create It"

STRIVR ran a small experiment at Stanford last year. They let three quarterbacks use the virtual-reality technology. After a month, the quarterbacks reacted more quickly and their memories improved.

Cardinal's starting quarterback Kevin Hogan used it before his last three games.

"His decision-making was faster," Shaw said. "He saw things happening and could make those decisions and anticipate the ball coming out of his hands."

Besides giving players a tool for studying plays, STRIVR can program, say, noise or other conditions that might otherwise catch a team unprepared on game days.

"We can make it dark. We can make it rain. If it exists, we can create it," said Tracy Hughes, who advises STRIVR on helping its business to grow. "We can pump in crowd noise. We can make it evening."

## To See What They See

For now, the cost is too expensive for anything but the NFL or major college teams. High schools and youth league teams will have to wait until a cheaper version comes out.

Shaw pictures a day soon when virtual reality is a part of every top football program.

"In this world, I get to see what my quarterback sees," he said. "I get to see which way he's looking. And I don't have to guess. I actually see which way he turns and can see exactly in his field of view.

"That's huge for us," he said. "And that's going to be huge for our team."
