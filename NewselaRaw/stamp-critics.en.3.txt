WASHINGTON — Harry Potter, Elvis Presley and Bugs Bunny share one thing in common: They're not at all popular with traditional stamp collectors.

Some stamp collectors say the committee that picks new stamps is focusing on the wrong things: pop stars and fictional characters. Fewer and fewer stamps picture great figures and events from American history.

Stamps have always been for celebrating important people and historical events, they say. Now, things are changing.

Ken Martin is head of the American Philatelic Society, a stamp-collecting group. He is not at all happy with the new stamps.

"Harry Potter is a perfect example," Martin said. He's not pleased to see a stamp honoring the fictional boy wizard or his British creator, J.K. Rowling.

"Why do you honor a British author's book?" Martin asked. Wouldn't it be much better "to honor something that reflects our country's" history?

## Pop Culture Is What People Buy

The reason for the change, many say, is money — something the Postal Service badly needs. For some time, it has been losing huge amounts of money.

The newer kinds of stamps sell far better than traditional stamps. Pictures of Civil War generals or lighthouses just are not that popular. Stamps celebrating things like "Spider-Man" or "Star Wars" are. Not surprisingly, the Postal Service is favoring stamps it thinks more people will buy.

The Postal Service certainly came up with a hit last November. Its Harry Potter stamps sold very well.

The stamps show scenes from some of the eight wildly popular Harry Potter movies. One shows Harry reading the letter admitting him to Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. Another pictures him firing his wand in battle. Magical creatures like Dobby the house elf and Hedwig the owl are also featured.

The Postal Service issued its latest limited-edition stamp Friday. It honors legendary 1960s blues rocker Janis Joplin.

## They Want Stamps To Be Interesting

Postal officials don't feel the need to apologize for the new stamps. They especially hope the new stamps will make young people interested in stamp collecting.

Toni DeLancey is a postal service spokeswoman. She said the postal service needs "to change and improve." It needs, she said, to "serve the changing needs of the American public." When it comes to younger Americans, she added, the new stamps are probably the kind "they want to see."

DeLancey defended the 12-member committee that helps pick future stamps. The group, she said, is just keeping up with the times.

Not everyone agrees. Last month one member of the committee angrily resigned.

The member who quit, Benjamin Bailar, served as head of the Postal Service during the 1970s. He suggested that the committee be discontinued. The only purpose of the new stamps, he said, was to make more money.

"The stamp program should celebrate the things that are great about the United States," Bailar wrote.

He said the stamp program "deserves more." It shouldn't be picking "comic-strip characters and pop-music characters."

## Some Like It, Some Don't

Janet Klug is the head of the stamp committee. She said she was disappointed by Bailar's resignation and does not think he represents others in the group. The committee's goal, she said, is to increase public interest in stamp collecting.

"I don't even know if the post office is making more money," she said. "I'm sure they would like to make more money. Who wouldn't? But it's also trying to (reach) a broader public and get them interested in stamps."
