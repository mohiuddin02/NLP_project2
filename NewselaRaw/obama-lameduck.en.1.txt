WASHINGTON — After Tuesday's election, President Barack Obama is limping into his final two years in office.

All second-term presidents lose considerable power at this mark. But for Obama, this comes amid a political climate so tense that compromise between him and Congress is all but impossible. On Tuesday, the Republican Party, which already controlled the House of Representatives, won a majority of seats in the Senate. The Republican victory only further complicates the Democratic president's ability to deal with a tough list of foreign and domestic policy challenges.

Although the U.S. economy is growing at a healthy rate, wages are not rising and the global economy is slowing down. The extremist group Islamic State has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria, even as the U.S. targets the militants with air strikes. The appearance of the deadly Ebola virus in the United States has scared voters and raised questions about whether the White House can handle several crises at once.

Next week, Obama will head to Asia and Australia for meetings, even as Congress returns to Washington to finish its work in a lame-duck session. A lame duck is an office holder who will not be returning to office after the new year. The new Republican-led Senate will begin in January, as will the House of Representatives with a bigger Republican majority. Obama is considered a lame duck because he can't run again.

## Executive Order On Immigration

Obama has no plans to compromise with Congress — both the old one or the new — at least on one matter. Aides said Tuesday that he'd sign an executive order to help some of the 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally stay and work in the U.S. Obama had delayed the order earlier this fall, because Democrats feared that angry voters would kick them out of office.

Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said after he won re-election that he and Obama "have an obligation to work together on issues on which we agree."

McConnell said, "I don't expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently."

He added, "He knows I won't, either." McConnell is expected to become the Senate majority leader.

"There would have to be some really exceptional set of events to get people who have shown no interest in cooperating to get something done," said Ken Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who studies the presidency. Mayer he said he doesn't think there will be any important new laws passed during Obama's last two years in office.

## Not The Only Unpopular One

Meanwhile, much of Washington and the political world is ignoring Obama and starting to look at who will be the next president. Obama will become "yesterday's news" as soon as the 2016 presidential race begins, said New Hampshire State Senator Lou D'Allesandro, who is a Democrat.

D'Allesandro expects that president won't accomplish much in his last two years, because Republicans will stand in his way.

Obama enters these final months already hindered by low approval ratings that led Democrats running in close elections this year to keep away from him. Obama spent the last two days leading up to Election Day in meetings at the White House.

But if he's unpopular, so are Republicans. Vice President Joe Biden argued, perhaps hopefully, that Republicans in Congress will need to compromise with Obama if they want something to brag about in the 2016 elections.

"We know what we have to get done the last two years," Biden said. The White House is "ready to compromise." Biden said he thinks the Republicans might be also willing "because the message from the people, and I'm getting it all over the country, is they're tired of Washington not being able to do anything."

Although he may feel lonely, Obama isn't alone in what he faces. The last three presidents to serve two terms — Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — spent their last two years in office with the opposition party controlling both houses of Congress.

## Can Still Get Some Things Done

Aides who worked for those former presidents say a lame-duck president can still pass important laws.

Obama and Republicans in Congress share a desire to show voters they can still be effective, said William Galston, a former Clinton adviser.

"President Obama, like any president, wants to finish strong and leave as much of a legacy as he can," Galston said. Since the Republicans are not very popular either, they have good reason "to show they can do business."

"There is incentive for Obama, if he wants those last two years to be of consequence, to figure out ways to work with Congress," said Ken Duberstein, who served as Reagan's chief of staff in his second term. "He needs to build trusting relationships."

The White House has signaled that some staffing changes are likely. Press secretary Josh Earnest said there wouldn't be any major changes, at least not right away.

Some presidents have felt compelled after midterm elections to publicly fire well-known officials in their government, he said. "At this point, I don't anticipate that that will happen later this week."

Obama and Republicans could compromise on different issues, including trade, taxes, immigration changes and investing in the nation's highways and railroads.

"There are ways to bridge the differences," Duberstein said. "I think there is a fork in the road." He said that if Obama isn't willing to compromise, he won't get anything done.
