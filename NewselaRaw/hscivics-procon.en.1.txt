### PRO: Teaching the principles of freedom requires a different approach

U.S. high school graduates don't understand the principles of freedom and equality essential to American government and the historical roots of these principles. If this continues, how can we expect them to affirm and defend these principles as adults?

Many people are quick to blame teachers for the shortcomings of America's schools. And the shortcomings should be obvious.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress has shown consistently that many students, in the fields of U.S. history and government, among others, are not even mastering the basics.

For example, the most recent NAEP U.S. history exam, in 2010, found just 12 percent of all U.S. high school seniors scoring at or above the "proficient" level. The Institute of Education Sciences describes being "proficient" as the level representing "solid academic performance to which all students … should aspire."

In civics — the test covering the subject of U.S. government — the scores were somewhat better. Still, slightly less than one-fourth of all high school seniors performed at or above the "proficient" level.

## A Problem With Training

We often hear about the need to improve education in the STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering and math. But American students perform worse on American history tests than in any other subject.

It's unfair to blame America's 125,000 social studies teachers, however. In the 17 years I've been with the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University in Ashbrook, Ohio, some 8,000 teachers from across the country have participated in our educational programs. So I've had ample opportunity to interact with many teachers. I know from first-hand experience they're not the problem.

The problem is the way teachers are trained. Teachers spend too much time learning how to teach — the mechanics of pedagogy — and not enough time learning what to teach.

Without a major change in how teachers are taught, America will continue down the same path. We'll continue to raise generation after generation of students who do not understand what it means to be an American, who equate freedom of speech with "selfies," who believe freedom of religion requires purging religion from the public square, who think our Founding Fathers — belittled in popular culture as dead old white men — are irrelevant.

They also may end up thinking of Sam Adams solely as a beer company. Or associate Washington and Lincoln as having something to do with Presidents Day, a holiday when everybody goes shopping. Or The Fourth of July merely as an occasion for fireworks and a cookout.

## More Than Chronology

Teaching government and history involves more than just stringing together an agreed-upon chronology of significant dates and events and connecting them with names. It involves more than superficial familiarity with a handful of historically significant documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Emancipation Proclamation.

To successfully teach U.S. history and government, so students understand and appreciate the principles that define our American character, teachers need to rely less on textbooks. Instead they should rely more on the writings and thinking of those who shaped our country.

Consider civil rights. The changes in America's mind, heart and laws over time on the subject of racial equality didn't happen by accident. That's why we urge — and in our master's degree program require — teachers to immerse themselves in the writings of those who shaped America's thinking.

This would include, for example, Frederick Douglass' 1852 speech, "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" along with Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, Gettysburg Address and "Resolution Submitting the Thirteenth Amendment (outlawing slavery) to the States," the texts of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954), and Martin Luther King's 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech.

Teachers who understand the importance of such documents and use them in the classroom will be better teachers. Their students will learn more. And they'll be better prepared for the responsibilities of citizenship as adults.

### CON: We need better, not more, history classes

It's a given that every citizen in a democratic republic must be well-versed in civics and history to fully understand national issues as well as global affairs.

However, high school schedules are already crowded with classes. Stuffing in more American history and civics classes is exactly the wrong way to accomplish that worthwhile mission.

Beefing up those areas in the nation's high schools likely would mean force-feeding our nation's youth more of the politically correct diet of information decreed by such stifling agencies as the U.S. Department of Education and state education departments.

In fact, teaching teenagers to be better citizens — if that is possible — should be better left to parents and other family members, the local school board, and even community organizations such as the Scouts and Rotarians.

## How History Is Taught

Instead, history and government courses are too often taught in public schools as a series of human rights abuses. Typically classes teach about the U.S. crimes against Native Americans, Mexicans, African-Americans, Irish and Italian immigrants, women and most recently, the lesbian, gay and transgender communities.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting schools should teach a censored form of patriotism that presents an America free of all its warts.

By all means we should recognize ours flaws at home and costly mistakes abroad. But we should also recognize that our founders were wise — exceptionally well-read and learned even by present day standards.

They created a system of government that was self-correcting and remains so to this day. The result is that our country has continued — although often after the fact — to correct past mistakes in its 239-year quest to create a more perfect union.

Unfortunately, imposing more American history and civics classes on today's restless students — as developed by bureaucrats in Washington — likely will only make things worse.

A glaring example is the community service requirement now imposed on students in some 83 percent of the nation's public school districts.

The requirement violates our Constitution's ringing declaration of individual freedom. It forces students to spend numerous hours each month away from the classroom. Instead they're forced to engage in government-approved public service projects like recycling, cleaning up trash in poor neighborhoods and even attending re-education sessions to ensure they are marching in step with the political leaders of the progressive left.

## Make History Come Alive

Now there's even a push to require all high school seniors to pass the same citizenship test required of immigrants to America. This despite the fact that more than 90 percent of recent high school students have spent a semester studying civics and a majority have spent a year studying American history.

As Peter Levine of Boston's Tufts University recently pointed out: "Requiring students to pass a citizenship exam will reduce both the amount and quality of civic education in our schools."

The problem with civics is not that we fail to teach it, he says. "The problem is that civics is often viewed as a set of disconnected facts, not as a challenging and inspiring subject that will continue to interest us after high school."

He's right, of course, and that's exactly why school programs for American history should be formulated at the local, not national, level.

In the Baltimore area, where I live, the highlights of local history become even more fascinating when linked to those of the nation.

Consider just a few: the voyages of discovery and mapping of Chesapeake Bay by Captain John Smith; the founding of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad that hastened the way west for early pioneers; the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812 that inspired Francis Scott Key to write the National Anthem; and Baltimore's key role in the Civil War. And on and on.

Applied across the U.S., this approach can make history come alive.
