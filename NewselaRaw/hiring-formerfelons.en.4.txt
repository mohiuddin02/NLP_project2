WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Looking for work is hard. People have to fill out a job application. It asks many questions. One group of people has an even harder time finding a job. People who have been in prison often get asked tough questions about prison. Businesses may not give them the chance to talk about their skills.

Vivian Nixon is one of those people. She went to jail for a serious crime. After Nixon got out, she started to look for a job. She went on three interviews a week.

Bosses did not ask Nixon about her skills. Instead they asked about prison. They wondered what she did there. They wondered if she lived with scary people. They even wondered if prison is anything like it is on television. Nixon was embarrassed. Even worse, no one would give her a job. She looked for more than a year. Finally, she was hired by a hospital.

## Skills First, Questions Later

Now President Barack Obama wants to help people like Nixon. He is making a rule. It is for people who want jobs with the government. Bosses will not be allowed to ask people about their time in prison at the beginning of a job interview. They will have to wait until after a person has had time to talk about his or her skills.

Lawmakers in Washington want to go even further. They want to pass the Fair Chance Act. This law would help people trying to get government jobs. It would affect companies that work with the government, too. The law would stop bosses from asking people about prison until they are ready to offer them a job. The lawmakers still have to vote on it.

## Supporting A Second Chance

More Americans now want to give people a second chance. Before, some bosses were scared to hire people who had been in jail. Now they are changing their minds. They want to help former prisoners get jobs. Then, former prisoners can lead good lives. They will not carry out crimes to get money. They will not have to go back to jail.

Glenn E. Martin started JustLeadershipUSA. His group wants to lower the number of people in prison. There are 65 million Americans with criminal records, he said. A new law could really help them.
