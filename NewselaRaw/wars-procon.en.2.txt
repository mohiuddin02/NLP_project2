### PRO: U.S. should not pull out of Afghanistan

WASHINGTON — Former U.S. secretary of state and Nobel Peace Prize winner Henry Kissinger is, by all measures, a heavyweight in international politics. At a recent black-tie dinner, he stood — stoop-shouldered and peering commandingly over his signature thick, black-frame glasses — and remarked: "Unilateral withdrawal is not victory."

He was referring to the Obama Administration's decision to pull our military out of [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan).

Kissinger knows a thing or two about the pain of walking away. After negotiating the Paris Peace Treaty to end the Vietnam War, he saw President Nixon resign in disgrace over the Watergate scandal, then watched Congress pull the plug on all support for South Vietnam.

America's 25-year effort in Vietnam was wasted. With backing from our Cold War enemy, the Soviet Union, the North Vietnamese rolled over South. Vietnam, and neighbors Laos and Cambodia experienced a bloodbath of brutality. The communist Soviet Union, which consisted of several Eastern European countries, and controlled by Russia, was strengthened. It funded new revolutions in South America and Africa and fostered a wave of Islamist terrorism across the Middle East.

Many Vietnam War protesters, including now Secretary of State John Kerry, trumpet America's withdrawal as a triumph. But, there is no reason to be proud of how we left. While we can still debate the wisdom of going to war there, there is no doubt that our total abandonment of our allies left a bloody and shameful history.

Kissinger's comments weren't meant to recall ancient history. He was worried that history is repeating itself and the prospects are now high that Afghanistan will fail … needlessly.

## Our Presence There Still Needed

The Obama administration's Afghan plan is a near copy of its withdrawal from [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq). It assumes that as long as the Afghan government doesn't look like it's about to collapse, it's OK to head for the exit. But just because the Afghan government is not in immediate danger of collapse doesn't mean we can declare victory. It's no better than when George W. Bush declared "mission accomplished" after the initial invasion of Iraq.

That's not to say that the United States should plan major, unending commitments to a country after a fight. But once the levels of violence have come down, some further commitment is usually necessary to help peace become normal. Our presence can let a strong government take root.

Iraq is a case study in how to get it wrong. It is absurd to argue that the White House could not have gotten permission to maintain a small force there — it simply didn't want to. It is also clear that the U.S. pullout left an opening for al-Qaida as it regained its strength. Today, Iraq suffers much higher levels of violence than when Obama took office.

The prospects for Afghanistan are even grimmer. Obama's Afghan "surge" of sending in thousands of additional troops to attempt to wipe out al-Qaida in one blow was not nearly as massive and effective as the Bush surge in Iraq. The Taliban still has areas they can operate freely in in Pakistan; the Haqqani Network of Islamic fighters is as strong as ever and al-Qaida is waiting for its chance to strike. The illegal drug trade, which helps fund rebel attackers, is alive and well. These are daunting challenges for the Afghan people to handle on their own.

Obama talks of finishing the job in Afghanistan, yet many in his administration would be delighted to go with the "zero" option — no U.S. troops, period. But it's not clear that a small multinational presence will be enough to hold the hard-won gains there.

The U.S. went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan to crush the terrorist forces that had killed thousands of Americans and threatened to kill many, many more. Job 1 was not to bring freedom and justice to those lands, but America always prefers to leave a path to liberty and well-being in the wake of its wars.

Sadly in the case of Afghanistan, Obama seems once again poised to pluck defeat from the jaws of victory, as he did in Iraq. Future administrations will reap the blowback and have to deal with it — probably at greater cost. "Unilateral withdrawal is not victory."

### CON: U.S. cannot dictate to a new government

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Our military exit from Iraq, and now the forthcoming one from Afghanistan, have been filled with problems. But the withdrawals are not the reason that we find ourselves dealing with governments in both these countries that are not doing as we think they should.

We are learning a hard lesson. While our military can remove an existing government, we cannot dictate what will replace it. It is a huge lesson we can learn from right now, because in recent days we are hearing new rumblings about the U.S. possibly getting its military involved in Syria, where a civil war is raging.

In Iraq, President George W. Bush apparently gave little thought to what might replace the government of then leader Saddam Hussein.

In 1991, when his father, President George H.W. Bush, attacked Iraq over its invasion and occupation of Kuwait, he was urged by some in Congress to expand the operation. These congressmen wanted him to attack Iraq's capital city, Baghdad, and remove Saddam Hussein from power.

Wisely, he knew that such action would open a can of worms. Under Saddam Hussein, power rested in the hands of the Sunni community. Sunnis are a minority within Iraq who practice one style of Islam. The majority Shiite community practices a somewhat different type of Islam and was resentful over its treatment at the hands of Saddam Hussein. Removing Saddam Hussein from power would upset the existing order, Bush realized.

What was not difficult to see in Iraq was the likelihood that any new government there would be dominated by the majority Shiite community. Then there was the chance that it might seek justice for its suffering in a way that would leave the country in chaos.

Now we see current Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki tilting toward the Shiites. That is the result of the situation we created with our invasion of Iraq in 2003.

The Sunni in Iraq are reacting now with violence. Whether we are there with troops or not, that difficult relationship between Sunni and Shiite is playing itself out as violence between the two groups breaks out on a daily basis.

Nor was it difficult to guess that a Shiite-led government in Iraq would be on good terms with the government of Iran, as Iran has a Shiite government as well. Since the Iranian revolution in 1979, we have been at odds with Iran's leaders. By invading Iraq, we boosted support in the region for the government of Iran.

## No One To Blame But Ourselves

In Afghanistan, we removed a government headed by the Taliban, an extreme religious political group. Afghanistan, as was known at the time, had a population made of many different ethnic groups who have never come together to form a country-wide political order.

Now the warlords who ruled small fiefdoms in Afghanistan are making a comeback. One of them may wind up as the next president in elections to be held soon. We are having trouble convincing Hamid Karzai, the current president, to let our troops remain in large numbers past the end of 2014. We want to keep Afghan courts from having legal authority over any offenses that may be committed in the future by U.S. military there. Karzai rejects this demand.

In both instances, our military invasions — Afghanistan in 2001, Iraq in 2003 — could have been avoided. In Afghanistan, our demand on the Taliban — that it turn over Osama bin Laden and his associates — was not pursued. The Taliban was beginning to respond to our demand, but instead we invaded.

In Iraq, there was even less reason to send our troops. We invaded because, we said, Iraq was preparing mass-destruction weapons to use to attack us. That reason was quickly shown to be highly unlikely.

So in both Afghanistan and Iraq, we took military action that could have been avoided. Our invasions caused predictable problems that were damaging both for those countries and for ourselves.

And this does not include the thousands killed or wounded among our own forces, and among the populations of those countries.

Now we have to live with the political situation in both Iraq and in Afghanistan. We are leaving both countries in shambles. If we don't like the governments we see, we have no one to blame but ourselves.
