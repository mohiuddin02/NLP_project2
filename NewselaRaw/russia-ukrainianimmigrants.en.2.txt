DONETSK, Russia — Tatiana Poludnitsina fled her home in eastern Ukraine after it was bombed in mid-August.

With the help of strangers, Poludnitsina crossed the border into Russia. She now lives in a refugee camp outside the small border town of Donetsk.

"I have nothing anymore, nowhere to go, no apartment … and all my documents and personal belongings were burned," Poludnitsina said as she sat in a tent she shares with a family of four.

Her story is shared by tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees here. They fled Ukraine because of a war between pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military. The rebels want parts of Ukraine to become part of Russia.

About 814,000 Ukrainians have entered Russia since the beginning of the year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Most of the refugees appeared to have ethnic or family ties to Russia.

## Camp Conditions Are Tough

The fighting seems to be getting worse. Since Jan. 1, around 260,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled their homes and found shelter in Ukraine, although the actual number is probably higher.

In neighboring Russia, the government has opened four refugee camps since the rebels seized cities across Ukraine's eastern region. The camp near Donetsk is one of them.

Many refugees have gone to stay with friends, relatives or host families or rent apartments. Most who remain in the camp lack passports or other official documents that would allow them to move on or live in Russia.

As they wait, flies swarm inside the stuffy tents. On some days, the temperature reaches 90 degrees. Wooden-board walkways crisscross the sand and dirt between the shelters. The heat and frequent wind gusts make it nearly impossible to stay clean.

"We wash our hair with cold water," said Yevgenia Melikyan, who arrived at the camp in early August with her 76-year-old father and teenage son and daughter. "Mothers heat the water to bathe their children."

There are no books, no television, no Internet. Youngsters play in the dirt. Many appear frightened by loud noises.

"There's not a day that we don't hear explosions," Melikyan said.

Meals include porridge mixed with stewed canned meat. Poludnitsina said she longed for a hot dog.

## Little Food; No Water Or Electricity

Melikyan said her family left Luhansk in Ukraine after food became hard to find, the water supply was shut off and electricity became unreliable. Most nights the family huddled in the basement of their home terrified by the sound of gunfire and bombs.

Melikyan said she feared for her husband, who remained in Luhansk.

Many of the refugees in Russia blame their situation on Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Western leaders like U.S. President Barack Obama, who support the Ukrainian government.

"I wish they could live for one day like we lived, hiding from shelling in the basement," said Irina Pavlenko. "I wish their children would suffer the same way our children have suffered."

Many of the refugees claimed the pro-Russia fighters were ordinary citizens fighting to protect Russians in Ukraine. They expressed gratitude to the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukraine blames Putin for backing an invasion of its country.

"America and Ukraine did not take in any of us refugees or give us any humanitarian assistance. It's only Russia that's helping us," said Poludnitsina, who wants to remain in Russia and become a citizen.

## Emergency Help For Many

A U.N. spokesman said more than 250,000 Ukrainians had applied to stay in Russia since the beginning of the year.

Many Russian citizens have stepped forward to help them.

In the Russian town of Rostov-on-Don, about 100 miles south of Donetsk, Anatoly Kotlyarov started sheltering friends four months ago. Word spread and soon friends of friends and strangers were being sent his way.

Kotlyarov helped establish a volunteer group that provides emergency help to refugees. The group gives out baby food, diapers and other goods. It also has helped 5,000 refugees move to different parts of Russia, Kotlyarov said.

On a recent afternoon at Rostov's train station, dozens of refugees curled up in chairs or slept on the floor. They waited for trains to take them to destinations across Russia.

## A New Life "Somewhere Safe"

Marina Dolgopolova, 29, was preparing for her Sept. 12 wedding when her home in Ukraine was bombed. Dolgopolova said that she and her husband-to-be sold their wedding rings to pay for bus tickets to Rostov.

She arrived with a pair of jeans, two T-shirts and a laptop computer.

The young couple was headed to Samara, about 650 miles from their hometown, where they don't know anyone.

But that does not matter, Dolgopolova said. "The main thing is to find a job and somewhere safe to live."
