NEW YORK  - A group of doctors and sports experts want people who train student-athletes to watch out for more. It is not a broken bone or muscle strain.

They want trainers to keep an eye out for mental health problems.

Mental health is about how a person feels. Are they happy? Sad? Worried?

Athletic trainers are in a special position, the group said. They are close to college athletes. So they are able to reach out to troubled students.

## Anxiety Attacks

Athletic trainers are "usually right there with the student-athletes during some of their worst moments," said Timothy Neal, who heads the group. "You have their trust." Neal also works in sports medicine at Syracuse University.

Neal said he has seen all sorts of mental health problems among athletes. Some have problems with eating too little or too much. Some feel very anxious. Students come to him for help some of the time. But if something seems not quite right, he reaches out first.

Neal said he looks for somebody acting opposite of how he knows them. Somebody could be more angry than usual. Or somebody could be talking less than they normally do, he said.

Athletic trainers should talk to troubled students, the group said. They should offer to send them to a counselor. Sometimes trainers have to act right away. They have to call a counselor. Trainers should do this if athletes seem like they might hurt themselves or others. And they should call police if a person is acting dangerous.

Neal frequently talks to student-athletes about mental health. He wants to make them less ashamed of mental illness.

## Feeling Lost When Injured

Dr. Thomas L. Schwenk pointed out a special problem. He said it can be very difficult to convince athletes that it's okay to have a mental illness.

Athletes try hard to be winners. That can make them ashamed of having a mental illness, said Schwenk. He has studied mental illness in athletes.

He said hard work is needed to help student-athletes understand that they get sick just like everybody else. They have mental health problems just like everybody else."

Athletes can have a really bad time when they are injured and have to take a break from their sport. They are more likely to develop a mental health problem then.

For many athletes, being an athlete makes them who they are, Neal said. So when they get hurt, they may feel lost. They may feel alone.

Schwenk suggested one good way to reach out to athletes: Tell them mental health care can improve their game.

An athlete might not listen, at first, Scwenk said. "Until you say, 'This is the way you can be better.'"
