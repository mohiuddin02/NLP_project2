WORCESTER, Mass. â€” Rick Sacra is a lucky man. One year ago he was very sick. He was so sick he almost died.

Rick had a terrible disease called Ebola. The disease has killed many people. Most of them lived in West Africa.

Rick is 52 years old. He lives in Massachusetts.

Rick works as a doctor. He helps people get better when they are sick.

## Doctor Caught Ebola In Liberia

Four times a year, Rick goes to a country called Liberia. It is in West Africa. Liberia is very poor. It needs doctors badly.

Rick caught Ebola in Liberia. He was working in a Liberian hospital. He was there to help mothers have babies.

When Rick got sick he was rushed back to the United States. Doctors here worked hard to make him better.

## He Could Have Died

Most people who catch Ebola die. Rick knew his life might end.

"I knew that I might die," he said. He said he is very happy to still be living. He is glad for each new day.

Rick is now completely better.

"I'm doing fine," he said.

Rick is now immune to Ebola. He can no longer catch it. Once you have the disease and get cured  you cannot catch it again.

## Ebola Fading In West Africa

Ebola is now almost gone in West Africa. Doctors have almost beaten the disease.

Rick says he will keep on going back to Liberia.

There are still big problems in Liberia, he said. Ebola is not the only terrible disease the country is fighting. There are a lot of other ones too.

Liberia still needs doctors very badly, Rick said. There are many sick people there and not enough doctors. He will keep going until his help is no longer needed.

Then he will go to another country that needs help, Rick said.
