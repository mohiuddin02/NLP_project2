### PRO: Don't let history repeat itself

WASHINGTON — The U.S. is planning to pull its military out of [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan). The U.S. went to war in Afghanistan to crush the terrorist forces that had killed thousands of Americans on Sept. 11, 2001. Those terrorists threatened to kill many, many more. Now, President Obama says it's time for the U.S. to leave.

Former U.S. secretary of state and Nobel Peace Prize winner Henry Kissinger doesn't agree. He spoke at a recent event, saying that withdrawal "is not victory."

Kissinger knows a thing or two about the pain of walking away. He negotiated the treaty that ended the Vietnam War. Then he watched on as Congress pulled the plug on all support for South Vietnam in its war against North Vietnam.

America's 25-year effort in Vietnam was wasted. The North Vietnamese rolled over the South. Vietnam, and neighboring countries Laos and Cambodia, were engulfed in brutality and widespread killing.

Many Vietnam War protesters see America's withdrawal as a triumph. But, there is no reason to be proud of how we left. We can still talk about the wisdom of going to war there. Yet, when we abandoned our allies we left a bloody and shameful history behind.

Kissinger was saying that history could repeat itself. There's a strong chance that Afghanistan will fail … needlessly.

## U.S. Needs To Stick Around

The Obama government's Afghan plan is a near copy of its withdrawal from [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq). The U.S. went to war there to stop terrorists just like in Afghanistan. Obama has decided that the Afghan government appears that it won't fall apart. So, now it's OK to head for the exit. But just because the government isn't in danger of immediate failure doesn't mean that we can declare victory.

The United States shouldn't plan to stay in a country forever after a war. But once the levels of violence have come down, some further commitment is usually necessary. The U.S. may need to stick around until peace becomes normal. Our military can help a strong government take root.

Iraq is a lesson in how to get it wrong. It is silly to argue that the White House could not have gotten permission to keep a small force there. It simply didn't want to. It is also clear that the U.S. pullout allowed al-Qaida to launch more attacks there. Today, Iraq suffers much higher levels of violence than when Obama took office.

The future of Afghanistan looks even grimmer. Obama's Afghan military "surge" sent in thousands of more troops to wipe out terrorist groups in one big action. But, it did not nearly have the same effect as Bush's surge in Iraq. In certain areas of Pakistan, the Taliban can still operate freely. And terrorist groups like al-Qaida are still strong. The drug trade that pays for the attacks against the government remains constant as well. These are enormous challenges for the Afghan people.

Obama talks of finishing the job in Afghanistan. Yet, many in the government would be delighted to have no U.S. troops there, period. Some people suggest a small army of troops from other countries could replace the U.S. That might not be enough to hold the hard-won gains there.

Job 1 was not to bring freedom and justice to those lands. But America always prefers to leave a path to liberty in the wake of its wars.

Sadly in the case of Afghanistan, Obama seems ready to repeat the mistake he made in Iraq. Future U.S. governments will have to deal with the effects — probably at greater cost. As Kissinger said, "withdrawal is not victory."

### CON: U.S. can remove a government, but can't replace it

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Our military invaded Iraq and Afghanistan to fight terrorism. But leaving Iraq wasn't easy. Now we are about to remove our military from Afghanistan and could face some of the same problems we had in Iraq. Governments in both these countries are not doing as we think they should, but our military's exit is not the reason for that.

We are learning a hard lesson. Our military can remove a government from power. However, we cannot decide what government will come next. It is a lesson that we need to pay attention to now. There is talk that the U.S. military might get involved in Syria, where a civil war has raged for three years.

President George W. Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Saddam Hussein was the president then. The U.S. removed him from power. But, it seems that Bush gave little thought to what kind of leaders would come after Hussein.

In 1991, his father, President George H.W. Bush, attacked Iraq after it took over Kuwait. Some of our leaders in Congress didn't just want Iraq kicked out of Kuwait. They wanted Bush to order an attack on the capital city, Baghdad, to remove Saddam Hussein from power.

Wisely, Bush senior knew that such action would create many new problems. Under Saddam Hussein, the Sunni community had power. Sunnis are a minority in Iraq who follow one of the two main forms of Islam. The Shiites there are the majority. They practice the other form of Islam. Hussein was a Sunni who treated the Shiite community badly and killed many.

It should have been easy to see in Iraq that any new government there would be led by the Shiite community. Since they are the majority, it makes sense that they would win elections. Then there was the chance that the Shiites might seek justice for their suffering under Saddam Hussein.

The Shiites have gained power because of our invasion of Iraq.

The Sunni in Iraq are reacting now with violence. Fighting between Sunnis and Shiites breaks out daily in Iraq.

## U.S. Has Little Choice

In 2001 in Afghanistan, we removed a harsh government headed by the religious extremist Taliban party. Afghanistan is home to a number of ethnic groups but has never had a government that could truly unite the whole country. Warlords had always ruled different parts of the country. We knew this at the time.

Now the warlords who ruled areas in Afghanistan are making a comeback. Elections are to be held soon. One of those warlords may wind up as the next president. Hamid Karzai is the current president. We are having trouble convincing him to let our troops remain in large numbers past the end of 2014.

In both Afghanistan and Iraq, we took military action that could have been avoided. In Afghanistan, we demanded that the Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden. The Taliban was beginning to respond to our demand. Instead, we invaded.

In Iraq, there was even less reason to send our troops. We invaded because, we said, Iraq was preparing powerful weapons to use to attack us. This turned out to be highly unlikely.

Those invasions damaged both those countries and ourselves.

Thousands of our own forces were killed or wounded. Thousands of Afghans and Iraqis were also killed or wounded.

Now we have to live with the situation in both Iraq and in Afghanistan. We are leaving both countries in shambles. We may not like the governments we see. But, we have no one to blame but ourselves.
