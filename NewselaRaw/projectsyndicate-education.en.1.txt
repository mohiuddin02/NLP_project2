PARIS, France — Until the Industrial Revolution, a vast majority of people were unaffected by formal education or new technology. These advances were reserved for the wealthy. But as technological progress accelerated, education failed to keep pace. This left large numbers of people without the intellectual tools needed to adapt to a rapidly changing world. It also, on a larger scale, contributed to widespread suffering.

It took a century for public policy to respond with an effort to provide universal access to schooling to ensure that everyone would have access to education. In recent decades, big strides have been made in achieving that ambitious goal worldwide. But there is more to be done. We live in an era when technological innovation is once again outpacing education. The effort to provide everybody with an opportunity to learn must not only be redoubled; it must also be retooled for an increasingly unstable and volatile world.

Access to education has been significantly broadened. The world is no longer as divided between rich, well-educated countries and poor, badly educated ones as it was once. The quality of schooling remains a powerful predictor of national income over the long term. In fact, many low-income countries have begun leveraging education as a tool toward strengthening their economies.

## Even Rich Countries Need To Help Students

But work remains in bringing education to everyone — even in high-income countries. Many oil-producing countries, in particular, have succeeded in converting their economic wealth into physical capital and consumption, such as modern buildings and advanced transportation systems. But they have failed to invest in the human capital that will keep their economies running in the future. If high-income countries invested in educating all of their students with at least very basic skills, the countries would benefit greatly economically. Even with their abundant natural resources, far greater wealth lies untapped in the undeveloped skills of their people.  

Education has a much wider impact than simply improving a country's earnings or employment opportunities. That is one reason why education is a factor of the human development index. The index uses a mathematical algorithm to rank countries. According to the index, adults with lower literacy skills are far more likely to report poor health, have less trust in other people, and feel less like they can influence the politics of their country. For countries that fail to educate their residents with the proper skills, technological progress is unlikely to lead to economic growth, and large swaths of the population risk being left with no way to contribute to society.

## Skills Should Match Available Jobs

And yet, it is important to note that formal education alone is not enough to ensure greater opportunity and prosperity. One important issue is matching skills to opportunities. In many economies, a large number of employers cannot find skilled workers while at the same time many unemployed graduates are looking for work. If individuals and countries want to continue to reap the benefits of education, policymakers must ensure that the education system trains students in the skills necessary to prosper in a rapidly changing world and ultimately get a job.

In the past, education was about imparting knowledge, but today, it is about providing students with the tools to navigate an uncertain, volatile world. Unfortunately, the skills that are easiest to teach and test, such as entering data or memorizing facts, are also the easiest to automate or outsource. State-of-the-art knowledge remains more important than ever. But the global economy has evolved into a knowledge economy. Today's world no longer rewards workers for what they know (Google knows everything); it rewards them for what they can do with what they know.

## Teaching Students How To Think

Education needs to focus on improving how students think and also on providing the social and emotional skills students need to successfully collaborate with others. In the past, educators taught students by breaking problems into manageable pieces and then teaching techniques to solve them. But in the workplace today, there is value to being able to look at many separate bits of information and put them together. Workers need more than technical skills. They must also have curiosity, open-mindedness and the ability to make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.

In the traditional education system, students typically learn on their own and are judged individually. But as technology progresses and economies become more connected,  the ability to work with others is becoming increasingly important. Today, innovation and big ideas rarely result from individuals working in isolation. Instead, they are the product of sharing and collaboration. Schools need to add these skills into their class programs by giving students a chance to work across cultures.

## Links Between School And Work

Part of the solution is to promote learning that gives students skills they will use throughout their working lives, rather than focusing on education that ends when work begins. Learning and working can be better integrated, and this shift would allow young people to develop both work skills and "soft skills" — including teamwork, communication, and negotiation — through real-world experience. Another important policy approach is to create pathways between the schools and the job market, including counseling, job-search assistance, incentives for companies to hire low-skilled youth, and income support for young people actively searching for work.

Transforming education for the modern economy will require every part of society to rethink its role in students' lives. Governments will have to design smarter financial incentives. Education systems will have to start inspiring entrepreneurship and better job training. Employers will have to invest in training their workforces, and labor unions that represent workers will need to make sure that training leads to better job opportunities. 

Education is increasingly a global system, and this must be reflected in the skills it provides to graduates. Ultimately, however, the future of education will depend on individuals and their willingness to take advantage of learning opportunities and invest in their own futures.
