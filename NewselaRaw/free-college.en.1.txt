Imagine a city where one-third of the children live in poverty and one-tenth of the adults cannot find a job. Imagine a community where barely six of 10 students even finish high school.

That city was New Haven, Connecticut, just a few years ago. Many New Haven youths saw no way out of their life of poverty. They looked ahead and saw no opportunities; they certainly would never be able to afford to go to college. This reality was especially frustrating because New Haven is home to Yale University. Yale is one of the best colleges in the world; its graduates have gone on to become U.S. presidents and senators.

## A Radical Plan

A few years ago, things began to change. New Haven's mayor and the head of the board of education met with other city leaders to discuss solutions to the city's poor academic performance. They decided to copy a program that was started in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and was working in other cities. The program, New Haven Promise, would pay for the college tuition of high school graduates who qualify. Now in its third year, it has helped lift New Haven's graduation rate. In fact this year, seven out of 10 high school students are on track to get their high school diplomas.

All New Haven students, even those from the poorest families, now have a chance to attend college if they meet the requirements. New Haven Promise will cover full tuition to Connecticut public universities and part of the tuition for private universities in Connecticut. The funding comes from Yale University.

## A City In Search Of A Makeover

New Haven Promise is part of a bigger plan to improve the city's economy. Like so many cities in the Northeast and Midwest, New Haven has serious economic problems. The city had factories that employed low-skilled workers, but those factories are long gone. In their place are new companies that need skilled workers. New Haven residents want those jobs, but it has been too expensive for them to go to college or get specialized training. City leaders realize that turning around New Haven's economy will take more than just new companies moving to town. New Haven needs to invest in educating its youth so they will be qualified to do those high-skilled jobs.

## A Two-Way Promise

New Haven Promise is no one-way street. Although the scholarship is open to all students, candidates must first sign a pledge to "do their best" in certain key areas. To earn the scholarship, they must live in New Haven and attend New Haven public schools. They must have a B average, 90 percent attendance, and a good behavior record. They also have to give 40 hours of service to a community organization.

During the few years these Promise programs have been in place, it has become clear that just providing free tuition is not enough. Many students do not have enough support at home to help them stick with college. There may be nobody setting an example of success or encouraging them to work hard.

In addition to Promise, New Haven started another program called College Summit. The goal is to create a culture of success from kindergarten all the way through 12th grade. Students, teachers and parents must all be on the same page, expecting that every student can and will attend college. High schools are now providing college readiness courses for their students. Promise is offering workshops for parents on how to apply to college.

## Not Just Getting In, But Staying In

The Promise program will be successful if students are able to do well enough in college to finish with a 2-year or 4-year degree. But educators are finding that many Promise scholarship students are not able to finish the first year of college. Some students do not sign up for a second year. Others are not able to get high enough grades to keep their scholarship.

There are many reasons for this. Some students have to get jobs and cannot afford to stay in school. For example, in Kalamazoo, where Promise started, middle-income students were about twice as successful as poor students.

New Haven wants all of its students to succeed. The city is finding ways to give students help and guidance all the way through college. It may be too soon to tell, but the hope is that the new culture of success will make the difference in the years to come.
