MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has stood by his call to block all Muslims from entering the United States. He did so even as the idea was widely condemned as un-American by rival Republican presidential candidates, party leaders and others.

"I don't care about them," Trump told the TV news network CNN when asked about the strong disapproval by Republican party leaders. "I'm doing what's right."

Trump defended his plan for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" by comparing it with President Franklin Roosevelt's actions during World War II. In 1942, President Roosevelt gave an order that imprisoned Japanese-Americans in special centers called internment camps. He did so under the name of protecting the nation. Now the cruel treatment of Japanese citizens during World War II is remembered as a terrible time in American history.

"This is a president who was highly respected by all," Trump said Tuesday. "If you look at what he was doing, it was far worse."

## Widely Criticized, At Home And Abroad

The idea announced by Trump Monday evening drew swift rebukes, some from abroad. British Prime Minister David Cameron slammed it as "divisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong." Muslims in the United States and around the world denounced the idea as unconstitutional or offensive.

The front page of the Philadelphia Daily News pictured Trump holding his right hand out as if in a Nazi salute with the headline "The New Furor." In morning TV interviews on ABC and CNN, Trump was asked about being compared with Hitler.

The candidate did not back down. He said that banning all Muslims is warranted after attacks by Muslim extremists in Paris, France, and San Bernardino, California. Terrorist attacks killed 130 people and injured hundreds more in Paris and killed 14 people in San Bernardino.

"We are now at war," Trump said, adding: "We have a president who doesn't want to say that."

Trump's proposed ban would apply to Muslim immigrants and visitors alike, a sweeping plan affecting all followers of a religion practiced by more than 1 billion people worldwide.

## S.C. Crowd Cheered Announcement

Trump announced his plan to cheers and applause at a Monday evening rally in South Carolina.

"Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life," Trump said. 

At the rally he referred to the 9/11 attacks, warning that without drastic action, "it's going to get worse and worse, you're going to have more World Trade Centers." On Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks killed some 3,000 people at the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania. 

Rod Weader, a 68-year-old from North Charleston, attended the rally and said he agreed with Trump's plan "150 percent."

"As he says, we have to find out who they are and why they are here," Weader said.

## Pushing Limits On Proposed Restrictions 

Since the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, a number of Republican presidential contenders have proposed restrictions on Syrian refugees because many are Muslim. Several candidates suggest giving preferences to Christians seeking protection in the United States. 

But Trump's proposed ban goes much further. His Republican rivals were quick to reject his ideas. "Donald Trump is unhinged," Republican candidate and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said via Twitter. "His 'policy' proposals are not serious."

John Kasich, another Republican candidate, slammed Trump's "outrageous divisiveness," and Ted Cruz, a more cautious candidate, said, "Well, that is not my policy."

Trump's plan also drew criticism from the heads of the Republican Party in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. These states are the first to vote in next year's presidential primaries and will help determine the Republican candidate for president.

"It is un-Republican. It is unconstitutional. And it is un-American," said Jennifer Horn, chairwoman of the Republican Party of New Hampshire.

## Plan Includes Banning Tourists, Immigrants

Corey Lewandowski, the manager of Trump's campaign, said Trump's proposed ban would apply to "everybody," including Muslims seeking immigration visas and tourists.

In an interview on Fox News, Trump said Muslim members of the U.S. armed forces would "come home" and that his plan would "not apply to people living in the country."

In the late 1800s, Congress passed legislation aimed at halting Chinese immigration. But, said Leti Volpp, a University of California expert on immigration law, "there is no precedent for a religious litmus test for admitting immigrants into the United States." Volpp pointed out that the United States has never prevented immigrants from a particular religion.

## Violating The Constitution

"Excluding almost a quarter of the world's population from setting foot in the United States based solely upon their religious identity would never pass constitutional muster," Volpp said.

Trump's proposal came a day after President Barack Obama said the shootings in San Bernardino, California were "an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people."

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said Monday the Muslim couple who carried out the massacre had been radicalized and had practiced shooting at gun ranges within days of the attack last week.

## Candidate Continues To Provoke

Trump's campaign has been marked by a pattern of inflammatory statements, dating back to his harsh words about Mexican immigrants. He has taken a hard line against Muslims since the Paris attacks, advocating enhanced observation of mosques due to fears they will radicalize people.

"Donald Trump sounds more like a leader of a lynch mob than a great nation like ours," said Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "He and others are playing into the hands" of the Islamic State group known as ISIS. "This is exactly what ISIS wants from Americans: to turn against each other."
