Pierre is big and broad-shouldered, while Claire is tiny and painfully shy. A wounded wing and a shotgun blast brought these two rare white pelicans together.

American white pelicans are hardly seen in the world of Florida bird rehabilitation. The team at the rescue center in Orlando's SeaWorld hadn't treated one in nearly 10 years, maybe longer. The brown pelicans — the ones that annoy fishermen by swooping in and stealing their catch — are more common.

But early last month, two whites came in, just one day apart. Pierre and Claire, as the team called them, were both awake, hurt, confused and lonely.

Then they spotted each other.

"They got very excited," said Sherry Branch, SeaWorld's curator of aviculture, better known as "The Bird Lady." She is in charge of the care, housing and feeding of birds.

"They immediately waddled toward one another," Branch said. "I think it was comforting for them just to have someone else of the same species."

## White Pelicans Live Together

White pelicans, after all, are used to living together. When it's breeding season, thousands of them will take over an entire island and build their nests.

The two pelicans became friends. Pierre, perhaps a year old, had been found in a lake near Bradenton, Florida.

"Its wing appeared to be broken, but he could swim OK," said Ed Straight. He is the president of the Wildlife Education and Rehabilitation Center on Anna Maria Island in Florida

Probably, Pierre had become tangled in fishing line left in the lake, and he broke his wing trying to free himself, Straight said.

Straight and his wife drove the pelican to SeaWorld's rehabilitation center, which is just beyond the marine park.

That was on March 7.

A day later, state wildlife officer Heidi Cogburn and Orange County Deputy Kevin Oglesby were patrolling a nearby river in an air boat. They saw a small, struggling white pelican in the water.

## Injured Bird Could Have Been Gator Bait

"It took us a while to get it, but once we did and pulled the pelican into the boat, we could see it was really serious," said Cogburn. She works for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

"I don't know how that bird lived," added Oglesby, who works in the county's marine unit. "It's amazing it wasn't eaten by a gator."

Claire, it turned out, was at least 3 years old and covered with wounds from a shotgun. No one knows if she was shot accidentally by a duck hunter. Her injuries were likely several weeks old, and if she hadn't been found, she would have died from thirst, starvation or shock.

Lara Croft, a SeaWorld veterinarian, said the injury was so bad she had no choice but to remove part of her wing. "I tried to leave her as much wing as I could while still removing all the dead tissue," she said. "Even though she'll never be able to fly, the wing also helps with balance" when she walks.

## One Bird Could Be Released

Meanwhile, X-rays of Pierre showed an injured joint that had already started to heal. In the weeks since his rescue, he has been able to move around much better.

Pierre has not left Claire's side, except when workers have to change her bandages.

"They're always right next to each other," Croft says. "They walk together. They swim together. They rest together."

For now, while they are healing, they share a roomy fenced and netted yard, with plants and shade and their own private pond. She hides behind him, scurrying to the far end of their land when humans approach. Pierre protects her, his eyes darting between the strangers and her, keeping a watch on both.

The veterinarians hope that Pierre can eventually be released into the wild.

Claire, however, would not survive very long if she were set free.

"They have formed this very tight bond," said Croft, adding that it would be sad to part the two pelicans. "But obviously, if he is able to fly, we want him to have as natural a life as possible."

## Claire Won't Lack For Attention

Claire would not be lonely for long. Although mainly brown pelicans live in SeaWorld's Pelican Point, a pair of American white pelicans make their home there, and both of them are males.

"There are two handsome men out there just waiting for her," Branch says. "She'll have a good life."
