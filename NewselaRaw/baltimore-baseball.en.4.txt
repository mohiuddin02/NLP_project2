BALTIMORE, Md. â€” Last week, the city of Baltimore was torn apart by riots. Buildings were burned. People looted, stealing from stores. Policemen were injured.

The anger in Baltimore was over the death of Freddie Gray. Gray was a 25-year-old black man. He died after being arrested by Baltimore police.

On Wednesday, the Baltimore Orioles were scheduled to play a baseball game against the Chicago White Sox. The game wasn't called off. Something even stranger happened: the game was played, but no fans were allowed inside the stadium.

## No Fans, Quiet Stadium

There are 45,971 seats in Camden Yards. It's the home of the Orioles. On Thursday, there were three scouts sitting in the seats. Scouts work for the teams. The rest of the seats were empty.

News reporters were at the game. They shook their heads. They'd never seen anything like it.

No one has. This is the first time a Major League Baseball game has been played with no fans there.

Sounds echoed through the huge stadium: the crack of the bat, the swoosh of a slide. Even the players talking in their dugouts could be heard.

## "Weird" And "Different"

The game moved quickly. It lasted about two hours, which is short for baseball.

Some fans always show up for a baseball game, even if both teams are bad. Even Little League games have parents and friends watching. Playing in an empty stadium got players and coaches thinking.

What's the point of playing if there are no fans? Why do fans come to watch in the first place? Can baseball help Baltimore to heal?

White Sox pitching coach Don Cooper said that playing in an empty stadium was "weird" and "different."

He has thought a lot about it, he said. Without fans, the players must find motivation inside themselves, he said.

## A Home Run Still Counts

Still, baseball is baseball.

"If a ball goes into the seats and nobody sees it, is it still a home run? You bet it is," said Cooper.

Buck Showalter is the manager of the Orioles. His voice matters here in Baltimore. Showalter said it's not his place to imagine why the city exploded in anger.

He said he had no way to truly understand the experience of a young black man in the city.

## Fans Cheering From Outside

Still, Showalter hoped his team could help bring the city together.

Outside the stadium, a small group of fans looked in. They provided the games only cheers: "Let's go, O's!"

Benjamin Fluke is 19 years old. He was watching the game from outside. "You're taking away from the fans, but I understand there is bigger stuff going on than baseball right now."
