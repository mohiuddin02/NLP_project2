WASHINGTON — Army Capt. Brian Dowling was leading his Special Forces team through the mountains of eastern Afghanistan in 2006. Suddenly, enemy fighters attacked his patrol. Two of his soldiers were left pinned down with life-threatening wounds.

The two men were rescued after a furious firefight. But that day would change Dowling's life.

He is now part of an effort by the U.S. Special Operations Command. It is trying to produce a new protective suit for special soldiers. The goal is a suit with head-to-toe armor. It would give a soldier extra strength. Live information would be shown inside the helmet.

They call it — what else? — the "Iron Man suit."

## Superhero Suit

The plan is to make something like Iron Man from the movies, Dowling said. Tony Stark is a character in the movies and Marvel Comics. Stark is a master engineer who builds a high-tech suit of armor, or exoskeleton. He turns himself into the superhero Iron Man when he puts it on.

The Army is now trying to produce a working model. It wants it done within the next 12 months.

The metal suit the Army wants would certainly be awe-inspiring. Bullets would bounce off it harmlessly. It would be able to download live video. These would come from remote-controlled airplanes, or [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), flying overhead. This would allow a soldier to know what was happening nearby.

Tiny motors in the exoskeleton would give the soldier extra strength. He'd be able to easily run and jump while carrying 100 or more pounds.

The suit would also be able to treat small wounds. It would carry a built-in oxygen supply in case of poison gas. An air conditioner would keep soldiers comfortable.

"They want an Iron Man-like suit; they've been quite open about that," said engineer Adarsh Ayyar. "You won't get all of it. It's not going to fly. But I think it's doable."

## An Animated Video

The name for the suit is TALOS. This stands for "tactical assault light operator suit."

Adm. William McRaven is head of the Special Operations Command. He asked engineers working on the suit to imagine a soldier preparing to attack a house.

"He has to open that door not knowing what's on the other side," McRaven said. "He's got to be able to shoot, move and communicate. He's got to be able to survive." A TALOS suit, he said, will lower the soldier's risks.

Armored suits, of course, go back to ancient times. The new updated model the Army wants may seem a bit far out. But the Pentagon has a history of developing advanced technology.

This year the Army produced an animated video about the Iron Man suit. It shows a soldier in heavy armor running down a narrow alley. Behind a huge door unseen enemies wait. Only the barrels of their four AK-47 rifles are visible.

Suddenly the soldier crashes through the door. Dozens of bullets bounce harmlessly off his suit and helmet.

## Just An Idea For Now

How much of this is Hollywood and how much is truly possible is uncertain, designers say. For now, there are only ideas. A real working suit has yet to be built.

Soldiers already wear heavy armored vests and Kevlar helmets. The goal now is to come up with something that provides better protection. It also cannot be so heavy that it keeps soldiers from moving easily.

To make the suit work, designers will need to add a battery. Too big a battery would weigh down the suit. Too small and it could run out of power in the middle of a mission. In the movies, Iron Man is powered by a fictional "arc reactor" stuck in Tony Stark's chest. The reactor sometimes fails and sends him tumbling to Earth.

"The Iron Man movies got it right," said engineer Russ Angold. Making sure the battery always works is the tricky part.
