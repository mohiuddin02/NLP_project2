NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” People like to find out what is happening in the world. They want to hear about what is going on. They want the news.

People used to mostly get news from newspapers. The newspapers were printed on paper. People had to pay for them.

Newspapers are still around. People just do not buy them as much anymore.

These days there are many ways to get the latest news. Most of them are free. You do not have to pay a penny. You just have to look on your phone or computer.

## Hard Times For Newspapers

Many newspapers are in trouble these days. They are not making enough money.

Newspapers are important. They are still the best at finding out about big stories. They are still the best at telling those stories.

It takes a lot of money to run a newspaper. If newspapers do not make enough money, it is hard for them to keep going. Sometimes they have to shut down.

Many newspapers are now online as well as in print. Most of their online stories are free.

Some of the most popular papers ask you to pay to read their online stories. The New York Times is one of those.
