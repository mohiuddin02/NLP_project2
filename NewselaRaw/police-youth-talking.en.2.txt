ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — On a chilly evening, a group of police officers met with Rocky Mount residents to talk about a subject that has come up in almost every city in America. What happens when a young African-American man is stopped by the police?

The Rocky Mount population is 61 percent African-American. There has never been a deadly confrontation between a police officer and a young African-American male. Residents say they want to keep it that way.

"We're trying to be proactive," said Archie Jones. He works for Rocky Mount's city government and helped organize the program called "Know Your Rights."

"We know what happened nationally could happen right here," said Jones, who is African-American.

## Death In Missouri Led To Questions

In August, unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown's death led cities and towns across America to take a close look at the way police treat African-Americans — especially young men. Many people in the African-American community thought that Brown would not have been killed if he had been white.

Although nothing like that has happened in Rocky Mount, a few young black men have been profiled or harassed by police, said the Reverend Andre Knight. He is the local chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Profiling is when a police officer stops, searches or arrests someone based on their race. Profiling is illegal in many places.

"Just because you have a badge and a gun, you don't have the right to abuse your authority," Knight said. "You need to know your rights, but the officer does too."

In October, Jones attended a conference about the shooting in Ferguson and became concerned that it could happen at home. Jones approached Rocky Mount Police Chief James Moore, who told him he had the same concerns.

"We decided it was time to bring the police and the community together to head off any conflicts," Jones said. Some people may fear the police, he said, "but in some cases, the police are as fearful as the citizens."

## Thinking Of Ferguson

At the City Hall meeting, Khristian Roberson, 18, listened intently as several police officers answered questions. Most of the officers were black.

Roberson, who is also black, said he thought about Ferguson when he was stopped last month by a police officer. The officer said he ran a red light.

"I stayed calm. I wasn't rude," Roberson said. He added that he tried not to make the officer mad. Roberson's parents had often given him "the talk" — the careful instructions on dealing with police, delivered by worried African-American parents around the country.

Roberson said he let the officer, who was also black, search his car and was let go without a ticket.

"I thought I was treated OK," Roberson said, adding that his mother thought he may have been stopped because he was black.

## A Good Reminder Of How To Act

Roberson said the police presentation was a good reminder about how to act if stopped by police. People should show their hands, not reach for anything and not make sudden movements, the officers told the crowd.

Ormani Muckle, 17, who attended the meeting with Roberson, added, "It was good to hear the police position straight from them."

Audience members submitted written questions to the police, such as: How can you tell if you're being profiled? What's a "threatening motion"? Can you videotape police if they stop you? Should you tell the police if you have a weapon?

They also wanted to know what police learned from the deaths in Ferguson and New York.

The officers said that yes, you can videotape the police. No, police are not allowed to profile citizens. A "threatening motion" is any sudden movement, especially in the dark. Yes, you should tell police you have a weapon.

As for the Ferguson question, police Lieutenant Henry King responded: Police have learned "to have programs like this and partner with the community."

## "The Police Are The Public, And The Public Are The Police"

Someone asked whether the police could draw a weapon on an unarmed person. King said officers may shoot if threatened by someone who is bigger and stronger, or by someone who tries to take the officer's gun.

Remember, King said, police officers do not have to accept a severe beating in the line of duty.

Audience members, most of them black, nodded, and no one seemed to disagree.

To end the program, Chief Moore looked out at the crowd. He slowly said, "The police are the public, and the public are the police."
