LOS ANGELES â€” There are no nets on the tennis courts at DeForest Park in Long Beach. Tennis balls are nowhere in sight. This evening, people are playing with a different kind of ball.

They are playing a game called futsal. It is squeezed-down, faster type of soccer.

The goals are spray painted on the fence that surrounds the court. Shots whiz by.

English and Spanish blend. Players chant "Corre! Corre!" ("Run!") and "Mira! Mira!" ("Look!").

The matches on this concrete court are quick. The first team to score wins. Losers move to wooden benches. The next team goes to play.

## On Concrete Courts

Arturo Sanchez, 20, loves to play.

There is a soccer field down the road at DeForest Park. But it was taken over by youth leagues during the day. The unlighted field was dark at night. The tennis courts, though, were still lit.

So, several years ago, Sanchez and a group of friends turned the tennis courts into soccer courts. Brazilians and other Latin Americans started doing the same thing nearly a century ago. They turned any flat, open space into a soccer field.

Existing soccer fields are beaten down from being used so much. There is not any open space in city neighborhoods to build more. So futsal has rolled into parks across the nation.

Nearly every player prefers to play on grass. But futsal courts are seen as the best choice right now. Also, building a futsal court costs about $25,000. A soccer field would cost 10 times as much.

## A Fast Game

Parks officials talk about some areas meant for other sports. Now they are mostly used for soccer-like games. This is another sign of how the nation's growing Latino population is changing things.

Futsal is usually played with teams of five. Soccer is normally played with 11 on a side. The smaller teams mean each player kicks the ball more often. The ball is also smaller and heavier. It rolls faster and requires harder kicks.

"You have to know how to pass really fast," Sanchez said. You also have to know how to "attack in small spaces and how to defend all at once," he said.

Soccer players may let the ball soar a long distance. Then they rely on their speed to attack the goal. In futsal, players rely on footwork.

If they tap the ball too hard it will sail out of bounds. If they fail to kick it hard enough, a defender is there to steal it away. There's not enough space to outrace another player for a misplaced ball.

## Adding Futsal Fields

Soccer experts say that children improve at soccer more quickly if they play futsal.

Futsal is also different from indoor soccer. Indoor soccer fields typically look like a hockey rink. Kicks that bounce off the walls are allowed. Futsal has an out-of-bounds line just like soccer.

Los Angeles County opened its first futsal fields last summer. Parents play with toddlers during the day. Teenagers come through in the afternoon. Adults, many of them Spanish-speaking immigrants, play pickup games in the evenings.

County officials said it was necessary to add futsal fields. They make community parks work for the soccer-like activities people want now.

In Long Beach, Sanchez no longer needs to tear down tennis nets; the city has done it for him. Three of the four tennis courts at DeForest Park were made into futsal courts last summer.
