SEATTLE, Wash. â€” Farmers in Washington state are getting ready for a tough summer.

The state got enough rain last winter, but not enough snow fell in the mountains. When the snow melts, it runs down the mountains and fills streams and rivers. This year, streams and rivers are very low.

State officials expect the drought to get worse.

## Saving Water For Later

Some farmers are concerned there will not be enough water to last the entire growing season. They are planning to not water their crops for part of the summer. Others are asking permission to use emergency water wells, or to drill new ones. A large area in Washington will shut off the water to farmers for a few weeks this month. The plan is to save up water for later this summer when farmers really need it.

Fish experts are keeping a close watch on the rivers. They are worried that salmon may get stuck in streams because the water is too shallow. The salmon could be also be hurt by warmer water.

The mountain snowpack level is less than one-tenth of what it should be. Snowpack is the layers of snow that build up over time. Farmers rely on melting snow to water their crops. Also, about one-fifth of the state's rivers and streams are at record low levels. On May 15, Governor Jay Inslee declared a drought emergency across the state.

Inslee's declaration allows the state's Department of Ecology to buy water for farmers. It also lets them protect salmon and help those in need. The department is still waiting for the money, though. Lawmakers have to agree to release the money.

## Streams And Rivers Running Low

It is the worst snowpack since at least the 1930s, said Scott Pattee, a water expert with the state. "The state is in a drought, even though we've had a normal water year."

Rainfall was normal in Washington this winter. Many cities have a good supply of water stored up and don't expect to limit water. Yakima is one of those cities. It has enough water, but is still encouraging people to not use too much.

Low snowpack means there will not be enough water this summer to refill streams and rivers. Summertime is the time when fish and farmers need water most.

Brent DeKoning grows hay in Ellensburg, near Seattle. DeKoning's water supply will be less than what he gets in a normal year.

DeKoning said it will not be enough water to grow as much hay as usual. He also will not be able to plant another crop, like corn or wheat.

"You just have to weather it out," he said. DeKoning hopes there will be more water next year.

## "So We Can Help The Fish"

This month, a group of farmers agreed to stop watering their crops for 17 hours. They are trying to keep more water in the Walla Walla River for salmon and other fish.

Jim Probert is one of the farmers. He raises about 750 cattle. "We're trying to get along with everyone so we can help the fish and not hurt ourselves too bad," he said.

Probert also expects he will use less water later this summer. He plans to move his cattle from pastures to feedlots earlier than usual. At the feedlot, the cattle will eat hay and grain, instead of grazing on grass.

"I don't think I've ever seen it like this, going into summer," Probert said.
