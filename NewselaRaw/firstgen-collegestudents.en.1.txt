NORTHAMPTON, Mass. — Smith College student Audrey Olmos-Govea remembers sitting in her first sociology class and not believing what she had just heard. A guest lecturer turned to the class and said: "You understand, you've all been to Europe, right?"

As most of her classmates nodded in agreement, at that moment Olmos-Govea experienced the culture shock she had been warned about. The Pomona, California, native had flown only once, and is the first in her family to attend college. The $15,000 a year her mother earns is the family's sole income. Europe is out of the question.

Her hand shot up in the air. "I haven't been to Europe," she said. "My family didn't take vacations. I worked every summer."

The lecturer turned beet red and apologized. Olmos-Govea felt embarrassed. "But after the fact, I knew it was the right thing to do," she said recently.

## Financial Aid, Scholarships Ease The Burden

By the time she arrived on campus with just two suitcases and a backpack - contrasting with her roommate who had filled two cars - Olmos-Govea, who is Mexican-American, already had overcome tremendous odds that set her apart from the majority of first-generation students. Now in her third year, she came from a town where 38 percent of residents over age 25 did not graduate from high school, and the majority do not speak English at home. She was encouraged to attend Smith, a top private all-women college with an annual cost of $63,950, not including books. A generous financial aid and scholarship package made it possible for her to afford the high cost.

In recent years, a growing number of expensive colleges have been trying to help high-achieving, first-generation students such as Olmos-Govea survive and thrive. Nationally, just 31.6 percent of first-generation, low-income students who enroll in a four-year college will graduate within six years, according to the most recent data from the Pell Institute, a research group working to improve educational opportunities for low-income, first-generation, and disabled college students. Some 47.8 percent of low-income non-first-generation students will graduate in six years. Those in the bottom 25 percent of family income, like Olmos-Govea, have only a 9 percent chance of graduating by age 24.

## Unique Challenges

At Smith, 19 percent of this year's freshmen are first-generation students. Efforts to help them include a program that encourages the young people to connect and learn about the campus before classes begin.

Many of these colleges are recognizing the array of challenges that keep first-generation students from graduating. In addition to the high cost, the students may be less prepared for the tough courses, have difficulty navigating the complicated college system and might be afraid to ask for help.

"Last year I was talking to a student who was homesick. I started talking to her like I would any other homesick student," said Marge Litchford, assistant dean of students at Smith and founder of the program for first-generation students. "But then I realized she wasn't going to see her parents for the whole year because she couldn't afford to fly home. And they couldn't fly to visit her because they were undocumented."

## Support For "FirstGenSmithies"

Recently, about 12 new Smith students listened to Smith President Kathleen McCartney talk about being the first in her family to go to college. McCartney said her guidance counselor would not write her a letter for a top college, instead encouraging her to apply to local state colleges. Despite that, McCartney applied to Tufts University, a top private university near her home, and got in.

She described the struggle of living at home and working part time while taking classes. After her talk, one student asked whether the group could take a photo with the president.

"I could tweet it out," McCartney said as the students enthusiastically agreed. "What should it say?"

Students volunteered suggestions, and they decided on, "Hanging with my people @smithcollege #FirstGenSmithies"

Angel Perez is vice president of enrollment and student success at Trinity College in Connecticut. Perez said he sees more support and acceptance for first-generation students now than when he graduated from another top small college, in 1998.

"When I went to college I don't know that I would have broadcast that I was a first-generation college student, or even fully understood what that meant," Perez said. "I'm just so shocked that students are willing to talk about it so freely."

## Utilizing A New-Found Confidence

Overall, there are not many first-generation students at the best four-year colleges and universities. A University of Michigan study found that when looking at the poorer half of immigrants, only 14 percent of their children attend the most selective colleges.

Some small private colleges are making an effort to get and keep first-generation students, and they are reporting some success. At Smith, where the orientation program began five years ago, officials say 86 percent of first-generation students graduate in four years. Litchford said the program is aimed mostly at increasing their sense of belonging and empowerment.

Richard D. Kahlenberg is with The Century Foundation, a group that promotes equal opportunity for students to go to college. He said it is important that small colleges enroll students from diverse backgrounds. A large number of leaders in the United States come from these small, top-rated colleges. "Our democracy is stronger if more of our leaders have experienced firsthand the struggles that come with having grown up in a family where the parents haven't gone to college," Kahlenberg said.

The discomfort Olmos-Govea felt as a new student at Smith has been replaced by new-found confidence.

"Being here," Olmos-Govea said, "has taught me how to handle myself in those situations. It hasn't made me any less scared. But Smith has taught me to question. … It's up to me to voice what I'm feeling, and advocate for myself. Because nobody else is going to do it."
