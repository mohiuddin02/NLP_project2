NEW YORK â€” City officials here had long worried that a patient infected with Ebola would eventually appear somewhere in this busy, chaotic city.

It could quickly become a public health disaster. New York is, after all, a city of 8.4 million, where strangers huddle together on subway cars and pedestrians jostle for space on crowded sidewalks.

The city got its first test last week. A doctor who had been treating Ebola patients in the West African nation of Guinea tested positive for the virus after returning to New York and developing a fever of 100.3.

## New York Is Better Prepared

In the wake of the confusion and missteps that surrounded the first U.S. Ebola diagnoses in Dallas last month, public health officials in New York were ready.

The physician, Craig Allen Spencer, was whisked into isolation and his fiancee and friends were placed under quarantined, or forced medical isolation. His apartment was sealed and decontaminated.

New York and New Jersey announced mandatory quarantines for anyone traveling from three West African nations who have had direct contact with an Ebola patient. The quarantines include health care workers.

"This is too serious a situation to leave it to the honor system of compliance," said New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo.

Spencer called the aid group Doctors Without Borders, with whom he volunteered in Guinea, on Thursday morning to report that he had a fever.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Dr. Mary Bassett, the city's health commissioner, assured New Yorkers that Spencer did not become develop symptoms until Thursday morning. They said that he was not contagious during his outings earlier in the week.

## A Concerned Neighborhood

Neighbors gathered outside Spencer's Harlem apartment building, where crews sealed the apartment and handed out Ebola information fliers in English and Spanish.

Cleaners wearing protective suits and boots carried blue plastic waste-collection drums into the apartment to begin the hours-long decontamination process.

Pedro Vanegas, who lives and works across the street from the apartment building, said he was not worried.

"The truth is that I was surprised and worried when I found out last night," Vanegas said. "But I think the government is doing the best they can. They started cleaning the apartment immediately."

Others were not reassured and some echoed U.S. lawmakers' calls for a ban on people arriving from West Africa, where Ebola is suspected in more than 4,800 deaths.

"I don't like the idea that the country is letting people come and go from these West African countries like normal," said Kenneth Clarke, who lives in the neighborhood. "How many more people like him are walking around?"

Juan Perez, whose family lives down the block, said his parents had not sent his younger sister to her school across the street out of fear she could catch Ebola.

"Everybody is scared," Perez said, adding that he wished local officials would hand out more information on Ebola prevention methods.

"And masks," Perez added. "I wish they would give people face masks."

## New York, New Jersey Make Plans

Doctors Without Borders alerted city health officials to Spencer's fever. The health department sent emergency medical services workers in full protective gear to Spencer's apartment.

"The process played out exactly as the protocol dictated," de Blasio said at a news conference. He reminded New Yorkers that Ebola is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids and is not airborne.

To underscore his assertion that New Yorkers have nothing to worry about, de Blasio sent a Twitter photograph of himself riding a crowded subway car.

He and Bassett said they had confidence in the self-monitoring system recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for people returning from Ebola-hit areas. It advises them to isolate themselves for 21 days, Ebola's incubation period, and to take their temperatures twice daily.

But Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said later that the newest developments showed that voluntary self-isolation did not work. From now on, they said, health care workers and others who had direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will be required to spend 21 days in quarantine.

## How To Enforce Mandatory Quarantine

Officials at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York also will conduct interviews with passengers coming from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Then they will decide whether there is reason to impose mandatory quarantines on them.

"He's a doctor," Cuomo said of Spencer, and even he did not follow the guidelines for the quarantine. "Let's be honest. So we have to do more."

"We are no longer relying on CDC standards," Christie said. "There are now New York-New Jersey standards on this."

It was not immediately clear how the mandatory quarantine would be enforced. In New York City, officials said they had placed Spencer's fiancee and two close friends under mandatory quarantine, which included sending health officials to them each day to take their temperatures.

In addition, Bassett said that from now on, other people arriving in the city from the Ebola-afflicted region would be contacted by health officials each day and asked for their temperatures.
