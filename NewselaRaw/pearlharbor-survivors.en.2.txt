PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii â€” Four survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 came together this month. They lived through the destruction of their battleship, the USS Arizona. On Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese Empire bombed the American military base in Hawaii.

The air attack caused the United States to join in fighting World War II. Every year, on the anniversary of the attack, the survivors gather in Pearl Harbor. They come to mark the event, and to honor the many who died.

The men, four of just nine remaining survivors of the bombing of the ship, are now all in their 90s and live far from Hawaii. However, they vowed that this year's anniversary will not be their last reunion.

They gathered for a news conference Tuesday near the memorial that sits on top of the Arizona, which sank during the attack. Even though it's the last official survivor gathering of the USS Arizona Reunion Association, the men said they still plan to get together, even if not in Hawaii.

## Badly Wounded In Attack

"I don't think this is going to be our last. ... We've still got time to go," said Louis Conter, 93. "We'll be back out here no matter whether the rest of the crowd can make it or not."

Donald Stratton, 92, was one of the few survivors among a group of men who were in the forward part of the ship when the Arizona was hit. The men were clustered around a gun-director device. Their job was to figure out the best firing angles for the ship's huge guns. Stratton and the others had sprung into action once it became clear Pearl Harbor was under attack.

More than 65 percent of Stratton's body was burned. He was hospitalized for more than a year and then was medically discharged from the Navy. He then reenlisted a year later.

"The good Lord saved just a few of us," he said.

## "It's Always Like Yesterday"

Sunday marks the 73rd anniversary of the Japanese attack that killed about 2,400 sailors, Marines and soldiers. During a private event Sunday, the four men will toast their shipmates. They will share a bottle of sparkling wine that was given to the survivors association by President Gerald Ford in 1975. The glasses they will drink from are copies of glasses used onboard the Arizona at the time.

The men arrived at the Pearl Harbor visitor center on Tuesday. They were met with military salutes, music from the Navy's Pacific Fleet Band and photo-taking tourists. At the news conference, they discussed their memories of the attack, and their feelings and thoughts about it.

"I learned something about faith," said John Anderson, 97. He recalled that he had just gone to church services and was heading to breakfast when someone said he saw the planes coming. He became teary-eyed as he discussed his twin brother dying in the attack.

"It's always like yesterday when we're out here," Conter said.

## The Ship's Sunken Hull

The survivors on Tuesday also watched live video of a dive along the Arizona's sunken hull. The hull still holds the bodies of more than 900 of about 1,177 men who died on the battleship.

Ashes of 38 survivors are buried there as well, at their request.

Survivor Lauren Bruner, 94, plans to have his ashes placed there when he dies, as does Conter.

Bruner spoke of his decision not to be buried in a normal military cemetery, where, he says, the dead are often forgotten.

"It seems like after a while nobody pays attention to them anymore, after about five years," he said. "I hope a lot of people will still be ... coming over to the Arizona and we'll be glad to see them."
