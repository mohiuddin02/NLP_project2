NEW YORK, N.Y. â€” This year, sales of toys were huge. That is good news in the toy business. For the past several years, toy sales have been low.

These days, toys are not the only thing kids beg their parents to buy. Many kids know more about video games than Barbie and stuffed bears. With so much new technology, it has been hard for toymakers to keep up. In 2015, though, they are expecting to have a strong year.

## Ready, Set, Shop!

The NPD Group is a company that studies the toy business. NPD said toy sales this year are expected to see the biggest increase in at least 10 years.

That is including the final three months of the year, when people are buying gifts for the holidays. Sales in October, November and December will probably reach $9.6 million. Toy sales will get a bigger holiday bump this year than they did in 2014.

What is pushing toy sales higher?

Experts say there are at least three reasons why toy sales are increasing. Toys based on Hollywood movies are becoming more and more popular. At the same time, new technology is making toys more advanced. Finally, toy companies are having more success reaching out to older kids.

## We Like To Buy Movie Stuff

Successful movies have helped companies sell huge numbers of toys. For example, the movie "Frozen," which came out in 2014, was an enormous success. "Frozen" tells the story of a princess with icy powers. Toys linked with the movie were very popular. In fact, "Frozen" was the top toy brand last year, NPD said.

Movie-based toys look like they will be popular again this year. The new "Star Wars" movie comes out on December 18. Hundreds of "Star Wars" toys, from puzzles to action figures, are already on sale. "Star Wars" might help toy companies have a big year in 2015.

Business expert Marty Brochstein says that one "Star Wars" toy is already selling out. The "Kylo Ren" Deluxe LightSaber is flying off shelves. It uses advanced technology to help kids imagine it is just like the light sabers used in the movies.

David Brandon is the head of the toy store Toys R Us. He says that the store hopes "Star Wars" will help them to sell more toys.

"It will be very interesting to see at the end of the holiday season where the growth comes from. And how much growth there is," Brandon says.

## Toy Companies Are Using More Technology

Another reason that toy sales are rising has to do with technology. Toymakers have begun using fancier technology in the toys they build. That means toys are becoming more advanced.

Jim Silver works for a company that reviews toys called TTPM. He said that technology is making toys more appealing to young children and teens.

For example, toys are becoming more life-like. One toy on sale this year is a unicorn called StarLily My Magical Unicorn. It can make more than 100 sounds and motions. Kids can interact with it as if it were alive.

Mattel, the nation's largest toy company, is also hoping technology will help sales.

Geoff Walker works at Mattel. He said that toy technology can get kids' attention. That is harder to do these days.

"You want to make sure that you give them enough that they're going to want to walk away from their iPads and phones," he said.

Mattel's new Barbie doll can have a two-way conversation with girls. Another popular toy is "Smart Bear," a talking teddy bear that helps kids learn.

## Toys That Attract Attention

As toy technology improves, toys are starting to appeal to older kids, too. Toy sales to tweens and preteens who are 8 to 12 years old are driving up toy sales. But toy companies first have to get their attention.

As toys become more technologically advanced, they are appealing to older audiences. For example, a toy called Meccano Meccanoid G15 allows kids to build their own 4-foot-tall robot, a machine that can walk and talk. It has more than 1,200 parts and tons of computer memory.
