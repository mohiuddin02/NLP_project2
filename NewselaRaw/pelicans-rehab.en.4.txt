Pierre and Claire are white pelicans.

Last month, they were brought to SeaWorld's rescue center.

They were both hurt. Claire had been shot. Pierre had a broken wing.

Then they spotted each other.

"They got very excited," said Sherry Branch. She is called "The Bird Lady." Branch is in charge of birds for SeaWorld. It is a theme park in Florida.

Pierre and Claire waddled toward each other. Branch thinks they comforted each other.

## Pierre Had A Broken Wing

On March 7, Pierre was found in a lake.

His wing was broken. He was able to swim, though, said Ed Straight. He runs another rescue center in Florida.

Maybe Pierre had gotten caught in fishing line in the lake. He broke his wing trying to free himself, Ed said.

Ed took the pelican to SeaWorld.

## Like To Stay Close

A day later, two people were in a boat. They saw a small white pelican in the water. She was struggling. They pulled her into the boat. Then they took her to SeaWorld.

The pelican was hurt badly. She had been shot.

At SeaWorld, the two pelicans like to stay close to each other.

They walk together. They swim together. They rest together, said Lara Croft. She is a veterinarian at SeaWorld.

The two pelicans also share a yard. It has plants and a pond. Claire hides behind Pierre. Pierre protects her.

## One Could Be Set Free

The vet hopes Pierre can be put back into the wild. Claire can never be set free. She can no longer fly.

Lara said it would be sad to separate them. Yet, Pierre should be free, she said.

Claire would not be lonely for long. At SeaWorld, there is a pair of American white pelicans. Both of them are boys.

They will keep Claire company, Sherry said. She will have a good life.
