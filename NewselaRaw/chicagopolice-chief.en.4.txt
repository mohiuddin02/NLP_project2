Last year, a Chicago police officer killed a teenager. The officer was white. The teen was black. A video camera recorded the shooting.

Last week, a judge said the police department had to release the video. It showed the officer firing bullets at Laquan McDonald. He was 17 years old. The officer is named Jason Van Dyke. He was charged with killing McDonald. Van Dyke will go on trial and get a chance to defend himself.

People have become very upset about the video. Thousands have protested in the streets. They were angry that it took so long to see it. They also were angry that Van Dyke was not charged earlier. Many people blamed the head of the Chicago Police Department. His name is Garry McCarthy.

On Tuesday, McCarthy was fired.

## People Lost Trust, Mayor Says

Rahm Emanuel is the mayor of Chicago. He said he fired McCarthy so people would start trusting the police again.

The mayor said that McCarthy did good work. Yet, the needs of Chicago are more important, Emanuel said. People do not trust McCarthy to lead the police.

City leaders and protesters had demanded that Emanuel get rid of the chief. They argued that a new police leader was needed. On Tuesday, a newspaper said people do not trust him now.

## Police Leader Admits Mistakes

McCarthy admitted to making mistakes. After the shooting, the police gave out wrong information. They said that McDonald did not stop although the police told him to stop. They said he also ignored orders to drop a knife.

McCarthy also defended how the police acted during the protests. He said they acted properly. They avoided hurting anyone.

Also on Tuesday, the mayor said he began a new group. It will come up with ideas to make sure that police treat people fairly. It has another purpose. Police cars have video cameras. They take pictures of crimes. Right now, the city will not let people see the videos. The group will also decide if the city should change this rule.
