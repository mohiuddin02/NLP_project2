It's no surprise that dogs like being petted. Unlike other animals, like porcupines, dogs are a hands-on species that loves physical contact.

But research suggests that dogs aren't the only ones who benefit from the petting. Positive interactions between people and dogs actually make both species happier. After enjoyable activities, like petting, play or talking, both dogs and humans feel a surge of chemicals in their bodies. The chemicals are called endorphins. The endorphins lead to bonding and happy feelings.

A recent study shows that eye contact may be enough to increase our endorphins. Dogs pay close attention to human faces. In some cases, they can even pick up on specific facial expressions. The act of gazing at your dog — or your dog gazing back at you — has been shown to increase endorphin levels.

## Sharing A Long Gaze

The new study was conducted by Miho Nagasawa, of Azabu University in Japan, and her team of scientists. They looked at the levels of certain endorphins in humans and dogs before and after the two species stared at each other. They found that owners and dogs that shared a long gaze had higher levels of oxytocin in their urine. Oxytocin is an endorphin. It is sometimes called the "cuddle hormone" because it has an important job in human bonding. A mother's body releases oxytocin after she has a baby. It helps her feel attached to her newborn baby. Gazing between dogs and owners is another behavior that leads to feeling attached.

The researchers collected urine samples from 30 dog-and owner pairs before and after they spent 30 minutes together. They found that the longer the dog and human stared at each other, the higher the endorphin levels were in both species. In other words, the longer the dog and human stared at each other, the more connected they felt.

These findings may help explain our intense and deep relationship with dogs.

Nagasawa recommends that dog owners do more than give commands to their dogs. She encourages humans to think about the effects of their gaze when they are building a relationship with their pet.

## Does It Work With Wolves?

Nagasawa's study fits into a larger puzzle that many scientists are studying related to evolution. Coevolution is a theory that two species evolved over time in ways that are related to one another. The gazing study supports the idea that there is a connection between humans and dogs that goes back a long time.

Nagasawa wanted to understand if there was a similar connection between humans and other animals. So her team also conducted a gazing experiment with wolves. The wolves in the study had been raised by humans. They wanted to see if wolves would experience the same rush of endorphins that dogs did. However, there was a major difference between the dogs and wolves. The wolves couldn't hold gazes with the humans in the study for more than a few moments. The researchers concluded that the "dog-to-owner gaze" developed over time as humans domesticated them. Since wolves do not typically interact with humans, they did not develop that skill.

Testing evolutionary theories like coevolution can be tricky. Scientists have to be careful to determine what animal behaviors are due to evolution, and which ones are because of how an animal was raised.

It is important to understand the differences in animals when scientists are making conclusions about evolution. For example, in the studies with the wolves, researchers had to think through many questions about the setting and wolves' behavior. In the gazing study, were the wolves exploring a new environment where the testing took place? Were they trying to escape? If so, those reasons may help explain why the wolves were not staring at the humans.

So far, science has supported what many people feel about dogs: there is a deep bond between a dog and its owner. However, it is too early to rule out other species, including wolves, from sharing similar connections to humans.
