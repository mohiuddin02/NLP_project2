There are now many more homeless people than there were two years ago. The increase was mostly caused by rising rents, the report said.

The new report was prepared by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. The Authority counts the number of homeless people every two years. It looks at homelessness in both the city and county of Los Angeles.

## At Home In Tents And Cars

A lot more people are now living on the streets in tents, camps and cars.

"It's everywhere now," said Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Bonin. The camps are in neighborhoods where families live, he said. "They're outside of schools."

The increase in homelessness was caused by rising rents in downtown Los Angeles and Venice. Once, there were plenty of cheap hotel rooms, motels and single-room apartments in both of those areas. Now, they are disappearing.

The change in both neighborhoods has made people angry and nervous. In just over two months, two unarmed homeless men were killed by police. Charly Keunang was killed on March 1, while Brendon K. Glenn was killed last week.

More than 44,000 homeless people were counted in January, the new report said. In 2013, the city and county had around 39,000 homeless people.

## Not Enough Affordable Housing

Many blamed the mayor and other public officials for the bad news.

"The city and county have done such a terribly poor job of creating affordable housing," said housing activist Steve Clare. "Basically they've ignored the issue."

Homelessness activist General Jeff Page said new homes need to be built.

"We need shovels in the ground," he said.

The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority says it needs much more money to solve the problem. The agency also said all neighborhoods must accept housing for the homeless. Right now, many people do not want the homeless to be housed in their area.

At the moment, there are simply not enough homes for all the homeless.

Meanwhile, housing prices and rents are rising rapidly. The increase is making affordable houses even scarcer.

## Critic Says L.A. Is All Talk, No Action

Homelessness activist Alice Callaghan is angry at city leaders. She blames them for failing to stop the loss of affordable housing.

City leaders talk big, she said. They promise to have everyone off the streets by next year. However, those promises are ridiculous, she says.

"There's no housing to put people in," Callaghan said. "I don't think people understand how bad it is."
