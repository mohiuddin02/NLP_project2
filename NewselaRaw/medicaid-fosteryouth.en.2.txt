Soon after moving to Utah this summer, Rainbow Sky Buck went to the hospital with a painful ear infection. While there, Buck learned that the state of Utah would not pay her medical bills.

When Buck lived in California, she was part of the foster-care system and did not live with her biological parents. Because she was a foster youth, she was able to get free health care through Medicaid. The government program helps low-income Americans pay for medical care.

Now that she lived in another state, Buck would have to pay the bill herself. She emptied out her bank account and borrowed money. "Luckily, I got my antibiotics and I am OK now," she said. "But what is going to happen next time?"

## Care Is Free To Age 26, Only In Same State

Under health law, young adults who have outgrown the foster-care system can get free health care through Medicaid until they turn 26. Yet these young people are facing a serious problem: They are promised coverage only in the state where they were in foster care. All states can choose to pay health costs for former foster youths. However, only about a dozen have done so.

Now, activist groups and lawmakers are trying to change the law at the national level. They do not want former foster youths to lose Medicaid coverage, no matter where they move.

Representative Karen Bass of California and Representative Jim McDermott of Washington state are lawmakers in Congress. They have proposed a bill that would make things easier for former foster youths. Since the bill is just a proposed law, it needs to get voted on. If the bill gets voted into law, it would allow all former foster youths to qualify for Medicaid and get free medical care until they are 26.

Other lawmakers and activists are pushing for similar changes.

## Youths More Likely To Need Care

First Focus is a group that helps foster youths. It has been receiving calls from young people who had no idea that they would lose health insurance when they moved.

"We really do feel an urgency about this," said Shadi Houshyar, who works for the group. "So many people who have aged out have significant health needs."

Experts say former foster youths are more likely than their peers to have physical and mental health needs. Research shows that about one in five former foster youths had been hospitalized at least once in the previous year. One-third had two or more emergency room visits.

Fatima Morales works for the group Children Now, which helps children. She said that just like other young people, former foster youths move to different states for school, jobs or family. Morales said they should not be put at a disadvantage for doing so.

Morales said her group is trying to let young people know what they might face if they move. "They need to know how their health coverage might be impacted," she said. "It's just something that they need to weigh."

## Coverage Might Limit Choices

Lezlie Martinez, 19, is trying to decide what to do. She is hoping to move from California to Colorado because she wants to live in a place that is less expensive. Her boyfriend is already there and she is looking for jobs to support herself and her 2-year-old son.

She worries that she might be left uninsured and unable to pay for treatment for several medical conditions. "It is causing foster youth to be stuck in the same state they were raised in," said Martinez, who lives in Oceanside, California. "It is really stressing me out."

Buck, who moved from California to Utah, thought she would have an easier time finding a job in her new state. Before moving, she asked social workers about whether she would still qualify for free health coverage and was told that she would. Buck said she was shocked to learn in fact that she would not.

She is no longer seeing a doctor for some of her health problems and is taking herself off medicines. She said she can no longer afford them. Buck said she also worries about getting another ear infection and not being able to afford treatment.

"It is just scary to think I am completely on my own," she said. Buck recently got a job at an automotive shop but doesn't get health care from her job. "I don't want to leave, but this is almost forcing me to move back to California."
