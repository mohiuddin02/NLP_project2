BROOKLINE, Mass. — Parkour treats the world as one big obstacle course. Athletes jump around on everyday objects like benches and buildings, anything they can get their hands on, to push themselves forward.

Now, the sport is becoming more and more popular. It's no longer just for the subculture whose YouTube-worthy acrobatics made it famous.

Although the sport was once only for the outdoor anti-athlete, it's becoming the go-to sport for people who just want a good workout.

Jessamyn Hodge is a 32-year-old software and information engineer from South Boston. She recently prepared for her first parkour class at a high school gym in suburban Brookline. She was hoping to learn the kind of wall-scaling, fence-hopping, obstacle-conquering moves she'd already seen in online videos shared by her rock-climbing friends.

"It's like dancing at high speed," she said. "It reminds me of being a kid again, like monkeying around on anything and everything, clambering about, generally having fun while getting around."

Parkour was developed in France in the 1980s. It borrows elements from martial arts, gymnastics, rock climbing and other athletic fields. Participants turn obstacles like park benches, trees, handrails, and buildings into tools they can use to nimbly propel themselves forward.

Parkour's developers were influenced by military training principles. Since then, some of the sport's most spectacular moves have been featured in movies, video games and advertisements. One of the most recognizable is a chase scene on a construction crane in the 2006 James Bond movie "Casino Royale."

Beginners who want to hit the ground running — but are not as extreme as James Bond — have the option of classes like those offered by London-Based Parkour Generations. It's a business with branches in California, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. It also offers classes in several countries including Thailand, Singapore and Brazil.

Classes include a warm-up, technical drills to learn the basics of safety, and games to teach and strengthen parkour techniques. At the Brookline class, instructors set up metal bars they called scaffolding and vault boxes in the gym. They teach students how to walk on or jump over balance beams and lift, leap or weave their way through whatever else is in their path.

## Features Functional Fitness

Both newcomers and advanced learners train together. Those with more experience are given more challenging training.

Instructor Blake Evitt said many of the new students he sees view parkour as a functional way to get fit. But parkour offers more than flashy stunts — it's a way for people to test their physical and mental limits.

"It's almost a way of life," said Evitt, a director of the U.S. branch of Parkour Generations.

Julio Sepulveda is a climate-change researcher who takes classes in the Boston suburb of Somerville, Mass. He said parkour is very accessible because learners don't need access to fancy, expensive gear to get into it. They can simply walk to a nearby park and use the existing environment to practice.

"And it's really all about your flow. The flow of your movements and your mind, which is really cool," Sepulveda said after catching his breath. "So it's a nice connection between your mind and your body."
