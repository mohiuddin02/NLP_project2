SAN JOSE, Calif. — The Pacific Ocean has been unusually warm this year. As a result, strange fish and sea animals from far away places have been spotted in the area.

Hawaiian ono fish are swimming off the California coast. And a green sea turtle usually at home off the Galapagos Islands was found floating near San Francisco.

The Pacific Ocean off the West Coast has warmed because of changes in wind patterns this fall. The warmer waters have drawn in warm-water fish and animals.

Temperatures off the California coast are currently 5 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual for this time of year. Fall temperatures are the warmest in 30 years.

## Why's The Water Warm?

"It's not bathtub temperature," said Nate Mantua, a scientist in Santa Cruz, "but it is swimmable on a sunny day."

It was 65 degrees off the Farallon Islands and 69 degrees near Santa Barbara in mid-October. Water temperatures in those areas would be in the high 50s or low 60s most years.

The last time the ocean off California was this warm was in 1983 and 1997. Both were strong El Niño years. In an El Niño, ocean water at the equator near South America warms much more than usual, and can affect the weather in North and South America.

But El Niño isn't driving this year's warm water, experts say.

Climate change isn't driving it either.

## The Answer's In The Wind

A change in wind patterns is the reason. Winds that normally blow from the north to the south keep warm water closer to the equator. Since the summer, the winds have dropped off. It has allowed the warm water to move north.

In most years, the winds also help push water along the ocean's surface. This churns up cold water from down below. That isn't happening much this year.

"If the wind doesn't blow, there's no cooling of the water," Mantua said. "It's like the refrigerator fails."

Mantua said scientists don't know why the winds slacked off. They also don't know when they will start up again.

"It's a mystery," he said.

## Tropical Fish Go North

For people who study the ocean, this fall has been a wonderland.

Scientists have spotted more than 100 dolphins off the Farallon Islands in the past two months. They're normally hundreds of miles away, off Southern California.

The scientists have found tiny sea butterflies, a type of tropical snail. They're normally found far to the south. They also found a Guadalupe fur seal, which is normally found in the waters off Mexico.

In September, a fisherman off San Francisco caught an endangered green sea turtle. This turtle is a very rare find for Northern California. It usually lives off Mexico and the Galapagos Islands. The fisherman returned it to the sea safely.

Fishermen and scientists have also found Hawaiian ono in Southern California. In addition, they found tripletail, a type of fish commonly found between Costa Rica and Peru. This summer, there were even sightings of giant sunfish off Alaska.

## No Cold Barrier

"They are following the water temperature," said H.J. Walker, a scientist. The warm-water fish normally turn around when they hit cold water, he said. This year, they are swimming farther north.

In many parts of California, fisherman caught fewer salmon. And squid were caught far north, which is unusual.

The ocean changes also have affected birds. Birds eat fish that eat krill that live deep in the ocean. Because the wind isn't pushing the surface water as much, not as much food is coming to the surface. With less food to eat, the birds are having a hard time laying eggs.

More of the types of fish and sea animals usually seen off the West Coast are expected to return when the waters cool. This is what happened after the 1983 and 1997 El Niños.

"It is an oddball year. But I'm not surprised," said Joe Welsh, who works for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. "These things come and go. There's a lot to learn out there."
