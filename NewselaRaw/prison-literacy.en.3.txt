MINNEAPOLIS — When he was a youngster, A.J. Briscoe was a strong student who had the chance to go to top schools in his area. But Briscoe lived in a tough neighborhood and he began to look up to young men he saw with jewels and new cars, young men making money in illegal ways.

## A Young Life Of Crime

When Briscoe was 12 he was arrested for the first time after police stopped him with drugs in his pocket. By the time he was 14, Briscoe said, he had made $200,000 selling drugs on the streets.

The temptations of the criminal life were strong and Briscoe told himself he was not hurting anybody, he was just selling drugs.

It wasn't long before Briscoe ran into more trouble with the police. A pattern began: he would be arrested, charged with a crime, sent to prison. He sold drugs in 32 states and went to prison several times.

For the last 22 years of his life, Briscoe, a former gang member, has been supervised by someone — either in prison or on probation. He had to report his daily actions, live only in certain places, and accept surprise visits by his probation officer.

In prison, though, one unlikely thing changed Briscoe's life and put him on the right path — reading.

## Reading Is So Important

Briscoe's transformation came after he saw another prisoner struggling to read a children's book to his son. The prisoner could barely read the book — he was illiterate. Briscoe can read, but he started to think about his own children. Would he be able to teach them?

"It haunted me to think about my own son asking me to help him with his homework," he said. From then on, Briscoe read everything he could get his hands on. Prison became his college.

Reading even saved his life. Briscoe was facing serious criminal charges that could have put him behind bars for 60 years. He dug through law books and found an error in the case against him. When his lawyer showed the error to the judge, Briscoe was sent to jail for three years instead of 60.

## Spreading His Message

Briscoe is now dedicated to pursuing his dream: becoming an independent businessman who encourages young people to read and spreads a message of hope.

He began his pro-reading project while he was in prison in Tennessee. He started a program to encourage prisoners to read. All the prisoners would chip in a little money, and the money would be used to get new books for the prison library.

These days, Briscoe wants to help young people who may be facing the same temptations he did. Briscoe started a program called To Succeed You Must Read! It reaches out to students in schools and libraries and includes a summer book club. Briscoe plans to visit 200 poor schools to encourage reading and to help kids follow their dreams, and fight their fears.

Briscoe has a partner and supporter — his wife of five years, Sundia.

"Sundia," he said, "taught me how to love people."

## The Bookshelf Is Full

Briscoe needs the support, because switching to a life of following the law has not been easy. One big issue is money. As a drug dealer, Briscoe made lots of it, he was rich. Now, it's much harder for him to earn money to support his family.

His probation officer, Kim Peterson, believes in him, but she knows he still faces a difficult road ahead.

"Kim told me, 'You can't do anything related to your past life, because you'll destroy people's faith and hope that people can change.'"

A.J. and Sundia live in a home filled with African art. On their front porch is a bookshelf, where kids can take books for free. There is plenty of taking, Sundia said with a laugh.

"Every day, in the summer especially, I come home to kids waiting on the stairs. They want to eat, because he's always cooking or baking. They grab a book. They're so excited to just be around him," she said.

## A Finally Free Man

Recently, A.J. celebrated his own personal "liberation day," the first day he was completely free from government supervision. It rained. His car broke down. He missed a meeting. But it was still an "amazing" day, Briscoe said.

For the first time in 22 years, he was truly free.
