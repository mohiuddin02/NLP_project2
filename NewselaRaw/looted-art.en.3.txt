AMSTERDAM - A major investigation of art hanging in Dutch museums just concluded. The goal was to find out if any of the art was once stolen by the Nazis during the 1930s and 1940s. The results were surprising: the investigation found 139 works that may have been looted, or stolen. They include ones by important artists like Matisse, Klee and Kandinsky.

The announcement Tuesday by the museums was a bombshell. It also raises a question: Why has it taken them nearly 70 years to examine their collections after World War II? It also suggests that even more looted art may show up in countries that have not done such investigations.

"These objects are either thought or known to have been" taken by the Germans during the war, said Siebe Weide. Or they were sold by owners who were forced against their will to sell them, he said. Weide runs the Netherlands Museums Association.

The art included 69 paintings. One of them is French artist Henri Matisse's 1921 "Odalisque." It is a painting of a half-nude reclining woman. The painting hangs in Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum. The museum is very popular with tourists.

## Paintings, Sculptures And Drawings

All Dutch museums with art from before the war participated in the review. They have identified the names of 20 people whose art was taken and linked them with 61 of the artworks. The museums are trying to find relatives of the former owners, including those of Jewish art dealer Albert Stern. He is the man who owned the Matisse.

The examination also found other paintings by well-known painters. Other pieces uncovered included drawings, like one by Paul Klee. There were also sculptures, old collectors pieces and Jewish ceremonial objects.

One painting had been purchased in good faith by the Museum of Dordrecht in 2002. The 1627 painting had changed hands many times over the years. Then the latest Dutch examination revealed it had belonged to a Jewish woman. It was sold by a bank. That bank had worked with the Nazis during the war.

In 1998, there was an international conference on looted art.  The Washington meeting found past attempts to return looted art didn't go far enough. Attendees from 44 nations set up the Washington Principles. They declared that "every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been" taken by the Nazis, and have it returned.

## Second Examination By The Dutch

Many American and British museums have already thoroughly looked at their collections. They have returned looted art. But nothing has been done across the two countries. In Germany, a government-led, nationwide examination is happening now.

The Dutch examination was the second in the Netherlands. The first one in 2006 focused only on works that were bought and sold during the war.

Some wondered what took so long.

"While I applaud the Dutch for doing this, I also have to say: where were you all this time?" said Chris Marinello, a London-based lawyer. He helps people in looted art cases. He said many countries should be doing more to help recover looted art. The United States is one of them.

## Website Seeks More Information

But some countries are less willing than others. Russia does not accept the Washington Principles. It calls art taken during World War II its rightful "trophies." Switzerland endorses the principles in theory, but has not conducted thorough research and ignores the idea that looted art could be hidden in its bank vaults, Marinello said.

The Dutch Museums Association launched a website on Tuesday. The site will show what the museums have discovered so far, and ask for more information about looted artwork. It will help relatives or others in filing claims. An English translation of the Dutch website is coming in 2014.

Investigator Rudi Ekkart admitted it's still possible that more looted artwork will be uncovered in the Netherlands. He said the museums' research was not complete and new research ideas — such as the website — will lead to new findings. In addition, there are likely pieces still held in homes that will be eventually detected.

But "you'll never again have a hundred at once," Ekkart said.
