KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — It was Tuesday night at the 2014 Winter Olympics. A group of women ski jumpers strapped on their helmets. They boldly raced down a steep icy ramp. And then they took off into flight.

Ski jumping means to jump off a high ramp on skis over a snow-covered slope.

But the women weren't just ski jumping. They were making history too.

Before Tuesday, no woman had ever ski jumped at the Olympics. Women ski jumpers weren't allowed.

But it was finally happening: 30 women from 12 countries were taking part in the first Olympic women's ski jump. They had fought long and hard to be there.

## Zooming And Flying

One by one, they shot off the ramp. Just like the male ski jumpers.

Many people had told them the sport isn't right for women. That it is too dangerous. And unhealthy for them as well.

On Monday, Russian ski jump coach Alexander Arefyev said: "I'm not a fan of women's ski jumping." It's just too dangerous, he thinks.

"If I had a daughter, I'd never let her jump," he said. Women are meant "to have children, to do housework."

But now, at last, women were jumping. They zoomed downhill and flew through the air at 60 miles per hour. They traveled about 10 to 15 feet off the ground. For the length of a football field.

Carina Vogt of Germany won the gold medal. Daniela Iraschko-Stolz of Austria won the silver. And Coline Mattel of France took the bronze.

American Lindsey Van led the effort to get women ski jumpers into the Olympics. She finished 15th.

"We can call ourselves Olympians now,'' said Van.

## Given A Chance, At Last

"I think all the girls from all the countries are just smiling," said American skier Jessica Jerome. "Everybody was just really glad.''

The first to jump was 19-year-old American Sarah Hendrickson.

Hendrickson didn't realize right away what it meant to go first. Then someone said, "You're the first girl EVER to jump in an Olympics."

"I kind of took that and ran with it," Hendrickson said. "It's a pretty cool thing. We put on an awesome show and the world saw what we've been working for.''

Many people think "men are braver than women,'' said Sarah's father, Bill Hendrickson. But going off these big ski jumps isn't easy. It "takes a lot of guts."

There are women, he said, who have the skills. And they have the "courage to do the same kinds of things men do.''

They only want one thing — to be given a chance.
