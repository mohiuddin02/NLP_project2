SOCHI, Russia â€“ Slopestyle is the newest Olympic event.  It is a form of snowboarding.

The sport takes place on a snowy course of rails and jumps. Snowboarders do big spinning jumps and other tricks. The event can be dangerous. But the danger gets people to watch.

Some people are asking: Did the 2014 Winter Olympic Games make the course too dangerous?

On Wednesday, Shaun White suddenly said he would not compete in slopestyle. White is the most famous snowboarder in the world.

White is still scheduled to snowboard in another event. He will try to win the halfpipe. The halfpipe competition takes place on a ramp in the shape of a half-circle. Snowboarders and skiers do tricks on the ramp. White is a halfpipe favorite. He could become the first American man to win an event at three straight Winter Olympics.

## Course Changes After Accidents

But White's goal to capture a medal in two events will not happen. This is troubling. The Sochi Olympics have had a lot of problems. Russia paid about $51 billion to hold the games. Still, concerns about safety, overspending, human rights and construction woes have become a big story.

White said the decision not to compete in slopestyle was "difficult." He said: "I know how much effort everyone has put into holding the slopestyle event for the first time in Olympic history."

White's decision came after days of problems at the slopestyle course.

Torstein Horgmo of Norway was a favorite in the slopestyle contest. But he fell on a jump during a practice run. He broke his collarbone, ending his Olympics. A Finnish competitor, Marika Enne, crashed on the course's third and final jump. She hit her head and was hauled off in a stretcher. White jammed his wrist in a practice run.

Olympic officials scrambled to fix things. They met with athletes and made small changes to  the 2,083-foot-long course.

## Modified Course Called "Sick"

It seems like organizers expected that some snow would melt before the games. That didn't happen. So the people running the games tried to reshape the jumps. One athlete had compared the jumps to leaping from the top of a building. Athletes also reported that rails used for tricks were too sticky and needed to be waxed.

Some slopestyle athletes downplayed the risks of the course.

"Snowboarding is dangerous. Like crossing a street is dangerous," said Canadian Mark McMorris. He broke a rib less than two weeks ago at the X Games. But he was still competing at the Olympics. The X Games are a competition for extreme sports.

Sage Kotsenburg is one of White's Olympic teammates. He called the modified course "sick." He meant it as a good thing.

"The snow's getting better," he said after a training session. "It's still a little bit icy. I mean, it's a dangerous course. Every course is dangerous."

Kotsenburg went on to win a gold medal in the slopestyle competition. He was the first American to win gold at the Sochi Olympics.

## Seeking A Younger Audience

The changes were apparently not enough to make White comfortable. There was still too much risk of injury, he said. He did not want to risk missing out on his other Olympic goals.

The U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association supported White's decision.

Slopestyle became an Olympic sport very quickly. The speed was unusual for the International Olympic Committee, which chooses the sports. It often takes many years to get sports into the Olympics.

Even slopestyle athletes were taken by surprise by the decision. Most had assumed that the event would not make it into the Olympics until at least 2018. Many observers said the choice was made because the Olympics wanted to get younger people to watch.

Slopestyle has seen sadness. One of its most well-known competitors was Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke. She died in a training accident two years ago. The X Games champion pushed hard to get the sport into the Olympics. Her teammates planned on honoring her in Sochi with a sticker on their helmets.
