SEATTLE, Wash. â€” Many scientists have said the Earth is heating up. When people burn oil or coal, it creates gases. These gases are getting trapped in the air and heating up the Earth. The gases are changing the Earth's climate, or weather.

Some kids are worried about the Earth and climate change. They want lawmakers to listen. The kids are suing the government. They are also writing petitions. In their lawsuits and petitions, the kids are trying to change the law in court. If they win, the law will change in their favor. The kids argue that when they grow up, they will be the ones living on Earth. The adults today will not be around in the future. So, it is up to the kids today to protect the planet for their future.

## Kids Want Help Cleaning Up Earth

The kids say they do not want to live on an unhealthy and dirty Earth. They say the government's job is to protect the planet for the public. This is known as the "public trust." They argue that the government has not been doing its job.

In Washington, eight kids between 10 and 15 years old have sent in a petition to the court. The petition has been signed by many people. The kids hope the petition will change the law. They say the government has not lowered the amount of gases that are being burned. The gas stays in the Earth's air. It settles into oceans, rivers and lakes.

## Asking For Stricter Laws

The kids want their government to make stricter laws. The laws would make it harder for businesses and other groups to burn gases.

Gabriel Mendell is 13 years old and is working for the petition. "Everything that can go wrong is going wrong," Mendell says about the Earth's problems. "The snowpack is melting. ... We need to fix it."

## Climate Change Not Just A State Problem

It will be hard to fix climate change, though. The problem affects the whole world, not just the state, says Richard Stewart. He teaches law at a university. A state could do some things, but it can only make a small fix to a very large, global problem, Stewart added.

Still, that doesn't stop some kids.

"The government isn't doing the best," said Aji Piper. He is 15 years old and is in the petition. "Our future is at hand."
