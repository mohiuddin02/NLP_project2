WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Over the next 50 years, a new study says, there will be major changes in who immigrates to the United States. More people will move here from different countries than they do now.

Currently, Hispanics are the largest group of people moving to this country. By the year 2065, Asians will be the largest group.

The Pew Research Center is a group that researches many things all over the world. Pew recently did a study. It says more Asian and Hispanic immigrants moving here will also lead to a bigger U.S. population.

## Fewer White Immigrants

In 50 years, people who were born in other countries are expected to make up nearly one-fifth of the U.S. population. It will be a record. Today, immigrants make up about one-sixth of the population.

The turning point is expected to come in 2055. That is the year when Asians will likely become the largest immigrant group. They will make up more than one-third of the population and will move past Hispanics.

White immigrants to America made up four-fifths of immigrants back in 1965. By 2065, they will represent about one-fifth of immigrants. Black immigrants will represent fewer than one-tenth of the immigrant population.

Currently, nearly half of immigrants living in the United States are Hispanic. By 2065, that number will have dropped to one-third. Asians currently make up about one-quarter of the immigrant population. In 50 years that is expected to increase to more than one-third.

## Lots Of Numbers To Figure Out

To come up with their predictions, Pew scientists looked at government numbers. They looked through information from the Census Bureau, the government agency that studies the different groups of people in America.

Part of the reason for the change is that women in Latin America are not having as many babies. Mark Hugo Lopez works at Pew. He said many women in Mexico are now having just two children. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, they were having about seven children. Fewer babies means fewer people who can immigrate.

Also, he said that more people are immigrating from Asia. They are coming here to go to college or work in technology jobs.

However, even though there are more Asian immigrants, Lopez said Hispanics will still make up a larger number inside the United States.

"Hispanic population growth is coming from people born here in the United States," he said. "It is really U.S. births that are now the driver of Hispanic population growth."

## Choosing One Word

By 2065, no one race or ethnic group will hold a majority in the United States. Whites will make up just under half of the population, Hispanics about one-quarter, Asians less than one-sixth and blacks even fewer than that.

Pew also asked Americans for one word to describe immigrants in the United States today. Some of the words were "illegal," "overpopulation," "jobs" and "deportation."

Americans also said immigrants are likely to make the United States better, with nearly half agreeing with that statement. Just over one-third said they make the country worse.
