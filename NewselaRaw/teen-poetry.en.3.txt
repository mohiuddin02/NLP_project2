On a sunny afternoon, the words pour out of 19-year-old Celestelle Webster and 18-year-old Christelle Roach. The feelings they express are both fierce and startling.

"The bones in my body are like needles in my skin … I am a bomb, take shelter."

The two are in a small auditorium at the Miami Beach Regional Library. Facing each other onstage, they speak the words they wrote together.

"Why are you still here? I'm in love with the arsonist … There is a fire burning inside me."

Webster and Roach are members of WordSpeak, a teenage spoken-word poetry program run by Miami's Tigertail Productions. What's happening today is just a practice run. In July, their program will send them and five others to a national poetry contest.

Now in its ninth year, WordSpeak teaches young people the craft of poetry. At the same time, it gives them confidence and a sense of purpose.

## Preparing For The Big Contest

Key to that is WordSpeak coach Teo Castellanos. Before becoming an award-winning writer and teacher, Castellanos grew up around drugs and gangs. His past helps him reach kids with the same kind of background. Castellanos shifts easily between street slang and a careful examination of poetry.

The team will need to be at the top of its game later this month. It will be heading to the Brave New Voices contest in Philadelphia. There it will face off against 500 other teens from across the United States and other countries.

At the practice run, Castellanos urges Roach and Webster not to forget "your goals, your rhythms … You'll find the chaos — it's the hardest rhythm for most people."

Next up are Wesly Oviedo, Steffon Dixon and Al Alexandre. Their poem is on gun murders and Florida laws that allow people to shoot first if they feel threatened. The boys, who are African-American, take the subject personally, saying heatedly: "I feel like Florida is the gunshine state and I'm living in the bottom of the barrel."

Castellanos is pleased — but pushes for improvement. He suggests they start with a feeling of celebration. Beginning that way will make the shift to describing the murders more startling.

"It's gonna be crazy!" he says.

## The Door Opens Wide For Change

The seven members of the team were selected from a group of around 1,000 WordSpeak members. Each had won smaller poetry slams, or contests. These are held to help choose the team for the national contest.

Tigertail head Mary Luft says the goal of WordSpeak is not just to better students' writing and speaking skills. The program also aims to give teens more confidence.

After a year in the program, Luft says, the teens change dramatically. How they speak and how they present themselves is completely different. "It's an opportunity for a young person to find a door to their life. They start thinking differently about their place in the greater world and what else is out there."

Maylin Enamorado started performing her poetry when she was in 9th grade. At first she was afraid of getting onstage. When she was chosen for the WordSpeak team the following year, she was shocked.

When she arrived in San Francisco for that earlier contest, though, she became excited. It was great to be around hundreds of other kids who love poetry.

"For the first time, I was like, poetry is normal!" Enamorado says. "I felt completely at home — and the creativity, the subjects were eye-opening."

It can be a big help for these teens to find others who think like them. Roach says she's the only artist in a family focused on sports and business. She is "the pen in the box of pencils" who wrote poetry at her brother's basketball games.

This is Roach's second year with the WordSpeak team.

"Everyone has such vast knowledge — I feel like I have so many books open to me," says Roach. "I've changed in that I know how to say what I'm feeling."
