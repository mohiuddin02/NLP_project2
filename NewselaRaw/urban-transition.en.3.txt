SEATTLE â€” Curtis Morrison needed help when he moved to Seattle from and Indian reservation in Montana.

The Chief Seattle Club helped him adjust to living in the big city. He says the club helped him find a home and get medicine.

"Other places didn't know what I was talking about, and nothing would happen," said Morrison, who's 45. "It was hard, but I have opportunities and a new beginning."

The Urban Indian Legal Clinic helps people like Morrison. It gives advice and and legal help to Native Americans. It's free to all [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american), no matter their income or if they are members of the club.

## Poor, Jobless And Homeless

Seattle has one of the highest populations of city Indians in the country. Organizers say the club helps a group that's often overlooked.

"It's about providing everyone that comes through the experience of understanding and knowing their rights," said Olive Lefferson, clinic coordinator and member of the Blackfoot Indian Tribe.

About 2.8 million Native Americans live in and around cities, according to the government. Seven out of 10 Native Americans live in cities.

There are almost 40,000 people in the Seattle area who say they are American Indian or Alaska Native. Many of them are poor, unemployed and homeless.

Lefferson said their problems are worse in cities, far from their families and tribes. City poverty is different from reservation poverty, according to people who have lived in both places. The big reason is reservations have more ways to help people.

## An Understanding Ear

People can come to the Chief Seattle Club twice a month and get help from lawyers. About half the cases deal with Native issues. Common ones are inheritances or trouble crossing over from the reservation. The clinic sends criminal cases to a criminal lawyer.

The lawyers come from different backgrounds but have one thing in common:  They have knowledge of Indian law and the Indian experience.

"For them to come to a safe place, with someone who has worked with Natives, is important," Lefferson said. "Otherwise, they might think someone won't understand them."

The club started offering legal help in 2006. It tries to help Natives, who usually keep to themselves and don't trust others.

The lawyers try to help people solve problems, said Lael Echo-Hawk, a Seattle lawyer. She's a Pawnee and was one of the founders.

Ralph Forquera said many of the natives he works with have long legal records. He's the executive director at the Seattle Indian Health Board. But those people didn't chose a life of crime, their crimes come from poverty, he said. Some are small thefts or public drinking.

## Feeling Lost In The City

The Indians living in the city also don't get the same support as they do on the reservation. Dunlap never knew his family was poor growing up on the Fond du Lac Reservation in Minnesota.

"In reservation poverty, you always had an auntie to feed you," Dunlap said. "Urban poverty for Natives is different."

The move to the city can shock someone who lived where health care and education are easier to reach. In the reservations, the government provides those services, said Chris Stearns. He is a Navajo lawyer who specializes in Indian law. In Seattle, those services are harder to find.

"When you come to the cities or urban areas, they're not there," said Stearns.

The legal clinic was one of the first in the nation, Echo-Hawk said. It pays for itself and has continued without much involvement from other groups.

## "No Other Place Like This"

The legal system often hasn't worked in the past for people who come to the clinic. That makes it hard for them to understand the system and make it work, said Sean Cecil. He is a Seattle lawyer who volunteers for the clinic.

Dunlap said the Chief Seattle Club and the clinic set an example.

"There's no other place like this in Indian Country," Dunlap said.

As Dunlap and Lefferson spoke, a man with a beaded necklace and long gray hair walked in. Dunlap asked him how he slept the night before.

He said he slept good, but his back hurt. His bed had been a concrete sidewalk.
