Arie is a seventh-grader. He is making it with one of the world's hottest video games: "Minecraft."

Some people think computer games should be played at home. Still, more and more teachers are using them in the classroom.

Teachers are using technology to get kids excited about school.

Nothing has gotten kids more excited than "Minecraft." It lets kids build almost anything they can imagine out of colored blocks. The game came out in 2009. More than 100 million people play it around the world.

"Minecraft" was invented by Markus Persson. He is a game designer from Sweden. He wanted to make the kind of game he played as a kid.

## Kids "Love It"

The results can be amazing. YouTube is filled with entire "Minecraft" cities and made-up worlds.

"The secret sauce is that kids are engaged," said Joel Levin. He is a retired teacher. His company, TeacherGaming, makes "Minecraft" for schools. Kids "love it. They want to do it," he said.

Some kids sign up for weekend or summer classes to play "Minecraft." Dana Stewart teaches at Northwestern University. Her students use "Minecraft" to build ancient Egyptian buildings. The project makes them think about designing buildings. The students feel like they're walking through the buildings in real life.

The idea is to use a game kids love to teach them about science, said Jana Sebestik. She is with the University of Illinois.

## "Build Anything"

Since November, fifth-graders in Palatine, Ill., have been building their own worlds. These worlds are complete with dragons. The students also write about their adventures.

"'Minecraft' is a nice way to make your imagination fly a little bit better," said Amelia Landau, 11.

Dan Rezac is with a school in Northbrook. He said "Minecraft" can be amazing.

"With 'Minecraft,' they can build anything," he said. They learn to work together with other people. They build worlds and lands and objects. They can even make a human body.

There's no end to what a kid can do with "Minecraft."
