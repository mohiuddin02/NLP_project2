DALLAS — Chuck E. Cheese's is a place where a kid can be a kid. But it also wants to be a place where mom can get a cappuccino and dad can chow down on fancy pizza.

This week, Chuck E. Cheese's introduced the biggest change to its menu in more than 10 years. The change is meant to make the restaurant more appealing to adults.

New menu items include thin and crispy pizza with mushrooms and spinach and, for a short time, New York-style cheesecake.

Tom Leverton runs Chuck E. Cheese's. He said that while children may be the ones who want to visit the restaurant, it's the parents who hold the car keys. "If we provide a good experience for mom and dad, they are going to be more willing to take their kid to Chuck E. Cheese's instead of … going out to a competing place."

## "We're Not Playing Games"

Nationwide, the company rolled out a Cali Alfredo pizza. It also has introduced whole-wheat tortilla wraps such as chicken Caesar.

And it added churros with dipping sauces.

All locations in North Texas are being remodeled. Some will include full coffee bars, featuring cappuccinos and lattes. Others will have full dessert bars.

If those items prove popular here, they may be expanded to other Chuck E. Cheese's.

The company's website promotes "all-new menu items for grown-up tastes." It also says "we're not playing games with our food anymore."

In addition to new menu items, the company is thinking about replacing those jingling game tokens. Instead, it may offer a plastic "play pass" like the one at Dave &amp; Buster's that can be used for many games. It also wants to increase its to-go business by offering food to adults who might not have children.

So far, parents love the additions to the menu, Leverton said.

## Parents Prefer Pepperoni Pizza

The chain is trying to attract more customers because other pizza restaurants are doing the same.

In November, Pizza Hut, the nation's largest pizza chain, announced it was adding more fancy items to its menu.

Still, at a Chuck E. Cheese's in Dallas this week, several parents said they like the chain's pizza as it is. They especially liked the pepperoni pizza. It seemed to be the most popular choice this particular evening. None of the parents spotted during dinner were eating the new menu items.

Brandie Bohmer is a mom of four and said she has at least two birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese's every year. She and her children like pepperoni pizza best. Bohmer said she'd buy it even if it was sold somewhere else.

Nearby, 38-year-old Zab Herrera also handed out slices of pepperoni pizza to his daughters. It's easier, he said, to just get one pizza that the whole family likes.

Right now, the company is buying more equipment and paying for talented new employees. It's all part of an effort to improve the food.

## A New "Play Pass" System

Leverton said a new company building will have a bigger test kitchen, which will develop new kinds of food. It will also have a new chef who graduated from a respected cooking school.

Beyond the food, the company is adding Wi-Fi to its U.S. locations.

In some local stores, the company will test the new "play pass" system, replacing tokens.

That's a scary thought for Bohmer.

"Because this is for younger kids, I say no," Bohmer said. "If they lose one token, I'm not going to cry over that. If they lose a card with 100 tokens, I'm going to cry."

Not to worry, the company said. The cards can be replaced.

Leverton didn't give many details about the test. Mostly, the company is excited to talk about the food.

"We want to make sure the adults are as excited about the visit as the children," he said. "The menu was a great opportunity to really do that."
