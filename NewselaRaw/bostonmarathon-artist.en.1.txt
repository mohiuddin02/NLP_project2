BOSTON — With her running shoes and her paintbrush, Hope Phelan is trying to recapture the joy and whimsy of the Boston Marathon.

An artist and a competitive distance runner, Phelan has created a series of paintings that celebrate the race — and deliberately ignore its terror scars.

"Wellesley Scream Tunnel" depicts the women of Wellesley College offering kisses and palm slaps to athletes as they pass. ''Heartbreak Hill" captures the exhilaration that exhausted runners feel once they have conquered the toughest section of the race. "The Home Stretch" shows competitors surging past Boston's iconic Citgo sign and zeroing in on the finish line.

"I was trying to bring it back to the way I remember it," said Phelan, 26, a professional painter and art teacher who grew up south of Boston in Hingham, Massachusetts, and visited every April to watch the race. "I wanted to bring the fun back."

## From Brooding To Bright

On April 15, 2013, Phelan had finished her first Boston Marathon in just over three hours and was a few blocks away celebrating when she heard the explosions and saw people running and screaming.

To deal with the stress of those traumatic memories, Phelan made an abstract painting she titled simply "Boston Marathon 2013." It was a dark, brooding work with splashes of red paint like the blood that spattered Boylston Street that day.

"I was just throwing paint at the canvas," she recalls. "It was really emotional and expressive."

Last year, Phelan was inspired to create more paintings to raise money for survivors on the anniversary of the bombings, so she started painting something quite different: bright, colorful depictions of athletes and spectators interacting along the famous 26.2-mile course that stretches from Hopkinton, Massachusetts, to Boston.

One playful piece, "The Finish Line," was painted on one of the foil blankets finishers are given to keep warm. The backdrop for another is a collage of Phelan's race bib numbers.

## A Springtime Celebration

Phelan's expressionist paintings are sold under her maiden name, Hope Rathnam, on a website called Etsy.com. The Boston Marathon paintings are also being featured at Marathon Sports, a running shop at Mile 23, where the race route passes through Brookline, Massachusetts. They will be on display there through the April 20 running of this year's race.

Two years after bombs killed three spectators and wounded more than 260, Phelan's art reflects the running community's growing desire to restore America's most beloved marathon to what it was intended to be when it was founded 119 years ago: an amateur footrace staged purely to see who was the fastest.

Tom Derderian, a Greater Boston Track Club coach and author of "The Boston Marathon: A Celebration of the World's Premier Race," says the race is an important element of springtime in Boston. He describes the massive event as a "celebration," pointing out that it takes place, "at that time of year when there is hope again."

Derderian, who is also the executive producer of a forthcoming new documentary film about the annual marathon, says that, eventually, the bombing will just be one horrible incident in the history of the race.

"A terrible crime was committed," he said. "But as the years go by, the Boston Marathon will be more and more of a footrace and less and less of a crime scene."

## Recapturing The Race

Phelan, who now lives in Easthampton, Massachusetts, wants to help bring the race "back to normal" and hopes her art will encourage others to re-embrace its people and pageantry.

"The Boston Marathon is like a parade. People are screaming and it's loud and there's water being thrown at you," she said.

Caitlin Marquis, a Boston energy policy researcher and fellow runner, says Phelan's personal connection to her work makes all the difference. "There is so much joy that leaks into the paintings that couldn't get there any other way except for her love of running," she said.

"The city is so determined to recapture the race, and these paintings are definitely in keeping with that joy," Marquis said.
