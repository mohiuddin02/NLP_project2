Noah Madson remembers being tested for ADHD, a disorder that makes it hard to concentrate. He left feeling exhausted from hours of testing.

"Boy, those were complicated," said his mother, Nancy. "He'd come out and say, 'My brain hurts.'" Today, Noah's task is less of a headache. After the 14-year-old plays a video game for 20 minutes, his parents and teachers will have information that paint a more complete picture of how his mind is functioning.

Better yet, as the Minnesota teenager plays the game more, his memory and processing speed might actually improve.

Noah is part of a early study for CogCubed, a Minneapolis-based business that makes games to help decide if people have brain disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). People with cognitive disorders have problems processing information. The games can also help the symptoms improve.
## Hitting A Gopher Amid Distractions

Google has already given the company $20,000 to help develop its business.

CogCubed was [founded](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) by a husband-and-wife team. Kurt Roots makes games, while Monika Heller is a doctor who focuses on mental health disorders in children. Their goal is to use technology to produce objective information about symptoms that are often hard to pin down, such as attention problems and hyperactivity.

The game that CogCubed is testing now uses Sifteo. It is a platform that consists of small cubes with screens on them. The game, called "Groundskeeper," asks the user to use one cube to hit a gopher that pops up on the screens of the other three cubes. As the game goes on, distractions like rabbits and chirping birds come up, and the instructions change.

The cubes produce information on more than 70 different things, including errors, response times and even whether the player is fidgeting. That informations is put together on a Web site that doctors, parents and teachers can use to help figure out how well and in what ways a child processes information. The information is very specific.

"That's part of our excitement with it, that we're getting so much detailed information," Nancy Madson said. "I can't wait for it to affect (Noah's) education plan for the coming year."
## Record Number With ADHD

This year, U.S. government figures show a record number of children were found to have ADHD: 11 percent of school-aged children have been diagnosed with the disorder, including nearly 1 in 5 high-school-age boys. People with ADHD can have problems paying attention, can be overly active, and may be more likely to act without thinking about what might happen.

It's not clear what's behind the increased numbers, which represented a 41 percent jump in the past decade. There was even a shortage of ADHD medicines in 2011.

But, Heller said, one thing is clear: People who take care of children with ADHD could use extra help.

"Six to 12 months is the average waiting period to see" a doctor to get thoroughly evaluated, she said. She wondered how great it would be if parents had a tool to make an assessment at home.

CogCubed aims to start selling its "Groundskeeper" training game, which adjusts to each player's weaknesses to help improve thinking skills, in the next few months. Noah and 36 other students with ADHD are testing that game. They play twice a day for three to five days a week.
## A 75 Percent Accuracy Rate

There is another version of the game that serves as a tool to help doctors tell if somebody has ADHD. But it won't be released until government health regulators approve it,  Roots said. The game wouldn't replace complete psychological exams, but would provide doctors with information to help them decide if a patient had ADHD.

In a University of Minnesota study, what that version of the game found and what a doctor found matched 75 percent of the time. A different computer-based tool that is often used has about a 62 percent accuracy rate, Heller said.

 "We don't want to make promises that we can't keep," Roots said. "We're doing the best we can to make sure we're not selling something that gets people's hopes up and doesn't work."

CogCubed is also beginning to work with local autism centers to test the Groundskeeper games' ability to provide information about autism, Roots said. People with autism can have difficulty communicating and forming relationships with other people.

"It's important that products that claim to offer improvement of brain function stay away from making big promises," said Max Wiznitzer. He is a doctor who serves on the professional advisory board for Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. The companies should focus their research on long-term effects instead, he said.

"Can we improve working memory and teach them little tricks? The answer is yes," Wiznitzer said. "Will it somehow make that person tons better in their day-to-day functioning? That's where I'm concerned when people make these kinds of claims. It's not the miracle cure. I wish it were."
## Boring Enough, But Fun

The amount of information that CogCubed collects could make it a game-changer in the mental health field, Heller said.

While a computer-based test just measures errors, the Sifteo cubes' sensors measure every move in between. That means there's less room for a mistake in deciding if somebody has ADHD.

The results of the early study at Noah's school, Groves Academy, could help teachers customize lesson plans for each student's particular needs, Groves' assistant director of diagnostics Zach Eakman said.

Nancy Madson said she's thrilled about the game, which Heller said was designed to be "just boring enough" to not give the brain too much excitement.

"It's an opportunity for our son to become more self-sufficient with his ADHD and his learning differences," Madson said. "And it's fun."
