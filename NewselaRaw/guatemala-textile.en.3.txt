GUATEMALA CITY â€” For more than 1,000 years, the people of Guatemala have told stories through the designs on their clothing.

In modern times, their colorful textiles have made them a target for unfair treatment. The textiles marked them as poor and part of a downtrodden people.

Now, these textiles, called huipiles, can be found in some of Guatemala's finest stores. Young designers are using them for everything from evening gowns and purses to ties and handmade shoes. They are sold as far away as Dubai in the Middle East.

For many here, the use of huipiles is part of a wider interest in the country's Mayan roots. A thousand years ago, the Mayan empire controlled all of present-day Guatemala. Now, musicians, designers and even elected officials are adopting Mayan languages and themes.

This is also happening in other countries with strong native traditions, such as Bolivia and Mexico. Traditional clothing and the culture of the people who have lived there for thousands of years are overcoming long-standing unfair treatment.

## "Guatemalan Textiles Are Rich In Color"

Adela Qel is a 45-year-old Mayan woman who wears the huipil. She lives in a rural area in northwestern Guatemala. She is proud that the fashion world uses her traditional costume.

"I am proud of my dress," said Qel.

The textiles come in dazzling colors with geometric patterns. The Mayan women often wear them as long shirts or dresses. In Guatemala's high fashion centers, they are made into shoes, ties and purses. They stand out from the usual dull colors seen in expensive stores.

Maria's Bags, a purse company, has been very successful with its textiles based on Mayan designs. The company sells its purses in department stores around the world. Bloomingdale's, a fancy department store, carries them.

Making the designs more modern helps non-native people appreciate them, said fashion designer Eduardo Figueroa. Famous Guatemalans own clothes based on the Mayan textiles. Guatemalans living outside their home country particularly like the designs. This may be because they are homesick.

Figueroa is famous for a dress he designed for the Miss World beauty contest. It is a bright orange gown with flowers at the shoulders. The outfit was rated as one of the contest's best.

"I am inspired by color," Figueroa said. "Guatemalan textiles are rich in color."

Some people think that the Mayan textiles are just for cushions and tablecloths, Figueroa said. But he tells them they can be used in many ways.

## Going Back To Their Roots

Karim Corzo is a shoe designer in Guatamala. He said the popularity of traditional textiles helps the communities that have made the fabrics for a long time.

"They allow us to give work to the women who weave them and sell them," Corzo said.

Tzutu Baktun Kan is a rapper in Guatamala. He performs in a Mayan language. He says Guatemala is going back to its roots. More than 1,000 years ago, Guatemala was located in the center of the great Mayan Empire.

Kan said he is trying to strengthen the old Mayan languages so they are not forgotten. This, he says, helps reduce racism.

Not everyone, however, likes the old ways.

Eduardo Ortiz, a high-fashion clothing designer, says he will not use traditional Guatemalan textiles. They aren't his style. Also, some Guatemalans won't accept them. They think they look too old fashioned.

## Stories Woven Into Textiles

Spain ruled Guatemala for 300 years, until 1821. Under Spanish rule, native Guatemalans were forced to wear traditional outfits. Every region had its own clothing designs so the Spanish could identify the people who lived in each area.

But over the years, embroidery on the clothing became a means of self-expression, said Alvaro Pop. He is a United Nations expert on native peoples. The designs included symbols such the Mayan calendar and magicians who could turn themselves into animals.

The stories and ideas of the Mayans are expressed in their outfits, Pop pointed out.

Recently, the textiles have became more modern and colorful so that more Guatemalans will wear them, Corzo said.

The new fashion doesn't come cheap. A pair of high-fashion shoes runs from $50 to $150. A gown can cost between $300 and $800. The price depends on the handmade product's quality, and also how unusual the design is.

Pop said that eventually some of that money should go back to the communities. They are among the country's poorest and most ignored. One of their greatest remaining possessions, he said, is their ancient culture.

Ethnic fashion is trendy around the world, Pop said. But designers have to be very careful not to use the designs without compensating their creators. Each is one-of-a-kind, he said. "They don't make it twice and (their ideas) should be paid for, too."
