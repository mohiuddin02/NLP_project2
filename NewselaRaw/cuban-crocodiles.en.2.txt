One of the world's most endangered crocodiles, the Cuban crocodile, is at even greater risk of disappearing than scientists previously realized. Over-hunting had already reduced their population severely. A new problem is that the Cuban crocodile has been mating with its American cousin.

It turns out that Cuba's rare, native species has been doing a lot of interbreeding with the more abundant American crocodile. The result is genetically mixed offspring which, over time, are becoming less and less "Cuban."

In each baby, a portion of the Cuban crocodile genome — the species' complete set of genes — is replaced by American crocodile genes. With each new generation, more and more Cuban genes are lost. Eventually, the species could become extinct.

Scientists already knew the two species were mating with one another in the wild. However, they only recently discovered just how frequently this was happening.

## Hunting Hit Cuban Crocs Hard

A team of Cuban and Canadian researchers, led by Yoamel Milián-García of the University of Havana, studied genes found in the scales of 227 wild crocodiles. The results showed that the level of interbreeding is much higher than previously believed: 49 percent of the wild crocodiles sampled had mixed genes.

The Cuban crocodile is considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It was once found throughout the island, but extensive hunting from the mid-19th century onward caused its population to drop severely.

Now the estimated 4,000 remaining individuals are at risk of genetic swamping by the more abundant American crocodile. As more genes from the American crocodile move into the population, the Cuban crocodile is losing what made it distinct.

Researchers say it is the Cuban crocodile's distinct characteristics that make it unique — and worthy of protecting.

Milián-García is trying to determine whether the interbreeding of the two species is a natural phenomenon or not. Illegal hunting and the gradual disappearance of the animals' natural environment may be driving the two species into the same areas. Once they are living side by side, the two types of crocodile are much more likely to interbreed.

## Researchers Have Hope

What complicates things somewhat is the fact that American crocodiles found in Cuba are not the same as American crocodiles found in the United States. They are more closely related to the Cuban crocodile than to other American crocodiles. It appears that in the Caribbean, American crocodiles took on some genes from their Cuban relatives more than 200,000 years ago.

Nonetheless, scientists feel that the interbreeding going on now poses serious problems. They believe it is a real threat to the existence of the Cuban crocodile as a separate species.

In addition to the wild crocodiles, Milián-García's team also studied 137 captive Cuban crocodiles from the Zapata Swamp Captive Breeding Farm. The animals kept at the breeding farm have been isolated from American crocodiles since 1974. A study of their genes gave researchers some reason for hope.

Approximately 30 percent still had certain genetic material that is unique to the Cuban crocodile and that was not found in the rest of the captive population at the farm. In the future, the animals could be used to help keep the Cuban crocodile from disappearing.
