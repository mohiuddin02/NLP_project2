JIM THORPE, Pa. — Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe had [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) and European ancestry. He died in 1953 at the age of 64. Thorpe's children tried to bury his body in a traditional Indian ceremony. This was held on the Sac and Fox Reservation in Oklahoma. Mourners shared a meal as the athlete's body lay in full view inside a lodge.

But the ceremony came to an sudden halt when Thorpe's widow barged in. Patsy Thorpe, his third wife, grabbed the sportsman's body and drove away.

William Thorpe, the athlete's 85-year-old son, was there that day. He remembers what happened as a "complete shock." He said, "We are all set to bury Dad in Oklahoma and then — boom! — he was gone, never to be returned."

Patsy Thorpe had cut a deal with two struggling towns in Pennsylvania. They were called Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk. Patsy and the towns agreed that if they came together, renamed themselves Jim Thorpe and built a memorial for him, she would present them with his remains. The sportsman had never even set foot in the borough.

## Town Ordered To Return Remains

Thorpe was born in Oklahoma in 1888 and raised on the Sac and Fox Reservation. William Thorpe says the town of Jim Thorpe has done a wonderful job. The town has cared for his father's grave for 60 years. But he now thinks it's "time for my dad to come home."

William, his brother and the Sac and Fox Nation won a lawsuit in April. This demanded that the town return his father's body to the reservation.

The town of Jim Thorpe appealed the decision. "People in this town are determined to keep our memorial, and keep the body here," says Mayor Michael Sofranko. "We've done nothing wrong. We've done nothing but honor Jim Thorpe all these years."

The grave sits on soil from Oklahoma and Stockholm, Sweden. Thorpe won gold medals in Stockholm in 1912. He also played professional football and baseball. Thorpe was then as famous as Peyton Manning or Michael Phelps are today.

Thorpe is buried in his favorite white buckskin jacket. The building that holds his body is surrounded by statues saluting his sporting success.

## "You Are The World's Greatest Athlete"

At the memorial there is also a comment to Thorpe from King Gustav V of Sweden. He told the gold winner at the medal ceremony, "Sir, you are the world's greatest athlete." Thorpe replied, "Thanks, King."

Anne Marie Fitzpatrick, 72, runs a downtown gift shop in the town of Jim Thorpe. In her store there is a glass jar stuffed with cash. It has a sign on the outside that says "Keep Jim Thorpe In Jim Thorpe." Fitzpatrick has set up several jars around town where people can give money toward the appeal.

"He's been here 59 years, and we're not about to give him up," Fitzpatrick says. She was in grade school when Mauch Chunk and East Mauch became Jim Thorpe, Pa.

It is difficult for outsiders to understand the love for the athlete from the people in this town. After all, the only thing they share is his name. But many have raised money over the years for statues of Thorpe. There is now a $60,000 statue of Thorpe throwing a discus and a $50,000 one of him with a football. They hope to add a baseball statue next.

## A Name Change, And A Burial

Not all of the Thorpe's family agree that his body should be taken to Oklahoma. "The town was built around my grandpa — people revere him," says John Thorpe, 56. John is Thorpe's grandson. He has joined with another grandson, Mike Koehler, 75. They are fighting their uncles and tribe in an effort to keep Jim Thorpe in Jim Thorpe.

Koehler thinks the town has honored his grandfather's memory well. "For God's sake, leave him alone," he says. John Thorpe and Koehler have traveled here for years to take part in Jim Thorpe celebrations.

After Jim Thorpe died, his widow Patsy had made plans with the Oklahoma governor. They included building a memorial and grave for the athlete. But then the governor changed his mind.

Patsy was furious. William Thorpe says she then started "shopping my dad's body around the country." She first traveled to Philadelphia. There she tried to persuade the commissioner of the National Football League to pay for a grave and memorial. As well as a football player, Thorpe was the NFL's first president. But Patsy failed to get the money to have her husband buried there.

While in Philadelphia, Patsy Thorpe saw a news story about Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk. They were holding fundraisers to save the depressed towns. She contacted town leaders and made the deal that brought the towns a new name and Jim Thorpe's body.
