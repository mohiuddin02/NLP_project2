LOS ANGELES â€” Like his father and grandfather before him, Lou DeRosa is a butcher.

Tucked away at the Los Angeles Farmers Market, his little butcher stand is selling more bacon than ever and at higher prices. The prices are "crazy," DeRosa said. The Danish bacon costs $8.98 a pound.

"Prices go up every six months, much more than your typical meat item, because everyone is buying it," DeRosa said. His family has run Marconda's Meats  since 1941.

Bacon has become the country's trendiest meat. Yet, a taste for bacon comes at an increasing cost. The price of bacon has risen more than three times faster than the cost of other goods since 2008. The price increase is the highest of any type of meat, according to the government.

Contributing to soaring bacon prices is California's three-year drought. The water shortage made feed for pigs more expensive. In addition, a new virus has killed about 7 million piglets since 2013. The nation's pork supply is down almost 12 percent, said John Green, who is with the National Pork Board.

But mainly, he said, Americans' hunger for bacon is putting the sizzle in prices.

## The Cost Of A "Bacon Fix"

In June, shoppers paid $6.11 on average for a pound of sliced bacon in grocery stores, a record high, according to the federal government. Four years earlier, the average price was $4.05 a pound.

At a California supermarket, James McMenamin considered putting a package of bacon back because of the price.

"It seems really expensive," McMenamin said, "but I still need that bacon fix."

Despite the soaring price of bacon, more people are buying it. Bacon sales climbed 9.5 percent in 2013. People bought a record $4 billion worth of bacon that year, according to Information Resources Inc., which researches buying trends.

Bacon has an important place in American culture, said Ari Weinzweig, the author of "Zingerman's Guide to Better Bacon." People see it as a comfort food.

"There's an emotional attachment there," Weinzweig said. "It reminds us of childhood."

## Bacon-Topped Ice Cream And Sushi

Americans are using bacon in unusual ways. They put it in ice cream and sushi and sprinkle it on chocolate chip cookies.

Restaurants are also weaving bacon into menus in unusual ways, Green said.

The salty meat can be found in the potato-bacon dish at Wolfgang Puck's Beverly Hills restaurant, Spago. Bacon can also be found in Denny's maple bacon milkshake.

Since 2010, breakfast giant IHOP has added 23 menu items that include bacon. They have put bacon in "everything from bacon crepes to salads," said Marie Grimm. She is an IHOP vice president in charge of creating new foods.

And an industry first: a bacon-and-cheddar-cheese-infused waffle.

Grimm couldn't say how much IHOP has increased its prices because of rising pork costs. She did say, though, that the high price is an issue.

The high price of bacon is making it harder for fast-food chains to make a profit. Bacon dishes account for 30 percent to 50 percent of menu items at several popular chains. These include Carl's Jr., Wendy's and Jack in the Box.

Drivers ordering bacon-topped burgers at drive-through windows will pay nearly $5 on average. About $5 is generally the top price people are willing to pay for fast-food burgers, according to SpenDifference. The restaurant supply chain is located in Denver. It conducted a survey that showed that 93 percent of chains planned to raise prices.

## That Bacon Burger Is How Much?

DeWayne Dove is vice president of purchasing for SpenDifference. Restaurants are already starting to charge customers more, he said.

In 2002, a Carl's Jr. bacon cheeseburger cost $1.39. By 2013, it cost $3.29 because of beef and bacon price increases.

In addition to paying more for bacon, Dove says customers might be getting less of it.

"A lot of chains are adjusting portion sizes. What used to be three pieces of bacon now is two pieces of bacon for the same price," Dove said. He noted that fast-food diners could soon be paying $6 for a bacon burger.

Plenty of bacon lovers are willing to pay.

Butcher Jim Cascone of Huntington Meats said price doesn't seem to matter when it comes to bacon. The Los Angeles butcher shop is selling 100 cases of bacon a week. In three years, Cascone has seen bacon sales go up 25 percent.

"No one ever questions the price," said Cascone, who charges about $7.99 a pound for applewood smoked bacon, up from $4.99 four years ago. Cascone said that one of his customers just had a bacon party. "There's just something about it that romances eaters," he said.

It certainly has that effect for Josh Goldstein. The 24-year-old personal trainer from Manhattan Beach says he eats half a pound of bacon every morning and wraps his Thanksgiving turkey in bacon every year. Not even high prices would change his bacon-eating habits.

"It has definitely become more expensive, and I buy so much it does add up," Goldstein said. "But bacon is my medicine. It makes everything better."
