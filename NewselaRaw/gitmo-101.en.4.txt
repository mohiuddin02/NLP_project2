WASHINGTON â€“ Barack Obama promised that he would close the prison at Guantanamo Bay when he ran for president. Easier said than done. As president, Obama has failed to keep his promise. On April 30, Obama said that he will try again. His promise raises many questions. Some are easier to answer than others.

## Q: How long has the prison been around?

A: The first 20 people captured in Afghanistan arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Jan. 11, 2002. Before that, it was a base for the U.S. Navy.

## Q: Why Guantanamo?

A: The military looked at many faraway places for holding men caught after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. It thought about sending them to islands in the Pacific Ocean. But then it chose Guantanamo. The U.S. military controls Guantanamo, so it is hard to get into. But Guantanamo is also on the island of Cuba. Officials thought that the men held there would not be able to take their cases to U.S. courts. The Supreme Court said that was not fair.

## Q: Who is being held at Guantanamo?

A: There are 166 men held there. More than half have been cleared for release or transfer to other countries. Others face criminal charges. There is another group that faces no charges. But they are thought to be too dangerous to release. More than half of the men being held are from Yemen.

## Q: They are called detainees instead of prisoners. Why?

A: The government says it uses the term for most of the men because they have not been found guilty.

## Q: What is it like there?

A: The first detainees were housed in wire pens that looked like a backyard dog kennel. Now most are in air-conditioned buildings. The buildings are called camps. Most of the detainees were in Camp 6. They could move freely out of their cells to watch television and eat together. But in April, detainees covered cameras used to watch over them. So guards forced all the prisoners back into small cells. As of Monday, 100 detainees were refusing food. Guards had to force-feed some of them with tubes.

## Q: What rules decide how they are treated?

A: Like other countries, the United States agreed to follow the Geneva Conventions. These rules were made so that prisoners of war are treated like human beings. Congress also made a law against cruel treatment.

## Q: Do detainees at Guantanamo have any rights from the U.S. Constitution?

A: Somewhat. The Supreme Court ruled in a 2008 that the detainees could take their case to court, just like prisoners in the United States.

## Q: How much does Guantanamo cost to operate?

A: The government said it spends about $150 million per year on Guantanamo. That equals about $800,000 per prisoner, depending on their needs. The government also has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the facility.

## Q: Why can't Obama just close Guantanamo and move the men to U.S. prisons?

A: Since 2009, Congress has made it hard for Obama to move men out of Guantanamo. One law stops him from using military money to move detainees to the United States. It also stops him from moving detainees to risky countries where it might be hard to keep track of them.

## Q: How many people who were let out of Guantanamo have returned to fighting against the United States?

A: In January, the top U.S. spy wrote a report on what happened to the 603 men who had been sent out of Guantanamo. The report said that 97 went back to fighting against U.S. forces. Another 72 were suspected of fighting against U.S. forces.
