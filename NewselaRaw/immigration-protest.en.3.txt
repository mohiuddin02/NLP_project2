WASHINGTON â€” Eliseo Medina is skipping Thanksgiving dinner this year. Usually, he sits down for a turkey dinner with his family in California, filling tacos with stuffing and extra jalapenos.

This year, Medina is feasting on nothing but water. He is in the 17th day of his hunger strike, or fast. He is refusing to eat as a way to protest Washington's inaction over making changes in immigration law. Immigration law involves people who are not U.S. citizens and whether they can live in the country.

He and two other fasters set up a heated tent on the National Mall at the foot of the Capitol building. While the rest of the country stuffed itself with turkey on Thanksgiving, they fasted.

"We are a little thinner," said Medina, who has lost 19 pounds. "It's a good diet," he joked. He said the goal of the fast was to bring attention to the problems of people trying to come to the United States to live.

## Supporters Drop By

Medina is thin. He has a patchy beard and a wooden cross hanging from his neck. He says he hopes that his fast will make the government do something. Some members of the government have held up plans to change immigration laws.

About 200 people a year die trying to cross the Sonora Desert, which runs along the border with Mexico. So Medina wants immigration law changed soon.

The government is split into two parties that often have different political beliefs. One party is the Democrats. They tend to believe it should be easier to come to the United States. Another party is the Republicans. Many of them think it should be harder to come live in the United States.

Some famous Democrats have dropped by Medina's tent to lend their support. Among them was Vice President Joe Biden. Two Republican members of Congress, Jeff Denham and David Valadao, also came by. They are Californians who support changing immigration law.

"It is a tremendous commitment, what they have been through," Denham said. It helps make other people see this issue, he said.

Denham says he pressed Republican leaders last week to act more quickly. But the government probably will not vote on immigration laws before the end of the year.

## Raising Public Awareness

Medina, 67, says his family is worried about his health.

At night, Medina sleeps in a room of bunk beds with the other fasters.

A full-time nurse checks Medina's health twice a day. She also checks the health of two other fasters. The three risk damaging their livers and other organs as the fast goes on.

Medina isn't surprised that some Republicans say the fast is a stunt to get attention.

Others say Medina's fast is raising public awareness like labor leader Cesar Chavez once did. Chavez organized farm workers in the 1960s and 1970s. The conditions the farmers worked in were bad then.

Medina wants the White House to do more. Congress would have to vote to change the immigration system. But, Medina says Obama could make sure people are not kicked out of the country so quickly. And it could keep more families together, says Medina.

President Barack Obama has said that he is doing all he can. To do anything more would be against the law.

## Hoping For Change

Medina says he was stunned in 1968 when he heard that Chavez was fasting to draw attention to labor conditions on farms. Medina was 22. He had been helping Chavez by getting people in New York City to refuse to buy grapes as a way to show support for farm workers.

He remembers thinking to himself, "Is he going to die? What will happen to us?"

Chavez did not eat for 25 days. Then a famous New York politician named Robert F. Kennedy traveled to California to meet Chavez. Kennedy gave Chavez a piece of bread to break the fast. Kennedy was about to start a campaign for president. His kind action brought attention to Chavez and made people take him more seriously.

Medina hopes that his fast will spur the same kind of change that Chavez's did.

"It's been 45 years since that fast, and I've never been let down by the American people," Medina said.
