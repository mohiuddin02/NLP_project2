BAGHDAD — Ann Khalid did not feel well. Still, she insisted on dancing a brief scene from Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" ballet with her classmates. The 12-year-old is set on one day having a career dancing and teaching ballet, not an easy dream in a country torn apart by years of conflict.

"My school and my church are the two things I love the most in Baghdad," the soft-spoken Khalid said with pride.

If she has a shot at her dream, it's because of the Baghdad School of Music and Ballet.

The school has managed to survive decades of trouble, a feat that speaks to the toughness of Baghdad's residents through war after war. The Iraqi capital once was a Middle East center of culture. Yet it has not been for some years. Still, the school has carved out a tiny island of creativity despite the violence that is part of daily life and the religious conservatism that now defines public life.

## Golden Age Long Gone

"Where else in Iraq can you walk into a school and listen to a small boy playing Antonio Vivaldi on his violin?" boasts the school principal and accomplished musician, Ahmed Salim Ghani.

Another rare thing: The school isn't segregated by sex like almost all Iraqi schools. Male and female students take classes together from kindergarten to high school.

"The second you walk through the gate, you find yourself in a different world, one of art and culture," Ghani said.

Ghani speaks fondly about Baghdad's golden age — the 1960s through to the 1980s. Back then, the city's rich elite supported art and culture and the nonreligious government ensured that enough of the nation's oil money went to the arts. The school, founded in 1968, thrived.

Black-and-white footage of a 1977 school production of "The Nutcracker" shows a relatively high level of skill, with the children dancing in professional-level costumes. In class photos from the period, the schoolgirls and female teachers wear miniskirts. The boys wear blazers and bow ties.

## Decades Of War

Things rapidly worsened for Baghdad and the school with Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. punished Iraq and prevented it from selling much of its oil, wrecking the economy. Money was running out.

The city plunged deeper into chaos after the U.S. led an invasion of Iraq in 2003. The school was looted days after President Saddam Hussein was ousted, and later it was partially burned.

As violence rose, so did religious extremism. Ballet — and to a lesser extent music — were considered immoral and anti-Islamic.

The school removed its large street sign to escape attention. Children hid their musical instruments when out in public or left them at school.

Daily bombings, assassinations and kidnappings forced parents to keep their children at home. The school's best Iraqi ballet and music teachers fled, seeking jobs in other countries. During the height of the violence, in the mid-2000s, the number of students plunged to an all-time low of 100 to 120, according to Ghani.

## "It's A Rare School"

The city has become safer, but bombings continue.

"We hope it is just a phase that will eventually go away," said Salam Arab, whose 16-year-old son Maysara is one of the school's best male dancers. "It's a rare school in the Arab world, and it is very important that it continues to carry out its mission."

The religious ideas taking hold in Baghdad's society have a powerful effect as well.

The school now has around 500 students. But many parents pull their daughters out of ballet when they are 12 or 13. They object on religious grounds to the girls being lifted and held by boys their age while performing, according to Zeina Akram Fayzy, a 40-year-old ballet instructor.

"Years of our hard work go to waste," said Fayzy, who graduated from the school. "The school needs talented children who stay the course."

Leezan Salam, who graduated this year, said that when she started ballet at the school there were around 30 girls with her. By the time she reached the 10th grade, "we were only three."

## Dancing Despite Mocking

Khalid, the 12-year-old, says the moral questions surrounding dance don't dent her enthusiasm.

"Everyone says it is haram (religiously prohibited) and disgraceful. But my parents are happy for me to dance," she said. Khalid is the daughter of artistic parents — her father is an actor and her mother a television director.

Dance can be just as much of a problem for boys.

Maysara said he doesn't tell people he dances. "Those in my neighborhood who have found out often mock me," he said.

As they did drills together, his fellow dancer Moayed Nawar said, "I want to dance professionally."

Then the 13-year-old added defiantly, "I am not going to stop, stay home and shut up about it."
