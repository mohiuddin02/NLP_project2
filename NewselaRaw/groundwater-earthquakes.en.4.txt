LOS ANGELESâ€” California's Central Valley produces crops that feed the nation. It may also be to blame for an increase in earthquakes in the area, because of irrigation.

A group of scientists found that the mountains closest to the Central Valley were rising faster than expected. They were rising by about 1 to 3 millimeters a year. That added up to about half a foot in the past 150 years.

The scientists think they know what is happening. They believe the mountains are rising because groundwater is being pumped out.

Groundwater is very heavy. It pushes down on the Earth's upper crust like a weight. When the weight is removed, the Earth springs upward.

That change in pressure can cause more small earthquakes, the researchers said.

That means humans may be causing the gradual increase in the number of earthquakes, the study found.

## Watch Out For Dry Months

Other scientists studying an area of southern Monterey County found that there were more earthquakes during dry months. The number of earthquakes there every year has risen. The number doubled between 1984 and 2005.

But the reason why earthquakes have been increasing in Parkfield over time remains a mystery. The groundwater theory gives one possible answer.

Groundwater has been slowly drained in the Central Valley. The groundwater has been used for farms and cities since the mid-1800s.

In the 1930s, Tulare Lake disappeared because the water was rerouted to water crops. Tulare Lake was once the largest body of fresh water west of the Mississippi River. It was 60 miles wide from end to end.

The Central Valley has lost a lot of groundwater over the last 150 years. The amount of groundwater that has been lost would fill Lake Tahoe.

## Pumping Water, Shaking Ground?

About one-fifth of the nation's groundwater comes from Central Valley aquifers. It's the second-most-pumped aquifer system in the United States. In addition, the Central Valley produces one-quarter of the nation's food, including almost half of fruits, nuts and other food.

Susan Hough studies earthquakes. She said the idea that less groundwater can lead to earthquakes is very possible.

In addition, Hough said, it's possible that smaller earthquakes in the Parkfield area could cause larger earthquakes.

Parkfield was the starting point of a big earthquake that hit the San Andreas fault in 1857. The shaking lasted from 1 to 3 minutes. Trees were uprooted and buildings were destroyed.

"It won't necessarily happen that way" again in our lifetime, said Hough. "But the fact that it did happen once means that it could happen."

The San Andreas fault runs from San Diego to San Francisco. A fault is a break in the Earth's crust. Sometimes, the rocks on either side of a fault move suddenly. That causes an earthquake.

The part of the San Andreas fault around Parkfield is fairly weak. That means not much change in pressure is needed to cause earthquakes. The parts closer to San Francisco and Los Angeles are much stronger.

Steve Ingebritsen, a scientist, called the new theory interesting. But he said that more study was needed.
