COVINGTON, Wash. — Rick Bergum never dreamed of becoming a school janitor.

A scientist, maybe. Or an electrical engineer.

But he ended up joining his father's cleaning business. Now, the 51-year-old head janitor and handyman at Tahoma High School enjoys his job. He likes the satisfying jingle of a ring of keys and fresh plastic bags lining a tidy row of trash cans. Most of all, he loves spending days with his quirky father and college-aged son. They also work part-time cleaning the school.

Bergum prefers to be unknown. He says he is the man behind the curtain. Recently though, he has been getting some extra attention as one of 10 finalists for national Janitor of the Year.

## A Behind-The-Scenes Kind Of Guy

Bergum never expected to be nominated for such an honor — he doesn't even use products made by the cleaning company sponsoring the contest.

Even though he writes a blog about a fictional janitor character named Jon E. Mopp, Bergum has never sought fame.

"I just like to be behind the scenes, doing my job," Bergum said. "I like the idea of everything works, everything runs, and no one knows why."

Cintas, the company running the contest, sorted through hundreds of votes for the nation's top janitor. The list was narrowed down to 10.

Bergum, nominated by his father plus five others, is the only finalist from Washington state.

People will vote online between now and May 1 to determine the winner, who will receive a $2,500 check, plus another $2,500 in cleaning supplies for his or her school.

## The Votes Are Rolling In

Other janitors at the school said they are voting for Bergum as often as they can. Some Tahoma High teachers have told Bergum that entire classrooms of students have voted for him.

"He can do anything," said Terry Duty, Tahoma High's principal, who has worked with Bergum for nearly 20 years. "He can fix anything. There's never a problem that Rick doesn't find a solution to."

Bergum's office is full of cleaning supplies, tools and hundreds of keys. It is extremely organized, there are even drawers labeled as "junk." He likes a clean space, which is good for someone in his line of work.

Bergum always carries many things on him during the day. He has two cellphones and a radio, which he clips to his chest each morning. He also keeps three sets of keys, a flashlight and two pocket tool sets on his waist.

## It's Always Something

He never knows what the day will bring.

"You get to see a little bit of everything," Bergum said, describing a few unpleasant incidents that included vomit and clogged toilets.

But Bergum has fun, too. One recent day, Bergum was in the cafeteria, pushing a dry mop across the floor. There was an empty fruit cup, some straw paper and potato chips.

Jim Bergum, 72, whizzed around behind his son on a ride-on floor cleaner, eating the sandwich he had packed for lunch and beeping the horn when he wanted his son's attention.

The two sometimes joke that they are brothers. The elder Bergum is taller, but they are balding in the same way.

Jim Bergum has also made a career of cleaning. After being laid off from a job as an electronic technician at Boeing years ago, he rented a carpet cleaner to aid a friend's window-cleaning business — a move that ended up marking the start of the family cleaning business his son joined.

When Bergum left about 17 years ago for the Tahoma School District, his father eventually followed, selling his business. Devon, Bergum's son, works as a fill-in janitor at the school, too, which helps pay his way through college.

## Everything Is In Its Place

Bergum sometimes thinks about the janitor at his middle school in Covington, Washington, who would make him and his friends laugh in the lunchroom. They even had a nickname for him, chosen for his clanking keys: "Wad of Metal Man."

"I look back and I'm like, 'Now I'm that guy,'" he said.

After a long day, Bergum likes turning the lights off on a clean room. Everything is in its place; trash bags empty, floors clean.

"It's like, 'Ah, that looks good,'" he said.
