CASPER, Wyo. — These are boom times in the Cowboy State, thanks to an oil explosion.

Good jobs in the oil and natural gas fields of Wyoming are as common as pickups here. And the amount of people without jobs in Wyoming is far below the national average.

But some people worry that Wyoming is relying heavily on just oil.

Wyoming's oil business failed in the mid-1980s. If that happens again, it could expose a problem for the state: The easy oil money has prompted teenagers to skip college, or abandon high school, for the oil fields. And many don't have a backup plan if things go bad.

## One Who Went Bust

Tyrel Wellmaker is typical of these young workers. He's a high school graduate who left the Army for an oil job that required little skill. But that job offered a salary greater than even those requiring college educations.

In his early 20s, he worked in the oil fields. He came home each night dead tired. But, with a salary of more than $100,000 he purchased his own house and drove a $50,000 pickup.

However, he grew tired of the dangerous conditions after witnessing fellow workers die on the job. One winter day in 2008, the toilet in the trailer that he shared with other workers froze solid on a job. He just walked away.

Without savings, he soon filed for bankruptcy. The house went into foreclosure after he couldn't pay for it. His pickup truck was taken away. At 26, he moved back in with his father and regretted his decision to skip college.

"I felt I had made the biggest mistake of my life," said Wellmaker, now 31.

## The Lure Of Quick Money

But who could blame him? For most U.S. high school graduates, the quickest way to achieve the American dream is to attend college. Not so in Wyoming.

Between 2009 and 2011, the average U.S. salary for someone with a college degree was $48,997. That's nearly twice the $26,957 that the average high school graduate made.  And it's more than double that of a high school dropout ($19,013), according to government figures.

Compare that with Wyoming: In 2011, in the $60,000-$75,000 pay range, there were more people with only high school educations than those with college degrees.

In the $38,000-$47,000 range, even workers without high school degrees outnumbered those with college degrees.

Wyoming's ties to energy run deep: more than two-thirds of the state's money comes from digging up coal, gas and uranium. Some experts say the state has no choice.

"You have to pursue the opportunity while all those good-paying jobs are there," said Mark Perry, an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint.

He predicts the oil boom will last for a long time. "Let's be practical: A college degree is no guarantee to success anymore. Young people should grab some of this oil money. They can always go back to school," he said.

## Wyoming Keeps Its Focus On Oil

Some people say that oil has reduced the urgency in Wyoming to create new types of jobs.

"Wyoming is an energy state; we live off the energy dollar," said Sissy Goodwin, who teaches power technology at Casper College. "We're in a boom cycle now, but the bust will come. We need our politicians to look for the non-energy jobs of the future."

Jobs for unskilled workers are easy to find. But those for college graduates are not.

Last year, almost one-sixth of Wyoming's 288,000 jobs required a college degree. That's according to Wyoming state figures. But more than two-thirds required only a high school degree.

Jim Rose directs the Wyoming Community College Commission. He says the state is almost afraid to consider a future without oil.

"Colleges can't train students for a workforce that doesn't exist," he said. "If Wyoming started training people to work in the automobile or aircraft industry, we'd just be buying them a ticket to leave the state because there are no jobs here."

## Another Who Called It Quits

Jonathan Odlin has been training for a new job. He was in the military, but then took a job in the Wyoming oil fields in 2006.

He had a high school degree, and the pay was good. But he soon hated the unpredictable hours.

Then, in 2008, a good friend was cut in half in an industrial accident — after taking Odlin's shift. That's when he called it quits.

Odlin, 30, will soon earn a degree in power plant technology, as he struggles to support five children. "The oil fields may mean quick bucks, but for low-level workers like me, they're not the place to be. I need a real career," he said.
