### PRO: U.S. should help Ukraine defend itself against Russia

WASHINGTON — Congress has an opportunity to push the United States in a more effective direction to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. A Senate proposal would give Ukraine $350 million in military aid. It needs money and weapons to fight Russia from taking more of its land. Republican and Democratic lawmakers should vote to approve the proposal.

Russia took Crimea from Ukraine in March. Many people in Crimea have Russian roots and speak Russian. Some wanted to separate from Ukraine and began to fight Ukraine's government. Russia supported these separatists as they began their attacks. Then Russian troops invaded Ukraine and seized control of Crimea.

Russian President Vladimir Putin dreams of bringing back the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a huge country that included Russia, Ukraine and other Eastern European countries. Putin wants to go back to the days when Russia ruled over Eastern Europe.

Putin won't be stopped by the weak actions of the U.S. and Western Europe. So far, they've only put in place weak trade blocks to prevent countries and businesses from buying and selling with Russia. Threatening somewhat tougher trade blocks won't do anything.

## "Cannot Win A War With Blankets"

That's important because Putin is not just carving up Ukraine. Now he's threatening the Baltic countries of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. All of those countries are now members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance led by the U.S. and Western Europe.

In fact, Putin is threatening global peace.

Only U.S. military aid to Ukraine's weak government could possibly stop Putin. So far we've given just non-military aid. As Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told Congress recently with regard to U.S. non-military aid, "Blankets and night-vision goggles are important. But one cannot win a war with blankets."

The U.S.-led West has made only weak efforts to halt Putin's advances. Putin has just pushed ahead.

After Russia took Crimea, in an unfair election Crimeans voted 95.5 percent to join Russia. U.S. and European leaders called the election illegal. Then they imposed limited rules blocking some Russian trade, and conducted military exercises in the area. None of those actions stopped Putin.

## Russian Troops And Arms

Then, Russia aided pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. Russia sent troops and arms across the border into Ukraine. It cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine, which it needs. Russia then forced Ukraine to let the separatists rule over the area of Ukraine they'd taken. These were Russia's terms as part of a cease-fire to stop the fighting. Not surprisingly, the Russian separatists have already broken it.

President Barack Obama vowed to Russia that "there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine." The United States and Europe increased trade blocks and Obama visited Estonia to show U.S. support for the Baltics. Again, Putin barely noticed.

A top Russian official recently complained of discrimination against ethnic Russians and the Russian language in the Baltics. He's clearly laying the groundwork for a Ukraine-like intervention.

In addition, Russia arrested an Estonian official along their shared border and charged him with spying. It also captured a Lithuanian fishing ship. Russia claimed that the ship had sailed into Russian waters. Even troubling still, Russia asked Lithuania to send 1,500 former Soviet citizens living in Lithuania to Russia. Supposedly, these citizens did not fulfill their military service when they lived in the former Soviet Union.

## Other Russian Moves

It gets worse. In mid-September, Russian nuclear bombers flew within 63 miles of Alaska's coast and 46 miles of Canada's. The action forced U.S. and Canadian jets to fly out and meet them.

Russia's actions come at the same time as the country is improving its nuclear weapons with new missiles, submarines and a new bomber.

A Senate Committee approved the $350 million in aid for Ukraine on Sept. 18. Congress should vote on it. Then President Obama should sign it.

Otherwise, we'll surely see more Russian attacks in Ukraine and beyond.

### CON: U.S. should give both sides a chance to work out their differences

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is asking the U.S. for military aid. Poroshenko wants weapons to fight people in his country who want to break away and join Russia. President Barack Obama said no to the request, and he was right to do so.

Obama let Poroshenko speak to Congress when he visited Washington. When Poroshenko asked for weapons, lawmakers clapped. But in a meeting just after, Obama turned Poroshenko down. Obama will give military aid to Ukraine that doesn't include weapons.

There is a cease-fire deal to stop the fighting in Ukraine. The deal was made between its government and the separatists. The separatists hold the major eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. If the cease-fire holds to stop the fighting, the warfare that has wrecked some parts of eastern Ukraine will not continue.

Giving Ukraine weapons would risk making the situation there worse. It would come at a time when matters seem to be getting fixed.

## A Good First Step

Poroshenko has just made an important deal. He passed a law to let the separatists have more freedom to rule the areas they control. That law, along with the cease-fire, could be the way out of the deadly conflict.

Obama's decision to not send weapons to Ukraine upsets some people in Congress. A Senate committee has called for the U.S. to give weapons to Ukraine's government. But what the United States should now do is to help the cease-fire hold and make sure the new law goes into effect.

That law is a good first step. It gives the population in eastern Ukraine more control over local affairs. It will allow the people there to keep the close ties that they've always had with Russia.

When it comes to what the U.S. should do, the spotlight has been on the differences between U.S. and Russia. It's easy to see anything that looks like a gain for Russia as a loss on the U.S. side.

## Promoting Peace

But the goal should be to do what is best for Ukraine.

It will not be easy. The new law doesn't say exactly which parts of eastern Ukraine are involved, and just how much freedom the people will have to govern themselves.

Knowing what the people in eastern Ukraine want is unclear as well. One group of the easterners want nothing to do with Ukraine's government. This is the opinion of the separatists. But a second group in that same part of Ukraine is comfortable with being ruled by Ukraine's government. And perhaps a third group just wants peace.

One important piece of the new law is that the Russian language can be used publicly in eastern Ukraine, such as in schools, courts and local government. That is a good step.

Just what kind of relationship eastern Ukraine will have with Russia remains to be worked out. A takeover by Russia — as happened earlier in the year in Crimea — is not likely to happen for eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government and the separatists have to work out a solution to please everyone.

The United States should promote that process. There is every reason to believe that an acceptable arrangement can be achieved that will end the bloodshed in Ukraine.
