JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. â€” Andre Saraiva is a French street artist known around the world.

He became famous for drawing cartoon figures all over Paris. He signs his graffiti with "OX."

Two months ago, a photo of a painted boulder showed up on a hiking website. It carried Saraiva's OX mark. The boulder was located in California's Joshua Tree National Park.

Saraiva belongs to a new generation of graffiti artists. They do not paint graffiti on buildings or trains or mailboxes. Instead, they think of nature as their sketchpad. They draw on rocks and trees in national parks, then post photos of their work on the Internet.

## For Many, It's Like A Punch In The Stomach

These artistic acts make nature lovers furious. But the issue is complicated, said Casey Schreiner. He is the editor of Modern Hiker, the website where Saraiva's boulder photo appeared. "How different is graffiti in national parks than street art?" he asked. If painting graffiti on buildings is OK, is graffiti also OK in national parks?

"National parks are special places for most Americans," Schreiner said. Seeing them marked up is like getting punched in the stomach, he said.

A little bit of graffiti can encourage others to make their mark, Schreiner said.

## More Graffiti In Parks Near Cities

Government officials say they are seeing more graffiti in some national parks. They are seeing less in others. The most graffiti are in parks near big cities. Two of them have experienced a notable rise in graffiti. One of them is Golden Gate National Recreation Area near San Francisco. The other is Joshua Tree, not far from Los Angeles.

In 2013, graffiti artists marked up Rattlesnake Canyon in Joshua Tree. In February, someone painted a large, blue giraffe on a boulder. About the same time, someone painted an enormous skull.

"That makes me sick," said Steve Axthelm. He is a hiker from Portland, Oregon.

## Graffiti Is More Acceptable To Many

Graffiti is becoming more accepted. Many see it as art. These days, on the Internet, people post examples of street graffiti. Google recently began a website featuring street art from around the world.

In the modern art world, street graffiti is seen as old fashioned, said Jeremy Cross. He is an artist in California. Tagging a national park is the next new thing. Cross said a lot of people are getting mad at the artists, though.

Recently, selfies of a young woman were posted on hiking websites. They showed her painting faces on colorful rocks.

A National Park Service spokesman said the artist may be Casey Nocket, 22, of New York. Officials suspect Nocket painted graffiti on eight national parks. One of them was Joshua Tree.

## New Tools Help Officials Fight Back

Park officials are fighting back. They are using hidden video cameras to catch taggers in the act, said David Smith. He is in charge of Joshua Tree.

Saraiva is the best-known artist who has tagged in a national park.

At first, he has denied the boulder was even in the park. He even posted on Instagram that it was done in a friend's backyard.

Readers of Modern Hiker then decided to investigate and found the boulder's exact location. Their conclusion? It was definitely on national park grounds.

His lawyer said Saraiva used paint that could be erased.

On April 1, Saraiva paid a fine of $275, officials said.

Some businesses think people focus too much on graffiti in national parks.

Lena Kent works for Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway. Its freight cars and engines are tagged every day. Kent said she wishes people cared as much about graffiti on private property.
