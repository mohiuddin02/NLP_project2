The 14-year-old student needed both hands to grab something, so she put the mini-magnets in her mouth. Someone made her laugh, and … gulp. She swallowed them.

Five days later, Christin was in the hospital having the magnets taken out. Along with the magnets, doctors took out a small part of her colon. The colon is the last part of the body's digestive system.

Christin used to love magnets, the kind you can form into shapes and use to perform magic tricks. But she found out the hard way what doctors already know.  It's not just little kids who get into trouble with magnets. Tweens and teens are also at risk.

## "Magnets Cause More Damage"

Warnings are on many toys. But that has not stopped a growing number of kids from putting the little magnets in their mouths or noses. The magnets can get stuck in their bodies. There, they can cause serious harm.

"Kids swallow a lot of objects," said Dr. Tejas Mehta. He treated Christin at the hospital. "Magnets cause more damage than anything else."

Magnets work very hard to find each other. Their force can cause intestines to twist and become blocked. The intestines are the long, coiled tubes connected to the stomach. They help the body break down food and absorb nutrition.

Eventually the magnets can make a hole in the intestines. This can cause an infection, Mehta said.

Four out of five kids who swallow magnets will need an operation to remove them, said Mehta. Some kids need a serious type of operation. In it, all or part of the large intestine is removed.

From 2002 to 2011, the number of kids getting sick from magnets jumped. A study showed 22,500 kids under 21 went to the hospital because of magnets. Usually the kids swallowed the magnets. But one in four kids put the magnets up their nose, said Julie Brown. She is a doctor at a hospital in Seattle. She helped write the study.

## A Growing Problem For Kids

The problem shows no sign of slowing down, she said.

"There is something very tempting about" magnets, Brown said. "You want to put it in your mouth. You want to try to separate the magnets with your teeth."

To toddlers, they look like the little silver-ball sprinkles on cupcakes, she said.

Buckyballs is a set of 216 magnets. People can stick them together to make things. Last year, a product safety group said Buckyballs should not be sold.

But you can still find them online. And Brown said that more than 3 million magnet sets have been sold.

Other products with magnets are also a problem, she said. One example is bulletin boards with little magnet pins. There also are refrigerator magnets that look like candy.

## Tracking, Then Removing, The Magnets

Some doctors don't know magnets can be a serious problem. When Christin's mom took her daughter to the hospital, a doctor just sent Christin and her mother home. The doctor said the magnets would pass out of her digestive system when she pooped.

That advice didn't sound right to Rivas. She looked online.

"That's when I hit the panic button," she said.

Her mother took Christin to another hospital. There, doctors tracked the magnets with an X-ray machine.

Normally, anything put in the mouth takes six to eight hours to come out of the body. But Christin's magnets got stuck for 24 hours. So, the doctors decided to operate.

The doctors safely removed the magnets. But the operation could cause her to have a blocked intestine in later life. A blocked intestine can be very dangerous.

"Don't even think about touching them or buying" magnets, Christin advised. "I messed up my intestines. I worry about that down the road."
