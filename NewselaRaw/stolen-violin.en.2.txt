MILWAUKEE â€” A 300-year-old Stradivarius violin on loan to Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra lead violinist Frank Almond was stolen during an armed robbery last Monday.

Almond was attacked with a stun gun after he gave a performance at Wisconsin Lutheran College. The robbery of the instrument took place shortly before 10:30 p.m. in a parking lot in the rear of the school, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Tuesday at a news conference. Flynn said the violin was valued in the "high seven figures."

As Almond lay on the cement, the robber fled to a nearby vehicle, which then left the scene, Flynn said. The escape vehicle, a maroon or burgundy minivan, was driven by another person.

Investigators believe the instrument was the target of the robbery, Flynn said. The violin is known in musical circles as the Lipinski Stradivarius.

## A 300-Year History

Stradivarius violins are among the world's most famous and expensive. Built by Antonio Stradivari during the late 1600s and early 1700s, they have been played by some of the world's greatest violinists.

In a 2008 newspaper story on the violin, Chicago violin dealer Stefan Hersh said the Lipinski violin was similar in value to another Stradivarius that sold for more than $3.5 million in a 2006 auction.

Chief Flynn described the violin taken in the robbery as "priceless." He said its value could only be appreciated by a very small population.

"It can't be easily sold for even a fraction of its value," he said. "These are wildly valuable to a tiny slice of the art world."

The violin was crafted in 1715 in Cremona, Italy. It has a unique pattern on its back, the chief said.

Police have not ruled out that the robbery was an unplanned street crime. Yet, they are working with investigators with the FBI's art crimes team based in Virginia, which specializes in high-end art thefts. The International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol, has also been notified, Flynn said.

"This is a potentially international crime," Flynn said. Investigators are searching everywhere from pawn shops to international databases.

## Once Played By Lipinski

Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra president Mark Niehaus said Almond was recovering from the attack. He would not be on stage this weekend.

The instrument was on long-term loan to Almond from its owners, who are unknown. Almond has described them as people with "strong ties to Milwaukee." It's a common practice in the music world for the owners of famous instruments to loan them to expert, talented musicians such as Almond.

The violin's early owners included the virtuoso Giuseppe Tartini (1692-1770). He's known to listeners for his "Devil's Trill Sonata." The instrument has also belonged to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski (1790-1861), whose name has stayed attached to it.

Local music writer Elaine Schmidt held the instrument during a 2013 interview with Almond. She described it as "light, far lighter than one would expect, and an absolutely gorgeous example of craftsmanship."

During that 2013 interview, Almond explained that the Lipinski is "finicky" about temperature and humidity. The violin responds differently some days than others.

## Vibrations Keep The Violin "Alive"

"One of the really mysterious things about these instruments is that they really maximize our strengths if we can figure out how to play them," he said. He began playing the Lipinski in 2008. He found the instrument produces sound differently than one would think. Its sound tightens and narrows as the player adds more bow pressure on the strings.

"It's like a high-performance car," he said. "You have to learn to drive it."

Almond said in a previous interview that he was told the violin had been stored in a bank vault. The bank is just a short distance from where Almond was playing with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. He met the violin owners at the bank, and they asked him if he wanted to play it on loan. He said yes.

Niehaus said that because the violin is made of wood, "it needs to be touched, it needs to be played."

He added, "The vibrations of the music keep it alive."

Almond conducted a Kickstarter campaign to fund "A Violin's Life," a recording that memorialized the history of the violin. If featured music by the violin's owners throughout history.

In 2013, British police recovered a stolen 300-year-old Stradivarius violin that had been missing for more than two years.
