When comparing the appearance of United States presidents with the runners-up who lost the election, the difference is apparent. Former Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain appear healthy and chipper. President Barack Obama, on the other hand, has more gray hair and often looks tired.

If failed candidates for the highest political office in the country only knew the results of new research, they might be happier to have lost the election. The research might even discourage some of the many Republicans currently running for the highest office in the land.

Researchers conducted a study about the lifespan of those elected to either a parliamentary leadership position or a presidency. They studied nearly three centuries worth of information. They looked at heads of state in different countries. The results showed that after an election, the losers lived about four years longer than the winners who went on to serve as heads of state.

On average, winners were also a little older than losers. Therefore, these results needed to be adjusted. Considering this, the study found that elected heads of state lived about 2.7 fewer years than candidates who were not elected to office.

## Leading The Free World Is Stressful

Although the goal of running for office is to win, researchers decided that it had a downside. They said that being elected to a country's highest office can lead to early aging. Researchers determined that the weight of leadership and holding a political office has a physical effect on elected officials.

That claim has been controversial. Dr. Michael Roizen, of the Cleveland Clinic, has said that the typical president ages two years for every year he is in office. However, no information is available — yet — on how a woman would age in office. To draw his conclusion, Roizen has used presidential medical records from the 1920s through today.

But in the medical journal JAMA in 2011, human lifespan and human endurance expert S. Jay Olshansky came to the opposite conclusion. He based his opinions on the health and life spans of presidents from George Washington to the present. Olshanksy is a professor of public health at the University of Illinois. He looked into the 34 presidents who died of natural causes. He found that 23 of these 34 presidents "lived beyond the average life expectancy for men of the same age when they were inaugurated, even if they hypothetically aged at twice the normal rate while in office."

## Seriously Silly Studies Too

The new study appears in the BMJ, a medical journal. Once a year in the Christmas issue, readers are treated to a collection of papers that feature silly subjects. The silly subjects are explored with thoughtfulness, and serious subjects are explored with goofy methods. Last year, one paper conducted a thorough test of "male idiot theory." It concluded that, indeed, men are idiots.

The latest research adds to a surprisingly powerful set of results. It determined that winning awards, honors and elections actually leads to a long life. Previous studies in this subject looked at Academy Award winners, Emmy Award winners and Nobel Prize winners. Results showed that these winners tend to live longer than candidates who did not win.

Other results supported the presidential study. A paper published in 2013 found that players inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame did not fare so well. Unfortunately, when they died they were an average of two years younger than their peers who were nominated, but did not get in.

## All Lifespan Results Are Not Equal

When comparing the lifespans of elected heads of state runners-up, research has not found a clear pattern. The recent study aimed to find a way around the shortcomings in the methods used in in the previous studies. Those methodologies were seen as leading to jumbled results.  

To find an accurate result, the study went through almost 300 years worth of information. The researchers collected past electoral results from several countries. They included Austria, Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United States.

The researchers' earliest example drew from the 1722 parliamentary election in Britain.
