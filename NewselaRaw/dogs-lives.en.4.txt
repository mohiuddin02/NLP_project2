SEATTLE â€” For Daniel Promislow, it is hard to watch his dog get old.

"Month by month, he gets slower and slower," Promislow said. He is a scientist at the University of Washington. His dog, Silver, is 11 years old. His other dog, Frisbee, is still playful like a puppy. At 10, though, she also is old for a dog.

Promislow wants to find a way to make pets live longer.

Right now, the most hopeful medicine is called rapamycin. Experiments show it can make mice live longer. It can also delay some diseases. Promislaw hopes it will work for dogs.

## Let's Test It And See

No one has tested to see if rapamycin makes people live longer. Experiments on people are expensive. They can take many years to get results.

Dogs are another story. Scientists could find out more quickly if this medicine lets them live longer.

"I think it's worth a go," said Steven Austad. He is an expert on aging at the University of Alabama.

Rapamycin may not work on dogs, Austad said. "But if it did, boy, it's going to be huge."

The scientists are planning an experiment on dogs.

It might not make the dogs live longer, Promislow pointed out. However, it may help them stay healthier and more active. That would be good, too.

## People Want Their Pets To Be Healthy

Finding money for the study may be difficult. The government only pays for studies that help humans.  Dog-food companies might be willing to pay for it. Most of all, the scientists are counting on dog lovers who want their pets to be healthier.

The scientists have set up a website about the project. It is dogagingproject.com. On it, people can give money. They can also sign up their dogs to be in the study.
