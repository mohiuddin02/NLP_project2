MINNEAPOLIS â€” Denis Keegan was suffering from kidney disease, but his doctors were struggling to find out what was causing it. He was out of answers. That's when he turned to testing his DNA. Your DNA holds the information that tells your body how to grow and work. DNA is passed on from parents to children.

Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota took Keegan's DNA from a blood sample and examined it. There they found that a mutant gene was causing his kidney problem. Keegan was suffering from a very rare disease. Now that they knew this, the doctors were able to treat his condition.

All human genes were first mapped in 2003 and showed for the first time exactly how our bodies develop. Scientists found that we all have the same number of genes, but the genes themselves can be different. You might have the gene for blue eyes, and someone else may have the gene for brown eyes. Since human genes were mapped, genetic testing has become a booming business. It can also let people learn more about the mysteries of their bodies.

The testing is also improving quickly. The X-ray machine made it possible to look inside the human body. Now, genetic testing is changing the way doctors test for and treat diseases.

## Spotting A Disease's Cause

Testing can be done by a doctor or with kits bought online or at a drugstore. Americans are expected to spend $25 billion a year on genetic tests by 2021. The tests can check for a wide range of diseases.

Genetic testing is a complicated issue. It could cause needless worries among healthy people. Or it could start family problems if one member's test reveals troubling findings about the whole family's genetic information.

People get many diseases because of their genes. So genetic testing can help prevent, spot or treat a disease much better.

It also can show whether a person can pass a disease to his or her children. The DNA is usually collected from blood or saliva.

The cost varies widely, from $99 home kits to thousands of dollars for hospital tests. The price also changes depending on which disease the doctor is looking for.

Health care companies will usually cover tests done by doctors but not tests at home. Some experts believe that the home tests can give incorrect results.

## Finding The Right Medicine

Doctors say that DNA tests can help in finding the best medicines for particular diseases.

Dr. Alexander Parker said one woman had a disease that was not getting better with the regular medicine. Using genetic tests, the doctors found a medicine that worked.

For healthy people, there is little point in having these tests. It may even cause harm by raising worries about the chances of developing a disease.

Parker said that DNA testing is just about finding risks of developing diseases. "We can never say that we know exactly what will happen to anyone," he said.

Parker said patients should talk to their doctor before taking any tests. Melissa Truelson works in genetics at the University of Minnesota. She encourages people to ask themselves about what type of information they may get from the test. They should also think about how it will affect them both medically and emotionally.

## Worries About Getting Tested

Nada Maalouli of Minnesota has wrestled with these questions for years. Her mother, her grandmother and an aunt all died from cancer. A genetic test would tell Maalouli if she carries the gene that gives her a higher risk for cancer.

She has worried over the decision to get tested. Maalouli is concerned that the test results could bring bad news. Now 51, Maalouli and her three sisters have made a deal. Though they are all healthy now, if any of them finds something wrong they will all go for testing.

One person's choice to get tested may also give information about his or her relatives. And they may not want to know. Keegan's decision to have the tests affected several members of his family. Doctors asked his older brother and father to also give DNA to find out if Keegan had got his disease from his father. His father was sick before him and had to get a new kidney.

Keegan, 30, and his wife were thinking about starting a family. There is a one-in-two chance that their children could get the gene that could cause kidney disease.

The couple talked about testing the fertilized egg to make sure it  did not have the gene. But they  thought this would be "playing God." They've decided just to go ahead, have children and see what happens.

Keegan figures that treatment for the disease will be much better in the future.
