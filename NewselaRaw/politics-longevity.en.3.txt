When comparing the appearance of United States presidents with the runners-up who did not win the election, the difference is clear. If you look at people who ran for president and lost, many seem to be healthy and lively. President Barack Obama, on the other hand, like many before him, looks tired after some years in the White House. His hair has gone gray.

A new study looked at how being president affects the body. The results of the study might make people who have lost the presidential election less unhappy about it.

## So You Still Want To Be President?

A presidential candidate is a person who is running for president. If some of the current candidates knew what the study said, they might not want to be president after all.

Scientists conducted a study about the lifespan of those elected to be a head of state. A head of state is a person who has the highest government job in a country. A president is a head of state.

Scientists studied almost 300 years worth of information. They studied heads of state from different countries. They looked at how long elected heads of state lived compared with election losers. The results showed that after an election, the losers lived about four years longer than the winners.

On average, winners were a little older than losers. Therefore, these results needed to be adjusted. After that, the study found that election winners lived about 2.7 fewer years than runners-up who were not elected.

## Some Presidents Beat The Odds

The goal of running for office is to be elected. However, scientists said that winning has a downside. They said that being elected head of state can lead to early aging. The scientists determined that the weight of running a country has a physical effect on a person.

That claim has been controversial. Dr. Michael Roizen said that the average president ages two years for every year he is in office. However, no information exists yet on how a woman would age in office. To do his calculation, Roizen used past presidential medical records from the 1920s through today.

In 2011, human lifespan expert S. Jay Olshansky shared a different view. He based his opinion on the health and lives of U.S. presidents.

Olshansky looked into the 34 U.S. presidents who died of natural causes. He found that 23 of these presidents lived longer than the average life expectancy. This was true even if these presidents aged two years for every year in office. He based life expectancy on men the same age as the presidents.

## Adding Actors, Athletes Into The Mix

The new study was published in the BMJ, a magazine for doctors. Once a year, they share a collection of studies. Included are thoughtful studies on silly subjects and serious studies carried out with a silly approach. Last year, one study looked into the "male idiot theory." The study determined that men are idiots.

Another study adds to the results. The new study determined that winning awards, honors and elections leads to a long life. These studies looked into actors who had won Academy Awards and Emmy Awards. Results showed that the winners tend to live longer than runners-up who did not win.

Other studies had varying results. A study from 2013 said that baseball players who made it into the Baseball Hall of Fame did not do as well. On average, they died two years younger than players who were nominated but did not get in.

## Centuries Of Research

Based on all of the studies, results are mixed. When comparing the lifespan of elected heads of state to the runners-up, no clear pattern was found. The latest study tried to find a way around the mixed results of past research.

To improve on past studies, the new one looked at almost 300 years worth of information. The scientists collected election results from 17 countries. The earliest information to be studied came from a 1722 election in Britain.
