LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” Kobe Bryant once promised that he would play basketball only for the Los Angeles Lakers. On Sunday, he kept his vow. After 20 years with the team, he said he will retire at the end of the season.

"I had to just accept the fact that I don't want to do this anymore, and I'm OK with that," Bryant said.

Bryant announced his retirement in a poem titled "Dear Basketball." It was posted Sunday on The Players' Tribune website.

"My heart can take the pounding. My mind can handle the grind. But my body knows it's time to say goodbye," wrote Bryant in the poem. "And that's OK. I'm ready to let you go. I want you to know now."

## One Of The Best Players Ever

On Sunday night, the Lakers played against the Indiana Pacers. At the game, fans received a letter from Bryant in a black and gold envelope.

"What you've done for me is far greater than anything I've done for you," wrote Bryant in the letter. "I knew that each minute of each game I wore purple and gold." Those are the team colors.

Bryant is one of the best players in NBA league history. He has played in five NBA championship games and was named an NBA All-Star player 17 times. He also made the most baskets in the Lakers' history. Bryant earns $25 million and is the NBA's highest-paid player this season.

The Lakers were always Bryant's favorite team. In 1996, Bryant joined the Lakers straight from high school near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Paul George, an Indiana Pacers basketball player, said he watched Bryant play when he was growing up. Bryant was his hero.

## Injuries Have Slowed Him Down

Bryant often has been hurt playing basketball. In the last three years, he had to end the season early because of injuries. In the last two years, he played only 41 games. So far this season, he has made just one out of every three of his shots and has been in pain every day. Before Sunday's game, many fans took pictures of Bryant warming up. Then he missed his first six shots.

"Kobe Bryant is one of the greatest players in the history of our game," said Adam Silver. He is the head of the NBA.

Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak was not surprised that Bryant decided to retire. The team is not doing well and is no longer a challenge for him, Kupchak said. "I think the game will be easier for him now," Kupchak said. "I think he'll be able to enjoy the rest of the season."

## Future Plans Are Not Clear

Bryant intends to keep going.

"There's nothing I would love more than to be able to play this entire season," he said. Bryant added that he would like to play on all the basketball league's courts one last time.

Bryant said he is at peace with his decision. He did not say much about his future plans, but did say that said he would be honored to be picked for the U.S. Olympic basketball team this summer.

Bryant said he used to think about basketball all the time. Now, he does not think about it as much anymore, which makes him feel that it is time to quit and do something else.
