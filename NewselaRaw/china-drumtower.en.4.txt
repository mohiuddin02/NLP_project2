ZENGCHONG, China â€” There is a village in China called Zengchong. It has a huge tower with a giant drum. The drum tower was built more than 300 years ago. The drum is used to call villagers together. It also is used to warn them if an enemy is coming.

The tower was built without nails. It is 82 feet tall. It has 11 levels that each have six sides. The levels are stacked on top of each other. The tower is decorated with painted roosters, chickens and ducks. They are painted in bright blues, greens and yellows. A smaller two-story tower sits on top of the building.

## Village Life Is Slow And Quiet

The tower was built in 1672. Life in Zengchong seems to be about the same as it was then.

There are no McDonald's or Burger Kings. There are no traffic lights. Men still drive donkey carts. Women carry bundles of firewood on their backs.

Old women sell handmade brooms there. Pigs oink in the streets. Roosters cluck.

People come to the tower to celebrate. They also come there to settle problems.

There is a large fire in the center of the tower's floor. The fire is lit each morning. The only time it is not lit is when the weather is very hot. There are 300 families in the village. Each keeps the fire burning for at least one day a year.

## People Can Visit The Tower

One time the tower was in danger. More than 40 years ago, China's leaders tried to get the villagers to burn the drum. The villagers did not listen to the leaders. They would not harm their drum tower.

The tower has lasted 343 years. It is China's oldest drum tower. Now the people who lead China like it. They want to use the tower to get people to visit the village. The drum tower might be famous.
