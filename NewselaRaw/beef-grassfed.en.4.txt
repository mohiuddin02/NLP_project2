DELEON SPRINGS, Fla. â€” The cow looked around David Strawn's pickup truck. She was hoping to find something good to eat.

Strawn is a rancher. He is 79 years old and lives in the state of Florida. For many years, his family raised cows, lambs and pigs. Then Strawn got rid of the other animals and started raising grass-fed cattle.

## No Cages For These Cows

Strawn likes to eat meat. He wants to make sure the animals he eats live a good life. He thinks grass-fed cattle live good lives. Grass-fed cattle eat grass, not grains. They do not live in cages. They are not forced to grow fatter.

"These guys enjoy our pastures, the lakes," said Strawn. "They get gentle treatment."

Supporters of grass-fed meat like it for several reasons. They say it has less fat and is healthier than regular meat. They also say the animals are treated better.

Not everyone agrees. Some people think grass-fed meat is no better than regular meat.

## This Meat Costs More

One thing is certain. Grass-fed meat usually costs more money.

Erika Maier is a schoolteacher who has been buying grass-fed meat for several years. She buys it from David Strawn's ranch. This month she and several other families bought a cow that weighed 935 pounds. It cost more than $2,000. The families split the cost.

Maier freezes her meat. She makes dog food out of the parts she will not eat. She gives it to her German shepherd, Buddy.

## He Cares For His Ranch

Strawn used to sell his meat to restaurants in South Florida. Then he decided to sell to people directly. He wanted to get to know them better. Strawn loves his work. He likes to take care of the trees and wildlife that share the land with his cattle.

"I really like growing things," said Strawn, who grew up on the ranch. "I like caring for things."
