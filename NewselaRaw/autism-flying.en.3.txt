BALTIMORE â€” Tomas Harp wanted to get to the front of the line at Baltimore's airport quickly. He did not want to wait. He was about to get on a plane for the first time.

As he stood in line, his mother reminded him that waiting is part of going to the airport. Tomas sometimes has trouble waiting quietly. He has autism. People with autism understand the world differently. Sometimes they do not know why things happen. It can be scary for them.

Tomas is just 7 years old. On this day, he and his brother, Mateo, who is 9, were going to get on a plane that was not really going to leave the airport, or even move. They were going to practice how to fly.

## Wings For Autism Helps Out

The Harps were in a program called Wings for Autism. It teaches children with autism how to get on a plane. Fifty families were at the airport to practice.

Everything about flying on an airplane can be hard to understand if you have autism. You have to wait in lines with hundreds of other people. Airports also have many strange and loud noises, like planes taking off.

It can be very scary for people with autism.

Jennifer Bishop was also at the airport with her son, Nathaniel Epstein, who is 14 years old. Nathaniel had been on a plane once before when he was 4. The trip was very hard because Nathaniel was scared. Ten years later, his mother was ready to try again.

Nathaniel can walk, but he spends most of his time in a wheelchair, Bishop said. This is because he gets scared in new places. If he gets fearful, he might sit down and decide not to move.

## The Fastest Little Trip

Parents of autistic children say they do not often go to airports. Instead, they just drive everywhere. Tomas' mother, Carolina Harp, said she drives all over.

She even drives when she takes her sons on vacation. But this summer the family is going to California, which is all the way across the country. The trip will take days.

Harp said she does not plan to drive that far, so her family must learn how to fly.

The airport was helpful on practice day. Families went through a special gate. They got on the plane and found their seats. They heard a talk about safety and were served pretzels and water.

They were back off the plane in a half-hour. It was the fastest little trip to nowhere.

Wings for Autism was very helpful for the parents and children.

Bishop learned a lot on the practice run. For example, she learned that getting on the plane was hard for Nathaniel. At first, he refused to get out of his wheelchair. He wanted his mom next to him, but she was behind him pushing the wheelchair.

Bishop decided to move around to the front of Nathaniel's chair so she could walk with him. Then the family went to the first seat of the plane and sat down. Nathaniel smiled. He had done it.
