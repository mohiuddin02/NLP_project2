LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Many places in the United States require emissions testing of motor vehicles. Emissions testing checks the levels of dangerous materials that escape into the air from the exhaust of a car or truck. The materials are harmful to humans and the environment. To pass the tests, automakers have to make sure the emissions are within the legal limit.

Now the Volkswagen car company has admitted fitting diesel cars with a device that cheats emissions tests. The public is upset by the company's wrongdoing, and consumers are angry. There is, however, one victim everyone has forgotten — the Volkswagen dealer.

The dealers do not work for Volkswagen, and they cannot be held responsible by law for the automaker's offense. Still, they find themselves caught in the middle. The product they sell is in trouble, and their customers are furious. In addition, the world is waiting to learn what the car company will do to resolve the problem.

## Automaker Admits "Defeat Devices" In Cars

"Our dealers don't manufacture Volkswagens, they sell them," said Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Association. It represents 50 VW dealers across the state. Maas said the dealers had worked hard to build their brand and customer trust. Now their own business partner, VW, was hurting them by being less than honest.

Following an independent study, Volkswagen admitted placing "defeat devices" in as many as 11 million diesel engines. The devices helped the cars pass emissions tests under laboratory conditions. In normal operation on the road, however, the engines emitted pollution-causing nitrogen oxide up to 40 times more than the legal amount in the United States.

The result has been a total freeze on all new and some used VW diesel-engine cars. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the government agency in charge of protecting the environment. It has refused to allow the 2016 line of Volkswagen diesels. The company has also ordered its dealers to stop selling new and used diesel cars.

## Dealers Must Wait For A Recall

Now dealers have to wait until Volkswagen finds a fix for the diesel problem and issues a product recall. After the cars are ordered back, VW dealers will start working to get the affected automobiles legally back on the road. Until then, they cannot do anything.

The independent national used car chain CarMax has a stock of about 50,000 used cars in its network. It has several hundred of the affected VW vehicles. Government regulators have not given them any direction on the situation yet, a spokesman for the company said.

Individual dealers contacted were careful when speaking about the matter, and did not want to make public statements.

## Fraud Caused No Deaths Or Injuries

One dealer, who agreed to speak only if he was not named, said he was glad that there had been no deaths or injuries because of the company's bad conduct. He said he hoped people understood that dealers did not cause the diesel problem.

"Unlike the runaway Toyotas or the GM ignition switches, no one has died because of this problem — and people seem to forget that," the manager of a well-known Southern California VW dealership said. They also seemed to forget that the dealers were not Volkswagen, he said.

Christian Scali is a lawyer in Los Angeles. In the past, he has represented car dealers in lawsuits that involve many people suing one defendant, called class-action lawsuits. He said there may be a legal remedy for VW dealers hurt by the company's cheating.

If Volkswagen purposely set out to do wrong, they are going to have to answer to the government, the public and the dealers, Scali said. "The dealers would have a right to sue Volkswagen just as the public does."
