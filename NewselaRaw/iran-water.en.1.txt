TEHRAN, Iran â€” At Friday prayer services across the nation, there were the usual shouts of "Death to America." But believers also prayed for divine help with a matter that had more to do with the climate than their ideas about the United States.

The faithful prayed for rain, or at least were urged to do so.

"For God's sake, let's go to God's door and ask his Almighty to send water," an excited Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi begged the crowd assembled on the campus of Tehran University. This is where the nationally televised Friday prayers are normally held.

The ayatollah, or Muslim religious leader, broke into sobs from time to time as he begged the crowd to make their pleas both to God and to Imam Hussein, a respected figure in Shiite Muslim tradition. Shiites are an Islamic group that follows Shiite Islam, the official religion of Iran.

The water shortages troubling Iran, the religious leader suggested, could be a sign that heaven wanted believers to pay a little more attention to matters of the spirit.

"God sometimes sends ordeals to make his followers seek him out by praying and avoiding sin," the ayatollah said.

## Much Of The Desert Nation Is Parched

Concerns are growing about the water shortage across Iran. Water is in short supply everywhere, from the crowded, smog-filled capital and its parched suburbs to outlying towns and cities, to distant corners of the nation, much of which is desert. Lakes and rivers have been drying up, reservoirs are at all-time lows and there have been water supply cuts in some areas. The annual snow-melt from the mountains is on the decline.

On the streets here, people grumble about cuts in water service. Many buildings have tanks on the roofs to collect rainwater. Unfortunately, it hasn't rained in months. Bottled water is available for use, but many Iranians cannot afford it. Most Iranians rely on tap water for both drinking and washing.

"On some days of the week, our tap water is cut for seven or eight hours," said Akbar Aziz, 40, a printing-house employee who lives in the capital's working-class Khorasan district. "We are consuming as little as possible," added Aziz, a father with young daughters. "We only shower two times a week. So we are not responsible for the water shortages."

## People Asked To Reduce Water Waste

Experts say a range of factors is responsible: a lengthy drought, climate change and outdated farming and household practices that tend to waste the precious liquid. Iran regularly ranks near the bottom in global surveys of how nations manage water supplies, officials say.

The capital had a stifling hot summer, a trend that has continued deep into September and early fall. The water problem is not likely to go away anytime soon.

"In the short term there is really no solution," professor B. Alijani, who teaches students about climate change and geography, said in an interview. However, Alijani said that Iranians need to learn how to reduce their water use "and avoid wasting it both at home and in the fields."

He noted, for instance, that farmers using irrigation to maintain orchards of apple and cherry trees that need huge amounts of water in arid areas such a Lake Urmia. The lake was once a grand body of salty water in northwestern Iran. Now, the lake is drying up as its shorelines shrink every year. Underground wells that feed water into the lake are running dry.

"Why on earth are we cultivating apples and cherries near the Urmia salt lake?" Alijani asked.

## Water Could Become Expensive

This month, Eshaq Jahangiri, Iran's first vice president, completed a tour of water treatment facilities and reservoirs in the capital.  He and others have launched a campaign to raise awareness. The country's semiofficial Fars News Agency quoted his grim calculations.

"Tehran's dams only have water for a few more days, and this means that people must take serious measures," the vice president warned. "Those who use water beyond normal amounts are hurting those who abide by appropriate levels of consumption."

The vice president warned that water prices could rise. Authorities could be forced to make sure people cut their water use if autumn rains do not refill the reservoirs, he said.

On the horizon are ambitious plans for recycling wastewater. Plans to improve farming methods and change what many regard as wasteful personal use of water are also being considered.

## A Prayer Campaign Couldn't Hurt

But Iran has little money available for massive projects designed to increase the water supply. And people are reluctant to change their habits of water usage acquired over decades and generations.

Thus, authorities have turned to powerful religious figures for help. A prayer campaign, officials felt, could be an effective tool to get out the message that Iran is running dry. Mohammad Hadi Heidarzadeh, the top official in charge of the environment in Teheran, wrote a letter to a Shiite Muslim religious council in charge of Friday prayers.

In his letter, he asked preachers to invite the faithful to join them in a "rain prayer." Religious leaders were also asked to urge people to reduce their water usage, said the letter, which was released in the local press.
