BUDAPEST, Hungary â€” A flood of people are trying to get into Europe. They are from dangerous countries like Syria. The country is in the Middle East. There is a lot of war there.

The people trying to escape are called migrants. Thousands of migrants have come to Hungary, a country in Eastern Europe. Many are escaping war in their home countries. Others were very poor. They are stopping in Hungary. Then they will move on to other countries in Europe. They want to find safety.

For two days, Hungarian police have stopped them from leaving Hungary.

On Wednesday, people protested outside Budapest's train station. It is in the capital of Hungary. The people wanted to get on the trains. More than 3,000 migrants camped nearby.

## Countries Say They Need More Help

Europe cannot decide what to do. More than 332,000 migrants have entered Europe this year. Greece, Italy and Hungary are seeing the most people coming in. They have asked for more help. Germany has demanded that other countries take in more migrants. Germany expects to let 800,000 migrants stay this year. That is the most in Europe.

The people coming to Europe are desperate. They just want to be safe. They cross the sea in boats that are badly built. Others ride on the tops of trains. Many migrants have died.

This week, 11 migrants drowned trying to cross the sea to Greece. Also, trains between London and Paris were stopped. Migrants were running on the tracks. They tried to climb on top of the trains.

Zoltan Kovacs is with the Hungarian government. He said Hungary will stop migrants who are coming into Europe without permission.

Hungary is keeping people out of Germany. Only about 50 migrants arrived Wednesday on trains to Munich in Germany. On Tuesday, there were 2,400 migrants.

## Boats Rescue Many From Drowning

European boats are patrolling the seas. In the last day, Greek ships saved 1,058 migrants from drowning. More than 200,000 migrants reached Greece this year. They came mainly from Turkey, a country next to Greece. More than 1 million people live in camps there. They are just trying to escape war.

In Iceland, another country in Europe, people are trying to help the refugees. The government in Iceland promised to let 50 people from Syria stay. People in Iceland say it is not enough. Some offered to let a refugee stay with them. Others want the government to let migrants live on an old army base.

Abdullah Bakshi is a migrant from Afghanistan. Like Syria, the country is also in the Middle East. It is a dangerous place to live. Bakshi lives in Greece now. He says he misses his family very much. They are still in Afghanistan.
