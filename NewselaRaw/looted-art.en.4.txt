AMSTERDAM - During World War II, the Germans stole works of art from their Jewish owners. Even after Germany lost the war, the artworks were still missing. The children and grandchildren of the owners are still looking for the works.

A large investigation has just finished in the Netherlands. It looked at art hanging in Dutch museums. The goal was to find out if any of the art was once stolen by the German Nazis.

 The results of the investigation were surprising. There are 139 works that may have been looted, or stolen. They include works by important artists like Matisse, Klee and Kandinsky.

The announcement Tuesday by the museums was shocking. It also raises a question: Why has it taken them nearly 70 years to examine their collections this closely? It also suggests something else. More looted art may show up in countries that have not yet looked so closely.

## Works By Famous Artists

"These objects are either thought or known to have been" taken by the Germans during the war, said Siebe Weide. Or they were sold by owners who were forced to sell them, he said. Weide runs the Netherlands Museums Association.

The art included 69 paintings. One of them was painted by French artist Henri Matisse in 1921. It is called "Odalisque." It is a painting of a half-nude woman. The painting hangs in Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum. The museum is very popular with tourists.

All Dutch museums with art from before the war participated in the review. They have identified the names of 20 people whose art was taken. The people were linked with 61 of the artworks. The museums are trying to find relatives of the former owners. One of the owners was Jewish art dealer Albert Stern. He owned the Matisse. Stern is now dead.

The examination also found other paintings by well-known painters. Other pieces uncovered included drawings. There were also sculptures, old collectors pieces and objects used in Jewish ceremonies.

## A Painting Done In 1627

One painting was bought  by the Museum of Dordrecht in 2002. The museum had no idea the painting had been looted. The 1627 painting had changed hands many times over the years. Then the latest Dutch examination revealed it had belonged to a Jewish woman. It was sold by a bank. That bank had worked with the Nazis during the war.

In 1998, there was a wordwide meeting on looted art. People came to Washington from 44 countries. They found that past attempts to return looted art didn't go far enough. They set up the Washington Principles. The principles declared that "every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been" taken by the Nazis, and have it returned.

Many American and British museums have already thoroughly looked at their collections. They have returned looted art. But nothing has been done across the two countries. In Germany, a government-led, nationwide examination is happening now.

The Dutch examination was the second in the Netherlands. The first one in 2006 focused only on works that were bought and sold during the war.

Some wondered what took so long.

## Dutch Put Stolen Art On Website

"While I applaud the Dutch for doing this, I also have to say: where were you all this time?" said Chris Marinello. He is a lawyer who helps people in looted art cases. He said many countries should do more to help recover looted art. The United States is one of them.

But some countries are less willing than others. Russia does not accept the Washington Principles. It says artworks taken during World War II are its rightful "trophies." Switzerland says it supports the Washington Principles. But the country has not done any research. It also ignores the idea that looted art could be hidden in its bank vaults, Marinello said.

The Dutch Museums Association started a website on Tuesday. The website will show all it's learned so far about the stolen art. It will also ask for more information about looted artwork, and help relatives make a claim. An English translation of the Dutch website is coming in 2014.

Investigator Rudi Ekkart said more looted artwork might be found in the Netherlands.

But "you'll never again have a hundred at once," Ekkart said.
