WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama pushed for his plan to improve the fortunes of the middle class on Aug. 28. He did this while he honored the marchers who fought for civil rights 50 years ago. He recalled how they came together in a "coalition of conscience." He called for people to come together in the same way to fight for better economic opportunity today.

"In the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it," Obama said.

The president spoke at a ceremony 50 years after the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The 1963 protest became the most well-known moment of the civil rights movement. The first African-American president spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Martin Luther King Jr. spoke there 50 years ago. King described his dream that people of all colors would be equal. Many black Americans still struggled just to vote back then.

## Recalls "Those Ordinary People"

Obama's remarks came after several days of events in Washington. Thousands marched Saturday on the National Mall. They wanted to call attention to current civil rights causes. Those included gay rights, voting rights and gun laws.

The event Wednesday was more solemn. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter spoke, as did Oprah Winfrey and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. Lewis was the only speaker from the 1963 march.

It was drizzling. The president spoke to a crowd huddled under umbrellas. He paid tribute to the 1963 marchers. He mentioned both King and "those ordinary people whose names never appear in the history books."

He noted that "no one can match King's brilliance." But he called on all citizens to keep up the fight for more opportunity.

## Considers King An Example

Obama has often said that King was an example to him. The president regularly uses King's words in his speeches. The president has a copy of the program from the original march in the Oval Office. Obama took the oath of office this year using a Bible owned by King. The men are the two most recognizable black leaders in U.S. history. They have a symbolic connection.

But Obama's relationship with the civil rights movement and King's memory and mission has not been simple. Obama's mother was white. His father was Kenyan. He has wrestled with this and his connection to the movement that defined a generation of black political life.

He has identified with the Joshua generation. This is what children of movement's founders are called. They are supposed to carry on the mission. But he has also seen some problems with the movement.

Obama on Wednesday repeated some of those things. Real anger over discrimination has turned into something else. Some are making excuses for people behaving like criminals, Obama said. People once called for equal opportunity. That turned into asking for government support, he said. "As if poverty was an excuse for not raising your child."

## Wrestling With Nonviolent Teachings

People say Obama has not talked much about race while he has been president. However, he has recently spoken more about the discrimination he sees in the legal system. He has also talked about unfairness in education and economics.

King taught people to avoid physical conflict. As president, Obama is also in charge of the military. Obama has wrestled publicly with living up to King's nonviolent teachings.

The issue was in the news as he spoke on Wednesday. Obama's advisers were deciding whether to fire missiles against the government of Syria. The Middle Eastern country is believed to have killed hundreds with poison gas a week ago.

White House officials have suggested that a military strike is justified.
