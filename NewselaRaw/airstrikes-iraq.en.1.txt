WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama cleared the way Thursday night for the U.S. military to launch airstrikes against Islamic fighters in northern Iraq. The strikes are intended to save Iraqi religious minorities surrounded by the fighters and help defend Americans in the region.

Obama said American military planes already had dropped food and water to tens of thousands of Iraqi religious minorities stranded on a mountain. The minorities risk death if they descend.

"Today, America is coming to help," he declared.

Obama's announcement threatened to bring the U.S. military back into the country's long religious war.

Not since U.S. troops withdrew in late 2011 has the United States gotten so involved in Iraq. Obama, who made his remarks in a steady and somber tone, has counted on being remembered as the president who ended what he has called the "dumb war" in Iraq.

## Desperate For Food, Water Supplies

The supplies were delivered to the tens of thousands of Yazidi people trapped on a mountain who risk dying of thirst and starvation. The Yazidis fled their homes after the Islamic State group ordered them to convert to Islam, pay a religious fine, flee their homes or face death. Yazidis follow an ancient religion with ties to Zoroastrianism, a faith that originated in what is now Iran.

Obama said the Iraqi government requested the food and water. The Islamic State fighters are waging a war against the governments of Iraq and Syria. Their aim is to take control of both countries and create a religious government.

Obama acknowledged that the American public would be concerned about the possibility of renewed U.S. military action in Iraq. He vowed anew not to put American combat troops back on the ground in Iraq and said there was no U.S. military solution to the crisis.

## U.S. Will Not Be "Dragged Into Fighting"

"As commander in chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq," Obama said.

Even so, he explained that airstrikes might be needed if the Islamic State fighters attack Irbil. The city is in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq and is a base for U.S. troops and the diplomats representing the U.S. government. The troops were sent to Iraq earlier this year after the group swiftly moved across the border with Syria and into Iraq.

"When the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action," Obama said. "That's my responsibility as commander in chief."

He said he had also cleared the way for attacks if necessary to help the Iraqi military protect civilians.

Obama's announcement came only after the aircraft delivering food and water had safely left the drop site in northern Iraq.

The Pentagon said the airdrops were performed by one C-17 and two C-130 cargo aircraft. The planes delivered 72 bundles of food and water. They were escorted by two F/A-18 fighters from an undisclosed air base in the region.

The planes delivered 5,300 gallons of fresh drinking water, 8,000 prepackaged meals and were over the drop area for less than 15 minutes at a low altitude.

The president described the mission as part of the American duty to use its unique strengths to help avert a massacre.

In those cases, Obama said, "we can act carefully and responsibly to prevent a potential act of genocide."

Officials said the United States was prepared to make more airdrops if necessary, although they did not say how quickly those missions could occur.

## Some Question A Cautious Approach

White House officials said the Iraqi government has asked Washington to take military action. For that reason, they do not believe the United States is breaking international law by launching the attacks. They also said the U.S. Constitution gives Obama the power to act on his own to protect American citizens.

Obama authorized strikes in Syria last summer after the government attacked its own people with chemical weapons. Those strikes were never carried out. The president has also faced persistent calls to take military action in Syria where more than 170,000 people have been killed.

Some Republicans in Congress have argued that Obama's cautious approach has allowed the Islamic State group to flourish in Syria. Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina praised the president's proposed actions Thursday night, but said much more will be necessary.

"This should include the provision of military and other assistance to our Kurdish, Iraqi, and Syrian partners" who are fighting the Islamic State, they said in a statement.

Obama sent about 800 U.S. forces to Iraq earlier this year. Those troops are largely split between joint operation centers in Baghdad and Irbil. More than half are providing security for the U.S. embassy and U.S. government workers.

## Gathering Information For Now

Officials said the United States was conducting flights over Irbil with both manned and unmanned aircraft to gather information and to monitor the worsening conditions.

It's all but certain that Obama would proceed without formal congressional approval to launch the strikes. Lawmakers left Washington last week for a five-week recess, and there was no sign that Congress was being called back.

However, officials said the White House was in contact with some lawmakers, including the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is the leader of the Republicans in the Senate.

Some Republicans have specifically called for the president to take action and have said he does not need the approval of lawmakers.
