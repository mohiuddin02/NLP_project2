WASHINGTON — The NSA cannot listen in on your phone calls anymore — for a while, at least.

The National Security Agency (NSA) is responsible for tracking terrorist activities here in the United States. It relies on constant surveillance — close observation. As part of that surveillance, it has been secretly collecting and storing millions of phone calls made by ordinary Americans. Many people feel that practice goes too far. Americans should not have to worry about being spied on, they say.

Calls to change existing laws were prompted by the disclosures of Edward Snowden, who once worked for the NSA. Snowden released secret documents which exposed the NSA's phone records collection and other surveillance programs.

## Program Started In 2001 To Prevent Terrorism

The NSA was first given the right to collect Americans' phone records back in 2001. Its new power was granted by the Patriot Act as a way to help prevent terrorism. The laws permitting surveillance are not permanent, however. They need to be renewed periodically.

On Monday, Congress failed to meet the deadline for their renewal. As a result, the NSA was forced to suspend its controversial phone call collecting.

No solution is likely before Tuesday at the earliest.

The attempt to renew surveillance laws was blocked by Republican Senator Rand Paul, who is running for president. In a message to his supporters, Rand took credit and also sought donations to his presidential campaign.

"Yesterday, I forced the expiration of the NSA's illegal spying program. Contribute $5 now to show your support," Paul tweeted.

## Senate Republicans Seek Changes To Bill

Legislation that would have renewed surveillance laws had already passed in the House of Representatives. However, it became stalled in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leading Republicans sought changes. In a rare Sunday session, they abandoned their opposition to the House bill after President Obama and senior intelligence officials pressed them to pass it quickly. However, Paul then blocked their attempt to extend current law.

The House bill ends the NSA's collection of phone records. However, it still allows the agency to search the records held by phone companies.

McConnell and other top Republicans hope to add three amendments to the House bill. In its present form, the House bill dangerously limits the NSA's ability to keep Americans safe, McConnell said.

"We'll have a vote on that legislation as soon as we can," he said.

McConnell said that the proposed changes to the House-approved legislation are minor.

A senior member of the House Republican leadership, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, said the best course would be for the Senate to approve the measure as written. However, he pointedly did not rule out changes. "I don't know what the Senate could do — they said a lot of things," he told reporters.

## FBI Investigations Also Affected

The expiration of surveillance laws does not only affect the NSA. It also ends the FBI's authority to gather business records in terrorism investigations. In addition, it prevents the FBI from more easily eavesdropping on a suspect who is discarding cellphones to avoid surveillance.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest called on the Senate to make sure the gap in power was as short-lived as possible.

McConnell's attempts to pass a short-term renewal of existing law failed late Sunday. They were thwarted by Paul, who used Senate rules to postpone passage of the law.

"This is what we fought the Revolution over; are we going to so blithely give up our freedom? ... I'm not going to take it anymore," Paul said as the deadline for renewal approached. Supporters wearing red "Stand With Rand" T-shirts packed the Senate spectator gallery.

Paul's stand angered many of his fellow Republicans.

Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona complained bitterly to reporters about Paul's actions. Paul cares more about "his fundraising and his ambitions" than he does about the safety of the nation, McCain said.

Representative Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, issued a statement that said: "Having gone past the brink, the Senate must now embrace the necessity of acting responsibly."

## Officials See No Danger In Short Term

Intelligence officials warned that not renewing surveillance laws would be dangerous. However, they said they were not deeply concerned with a gap of a few days or weeks, given that surveillance will still be permitted in ongoing investigations. What they most fear is a legislative deadlock that could doom the programs permanently.

Obama supports the USA Freedom Act, as the updated surveillance laws are known. The act passed in the House overwhelmingly on May 13, before heading on to the Senate for final approval.

Senate Republicans blocked the legislation on May 23. They argued that it would prevent the NSA from being able to quickly search phone records. It fell three votes short of the 60 needed to advance.

But with no other options, McConnell, in a change of mind, reluctantly embraced the House-passed bill Sunday night.

"It's not ideal but, along with votes on some modest amendments that attempt to ensure the program can actually work as promised, it's now the only realistic way forward," McConnell said.
