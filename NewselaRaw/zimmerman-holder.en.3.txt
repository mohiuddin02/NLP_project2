ORLANDO, Fla. â€” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday asked members of the NAACP to help get rid of stand-your-ground laws. Holder, the first black to be the nation's top law enforcement official, said the laws "senselessly expand the concept of self-defense."

The NAACP is the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded in 1909.

Stand your ground was expected to be at the center of the trial of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. But it was not raised at the trial. It did come up when Zimmerman was arrested.

The Florida stand-your-ground law lets people defend themselves if they feel they could be hurt or killed. They can even shoot somebody. They do not have to run away, even if running away would let them avoid the confrontation.

## Stand-Your-Ground Laws Encourage Violence

Laws like that can encourage violence, Holder said. They do not prevent violence.

"We must stand our ground," Holder said to thunderous applause, "to ensure our laws reduce violence."

Holder also said his office is looking at all the evidence in the case. Federal prosecutors could still decide to charge Zimmerman in the shooting death of the black teen. Holder did not say how long the review would take.

Holder praised the peaceful reaction to Saturday's acquittal of Zimmerman. He also praised the "dignity" of Martin's parents.

But he also talked about the personal incidents of racial profiling he had faced as a young man. Racial profiling is when a person is stopped by police just because of their skin color.

## Racial Profiling

One time he was stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike for no reason, he said. Another time he was questioned by an officer in Washington's wealthy Georgetown district. He was running to catch a movie that night. He also happened to be a criminal lawyer for the government at the time.

When he was a teen, Holder's father told him on how to act if he were ever stopped by the police. Holder said he found himself having the same talk with his own 15-year-old son after Martin's death.

Holder said he was sure that his father thought that type of talk would not have been necessary for Holder's generation.

NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said he was "extremely pleased" that the Justice Department is fully involved in the Zimmerman case. He was also pleased to hear Holder's "strong, principled opposition to stand-your-ground laws."

Jealous said federal investigators need to look at evidence that the judge did not let into the case. The evidence allegedly showed racism was a factor in the killing.

Most of the hate-crime evidence was not allowed as part of the state trial, Jealous said.  He noted a relative of Zimmerman's who had said that he committed racial acts. He also mentioned youth in the community who said they think Zimmerman targeted them because of their race.

## Fight Against Discrimination Goes On

Holder also talked about the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision striking down important portions of the Voting Rights Act. He said the Department of Justice was would protect people's right to vote.

 "These problems are real. They are significant. They erode our democracy," Holder said.

Earlier, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan drew applause. He promised to continue investigations into housing discrimination. Those investigations already have resulted in people receiving more than $65 million.

"Blatant, in-your-face discrimination is still very real today," he said. But "a quieter form of discrimination has emerged that is just as harmful to our country."

One example: A report showed that fewer homes are shown to minority families than to equally qualified whites.
