DETROIT â€” Tracy Peasant began crying on the witness stand in federal court Monday morning. She described buying bottled water for herself and eight children, four of them her grandchildren, after her water service was cut off.

"It was hard," Peasant said, dabbing her eyes with a tissue.

Peasant was the first witness in Monday's hearing before bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes about Detroit's water shut-off policy. In 2013, Detroit filed for bankruptcy because the city owed more than $18 billion. The bankruptcy will allow Detroit to sell off some of its property to pay its bills as well as reach deals so some of its debt is forgiven.

Peasant's water was cut off at the home she rented in September 2013 because she did not pay her water bill which came to $8,500. She said it was so high because of a water leak and she was turned down for a special program that would help her pay the bill because the total was too high. Peasant said she makes $259 a month.

## "Not Looking For Free Water"

The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) never told her she could request a hearing to challenge the bill, Peasant testified.

"No, I'm not looking for free water," Peasant said. "I'm just looking for affordability, to afford it."

The city has cut water service to 19,000 homes in Detroit in recent months. A group of advocacy nonprofits requested that the judge issue what is called a restraining order to stop the city from shutting off people's water.

The advocacy groups include the National Action Network, Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, Moratorium Now and the Peoples Water Board. They argue that the city shut off water unfairly and without enough notice to homeowners. They also say the city gives little financial help to poor people who do not have enough money to pay their bills.

However, lawyers for the city said Detroit cannot provide free water.

## Fairness For All Residents

Attorney Sonal Mithani said suspending shut-offs would only hurt customers who owe money, because their bills would pile up.

"The city has a responsibility to all of its residents," Mithani said in her opening statement. "It's not fair to them to shoulder the burden of free water to others."

Peasant said her water was unexpectedly restored in June by a woman she believed to be a DWSD worker. The worker was there to ensure Peasant's water had not been illegally restored, but she had a change of heart when she got to the neighborhood.

"She said, 'I can't do this with these kids and stuff. This is wrong,'" Peasant testified. "When she left, she said, 'You have some water now.'"

The advocacy groups called water director Sue McCormick to testify about the shut-off policy.

McCormick acknowledged that the department's old rules for cutting off service are posted on the department's website. The old rules, written in 2003, call for a Water Department worker to identify himself or herself to the customer and show the past due account. However, this year the department hired a company to cut off the service, which often made no contact with customers before shutting off their water.

## Following The Rules

The judge focused on this difference between the rule and what actually happened. He asked McCormick if it was legal to cut off service without complying with rules on the website.

"When a public body has a rule that it decides needs review and change, is it appropriate to simply ignore it and stop implementing it?" the judge asked.

McCormick said the department stopped notifying customers face-to-face, but she was unsure exactly when the policy changed.

She said that the department has been able to change how it operates so long "that I do believe (they are) legal terminations."

McCormick said the department shut off service to about 24,000 Detroit residential accounts in 2013. Another 19,500 people had service shut off before a temporary halt that ended in August. She could not answer a series of questions, though, about how many of those homes had children living there or people with medical problems or disabilities.

McCormick said the customer service department and the water system's deputy director could better answer those questions. She testified she makes $190,000 a year.
