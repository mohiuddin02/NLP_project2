ALEPPO, Syria â€” Entering the prayer room of a mosque built in the 1100s, a teenager named Hussein Mansour plopped himself down. He placed a grenade and a small bag of pretzels on the table. Hussein and the others in the room are rebels fighting the Syrian government. Their goal is to remove President Bashar Assad.

Hussein picked up the grenade again and pretended to pull the ring. A fellow rebel fighter, Abu Musab, gave the 16-year-old a harsh look.

"I mean, he's carrying a grenade and a 3-cent bag of chips," he said, shaking his head. "It doesn't fit. He's too young."

## Called To Duty

As the Syrian civil war rages on, hundreds of exhausted rebel fighters are deserting. Many others are being killed daily. More and more, teenagers like Hussein are taking their place.

Thirteen of Hussein's uncles and cousins have been killed fighting government forces. Now Hussein carries the assault rifle used by one of his late cousins. He picks it up often, as if playing with a new toy.

Hussein took a break from fiddling with the rifle and motioned to the gun rack beside him. "These are just rifles my 6-year-old brother could shoot."

In a war that has already claimed more than 190,000 lives, boys like Hussein expect to die one way or another. Most seem to live by the words often heard in rebel areas: "It's all one death."

## Father And Son On Front Line

There are now more than 5,300 child fighters among the rebels and 2,000 with pro-government forces. Most are between the ages of 14 and 17.

Many worry about the long-term effects of having so many teenagers fighting. They fear it will make Syria a harsher place even after the war ends. Fighting may become a habit for many of the teens.

Rebel groups say they don't look for fighters younger than 18. However, the situation is so desperate that no willing fighter is turned away.

Hassan Suwaas is stationed on the same front line as his 14-year-old son, Omar.

A kid that "sees a shell fall on him or on his neighbor," he said, becomes angry. He "is going to grow up and want to fight."

Here at the front line where the rebel-held mosque sits, there isn't much fighting. The line between rebels and government forces has not changed for more than a year. Government soldiers are stationed just a few hundred feet away. The last time they tried to storm the mosque, however, was more than six months ago.

## "You Think You're Going To Live?"

All the fighters are dressed in street clothes and many wear flip-flops: They expect to spend their days not fighting, but lounging on worn sofas. They take turns watching 10 televisions that give them a view of the area around the mosque. Things have been quiet, but they can never let down their guard. After all, the government troops are waiting nearby.

As others around him chatted, 16-year-old Majid stared at the TVs.

Fighting was Majid's idea. His father, who is stationed at another battle line in the city, did not want his son to join the rebels. Then his father's friend, a rebel commander, pushed for Majid to be allowed to fight. His father gave in. Majid's mother still doesn't think he should be a fighter.

"I lied to her and told her that there are no (government) soldiers nearby," Majid said. "She thinks I'm far away from the front line."

Majid had just finished seventh grade when his school was shut down as fighting took hold in the city. He insisted he would finish his education when the war was over.

Aamir Mansour, five years older, turned to Majid. "Why, you think you're going to live?" he asked.

"No," Majid said quietly.
