JERUSALEM â€” A group of protesters chanted "Jerusalem, wake up!" as security guards blocked them from entering the lobby of a new movie theater.

The crowd at the recent grand opening of Cinema City, a 19-screen multiplex, hadn't come for the movies. They were there to protest a government law that keeps the theater closed each week during the Jewish Sabbath, which runs from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.

"Nonreligious people are equal too!" they said.

The demonstration was the latest battle in Jerusalem's long-running "Sabbath wars." For decades, the city's secular, nonreligious Jewish population has been fighting the ultra-Orthodox community over whether shops, theaters and other public spaces can remain open on the Jewish day of rest.

Ultra-Orthodox Jews follow the most traditional and strict interpretation of Judaism. They do not believe Jews should work, drive or use money on the Sabbath. In Israel, there is no separation of church and state.

## Strict Religious Rules

"I don't tell people when to go to the synagogue, and they shouldn't tell me when to go to the cinema," said Laura Wharton. She is a city councilwoman whose left-leaning, secular Meretz political party led the protest outside the multiplex. The movie theater was built on city land and is barred from opening on the Sabbath by a rule written by an ultra-Orthodox city lawmaker. "You have a small, vocal minority telling the rest of the city what they should do," she said.

Tired of having to drive an hour to Tel Aviv to dance at a nightclub on a Friday night or sit at a cafe on a Saturday morning, secular activists are fighting for more nonreligious activities in Jerusalem over the Sabbath. They have supported the opening of a small but growing number of cafes and bars. They also have held booming block parties in the streets, at times provoking protests from the ultra-Orthodox.

Most of West Jerusalem, which is mainly Jewish, shuts down every Friday afternoon, according to Orthodox religious law that prohibit observant Jews from working on the Sabbath. Stores are closed, bus service is stopped and cars are banned from the streets in and around many neighborhoods.

The ultra-Orthodox tend to vote as a group in city elections and are heavily represented on the city council. Some of them have thrown stones at drivers who break the Sabbath.

"When I see a Jewish person in a car on the Sabbath, it hurts me," said Daniel Katzenstein, an ultra-Orthodox father of nine who moved to Jerusalem from Brooklyn. "Any threat to my lifestyle I am going to protest."

## "A Lack Of Tolerance"

In recent years, crowds of ultra-Orthodox men have burned down bus shelters featuring images of women in skimpy clothing. They have sought to stop construction of a mixed-gender swimming pool. When the owners of Cafe Bezalel, a well-known cafe in Jerusalem, decided to open for Saturday brunch this year, ultra-Orthodox protesters chanted "Shabbat" at them. That means Sabbath in Hebrew.

"There's a lack of tolerance here, the feeling like you're not welcome," said Elisheva Mazya. She runs a nonprofit called New Spirit that works to keep young people living in Jerusalem by helping them find jobs and obtain mortgages. Many nonreligious young people are leaving the city because housing prices are high, jobs are scarce and they don't like the religious rules.

A few years ago, the organization started hosting parties on Saturdays to compete with cities like Tel Aviv. Indeed, Tel Aviv''s beaches and night life have made it a magnet for young people, and the percentage of ultra-Orthodox residents is much smaller.

"It's an opportunity to find other normal people here," Mazya said, looking around at a crowd of about 100 at a folk concert.

The battle in Jerusalem reflects the conflict between the ultra-Orthodox and secular throughout Israel. Resentment of the ultra-Orthodox community has grown among nonreligious and moderately religious Jews.

More than 60 percent of ultra-Orthodox men study at religious schools and do not work, and few of them serve in the army. Families receive money from the government based on the number of children in a household. With the ultra-Orthodox community growing at a much faster rate than the rest of the Jewish population, some officials have warned that the current arrangement can't continue.

## Mayor's Balancing Act

Last month, Finance Minister Yair Lapid pushed a law through the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, that would end military service exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox. Hundreds of thousands of ultra-Orthodox men demonstrated in the streets.

The tension is worse in Jerusalem. There, the percentage of ultra-Orthodox is more than three times higher than in the rest of Israel, and the Orthodox and non-Orthodox live near each other.

For Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, who is secular, running the city has been a balancing act. He has tried to stay out of the argument on issues such as whether Cinema City should be allowed to be open during the Sabbath. Meanwhile, he has put a priority on attracting secular young people, whom he calls "the engine for growth."

Since taking office six years ago, Barkat, [who founded a software company](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur), has pushed internship programs to keep graduates of Jerusalem's universities from moving elsewhere. He increased funding for cultural events, such as a recent Monday night block party with dancers on busy Hillel Street, not far from an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood. He also helped open a trendy restaurant and shopping complex in the city's train station that operates on the Sabbath.

Rivka Yeruslavsky, who runs a training college for ultra-Orthodox students, said conflicts between the groups are based on fear.

"We feel everyone's against us," she said, adding that cooperation between the two is possible.

"I hope that we can be together not just in the workplace but everywhere," she said. "But it's a process."
