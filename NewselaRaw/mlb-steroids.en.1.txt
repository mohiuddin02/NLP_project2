Alex Rodriguez's dizzying fall from the ranks of baseball royalty hit bottom on Aug. 5. Major League Baseball suspended him for an unprecedented 211 games — the rest of this season and the entire 2014 campaign — for using performance enhancing substances.

Rodriguez, once expected to become baseball's all-time home run king, will now forever be remembered as the central figure in one of the game's worst scandals.

Twelve other players were given 50-game suspensions in connection with Biogenesis, the Miami-area doping clinic that supplied high-profile players with banned substances from 2009 until last year. The League says the New York Yankees slugger was one of them.

Rodriguez, 38, is a three-time most valuable player (MVP) and fifth on the all-time home-run list. He can still play while he appeals the ban. The announcement by baseball coincided with Rodriguez's return to the big-league roster after months of rehab for a serious hip injury, his second. He was in the Yankees lineup Monday night in Chicago, where the White Sox were hosting New York.

## An Aggressive Probe Into Doping

"The past seven months have been a nightmare — probably the worst time of my life,'' the third baseman said. His voice cracked as he spoke about returning to the game during a news conference in Chicago.

"I am thrilled and humbled to have an opportunity to put on this uniform again and to play Major League Baseball again,'' he said.

The announcement Monday by MLB capped a lengthy and aggressive probe. Baseball issued subpoenas and offered to pay witnesses to help them gather evidence against players suspected of cheating. Ultimately, MLB persuaded the clinic's founder, Anthony Bosch, to cooperate. He turned over emails, ledgers and phone records that allegedly confirmed ballplayers were doping in violation of the players' labor contract. Most of the evidence has not been made public.

The case also ensnared All-Stars Nelson Cruz, Jhonny Peralta and Everth Cabrera. Some are calling the suspensions the most sweeping punishments since the 1919 Black Sox scandal, which involved a scheme to rig the World Series.

"We pursued this matter because it was not only the right thing to do, but the only thing to do," Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said. "For weeks, I have noted the many players throughout the game who have strongly voiced their support on this issue, and I thank them for it."

## "Toughest Fight Of My Life"

Most of the players negotiated the terms of their suspensions over the past month. They elected to admit responsibility, sit out their suspensions immediately, and return as quickly as possible to the diamond.

Rodriguez had vowed from the beginning to fight the allegations.

"I'm in the toughest fight of my life and it's not going to get easier,'' he said Monday. "I'm fighting for my life.''

He declined to answer questions about the use of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). In the past, he has said he had not used PEDs since his days as a Texas Ranger.

The League, however, contends he continued to use testosterone and human growth hormone (HGH). MLB said his suspension was also based on his effort to cover-up and obstruct the investigation. Testosterone is a hormone and HGH is a protein. Athletes take both to try to build muscle, but both have potentially dangerous side affects, according to the Mayo Clinic.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami last week said it was conducting a criminal inquiry into the clinic's activities involving the illegal sale and distribution of drugs, including to high school athletes. It is possible that Rodriguez and other players could be subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, should the case rise to that level.

## Baseball's Highest-Paid Player

Rodriguez has a $275 million contract and is the highest-paid player in baseball. He previously admitted taking performance enhancing drugs when he played for the Rangers in 2001-03, after the results of a confidential drug test were leaked, but has never been disciplined.

Rich Hofmann, Rodriguez's high school coach at Westminster Christian in Miami, said it was a sad day. "Each one of us, depending on where we are in our lives, have decisions to make and we have to live with them. Unfortunately, he has to live with his and that will be his legacy.''

Rodriguez had been rehabbing with a minor league affiliate of the Yankees until Monday's call-up to the majors. He has accused MLB and the Yankees franchise of sabotaging his career so that the Yankees won't have to pay him the balance of his contract, estimated at about $60 million.

Though the players union has cooperated with baseball in its effort to clean up the sport — and has supported the suspensions — Executive Director Michael Weiner said the union would defend Rodriguez because Selig did not "act appropriately'' in his case. Weiner did not elaborate.

## Scandal Broke Last January

The scandal broke in late January when one of Bosch's partners, Porter Fischer, went to the Miami New Times with records containing the names of major leaguers and other athletes who were buying steroids, testosterone and other prescription-only substances from the clinic. After the newspaper published the story, MLB launched an all-out effort to build cases against the players.

Other players who received 50-game suspensions in addition to Cabrera, Cruz and Peralta were: Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Antonio Bastardo and New York Yankees catcher Francisco Cervelli.

The latest suspensions follow the July 22 ban of Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, who was suspended for the rest of this season.
