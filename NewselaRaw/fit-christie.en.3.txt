HACKENSACK, N.J. — William Howard Taft was the heaviest president in U.S. history. He grew so tired of being made fun of that he asked his doctor to help him lose weight. "No real gentleman weighs more than 300 pounds," Taft said.

Chris Christie is the governor of New Jersey. At one point, he was around 200 pounds overweight. Twenty-one months ago, the governor decided enough was enough. He had surgery to help him lose weight. A small band with a balloon inside was put around the upper part of his stomach. The band, known as a Lap-Band, limits what the governor can eat.

Since then, Christie appears to have lost at least half of his extra pounds.

Many see that weight loss as very important. It's not just a simple question of Christie looking and feeling better. Some people want the governor to run for president in 2016. Christie has not said yet if he will, but many people believe he plans to.

## Unfair Judgments

Americans are obsessed with weight, with many people trying to lose their extra pounds. An overweight person running for president would draw a lot of unwanted attention.

Many would feel he or she was not healthy enough for the job. They would point out that being overweight can cause many illnesses. Others would feel that an overweight person somehow just does not look like a "real" president — and therefore is not the right choice.

Christie's office will not say exactly how much weight the governor has lost. Christie has said that only his doctor and his wife know how much he weighs.

Dr. Jaime Ponce has never treated Christie, but was shown before-and-after photos of the governor. Ponce said the photos suggest the governor is doing very well. "He's lost 100 pounds, if not a little bit more," he said.

## Encouraging Words

Christie still has a lot more weight to lose. However, the change in the governor's body is quite visible. His face is much thinner. His clothes, which used to appear tight, sometimes hang on him a bit. There is much talk about the new, slimmer Christie, strengthening the idea that he will run for president. Supporters often shout words of encouragement, such as, "Looking good, governor."

Last month, Christie was asked if he felt as good as he looked. "Not yet, but I hope to," he said. "I feel much, much better than I used to feel, but the fact is I still have some work to do in that area, too, and so I've just got to keep working at it."

Christie might have as much as 100 more pounds to lose, experts say.

Connie Mariano was once the White House's official doctor. She is a Christie fan and said last year she would like the governor to run for president. However, she said she worried that he would wind up having a heart attack or stroke and "dying in office." Christie, noting that she was not his doctor, said, "She should shut up."

## Eating Well And Working Out

Christie has said he works out four times a week. However, he rarely talks about his meals.

After announcing last year that he had the Lap-Band put in, Christie noted that he ordered a steak one night. He said he was full after eating just one-third of it.

Christie will not let reporters watch him eat. For example, the governor recently sat down for a taco lunch while visiting Mexico. Once his food arrived, reporters were shooed away.

Some people have seen him eat, though. In September, a birthday party was thrown for Christie. Mitt Romney, who ran for president in 2012, said he ordered lots of food he thought Christie would like, including lasagna and ravioli.

"I bought all this food and put it out in front of the table," Romney said. "Chris sat there and picked at a couple of pieces of lettuce."
