Some lakes freeze solid in the winter. That does not stop ice fishermen. They go out onto the ice. They drill holes to get down to the water. Then they wait for the fish to bite.

Waiting used to be the worst part of ice fishing. Ice fishermen sat still by their holes. It was cold and windy. They waited for hours.

Today's ice fishermen say things have changed. The waiting is not so bad anymore. They have better supplies now. They are much more comfortable.

## Fishing With The Family

Russ Francisco owns a store in Minnesota. He sells ice fishing supplies. He has seen things change over the years.

Russ says tents are warmer now. New heaters make them cozy. People can take off their coats. They can relax. They can text their friends. They can get things done in the bright lights.

Ice fishing used to be too cold for kids. Now the whole family can go. The kids play on the ice. They run over when someone catches a fish. They go back to the tent to warm up again.

## Easy Fishing

Russ is glad to see how ice fishing has changed. He says it is more fun now. It is also easy.

Ice fishermen used to drill their holes by hand. It was hard work. Now there are machines that do it for them.

Russ has other fancy tools. One can tell when fish are coming. Its lights flash when the fish get close. It tells the fishermen to get ready.

Russ has bait that glows in the dark. The glow helps the fish to see the bait. It makes them want to eat it.

He also has tents with sleds on the bottom. The fishermen put their supplies inside. The tops fold down into the sleds. They are easy to pull.

## Fishing In The Winter

Ice fishing is becoming very popular. Store owners like Russ are glad to see it. They have always been busy in the summer. Now they are just as busy in the winter.

People stop by to see the new supplies. They like the changes. Now they can go ice fishing more often. They can stay out longer, too. The cold is no big deal.

Other people want to try ice fishing for the first time. They have to buy lots of supplies. They do not seem to mind. They are just happy they do not have to buy a boat.
