Mavis Batey was a British code breaker during World War II. She worked with a group that cracked the German codes. The group helped Britain and its allies understand their enemy's secret messages. The group worked in an old mansion in Bletchley Park.

Batey died on November 12. She was 92.

She was just 19 when she was sent to Bletchley Park. She was a college student. It was 1940 and World War II was beginning to rage across Europe.

Batey became one of Bletchley Park's best decoders. She broke the code on a message that led to a surprise British victory over the Italian navy. She also was the first to crack the secret messages of the Abwehr.

The Abwehr was the German spy group. That breakthrough helped the allies successfully invade France on the beaches of Normandy. The invasion was called D-Day. It was one of the most important moments in the war.

## A Message Without An L

Enigma was the name of the German machine that turned messages into code. It was developed in 1918. Batey knew nothing about Enigma when she got to Bletchley Park.

Enigma looked like a typewriter. It had 26 lettered keys. But it was far more complicated. It had three or four electrically wired wheels. The wheels could produce endless combinations of coded letters.

There were also a number of different models. Each model had its own way of changing the message. This made breaking the codes even harder.

One day Batey was studying a message. It was sent on the Italian navy's Enigma. She noticed there was not one L in it. Enigma never encoded a letter as itself. So an L in a message was not an L when it was first written. She figured out that it was a test message in which the sender was lazy and just typed L over and over. The message helped her break the code on the Italian navy's Enigma.

In March 1941 she decoded a far more important message. It was from the Italian navy. It showed there was a major attack coming in three days. The next message had details of the battle plan.

The information allowed the Royal Navy to stop Italy. For the Italians, it was their worst defeat at sea.

## Cracking The Enigma Code

Batey's most important contribution came in late 1941. She helped break the super-tough Enigma machine used by the Abwehr. Batey decoded one message. That message allowed her team to understand how the machine coded a message. Days later, she broke the code of a second Abwehr machine.

The Allies landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944. The invasion was called D-Day. It was the start of the defeat of Germany. Batey's work breaking codes helped the Allies send phony information about the landing to the Germans. It left the Germans unable to hold back the Allies. President Dwight D. Eisenhower later said the secrets broken at Bletchley Park shortened the war by two years.

Batey was born Mavis Lillian Lever. She was born on May 5, 1921. Batey was studying at University College, London, when she was asked to come work at Bletchley Park. She thought she would become a glamorous spy.

Instead, she spent the war years in a damp and dreary cottage at Bletchley Park. But there she was surrounded by brilliant people.

Batey also met her future husband at Betchley Park. Keith Batey was a mathematician in the unit that decoded German army and air force Enigma messages. They married in 1942.

In 2001 Kate Winslet played a character based on Batey in the movie "Enigma."

By then, Batey was known as a hero to her fellow Britons. But she never much cared for that title.

"I was just part of a team. We were all part of a team," she told a British newspaper last year. "The heroes were the chaps who were fighting on D-Day."
