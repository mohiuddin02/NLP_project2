WASHINGTON — When school students hop onto yellow school buses, taxpayers usually pick up the fare.

Yet tighter budgets have school districts in at least five states asking parents to pay for school bus service.

"It's a trend that started back in '08 when the recession hit," said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA, the School Superintendents Association. He was referring to the economic crisis of 2008, when the stock market tumbled and many people lost their jobs. People and businesses could not pay as much in taxes to support schools, which meant they had to scale back the money they planned to spend in annual budgets.

"School districts' budgets were cut back severely," Domenech said. "As an alternative to cutting a lot of programs, districts went the route of charging fees for sports events, uniforms, after-school activities — and eventually transportation."

## State Funding Is Dwindling

Nationwide, school districts receive about 45 percent of their funding from the state and roughly the same percentage from local government.

However, state funding for education has declined during the last seven years. A report in October by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, found that at least 30 states were providing less funding per student last year than they did before the recession. Fourteen of the states cut that funding 10 percent or more.

The move to charge for bus transportation has angered parents in some communities and worried some school officials about children's safety.

"When the budget hammer drops on pupil transportation, it's usually children and their parents who take the hit. That's just really unfortunate and a shame," said Mike Martin, executive director of the National Association for Pupil Transportation.

## The Costs Vary Widely

Martin said that most school districts do not typically charge bus fees to make money - they do it to make up for a budget shortfall.

Fees vary from district to district. The Jeffco Public Schools in Golden, Colorado, for example, charge $150 a child per year. Students in grades 7 through 12 in Franklin, Massachusetts, pay $325 each, but no more than $975 per family. And the Poway Unified School District in San Diego County, California, bills $575 a year per child, with a limit of $1,437 for three or more children.

For years, school districts in a number of states have been charging parents for transportation as a convenience if they live within a certain distance from school, often 2 miles or less. Those who live farther away traditionally have gotten free bus service.

But shrinking budgets and higher transportation costs have pushed some districts to charge even if the students live far away.

Barbara Ortiz-Monson directs transportation for one of the lowest-funded districts in the state of California. "It costs $3.5 million a year to run the transportation program," she said. "The state only gives us $86,000."

Ortiz-Monson's district does not provide bus service to high school students who live within three miles of school. For middle school students, the boundary is two miles; for elementary students it's one.

Parents of students living farther away must pay for bus service. The fees are $395 a year for the first child in a family, with a maximum of $1,095 per family each year.

Last year, the district took in nearly $280,000 from bus passes, according to Ortiz-Monson. "It's a drop in the bucket when we're looking at $3.5 million," she said.

## Laundry List Of School Fees

School districts do not charge if students are disabled and qualify for transportation or are foster children or homeless. Some also offer discounted or free service to low-income families.

Ortiz-Monson said about one-third of the nearly 1,600 students who use school transportation in her district ride for free because they are low-income.

While transportation fees might help make up for lost funding, some districts have reported negative consequences like traffic issues, parent complaints and fewer students taking the bus.

Michelle Winzent, president of the Colorado PTA, said parents in her state feel like they are being "nickeled and dimed."

"Technology fees, book fees, athletic fees, and now bus fees. It's really outrageous," Winzent said. "It's also creating these horrific traffic issues at the schools because everyone is driving and picking up their kids."

## Student Safety Is A Concern

Some officials say that bus fees are unfair to students from low income backgrounds because they make it more difficult for those students to get to school. Families that cannot afford the bus fees might also not have access to cars.

Districts that bill parents do not always look at family income when they decide how much to charge.

According to Charlie Hood, student safety is another important consideration. Hood leads a national organization for student transportation directors. He believes that school buses provide unbeatable safety and worries that charging for transportation will result in some students using less safe ways of getting to school.

Safety is one reason some parents support the idea of paying for bus service.

Five years ago, Colorado's Douglas County School District launched a program that charges fees, but also uses a GPS system to track students on the bus. The district's transportation director, Donna Grattino, said parents were supportive.

"We're a large district that covers over 900 square miles. Some stops are 26 miles from the school," said Grattino. She says the tracking system shows where students are at all times "and parents recognized the value of that."

Domenech said he hopes that, as the economy continues to improve, districts that have been charging fees will begin offering free transportation once again.

"We're short-changing our children when we don't provide the necessary funding for their education," he said.
