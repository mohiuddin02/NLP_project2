SANTA CRUZ, Calif. — Surfing first came to California in 1885. Three Hawaiian princes introduced the sport to Santa Cruz by riding simple boards made from California redwoods.

Surfing has changed a lot since then. Today, surfers check satellite weather forecasts on their cellphones before heading out to catch waves. The biggest change to California surfing, though, may not be the surfers. It just might be the waves.

Global climate change is threatening many of the best surfing spots worldwide, as the Earth heats up and storms change. Monterey Bay in California has been a famous surfing area for a long time. The forecast for the future is not clear, but it does not look good.

"It definitely worries me," big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt said. He has already noticed changes in water temperature and weather patterns during the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.

## Climate Calculations

A wave that a surfer rides is usually created far out in the ocean. Storms far from shore send swells, or sets of waves, toward the California coast. By the year 2100, these storms could shift. The swells might move parallel to the coast instead of toward it.

Different swells and higher sea levels could wipe out many of today's favorite surfing spots.

To make these predictions, scientists made global climate models, using computers and calculations. The scientists look at past conditions, current trends and expected greenhouse gas levels in the future, caused by burning gas, oil and coal.

Scientists recently used the models to study how a warmer world might affect waves, said Li Erikson, a coastal engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey in Santa Cruz.

The results surprised both scientists and surfers. Both groups assumed a warmer and stormier future might push more waves toward the coast.

"I thought so, too," Erikson said with a laugh. She said there might be more storms, but storms over land may not create higher waves along the coast.

## Rising Sea Levels Not Good For Surfing

Good surfing conditions, such as large, well-shaped waves, depend on many different things. Swells form in the deep ocean, and as they get closer to the coast they are affected by local winds and storms. The swells must be sent in just the right direction to create perfect waves. Climate change may upset this balance.

"We'll roll with it," said Pete Ogilvie, a Monterey Bay surfer for more than 30 years. He is facing the possible changes with a laid-back Surf City vibe.

Climate change may affect waves in several ways. A warmer ocean will melt polar ice caps. Sea levels along the Northern California coast could rise between 1 1/2 and 6 feet by the end of the century. Higher sea levels will change how waves break along the coast.

As sea levels rise, waves will not break "in the same spots that they used to," said Curt Storlazzi, a geologist and oceanographer with the USGS in Santa Cruz. "They're going to break much closer to shore."

## Surfers On The Lookout

John Dee has been surfing in and around the bay for 20 years. He is concerned about losing the area's low-tide surf spots — where the waves are best when water levels are low.

"If there's a 3-foot tide, everyone's out here," he said recently as he headed out to surf. "If there's a 5-foot tide, nobody's out here."

Climate models do predict larger storms and bigger waves in the oceans. But that may not benefit California's surfers. The North Pacific Swell, which creates many surfing waves today, is expected to shift.

"As the temperature rises, especially in the Arctic, the big winter storms are moving farther north," Storlazzi said. So, areas along California could see fewer waves.

## Move The Surfboard To A New Spot

There is also an unpredictable weather pattern that could change wave patterns. It's called El Niño.

El Niño brings warm and high waters to the Pacific coast. Those conditions create strong storms that drive waves and winds directly into California's coast. That could improve surf conditions around Monterey Bay, at least for awhile.

"(The El Niño waves) hammer the shoreline," Storlazzi said. "They're the biggest and best waves."

Monterey Bay could end the 21st century with poor surfing waves if the predictions are correct. Still, the changing climate and rising seas could create better surfing conditions in other places along the California coastline. It is impossible to say where.

The uncertain future may leave some surfers looking for answers. But others are taking a different view.

"When waves die in one spot and pick up in another, you move to that spot," Ogilvie said.
