PARIS â€“ Wednesday is no longer a day off from school in France. It used to be a break in the middle of the week. Now French children have to show up for class Monday through Friday.

Parents like Eric and Isabelle Nizard are angry. Their 9-year-old son, Sacha must now go to class on Wednesdays. It's the latest change in French public education.

The Nizards complain that Sacha feels lost. Their Tuesday evenings have been ruined. The family used to go out to dinner or watch TV. They wouldn't worry about class the next morning. Sacha's guitar lessons used to be on Wednesdays. Now they are during his Friday lunch period.

"We weren't asked for our opinion," said Isabelle, 41. She says it was forced on them. "They changed the course of our life without asking us for our opinion!"

## Ending Long School Days

The new school week has sparked protests from teachers. Parents sent letters. President Francois Hollande is having a hard time defending it. His government is unpopular.

Officials say the change was made to fix a serious problem. The French school year is short. Since students had Wednesdays off, schools were forced to pack more hours into each school day.

Fewer school days mean much longer ones. Children as young as 6 stay in class late in the afternoon. They leave when it's dark out and parents get off work.

Adding Wednesday is supposed to make it easier. French students' falling scores are becoming a real worry. About a quarter of the country's elementary schools have already changed their calendars. The rest are expected to do so next year.

France created its school system in the 1800s. The government gave one day a week to the Catholic Church. The Church taught bible classes on Wednesdays. But in 2008, the president of France decided that a four-day school week was enough.

## Moms And Dads Feel Cheated

Vincent Peillon is France's education minister. He says he feels good about the change. He thinks it is clearly in the best interest of the nation's young. But parents claim the shift has been made poorly. Even those who admit that the old system had problems say so.

In Paris, parents are mad. Now the city's new school week is mixed up. No two days in a row end at the same time.

And moms and dads feel cheated. Many have arranged their workweeks to spend Wednesdays with their kids.

Some children do attend church school. But parents today are mostly non-religious. They have found Wednesdays useful. That's when they have their kids' music lessons, sports practice and other non-school activities. These don't get much attention in the French education system.

## Protests Planned For Next Week

Isabelle helped put together a letter with people in her rich neighborhood. They demanded that the mayor of Paris stop the new school week. It hasn't succeeded.

But she also leads a parents group. It is asking members to pull their kids out of school next Wednesday in protest. Others across France are doing the same. Teachers and other school workers have called for a national strike. That is when people stay home from work to protest something.

Officials are looking at many ways to fix education. France's quality of education has been falling compared with other countries. They are trying to stop that. Changing the school calendar is just one way.

Almost half of French students have had to repeat a grade by age 15. That's three times the average of most rich countries. Nearly a quarter drop out.
