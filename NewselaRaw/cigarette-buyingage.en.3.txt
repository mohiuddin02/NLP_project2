CHICAGO, Ill. — Smoking is bad for a person's health. A new research study says there may be a way to help teenagers quit the smoking habit.

Right now, people who are 18 years old can buy cigarettes. The study found that teenagers might stop smoking if they have to ask someone who is at least 21 years old to buy cigarettes for them. Better yet, they may never start smoking.

Scientists in Washington, D.C., conducted the study. Many people noticed the results. One of them was Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Last week, he announced a new plan for his city. The plan would make it illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to buy cigarettes. 

Many people start smoking when they are teenagers. They can become addicted to cigarettes, and it is hard for them to stop. The new law would make it more difficult to start smoking in the first place.

## Riding The Wave Of Change

Experts say the idea is getting more popular around the country. More than 100 cities have already raised the age for buying cigarettes. 

When it comes to buying cigarettes, cities can change their laws and so can states. The national government cannot change the law for the whole country. 

Most states allow people who are 18 years old to buy cigarettes. The study caused many people to think about smoking in a different way.  

## States And Smoking Laws

The scientists who conducted the study made a prediction. They said if all states changed their laws, the number of teenagers who smoke would go down. 

Some young smokers in Chicago were recently asked about the idea. They were found puffing on cigarettes at a university.  

One 19-year-old said she began smoking last fall. She said she might stop smoking if she had to ask someone who was 21 to buy cigarettes for her. 

"I wouldn't go out of my way to get people (21 and over) to buy them for me," she said. 

The woman did not give her name. She did not want her parents to know she smokes. 

Joseph Saye is 22 years old. He has smoked since he was 19\. He did not think a new law would make much difference. He said younger smokers would still find a way to buy cigarettes. 

## Hawaii Is Only State To Set 21 As Legal Smoking Age

Lila Johnson disagrees. She works at the Hawaii Department of Health. It is part of the state government, and it works to keep people healthy. She said the study was important to government leaders in Hawaii. The study helped persuade them to change the law. In Hawaii, you now have to be 21 years old to buy cigarettes. Hawaii is the only state in the country that has this law. 

"We don't see the negative side effects because it's going to protect young people," Johnson said. "We hope to be able to show the difference that it makes."

The mayor of Chicago wants to do other things to make smoking more difficult. One is to make cigarettes more expensive. 

The national government asked people how they feel about young people and smoking. They conducted a survey that asked many people. The survey asked if people should be 18 or 21 to be able to buy cigarettes. Most people said 21\. Even smokers said people should be 21 years old.
