WASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama said the U.S. will do everything it can to help find nearly [300 Nigerian girls](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian schoolgirls).

The girls were kidnapped from their school three weeks ago by a terror group. They need to be found quickly. Otherwise, they could be sold into slavery by the people who captured them.

Obama said a team of U.S. experts will be sent to the African country immediately.

Finding the girls is most important, Obama said. But the extremist group, Boko Haram, must also be stopped.

## 300 Girls Kidnapped From School

"In the short term our goal is obviously is to help the international community, and the Nigerian government, as a team to do everything we can to recover these young ladies," Obama said. He spoke in an interview with NBC's "Today" show. They were some of his first public comments about the kidnapping. He called it a "terrible situation."

"But we're also going to have to deal with the broader problem of organizations like this" that can cause such chaos in people's day-to-day lives, Obama said.

The kidnapping has sparked anger around the world. Nigeria is being pressured to find and free the girls before they can be sold or hurt.

On April 15, more than 300 girls were taken by force from their high school in the country's remote northeastern area. A total of 276 remain missing. Another 53 girls managed to escape.

Obama said he was glad Nigeria has accepted help from the U.S.

"Obviously, what's happening is awful," Obama said. "And, as a father of two girls, I can't imagine what their parents are going through." Obama's daughter's, Malia and Natasha, are 15 and 13.

## U.S. Won't Send Military

Obama said the U.S. has tried to work with Nigeria to stop Boko Haram. Boko Haram is an Islamist extremist group that forbids anything Western. This includes voting in elections and a Western education. The group says girls shouldn't go to school at all. Boko Haram means "Western education is sinful."

Obama called Boko Haram one of the worst local terrorist groups. He said they've been killing people without mercy for many years now. The U.S. has tried to join forces with Nigeria before now to stop Boko Haram.

The Nigeria government has been unable to rescue the girls. And that may be what will get the world to finally stop "this horrendous organization," Obama said.

The U.S. will soon be sending experts to Nigeria. The experts specialize in investigating crimes, negotiating, and gathering and sharing information. The U.S. will also send officials who specialize in helping victims, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

The military won't be sent, Carney noted.

Obama made his comments during a series of television interviews in the White House Rose Garden. He spoke after some government officials urged the girls' safe and immediate release. Some lawmakers also stood silently for a moment on the Capitol steps in honor of the girls. Dozens of people also protested outside the Nigerian Embassy in Washington.

All 20 female senators urged Obama in a letter to severely punish Boko Haram. A smaller group of senators urged the Nigerian president to deal with the problems in his country.

## "Know-How And Expertise"

Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. had been in touch with Nigeria "from day one" of the crisis. But repeated offers of U.S. assistance were ignored. Concern and outrage over the kidnapping has only grown greater. So, on Tuesday, Kerry got on the phone with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.

Kerry said Nigeria now realizes that it needs to do more than it's been doing.

Boko Haram's threat to sell the girls has "convinced everybody that there needs to be a greater effort," Kerry said. "And it will begin immediately. I mean, literally, immediately."

A statement from Jonathan's office said the U.S. will send experts to work with Nigeria to find the girls and rescue them. The statement added that Nigeria's security forces are doing their best to find the girls. It said Nigeria welcomes the addition of American "know-how and expertise."

Islamist extremist Abubakar Shekau is the leader of Boko Haram. He said Boko Haram kidnapped the girls and would sell them. Shekau also warned that Boko Haram will attack more schools and take away more girls.

The U.S. government warned U.S. citizens against traveling to Nigeria.
