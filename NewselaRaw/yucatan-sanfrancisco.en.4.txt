OXKUTZCAB, Mexico â€” You might notice some odd things in this town in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. There is a lot of Asian food on restaurant menus. There are some new, large houses.

In fact, there is a little bit of San Francisco in Oxkutzcab (pronounced OHSH-kootz-CAHB).

Many men from this town had gone north to the United States. Many have returned, bringing new skills, attitudes and money with them.

Some returned by choice. Others were deported, arrested and sent home by the police.

## Good, And Bad, Changes

The people in this town are mostly Mayan. Their town has seen many changes, good and bad.

Some people have more money. Men are more willing to do housework. There is a little more tolerance of gay people.

But there are bad effects, too. Many families are in debt. There is more crime and drug use. Families are separated for years. Many migrants, those who traveled to the U.S., were injured on the trip and must use canes or wheelchairs.

"The place has changed, some for the better, some for the worse," said Gilmer Ruiz. He is a 35-year-old butcher. He spent 10 years working in kitchens in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ruiz walks with a cane. He broke his leg trying to cross the U.S. border.

Most Oxkutzcab migrants moving to San Francisco start out as dishwashers. Sometimes they learn to be chefs. When they return, they have skills that are not useful in this town.

## Talented Chef Now Cattleman

Roger Burgos, 36, learned to cook at an Italian restaurant in San Francisco. He had other restaurant jobs too. He is a talented chef. But people in the town don't want to buy the food he cooks. They can't afford it or don't like it.

Today, he buys and sells cattle. He barely makes enough money to survive.

Some changes here are not visible on the surface.

"Before, a man would never pick up a broom and sweep the house," said Ruiz. Living in the U.S. alone, men had to do their own housework. They got used to it.

The cost of sending a migrant from Oxkutzcab to the United States is huge for families here. It averages about $6,000.

Families must borrow money to pay for the journeys. Many migrants are caught and sent back. They often try again. That means raising the money again.

## Taking The Risk

Some families use their houses to borrow money. If they can't pay the money back, they may lose their house.

"This is how families fall apart," said Nestor Vazquez Baeza, a dentist.

It is bad to be broke, but it is much worse to be in debt, said Edgar Palomo, a lawyer here.

Despite the high risks of traveling without papers to the United States, many want to take the gamble.

Manuel Uc is 31. He has been deported from the U.S. three times. He is covered in tattoos and founded a gang here in Oxkutzcab. But he isn't interested in gang life anymore. He wants to return to San Francisco. He learned to cook Peruvian food there.

"Things I learned in the United States, I'm not able to use here," he said.
