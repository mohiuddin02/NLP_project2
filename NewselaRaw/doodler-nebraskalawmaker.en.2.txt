Being a lawmaker can be a demanding job. Being an artist can be just as tough. But one senator in Nebraska has figured out how to do both at same time, becoming a famous sketch-artist politician. Senator Ernie Chambers is the state's longest-serving lawmaker and is also known for his popular sketches. His office at the state Capitol is full of dozens of drawing notepads that display his work.

Senator Chambers points to pencil sketches of a man, a pig and a hairy cyclops. There is a box of framed portraits, too. Chambers has been a state politician for nearly 40 years. During his career, he has been quietly drawing, slowly improving on the art skills he learned as a child.  He draws a little bit of everything and everyone, from other politicians to famous celebrities.

"I watch the pencil and things just flow out of it â€” words that rhyme and pictures that shade themselves," Chambers, who is 77 years old, said. "Sometimes, I'm not even concentrating on making a picture. I'm just putting lines on a sheet of paper."

## Doodles During Work

Chambers was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and served 38 years as a state politician. He took a short break and was elected back into office. He has a reputation for being the "Defender of the Downtrodden" and stands up for people and issues that other people may ignore. He supports many liberal causes. Chambers has repeatedly tried to end the death penalty and tries to prevent laws he does not agree with. Chambers also stands out for dressing differently than other lawmakers. While most politicians wear suits and ties, Chambers shows up to work in sweatshirts and jeans.

Chambers said he doodles during work to pass the time, especially when the days get long and boring. In the first 45 days of this year's session, he scrawled more than 60 images on sheets of paper the size of a hotel notepad.

He writes captions under his drawings that often do not make sense. Beneath his cyclops, Chambers wrote: "Man, oh, man. I can't wait for evolution to kick in! Things can only get better!!!"

Chambers is inspired by his daily work, too, and gets ideas for drawings by the people he sees speaking during meetings.

Chambers tends to draw in meetings when the side he agrees with is presenting, according to Senator Adam Morfeld, another Nebraska state senator. When people are speaking who Chambers does not support, he stops drawing and then asks the presenter questions.

Morfeld said he was amazed by the quality of the art. He said that Chambers will sometimes combine the drawings with poetry and share them with lawmakers. "I've thought about asking him for one or two," Morfeld said. "I call them Ernie-grams."

## Always Drawing, Always Listening

Senator Bob Krist of Omaha noticed Chambers pencil-sketching a human eye earlier this year. Krist was struck by the depth of the art, so he asked Chambers for a copy to share with his wife, who is an oil painter.

"He's a great multitasker," Krist said. "He sits there and draws, but he's always listening to every word of the arguments."

Chambers started drawing in art classes in high school and continued with the hobby while he was in law school. A law professor noticed his work on a piece of poster board and suggested Chambers consider a career as an artist. Chambers felt that the professor was trying to convince him to drop out of law school.

Chambers' collection of art is diverse, featuring portraits of John F. Kennedy and his wife, and a smiling young mother with her infant son. His 2001 drawing of Elvis Presley was so detailed that a colleague framed it and hung it in her office.

Despite the praise he receives for his talents, Chambers insists he's not an artist but a "drawer," because he lacks formal training.

"What I do is like Burger King: Have it your way," he said. "If some people see it as good art, that's what it is. If people see it as bad art, that's what it is."
