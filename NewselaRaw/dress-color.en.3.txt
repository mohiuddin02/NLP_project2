PITTSBURGH â€” People are still arguing over the color of a dress in a photo online. Scientists say it is because of how our brains work with our eyes to help us see.

It started when a woman posted a photo of a dress online. She asked for help to find out if the dress was white and gold, or blue and black. The dress is really blue and black.

Debates broke out all over the world, and websites declared that the Internet was freaking out over the question. It was like choosing between different flavors, or hot or cold. Each person thought their answer was obvious.

## "I'm Right." "No, I'M Right!"

Kiel Conjack thought his wife was pranking him when she said she saw blue and black. They got into an argument until his wife turned to the Internet and found a photo that proved the dress's true color. That made him wonder if he was losing his mind.

Jeff Brown had the opposite experience with his fiancee. She believed the dress to be white and gold, while he argued that it was blue and black. It "felt good" to be proved right in the end, he said.

## Let's Ask Science

Everyone can relax. Science has come to the rescue. Scientists explained that different people saw different colors because of the way the brain deals with what the eye sees. Matthew A. Smith, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said we think our eyes just take a photo and post it in the brain. That is not true.

The brain takes the information that comes in through our eyes and tries to figure out what's going on, Smith said. "We don't take a perfect photo. We have limited information." Smith said that he sees the dress as blue and black.

When the brain does not have enough information, it makes guesses. The dress took up most of the photo. There was no room in the picture for more information to help the brain. That meant more guesses, and guesses can go either way, Smith said.

## Our Tricky Brains

Doctor John J. Guehl III described the photo as a kind of optical illusion. The brain figures what is important in a picture, he said. Then it cuts out the rest. Our hearing works the same way. A mother will tune out noise, but she will hear her baby make a sound, Guehl said.

The brains of some people might pay less attention to the blue light. That makes the person see the dress as gold and white. If the brain ignores the white or yellow light, he or she will see a blue and black dress.

People in Pittsburgh could be seeing the dress differently because of their experiences, Guehl said. Everyone there sees the dress as black and gold, the colors of the local sports teams, he laughed. "Everyone else is all wrong. It's clearly black and gold."
