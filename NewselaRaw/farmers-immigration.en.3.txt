WASHINGTON â€” The fruits and vegetables you find in your neighborhood grocery store today are just as likely to be picked in Mexico and Brazil as in California and Florida.

But even more produce could come from outside the United States, farmers warn. That's if Congress fails to pass an immigration law to make sure there are enough workers to bring in the crops and milk the cows.

"The bottom line is people need to decide whether they'd rather import their labor or import their food," said Randall Patterson, a North Carolina fruit farmer.

## Rotting In Fields

Patterson legally employs about 140 foreign-born workers. He hires them legally and uses a system similar to the one a group of senators wants to make better.

But crops are being left to rot in fields across the country because farmers cannot find enough workers. Many workers have been arrested and sent back home. Others do not show up to work. They are afraid the same thing will happen to them.

About seven of every 10 farm workers are thought to be working here illegally. Many Republicans and Democrats think that the farm industry is hurt by a broken immigration system. The system decides who can come work in the country.

## Senate Plan

A plan in the Senate would create a way for people living in the United States illegally to become citizens. That number of people is about 11 million. Farm workers could become "legal" quicker.

They would get special legal rights. Farm workers could also ask to live here for good after five years. They could even become U.S. citizens. But some people say that farm jobs should be held by Americans. The jobs should not go to people who broke the country's immigration laws.

One of the opponents of the Senate plan is Jeff Sessions. He is a Republican from Alabama. He thinks Americans will do farm work.

"I worked construction in the Alabama sun, hauling lumber and stuff. I know Americans do that every single day, tough work," he said.

But there are few U.S.-born farm workers.

## Foreign Workers Needed

Charles Conner, president of a farm trade group, said the country couldn't keep growing as much food as it does without foreign-born workers.

"If that labor was not available to us," Conner said, "... it would mean that we would get that food from somewhere else."

He said 80,000 acres worth of fresh fruits and vegetables that had been grown in California are now grown outside the United States because of labor shortages. That number came from a 2008 study. Meanwhile, Americans want to know more about the food they eat. They also want it to be locally grown.

A new study found that just 268 U.S.-born people in North Carolina applied for farm jobs. There are nearly 500,000 people without jobs in the state.

More than 90 of every 100 who asked were hired. But not many showed up for the first day of work. Only a handful finished the growing season.

## Caps On Workers

Plans in Congress have caps on the number of guest workers. The caps are limits. Once the cap is hit, no more workers could come in.

The secretary of agriculture could raise or lower the cap. The decision would be based on how much food is needed. But some growers like Patterson worry that there is a cap at all. "How do they know after writing all that reform how many workers I'm going to need at my farm?" he asked. "Einstein couldn't figure that out."

Patterson is a member of a group that uses a guest worker plan. Lee Wicker is the group's assistant director. He estimates that his members employ about 7,500 workers under the program.

But he doesn't like the idea of caps either. If the illegal workforce really is blocked, that could be a problem. Wicker worries the caps do not supply enough workers.

North Carolina's growing season runs later than in California and more southern parts of the country. Wicker worries that his farmers could be left out if the caps are reached before the Carolina growing season gets going. They might not have anyone to bring in the crops.
