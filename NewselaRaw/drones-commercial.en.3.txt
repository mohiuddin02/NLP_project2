Film directors, sports teams, farmers, oil companies and many other businesses are hoping the government will allow them to use a high-flying technology: drones.

Drones are small airplanes or helicopters that are flown by remote control, without a pilot. They are often used in situations that would be too dangerous for a plane with a pilot.

The U.S. military has been using drones for years to drop bombs on targets overseas. Now, many different kinds of companies hope to experiment with drones.

Drones could be used for almost anything in the future, said drone expert Rachel Stohl.

## Show Me A License

Today, almost no companies are using drones. The U.S. government hasn't allowed them to. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the government group that controls flying in the U.S., including airplanes, helicopters and airports.

So far, the FAA has mainly allowed police and research groups to use drones. It hasn't given out many permits to businesses that want to use the unmanned aircraft.

The FAA is working on a plan to deal with drones. Right now, drones are not allowed in U.S. airspace. Because of this rule, drones cannot fly too high or go into certain areas. The FAA's plan is supposed to be finished by 2015, but it may take longer, a government official said.

Drones are a challenge for the FAA. Traditional aircraft — airplanes and helicopters — come in standard shapes and sizes. They are used for common jobs. Drones can come in any shape and size. They can also be used for almost anything.

"[The FAA] is having a really hard time understanding the technology," said Mary Louise Cummings, who teaches at Duke University.

## Smaller And Cheaper

Drones can solve problems for many different types of companies. Drones are often smaller and cheaper than traditional aircraft. They can go into areas that are too dangerous for people.

Difficult terrain, such as mountains or desert, are a good place to use drones, Stohl said. They are also useful when conditions on the ground are dangerous, such as during a riot or a volcano   eruption. Drones could also be used to rescue people or fight fires, Cummings said.

Many industries need high-quality photos taken from the air, Cummings said. Some of the industries include farming, entertainment, mapmaking, mining and wildlife conservation. Drones could fly above bridges and into tunnels to check on safety issues.

"Anywhere where you think you need to see something from high up, it's going to be not only cheaper but safer," Cummings said.

## Send In The Drones!

Some businesses have begun using drones and many more are considering it.

Insurance companies in particular have a need for drones. When disasters hit like earthquakes or floods, people can lose their homes or cars.

In order to begin rebuilding, people need payments from insurance companies. These companies help people recover from disasters. To get the payments, insurance workers must look at the damage. Sometimes, after an earthquake or flood, the area can be too dangerous for the workers.

Drones would allow the insurance workers to get information without putting themselves in danger.

Insurance is not the only type of business that wants drones. Movie companies want to use the remotely operated planes to film scenes from the sky. Large oil companies want to use drones to search for oil off the coast of Alaska. Golfers want to use drones to film golf events. The Washington Nationals baseball team used a small helicopter-like drone to take pictures of the team.

Even college football players have been using drones in practice. Clemson University uses one to film football practices, which can help the players improve.
