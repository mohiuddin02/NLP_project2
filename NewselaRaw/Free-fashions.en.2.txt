FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Lynda Walsh wants kids to look fashionable no matter how little money they have.

To provide kids with clothing of all sizes, Walsh recently opened the Cool Clothes Closet of South Palm Beach County in Florida. Kids can shop at the nonprofit boutique for free. They don't have to worry about how much money is in their wallet.

Walsh provides clothes at the boutique, as well as matching accessories — like purses and shoes.

The 69-year-old retiree's main goal is to provide both everyday and professional clothing at no cost. She helps kids in foster care, kids getting their first jobs and children of returning veterans. Many veterans have not found work yet and their families do not always have enough money to buy new clothes.

"We are here to give clothes away to kids who need them," Walsh said.

## It Was A Good Idea

Walsh is a court-appointed advocate for children from Delray Beach, Florida. An advocate watches out for the rights and interests of kids in the foster care system, especially when they go to court. Children who cannot live with their families or who do not have families stay with foster parents until they find permanent homes.

The Closet is set up like a store. There are clothes hanging on racks and folded in dressers for both males and females. The clothes range in sizes from extra small to triple extra large.

Walsh got the idea started in 2012, when she became a legal guardian for children in the foster care system.

## Lots Of People Donate Clothes And Their Time

Walsh isn't a stranger to working with kids in tough situations. Before she moved to Florida in 2000, she worked in Chicago as a court reporter in the youth court system.

In West Palm Beach, she saw how poorly dressed the kids were when they showed up to court.

"I saw teens coming to court in dirty, ragged clothes," she said.

The courthouse does have a closet of clothes for kids to change into when they appear in court. Walsh wanted to help them outside of court, as well.

Walsh asked friends and family to donate clothes and help organize the space. She said her 93-year-old mother helps wash and iron donated clothes.

Since no outfit would be complete without the right accessories, there are also shoes, purses and hats available.

The Clothes Closet opened its doors about four months ago. Its young customers hear about it through word-of-mouth. The handful of children who have been helped so far have been grateful, Walsh said.

"Everybody has found something," she said. "Nobody has gone empty-handed."

## Fancy Bags Too

Roberta Mizrahi, who volunteers at the boutique, said the kids are often shy about trying on the clothes. They perk up with excitement when they try on something they like.

"I think it's wonderful," she said.

There is no limit on how little or how much kids can take. Walsh said the average is about two shopping bags per person. To get the full boutique experience, Walsh had fancy custom shopping bags made.

"I didn't want people walking out of here" with grocery bags, she said.

Now she is working on finding shoppers. The store is not open during regular business hours — 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — since that is when kids are in school. Instead, Walsh schedules personal appointments for each child on weekends or after school.

## Making Sure Everyone Knows

Walsh said she has a special place in her heart for the older kids, who are beginning to start their lives as adults. She makes sure the Closet is stocked with appropriate clothing for job interviews.

"I can remember being their age," she said.

Walsh spends time letting people know about the store. She reaches out to local schools, churches and after-school care programs.

"We need to connect with children and let them know we are here," she said.
