TOKYO, Japan — Toyota Motor Corp. wants to make robots to help older people. These robots can drive a car. They can also pick up after people and open curtains.

The Japanese car company wants to become important in this new area. Toyota calls it "partner robots." Toyota has only 150 robotics engineers, who design robots. To compare, about 300,000 people work for the company around the world. Toyota is putting money into developing new robots.

Last month, Toyota announced it bought part of a company to develop robots. It spent $1 billion. Toyota is already working with Stanford University in California and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on robotics.

Akifumi Tamaoki is in charge of Toyota's partner robot division. He said that in the future people may not be able to drive their own cars or may need help. Toyota thinks many people could use a partner robot to help them.

## Business Important In Japan

Japanese people may especially need them. Japan's population is getting older faster than in many other countries. The government is counting on the robotics business to grow. Other companies have jumped in. One of them is the Internet company Softbank Corp. It sells a robot that can have simple conversations.

Tamaoki said Toyota has been interested in robotics for many years. Toyota uses robots to make cars. Now, it thinks robotics can be a successful business. 

Some of that comes from the the auto and tech industries. They are developing cars that can drive by themselves. Google Inc. is testing driverless vehicles. Also, the Japanese car company Nissan Motor Co. plans to start selling them by 2020.

Honda Motor Co. was a leader in robots. It built its Asimo walking and talking robot, which is shaped like a child. Some said that Honda tried too hard to copy human movements. It did not spend enough time trying to make the robot useful.

## Robot Not For Sale Yet

Toyota showed off a one-armed partner robot on wheels earlier this year. It is called the HSR, or Human Support Robot. The HSR looks a bit like R2D2, the robot from "Star Wars." It can pick up after people, bring an item to someone in bed or open curtains.

The robot is not yet for sale. Toyota is working with 10 universities in Japan to figure out how the robot can be useful to people, Tamaoki said.

Tamaoki thinks many people will begin using robots like HSR. It may take another 10 years before that happens, though.

Toyota is planning on adding another arm to HSR. The second arm will let it do more complicated tasks. It also will be able to talk.

One group has suggested using it for taking care of pets. It could jiggle a toy for a lonely cat, Toyota said.
