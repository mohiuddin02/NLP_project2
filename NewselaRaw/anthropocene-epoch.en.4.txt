The Earth has been around for a very long time. Over its history, it has changed a lot. The land was once covered in ice. Before that, dinosaurs roamed the planet.

Scientists learn about the history of the Earth by studying the land. There are clues in the rocks and dirt. That is how we know about Earth's history.

## Earth's Many Stages Of Change

Scientists have divided the history of the Earth into stages. They have given each one a name. We are currently in a stage called the Holocene epoch. It began about 11,750 years ago. Before that, the planet was covered in ice. When the ice melted, the planet changed in big ways. The changes were so huge that the Earth went into a new stage of its history.

Now the Earth is changing again, and some scientists think it is going into another stage in its history. They call the new one the Anthropocene epoch.

## Scientists Say Humans Are To Blame

Jan Zalasiewicz is a scientist who studies the Earth's history. He and a group of other scientists just published a new report. It explains that the planet is not just becoming different on its own. This time, people are changing the planet.

Some of the changes are on purpose. People have altered the shape of the land for years. We have made farms and built cities. Other changes are by accident. For example, cars and machines are slowly making the planet warmer. This is called global warming.

Because of these changes, Zalasiewicz thinks the Earth is now in a new stage in its history.

## Still More To Discover

Key questions remain. If the Earth is in a new stage, when did it begin? It could have started when ancient people began farming. Or perhaps it began in the last few hundred years, when technology took huge steps forward. 

But not everyone agrees that the Earth is in a new stage. Some scientists do not think that the planet has changed in big enough ways. Others believe that it is just too soon to say.
