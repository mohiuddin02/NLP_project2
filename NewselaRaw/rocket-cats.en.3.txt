Pictures from more than 475 years ago have people talking. The pictures show cats and birds with what look like modern-day weapons strapped to their backs.

The unusual pictures were from a manual on weapons and war published around the year 1530. Below each picture is an explanation of what the drawings are about. The text is written in German.

It's about how army commanders could use the animals in times of war. The animals could help them set fire to an enemy castle or city.

Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania scanned the drawings, some in full color, into computers. By making the pictures digital, more people will be able to look at them.

## Cat And Bird Bombers

Mitch Fraas works at the University of Pennsylvania. He said that he initially "really didn't know what to make of it." He said that he thought it looked like a "jet of fire" coming out of the gear strapped to the animals' backs.

Fraas decided to try and solve the mystery. Were these unfortunate animals from the 1500s really wearing modern technology?

Fraas says no, of course not.

A weapons master named Franz Helm wrote the manual. He was believed to have fought in several battles against the Turks â€“ a powerful people in Europe and the Middle East. The Turks were part of the Ottoman Empire.

At that time, gunpowder was changing the way wars were fought. Gunpowder is a material that can explode.

Helm's manual was shown to many people back then, and several artists helped to illustrate it.

## "Really A Terrible Idea"

The manual shows birds and cats that have been turned into weapons.

Fraas says that Helm explained how animals could be used to fight enemies. The manual says to find and steal an animal from the enemy's town or castle. Helm then says to put something on the back of the animal that will start a large fire.

Helm thought that the animal would run back to its home after the explosive was placed on its back. Once home, the gear on the animal's back would start a raging fire.

But Fraas said he could not find any proof that animals living 4,500 years ago were used to cause such harm.

It's a good thing, too, because Fraas says it's "really a terrible idea."

He said it's "very unlikely the animals would run back to where they came from."

Instead, they would probably stay put. That would mean that a fire would start in exactly the wrong place.
