LEEDS, Utah — This small town along Interstate 15 is just a blur for most drivers zooming through. Leeds features views of southern Utah's gleaming red-rock hills, and not much else.

But for tourists, truckers, and others on the highway, Leeds is a gateway to bigger thrills on the road. Heading north from Leeds, the speed limit shifts from 75 to 80 miles per hour (mph) — all the way to Provo, 250 miles away.

For countless travelers, the suggestion is clear: push the pedal to the metal and give in to the need for speed while passing through this wavy desert terrain.

## I Can't Drive 55

In the 1970s, a shortage of gas and high gas prices led to the "Drive 55" movement, which slowed speed limits around the country. Today, gas prices have leveled off and cars have become far more fuel efficient. These changes have encouraged some drivers to zoom.

"I go 5 miles over the limit," said bartender Tony Bonny of St. George, Utah. "But as soon as I see that 80 sign, my foot gets just a little bit heavier."

Speed limits are rising all over the country, especially in wide-open Western states. The trend reflects the hurried lifestyles of a fast-paced nation. But many safety officials are scratching their heads over a trend they say will lead to more — and more gruesome — deaths on the roads.

One-third of all highway deaths each year are caused at least in part by excessive speed.

"The research is clear and consistent on the safety consequences of raising speed limits," said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit group that works to reduce car crashes.. "Higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster, but there's always a cost: Ultimately, there will be more severe crashes and more deaths on those roads. At the end of the day, it's simple physics."

## How High Can It Go?

Thirteen states have increased speed limits since 2005 — including Georgia, Illinois, Maine, New Hampshire, Kentucky and Ohio. Most of those states have set the highest limits at 70 or 75 mph.

But in the West, officials have taken things further. This year, Idaho and Wyoming raised their top speeds to 80 on some stretches of interstate.

Legislators in Montana are considering an 85 mph top speed to match areas in Texas as the fastest highways in the country.

A 5-mile-per-hour change may not seem like much — it only cuts two hours from a cross-country drive at 80 mph instead of 75. Still, state officials say they are not encouraging people to go faster — just changing the limits to reflect the speeds people already drive.

One highway safety expert blames the newest need for speed on "simple peer pressure."

"When your neighbor increases its speed to 80, there's pressure to do the same," said Kara Macek, spokeswoman for the Governors Highway Safety Association in Washington, D.C. "Motorists are giving in to the need to get everywhere quickly — especially out West, where it takes forever to get places."

## They're Driving Fast Anyway

Utah officials say that highway crashes have dropped on parts of rural Interstate 15 where they raised the speed limit to 80. A 2009 study also suggested that more drivers in Utah were following the new limit.

This month, Utah raised the speed limit from 65 to 70 mph on interstates around Salt Lake City, the state's capital. Highway officials say the higher speed limit makes the roads more predictable, hurrying up even slower drivers. "The idea is to provide consistency," said John Gleason, a spokesman for the Utah Department of Transportation. "We really don't think we're changing the speed that most people drive; we're changing the legal limit to reflect speeds they're already doing."

National safety experts have criticized raising limits on roads shared by pedestrians, bicyclists and public transportation. Officials applauded New York City's recent move to reduce the limit on city streets from 30 mph to 25 mph to reduce pedestrian deaths.

"About 10,000 Americans die every year in crashes that are related to speed, from going faster than the posted limit or faster than conditions allow," Rader said. "It's too many."

## High-Speed Crashes Are Not Pretty

Many are now enjoying the new freedoms offered by faster highway speeds.

"The 80 mph speed limit is symbolic of my individuality and freedom," editorial page editor Robert Ehlert wrote in the Idaho Statesman. "This is the West. This is the way we roll."

Outside Leeds, at a gas station popular with travelers, long-distance truck driver Jake Hansen stopped for coffee and a bathroom break. With the slightly higher speed limits, he was not in as much of a rush.

"It does make a difference — I can get ahead of schedule," said the 26-year-old Hansen, who was hauling a load of steel beams for an apartment building in Salt Lake City. "You get there faster; you unload faster."

The trucking industry as a whole, though, has cautioned against higher speeds. The American Trucking Association has called for a 65 mph national limit and "governors" on trucks — devices that limit how fast the trucks can go.

"Our guys are out there on the road every day," said Sean McNally, a spokesman for the Association. "We know speed increases risk and crash severity."

The Utah Highway Patrol has also spoken out against higher speeds.

"We're not in favor of raising the speed limits because we're out there on the road scenes of fatal accidents," Sergeant Todd Royce, a highway patrol spokesman, said. "We know what happens when you crash at those speeds."
