PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii â€” On Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor, an American military base in Hawaii. The attack killed around 2,400 people including sailors, Marines and soldiers.

About 1,177 of the people killed were on a battleship called the USS Arizona. The ship was bombed and sunk during the attack. The attack caused the United States to fight in World War II, which was already going mostly in Europe.

Now, four survivors who were on the USS Arizona have come together. Every year, on the day of the attack, they gather in Pearl Harbor. They come to mark the event, and to honor the many who died that day.

Today, only nine survivors of the bombing of the Arizona are still alive. The four who came to Hawaii on Tuesday are now all in their 90s. Still, they promised that this year's reunion would not be their last.

## Last Official Gathering

The four survivors gathered on Tuesday near the memorial that sits on top of the sunken Arizona. The event was the last official gathering of the USS Arizona Reunion Association. However, the men said they still plan to get together, even if they can't come to Hawaii.

"I don't think this is going to be our last. ... We've still got time to go," said survivor Louis Conter, who is 93. "We'll be back out here no matter whether the rest of the crowd can make it or not."

Donald Stratton, who is 92 years old, is another of the four survivors who came to Hawaii on Tuesday. He was in the front part of the ship when the Arizona was hit.

During the bombing, Stratton was working with a group of men, most of whom were killed. The men were gathered around a gun-director machine. Their job was to figure out the best firing angles for the ship's huge guns. Stratton and the others had sprung into action once it became clear Pearl Harbor was under attack.

Stratton survived the bombing, but he was badly hurt. More than half his body was burned. He was hospitalized for over a year, then released from the Navy. A year later, he rejoined the Navy.

## "Just A Few Of Us"

"The good Lord saved just a few of us," Stratton said.

During a private event Sunday, the four men will toast their shipmates. They will share a bottle of wine given to them by President Gerald Ford in 1975. Their glasses will be copies of ones used onboard the Arizona at the time.

The men arrived at the Pearl Harbor visitor center on Tuesday. They were met with military salutes, music from the Navy's Pacific Fleet Band and photo-taking tourists. The four discussed their memories of the attack.

"I learned something about faith," said John Anderson, who is 97. He remembers that he had just gone to church and was heading to breakfast when someone said he saw the planes coming. He became teary-eyed as he talked about his twin brother dying in the attack.

"It's always like yesterday when we're out here," Conter said.

## Their Shipmates Below

On Tuesday, the survivors also watched a live video. It showed divers swimming underwater alongside the Arizona's main body, or hull. The bodies of more than 900 men who died in 1941 are still there.

The ashes of 38 survivors who died years later are buried down in the hull as well. The men wanted to be buried next to their fellow sailors who were killed.

Survivor Lauren Bruner, 94, plans to have his ashes placed down in the hull. Conter does too.

Bruner spoke of his decision not to be buried in an ordinary military graveyard. The dead in such places are often quickly forgotten, he said.

"It seems like after a while nobody pays attention to them anymore, after about five years," he said. "I hope a lot of people will still be ... coming over to the Arizona and we'll be glad to see them."
