CHICAGO, Ill. â€” Parents hoping to avoid a long wait for a visit with Santa Claus at Woodfield Mall near Chicago can now reserve a spot in line ahead of time. But it will cost them.

To make an appointment to see Santa at the Minion-themed Ice Palace, which opened Nov. 5, the mall for the first time is requiring a $10 fee. The money can be put toward buying a set of pictures with Santa.

The new fee and elaborate home for Santa are part of a trend across the country to make holiday displays grander at shopping centers. The goal is to bring online shoppers back to malls.

## No Parent Paparazzi!

Holiday displays have become a big attraction, said Ruth Rosenquist, a spokeswoman for Noerr Programs. The company sends Santas and photographers to malls across the United States, including Woodfield. "They are full-scale Hollywood productions." she said.

Perhaps the biggest reason for the shift is the way the Internet has pulled shoppers away from malls. Retailers are trying many things to lure them back.

Santa, or St. Nick, is a physical symbol of the holidays that brings people into malls, Rosenquist said.

Malls in the Chicago area typically allow free visits with Santa but charge fees for photos and do not let parents take pictures, operators said. A spokesman for Simon Properties, which runs Woodfield, said kids still can see Santa for free if they walk up and wait in line. The advance charge is only if they want to reserve their place. The fee also helps to ensure that families keep their appointments with photographers.

## Not All Families Can Pay Santa Fees

Mary Jo Shepherd has brought her kids to Woodfield for years. She considers the advance fee "a new level of greed."

As a social worker, she said she sees families who cannot afford the photo fees. She considers Christmas exhibits at malls and stores to be a something malls give back to customers, and was appalled a few years ago when Woodfield stopped letting parents take their own pictures during Santa visits. "It just keeps getting worse and worse every year."

Shelly Kunets, a mom who was visiting Woodfield with her newborn, said she would not pay to see Santa.

"I think it's taking away from the spirit of why we see Santa," she said. "The magic is in meeting Santa. The rest is just extra."

But Matthew Caczewe, a father of two girls, said he understands why malls might have to charge for bigger exhibits.

"To get more, where does the money come from?" he asked.

## Holiday Symbol Or Marketing Tool?

As expensive as the Santa experience can get, it's not surprising that the holiday legend has evolved into a marketing symbol, said Robert Thompson. He teaches television and popular culture at Syracuse University.

Santa is the sign of the Christmas business, he said. "He represents the idea of a bag bursting with presents. On that level, it's hard to get really worked up, because he's always been tied up with moneymaking."

There are still choices for people who want a simple visit with Santa without the fees or reservations, according to none other than Santa himself. John Sullivan, who plays Santa at a variety of events, keeps a long list of free events on his website.

Most cities, villages, park districts and local business groups offer free visits with Santa and let parents take their own pictures, he said. He attended one such event on Chicago's South Side.

"It was very rewarding, because the kids were so happy to have a Santa there," he said. "The parents were delighted they didn't have to go to a mall and pay."

## The Over-The-Top Visit With St. Nick

Of all the local Christmas productions, perhaps the most elaborate was at Oakbrook Center, in Oak Brook, Illinois. It has teamed up with DreamWorks Animation to create "Adventure to Santa," a 20-minute movie that leads visitors on a journey to find Santa, with help from Shrek, Donkey and their friends. Participants attend a Sleigh Flight School and choose one of three obstacle courses.

One change to the attraction in its second year is that reservations require the purchase of a set of photos. The packages cost from $39.99 for parties of up to five, to $73.99 for parties of up to eight.

The show was such a hit last year that online reservations began in August this year, said Suzanne Beres. She works for General Growth Properties, which manages the mall.

But there is hope for those who wish for simpler times, said Rob Albertson of a company called Bandwith Marketing. Marketing experts have noticed that some people are not happy with the bigger, expensive Christmas displays, he said. Also, some retailers refuse to do things like charge for pictures with Santa.

"When things become too big or too grand or too monetized, there's a nice pendulum shift back," he said.
