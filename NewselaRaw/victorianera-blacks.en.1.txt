CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Some faces are thoughtful, while others are proud. Some are known, but others are not. All are black.

Rare, striking and never-before-seen portraits of black citizens in Victorian-era England are going on display for the first time in the U.S. Organizers say the photographs have a powerful message for modern-day Americans divided by racism.

"There's a healing aspect to seeing these exquisite images," said Vera Ingrid Grant, director of the Cooper Gallery of African &amp; African American Art. The show, "Black Chronicles II," opened in September and runs through December 11.

## Viewing Our Future Through Lens Of The Past

The photos alter our understanding of the past, she said, and in turn, that fresh understanding can "change how we view the present."

Researchers found the trove of glass plates wrapped in brown paper and tied with string in storage at London's Hulton Archive. Taken well over a century ago, they disprove the idea that Britons with African roots were all but invisible in 19th-century society.

Life-size black-and-white prints are mixed with small snapshots, some from privately owned collections. They show ordinary people and the somewhat well-known posing for portraits in their Sunday best. A few series of photos capture people playfully fooling around for the camera, just as today's wedding guests might goof around in a photo booth.

## Correcting Our Cultural Perceptions

Together, the pictures help write what Grant calls a "missing chapter." They show that blacks of the era not only were very present in daily public life but also prospered and enjoyed a certain dignity and social standing.

Many of the more than 100 photographs on display were taken for "cartes de visite," or calling cards — small, wildly popular postcards with a striking image and a bit of text. Much like a modern Facebook profile, they were designed to sum up the essential character of a person.

"How many of these stories were hidden in the attic and never saw the light of day? Look what was covered up," said Grant.

## Exhibit Covers Ordinary, Extraordinary Subjects Alike

The show features both ordinary and prominent citizens, from students and businessmen to artists, military men, missionaries and international royalty.

Among the better-known subjects are Sarah Forbes Bonetta, born in Sierra Leone and a goddaughter to Queen Victoria; Prince Alemayehu of Ethiopia, who was taken to Britain as a young boy after his father killed himself following defeat by the British; and heavyweight boxing champion Peter Jackson of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which belonged to Denmark at the time.

The collection of photos was originally put together by London art historian and photography expert Renée Mussai. According to her, the main goal of the exhibition is to resurrect forgotten black figures and to reintroduce them into modern-day consciousness.

## Heeding The Message And Its Healing

Grant believes the British photographs have something important to say to Americans battling a resurgence of racism, racial profiling and white-on-black police brutality.

She also hopes the show will inspire researchers to dig deeper into the role of blacks in U.S. photographic history.

"The full narrative of Africans in the world is an untold story," she said. Numerous photographic collections that record African-American life in the Unites States have yet to be closely examined, and could be rich with surprises. The British photos, she said, raise the question, "What's waiting for us here?"
