NEW YORK â€” Weather reporters were warning that a "crippling and potentially historic blizzard" was threatening the Northeast of the United States. The storm was expected to arrive on Monday. It could dump as much as 3 feet of snow.

The winter storm was named Juno.

On Sunday, people in cities and towns from Philadelphia to Boston were getting ready for the big storm. Many lined up at hardware and grocery stores to pick up emergency supplies.

The storm was moving along the East Coast. Tens of millions of Americans live in its path.

## Heavy Snow, Gusty Winds

The blizzard was expected to hit New Jersey, New York City, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts especially hard. It could shut down the nation's most crowded region for days. Schools and many businesses may be closed all week.

New Yorkers were getting ready Sunday evening. Many were rushing to buy food, water, batteries and snow shovels.

Nick Glenis manages the Westside Market, located in New York City's Morningside Heights neighborhood. The market was extremely crowded with people trying to prepare for the storm.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said city road crews were also preparing. The blizzard could turn out to be "one of the top two or three largest storms in the history of this city," he said.

Blizzard warnings went into effect Monday afternoon along the East Coast from New Jersey to Maine. Up to 4 inches of snow an hour could fall in some areas. Wind gusts would be fast, weather reporters said.

## Check On Your Neighbor

Governors and mayors across the region said people should stock up on supplies. They also asked that people check on elderly and disabled neighbors, who could be especially at risk.

Mayor de Blasio urged New Yorkers not to drive. He said people should use buses and trains instead.

"We need to prepare for something worse than we've seen before," de Blasio said. The city's record for a single storm is just over 26 inches of snow.

In Hoboken, New Jersey, officials were preparing for up to 30 inches of snow and heavy winds. The city will be opening warming centers and shelters. Stranded cars will be towed along emergency snow routes.

"We need to be prepared," Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy said. "Just as the state is monitoring and preparing, the public should do the same."

## "You Should Not Be Out"

Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said his city was already prepared. Workers were standing by with 700 pieces of snow-removal equipment.

"Our city has been through blizzards before," Walsh said. "I am confident we are prepared." The mayor asked Bostonians to help by removing snow and ice from sidewalks and curbs.

Back in New York City, people were told to use common sense. "Don't go outdoors if you don't have to" starting Monday evening, said Joseph Esposito, who runs the Office of Emergency Management. "You should not be out in this storm."

De Blasio said that city crews will have 6,000 miles of streets to clear. "Everything will be delayed," he said.

He added, "This could be a storm the likes of which we've never seen before. Be careful. Stay safe."
