The United States is about to spend billions of dollars to build a top-secret warplane. The new bomber could bring hundreds of jobs to the desert communities in Los Angeles County.

Two teams of airplane manufacturers are now battling to win what would be one of the most expensive contracts in Department of Defense history. The winner is expected to be chosen this spring. That decision has set off a debate over whether the new stealth bomber is necessary for national security or a huge waste of money.

"You're talking about a $2 billion airplane by the time they build it," said Thomas Christie. He worked as a top analyst inside the Department of Defense for more than three decades before retiring. "It's a disaster waiting to happen."

But last month, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said the new bomber was crucial. "I think the Long-Range Strike Bomber is absolutely essential to keep our deterrent edge."

## We Want Jobs

For elected officials across the country, however, the bomber contract means one thing: jobs. Lawmakers mainly want to know what their state will get out of the deal.

In few places can the lure of a new bomber be felt more deeply than Palmdale, California. Competing teams of airplane manufacturers have each told local officials they would perform a lot of the work in the area.

That means new jobs to help revive the local communities, which have built many of the country's airplanes. The towns are still struggling to recover jobs they lost in the recession, which began around 2008.

The two competing teams of airplane manufacturers are led by weapons giants Northrop Grumman and Boeing Company. Neither one can talk about it, said Palmdale Mayor James Ledford. "But we can." And the prospects look good for Palmdale.

According to Ledford, Northrop executives said they would build substantial parts of the bomber in Palmdale, creating about 1,500 jobs.

Lockheed Martin Corporation also plans to work on the warplane in Palmdale, Ledford said. That could mean 700 new jobs. Lockheed is working on the same team as Boeing,

"It would be the answer to all our prayers," said R. Rex Parris, mayor of neighboring Lancaster, California. The town has a 10.7 percent unemployment rate, far higher than the state average.

## It's Top Secret

The final decision over building the plane is in the hands of the U.S. Air Force. Officials say they need the bomber, which would be so secret it could evade the most advanced enemy radar.

Air Force officials have said the warplane would eventually be outfitted to carry nuclear weapons. They also want it to one day be flown remotely as a drone.

Other details are a closely guarded secret. The bomber program is part of the Defense Department's classified "black budget" for secret projects.

To stop criticism of the program's cost, military officials have vowed to limit the bomber's price to $550 million each. The Defense Department included $1.2 billion for the bomber in this year's budget. The Air Force plans to order as many as 100 of the new planes as soon as late spring.

Antelope Valley is located about 70 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. Its blue skies and open desert spaces make it a prime location for building and testing experimental military planes.

## What Budget?

In 1987, about 10 percent of the nation's aerospace jobs, nearly 200,000 workers, were in Palmdale and the rest of Los Angeles County. The country, as a whole, lost nearly 160,000 aerospace jobs between 1987 and 2011.

Boeing, Northrup and Lockheed have all previously won Defense Department contracts. The warplanes they built ended up costing far more than was planned.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Northrop developed the first B-2 stealth bomber, a black boomerang-shaped plane. The secrecy surrounding the project helped allow costs to soar. The contract was so far over budget that the Defense Department eventually decided to build just 21 of the 132 aircraft it had originally planned. The average cost of each was more than $2 billion.

Todd Harrison is an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. He estimated that the new stealth bomber program would ultimately cost $90 billion â€” or about $900 million for each plane.

The Air Force is already spending billions of dollars to update its current fleet of 150 bombers.

## Maybe Delay The Project

The Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly said the new bomber program could be cut. In 2013, it said that if the government delayed the project for 10 years, more advanced technology could be developed to improve its design.

New weapons developed in the next decade may even make the new bomber unnecessary, it said.

But the Defense Department says it needs to begin work now on the new bomber. In fact, for years, officials may have been secretly paying for it to be developed, analysts said.

Last year, congressional analyst Jeremiah Gertler said it seemed that the new bomber had already been built and was being tested.

Lancaster Mayor Parris said the bomber could create jobs throughout the area, including at restaurants, stores and manufacturing suppliers.

"It would be so great," he said, "to see it all come back."
