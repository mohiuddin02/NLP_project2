PARIS, France — Many Jewish men wear a skullcap, or a small hat, in public. They call it a kippa. It is a reminder that God is with them. Jews are not sure if it is safe to wear a kippa anymore.

Marseille is a city in France. Jews there have a hard choice to make. They have to decide whether to wear the kippa or to leave it at home and stay safe.

## Freedom To Wear What You Want

Jewish people, or Jews, follow Judaism. It is their religion.

The choice to wear a kippa is about freedom of religion. Wearing certain clothing lets others know a person's religion. Some people have been attacked for their religion. Wearing religious clothing can be dangerous. Especially in some parts of the world.

Haim Korsia is a Jewish leader in France. Korsia said that freedom of religion is an important part of France. People should be able to wear a kippa without being afraid.

There have been attacks against Jews in France. Israel is a Jewish country in the Middle East. Thousands of Jews from France have moved to Israel to feel safe.

## Wait For "Better Days"

The Islamic State is a group from the Middle East causing violence. It is also called ISIS. ISIS has attacked people in many countries and religions. 

A Muslim is a person who follows a religion called Islam. Some Muslims and Jews do not get along. Most Muslims do not like ISIS. 

Last week, a Jewish teacher was attacked in Marseille. A 15-year-old boy slashed him with a knife. The boy blamed the attack on ISIS. 

Jews are concerned for their safety. Zvi Ammar is a Jewish leader in Marseille. Ammar asked Jews not to wear the kippa "until better days." 

A kippa lets people know when someone is Jewish. Not wearing a kippa might keep Jews safe from some violence. 

Many French people did not like Ammar's announcement. 

Some other countries have told Jews the same thing. Some leaders in Israel and Germany say not to wear a kippa. These leaders want Jews to stay safe.

## Muslims Also Feel Unsafe

Religious clothing has put Muslims at risk, too. Some Muslim women wear headscarves. Covering themselves is an important part of being Muslim. 

A headscarf lets people know that they are Muslim, which can be unsafe. 

American Muslims have been threatened more lately. Some Americans have said hateful things about Muslims. There have been attacks on Muslims in parts of the world.
