Dariel Alvarez was in a small speedboat trying to illegally escape from his home country, Cuba, when the vessel ran out of fuel in the Gulf of Mexico.

"The first thought was, 'Wow, I went through so much just to die on the edge,'" Alvarez, 25, recalled recently speaking in Spanish. "I was scared to come so far and fall short."

Two years later, the baseball player is one of the Baltimore Orioles' up-and-coming position prospects. Alvarez combines steady defense in the outfield with an electrifying presence at the plate.

There's a lot Alvarez refuses to discuss about defecting from Cuba, a tightly-ruled communist country that prohibits some of its citizens from traveling abroad without permission. Leaving from the city of Camaguey, Alvarez went to Mexico in 2012 to pursue his dream of playing in the major leagues. Ask him how much he paid to desert the island nation, or who was waiting for him in Mexico, and he replies: "If I tell you, I'll lie."

## In The Dead Of Night

However, he will talk about the journey that led him to play the highest level of minor league baseball, Triple-A, for the Norfolk Tides. That journey now sees him under consideration for a September promotion to the Orioles in Major League Baseball.

After leaving his house in the dead of night, Alvarez and eight others fought their way through thick forest to a remote beach, where they hid in the bushes, whispering prayers, as they awaited their transport.

When it finally arrived, they still faced a two-day trip to an unknown destination. Along the way came an unexpected refueling stop in the perilous ocean swells. Getting spotted meant being forced to return to Cuba, followed by time in prison. Alvarez was willing to risk it, to help his family and pursue this dreams.

His boat radioed another boat for gasoline, and after stockpiling enough for the remainder of the journey, continued west. At about 1 a.m., Alvarez estimates, he set foot in his new country.

Alvarez defected understanding that, if stopped in international water, he would be suspended from playing the sport he loves in Cuba. He left realizing he might never see his family again. Alvarez escaped from Cuba without saying goodbye to several friends.

The United States requires Cuban athletes to get a special permit, called an unblocking license, to work for an American company. Alvarez went more than year without playing baseball while he waited for his unblocking license. He couldn't go forward or backward.

## All-Star Futures Game

Alvarez said the Cuban government won't allow him back into the country until 2021.

"I wish the time would pass faster," he said. "Right now, what I wish for the most is to be able to hug my mom."

Alvarez considers other Cuban defectors his brothers. He has spoken to the Los Angeles Dodgers' Yasiel Puig, the Chicago White Sox's Jose Abreu and Dayan Viciedo, and Texas Rangers outfielder Leonys Martin, who all have lived variations of the same story.

"They're examples to follow," Alvarez said. "They're Cuban, they came here, they triumphed. That's what we all want. Come here, succeed, and leave our names in this country representing Cuba."

This year, Alvarez has come closer to his goal of joining his friends in the major leagues.

In late June, the outfielder received an invitation to the All-Star Futures Game in Minneapolis. Many current All-Stars once played in the Futures Game.

Four days after the Futures Game, the Orioles promoted Alvarez to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. Triple-A is the last minor league level below the major leagues.

As Orioles director of player operations Brian Graham explains, Alvarez presents an intriguing blend of raw power added to speed and instincts. The Orioles could see evidence of his strength and bat control from earlier play in the minor leagues. Defensively, he covers a lot of ground in the outfield and uses his cannon of a right arm to slow down opposing baserunners.

## "To Have My Family By My Side"

Orioles manager Buck Showalter believes Triple-A pitchers will find holes in Alvarez's swing, and that some adjustments will be necessary. Showalter still has high hopes for Alvarez.

"We think he has the best arm of everyone in the organization," Showalter said. He thinks Alvarez could play in the major leagues.

Alvarez's future was not always that bright. Along with his difficulty in getting the right to try out for teams, scouts didn't view Alvarez as a high-caliber prospect. He signed with the Orioles for $800,000 in 2013. That was a much smaller bonus than some of the other Cuban stars of Major League Baseball received.

It was still an improvement from baseball in Cuba, where Alvarez said he made just $12 a month.

"[The money] surprised me a little," he said about his deal with the Orioles, "but not that much, because there have been others who have made more, and I support them. Honestly, I would have taken whatever they would have offered me, because I wanted to play baseball."

Alvarez met his girlfriend, Patricia Canedo, in the U.S., and they're expecting a baby boy in September. Canedo, who Alvarez said immigrated from Cuba legally, is working toward obtaining American citizenship. Once that happens, the Cuban government might permit Alvarez's family to visit. Alvarez hopes to introduce his mother to her American-born grandson someday.

"The only thing left to make me the happiest man in the world is to have my family by my side," he said.
