LAUSANNE, Switzerland – Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have captured the imagination of people around the world. They have also raised fears about what could be done with them.

In April, the United States Navy announced an experimental program called LOCUST, which stands for Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology. The weapon can rapidly launch up to 30 drones out of a tube, which then swarm together to gather information or strike at an enemy. Officials promise these war drones will give the military a clear advantage. The U.S. military already uses drones that can kill enemies at a distance. The new program is likely to make some people even more nervous about these flying machines.

## The "Science Of Delivery"

That scary scenario of wars fought by drones might be far off, but the everyday use of drones is here to stay. More than three million people are in the air daily in airplanes, and every large city on our planet is connected to another by air transportation. DJI, a Chinese drone manufacturer, is growing quickly. It claims that its business is already worth $10 billion. Cargo drones that fly goods and packages will grow into an even larger business in the coming years. Because these drones are lightweight, they will fly more cheaply, but be just as fast and safe as cargo planes.

In rich countries, interest in cargo drones has focused on the so-called "last mile." It means the ability of drones to deliver a package to its final destination, for instance, dropping a tub of ice cream onto a person's front lawn. But the bigger opportunities are in poorer countries. Some 800 million people around the world have limited access to emergency services. This fact will not change anytime soon, because there will not be enough money to build roads to connect remote villages. By flying medical supplies to these isolated communities, cargo drones can save lives and create jobs.

Cargo drones are a good example of what Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, calls the "science of delivery." The bank gives loans and advice to poor countries around the world. We know what we need to deliver: the solutions to many of our most pressing problems already exist. The question is how.

A group of people have joined together in Switzerland to answer this question. They have started a new program called Red Line. Companies are just beginning to make emergency cargo drones. Red Line wants to speed this up, so drones can be put to use faster. The group also plans to build the world's first droneports – in Africa.

## It's Often The Boring Stuff That Really Makes A Difference

It sounds like the perfect technological solution – and like one that would not work. After all, advanced technology has not been much good at bringing about meaningful change for the poor. It is boring stuff like teacher training, community health care and apprentice programs that makes a difference in their lives.

That is why many experts in helping poor countries develop are in favor of what they call "frugal innovation" over technology. These are solutions that cost less but work better. BRAC, the world's largest charity group, is in Bangladesh. It has 1.3 million children enrolled in one-room schools – and hardly a laptop in sight.

So why be hopeful about cargo drones? One reason is precisely because they can reach remote regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. In these areas, poverty and disease are widespread, distances are great and roads might never be built.

## A Gadget That Works

Cargo drones would be an especially good solution. In many hard-to-reach places in Africa and South Asia, local women have been trained to start tiny businesses. They are often the ones who get essential goods and services for their villages. It does not matter if they have much education. BRAC's community health workers, for example, sell basic health supplies and medicines. Drones could bring supplies to these workers.

Cargo drones will never replace ground transportation, like trains and trucks. Still, they can ensure that important goods get to where they are needed. Mobile phones took off in Africa because the technology was so much cheaper than building landline phone systems. The same can be said today about building roads in Africa. Like the mobile phone, the cargo drone can be a gadget that works for those who need it most.
