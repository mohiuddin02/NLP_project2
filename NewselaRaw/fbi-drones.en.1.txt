WASHINGTON â€” FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III admitted for the first time on Wednesday that the bureau had used spy drones inside the United States.

Mueller also told a Senate committee that the controversial National Security Agency spying program has been "one dot among many dots" for tracking terror plots.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation uses [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) "in a very, very minimal way and very seldom," said Mueller, adding, "We have very few."

Mueller's comments were the first time an FBI official publicly acknowledged that the bureau used remotely piloted aircraft.  The Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have both tested drones for use in investigations.

## "Greatest Threat To Privacy"

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, asked Mueller to explain how the FBI would limit how video and other information collected by drones would be used by investigators. She called drones "the greatest threat to the privacy of Americans."

Mueller replied that he would have to check on what images from the drowns were actually kept. But he said they were limited to particular needs and particular cases. That was the main privacy limitation the bureau had, he said.

Mueller said the FBI was in the "initial stages" of writing policies to limit the effect of drones on the privacy of American citizens.

"We're exploring not only the use but also the necessary guidelines for that use," he added.

## Soon To Leave Office

It was probably Mueller's last appearance in front of a congressional committee before he leaves office. Spying on people inside the United States was the big topic.

The NSA has admitted using information gathered from Web sites like Google and Facebook to try to stop terror plots. The disclosure came after a man who worked for the NSA leaked information about the efforts of spy agencies to gather information about people's telephone calls.

Those disclosures have been the source of great controversy.  The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the government to try to stop the gathering of phone records.

But NSA Director Keith Alexander said this week that the programs have helped stop more than 50 terror attacks globally.

Mueller defended the NSA's actions to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said NSA's use of telephone logs and Internet records was especially crucial in learning which U.S. suspects or foreign immigrants were in contact with al-Qaida or other terror networks overseas.

"You never know which dot is going to be the key," he said. "But you want as many dots as you can. And if you close down a program like this, there will be ... fewer dots to connect."

## Plans For Replacement

Mueller said the bureau already was making transition plans for his replacement, even though President Barack Obama had not yet nominated somebody for the Senate to confirm.

Mueller said he had met with Obama to discuss his replacement, but would not detail their conversation. The White House, meanwhile, has indicated the president plans to nominate James B. Comey, a former deputy attorney general, to the post.

No matter how much the FBI prepares, and who takes over, some unexpected crime or attack probably will change everything, Mueller said. A week after Mueller took office, the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks instantly changed the FBI. It went from a traditional anti-crime organization fighting gangs and bank robberies into one with anti-terrorism and national security as its top priority.

"It will take, I would say, a month to really get one's feet on the ground," Mueller said. "But in that month, I can tell you something's going to happen. So whatever you planned in terms of sitting down and looking at something, something else will come up and your attention will be diverted."

Committee members from both political parties complimented the departing director, thanking him for his 12 years of running the bureau.

## Made Bureau More Sophisticated

Some proclaimed his success in upgrading the FBI into a more sophisticated, highly technological organization. Those upgrades helped the FBI fight computer crime, international terrorism and complex Wall Street money schemes.

But several Republicans appeared frustrated. They asked why Mueller's FBI had not made arrests in the Internal Revenue Service political controversy. The Tea Party and other conservative groups were targeted for special scrutiny by the IRS.

Mueller said a dozen agents were assigned to the case. It was being directed out of the Washington field office.

"There is a sense of urgency with the investigation," he said. "It is not languishing."
