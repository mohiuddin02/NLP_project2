Fire ants may be famous for their painful sting. But they're also remarkable builders. They can quickly make a raft out of their own bodies so they can sail off to escape damaging floods. Until recently, though, scientists were unable to figure out how they did it.

Now, scientists are able to peer into the heart of fire-ant rafts. They have discovered that the insects link their bodies together to create strong yet lightweight structures. This knowledge may one day help engineers build buildings and bridges that can repair themselves.

The towers, bridges and boats that ants build are remarkable. They're strong, light and adapt to the conditions around them. The ants are both the construction workers and the raw materials. They use their bodies like the beams in a building. Instead of nailing those beams together, they reach out and touch each other.

"It's like their bodies are covered in Velcro," said David Hu. He is an engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Hu is part of a team that discovered how the fire ants construct their rafts.

## Simon Says Freeze!

Scientists are just beginning to understand how complicated ant architecture really is. A recent study even found that ants place their babies at the bottom of a raft. The babies make it better able to float.

But all those ant bodies are blocking the view. So it's hard for scientists to see how their rafts are put together. To look through the layers of ants, scientists could use a CT scanner. CT scanners use X-rays to look through a structure, like a skull. But the scanner is way too big. The medical device is built for humans, and the ants' legs are so thin that they can't be seen.

Instead, scientists at Georgia Tech used a micro CT scanner to see how the ant raft is constructed. The micro scanner is usually used to view the tiny 3-D structure of bones. Scientists put 110 live ants in a beaker of water and swirled it around so the ants would start to form tiny rafts. They froze the ants in place and then examined them under the scanner. They did this four times. Altogether, they used 440 ants making up 2,640 legs, since each ant has six limbs.

They found, to their surprise, that nearly all the legs were linked to each other. Just 26 legs didn't make a connection. The ants sure knew how to get a grip on each other.

"We were surprised at how effective they are at finding links," Hu said. "We thought oh, maybe half the ants would be linked."

## One Ant, Two Ant, Big Ant, Little Ant

The scientists also found that the ants placed themselves on a 90-degree angle to each other. This made the raft more flexible. It was able to expand and contract when needed.

Not all ants were created equal. Most of them could connect to no more than five other ants at the same time. But some ants were about three times larger and could connect to 20 ants. With "more parking spots for little legs," as Hu put it, their enormous bodies acted as hubs for the ant legs. In a bicycle wheel, for instance, the spokes meet in the middle at the hub. In buildings, hubs are important points of strength.

The ants reached out to each other. But they kept other ants at arms' length. By creating these big spaces between each connected ant, the insects made their raft lighter and less dense. Even though an ant's body is denser than water, the ant rafts are much less dense. This lets them easily float on the surface.

"In some ways they're building a whole new kind of material," Hu said. They're just ants, he said. But how they arrange themselves affects the strength and lightness of the structures.

Hu said the ant raft was quite a bit like bone in that way. It is very light, but still very strong.

## Bring On The Bigger Structures

The scientists next want to explore how larger ant clumps and towers are formed. Clumps and towers can be made up of between 10,000 and 100,000 ants. The rafts contain just 110 ants at a time.

Buildings and ships, which can fix themselves and adjust to changes, may sound like technology from the future, or something from a story.

But for the ants, "this is an ancient thing," Hu said.
