Along the way, irrigation canals take water to the farm fields that grow most of the greens Americans eat in the winter. If you eat a salad between Thanksgiving and April, the odds are good that some of it was grown in Yuma.

The river is a marvel of engineering, but it also shows how tough it is to manage the need for water in the Southwest. The Colorado is suffering from a historic drought that has made it clear the region cannot keep depending on one source of water.

Almost 40 million people in seven states depend on the Colorado for their water. Experts are forecasting the population could double in the next 50 years and after 16 years of drought, it's become clear that the Colorado cannot meet their needs for long. Government officials say water shortages will force them to cut back the water supply to parts of the area in the future.

## Arizona Would Take The Brunt Of The Cuts

Arizona would suffer the worst cuts in its water supply if the drought continues. Farmers who grow cattle feed and cotton in central Arizona could be forced to let fields go. Cities like Phoenix might have to begin reusing wastewater and even putting limits on growth, which has helped the economy of the state grow. Here in Yuma, though, there may be no cuts at all. Thanks to the complicated rules governing the Colorado, much of metropolitan Phoenix could become a ghost town while Yuma keeps planting lettuce in the desert.

The shortages have opened a testy new debate about rethinking the way Arizona divides the water it shares with six other states, including California. Some experts say people should take precedence over growing leafy greens. That kind of talk rattles the farmers in Yuma. They know they have water priority but not necessarily political priority.

The farmers believe there's a target on their backs, said Tom Buschatzke, who leads the Arizona Department of Water Resources. "I believe they're right," he said.

## Farmers Claim Their Rights Are Grandfathered

Some of the farmers come from families that were here when the big cities of the modern Southwest were little more than crossroads, and they don't intend to go quietly. Mark Smith, who farms about 500 acres in Yuma and leads 1 of 6 irrigation districts in the area, says the farmers have a legal right to that water. There is no easy fix, but this is a national debate, Smith added. The farmers in Yuma are supplying the entire nation and growing vital crops, he said.

Few rivers work as hard as the Colorado. It serves ranchers in western Colorado growing cattle feed and supplies Denver and its suburbs. Las Vegas and other southern Nevada communities draw up to 90 percent of their water from the river, and the Hoover Dam and other power plants turn its flow into electricity. After Arizona and California take their share, the river exits to the sea in the Gulf of California.

If a shortage is declared, California would not face any immediate cutbacks, thanks to an agreement reached with Arizona in 1968. That agreement also ensured that much of Arizona would take steep cuts, but Yuma is an exception.

## Yuma Farmers Argue Cities Grew Without Water Restrictions

Farms in Yuma have been drawing water from the Colorado since the late 19th century. They have the oldest water rights in Arizona and some of the oldest in the region, which gives them the right to more water than the cities of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, put together. California has rights to the largest share, and even in the worst case, it will always get its share. All sides know they have to work together, or they fear that the federal government will step in and make a decision.

Farmers in Yuma argue that the region has become more productive and reduced its water use over the last four decades — but farms still need a lot of water because the soil in the area has naturally high levels of salt. The farmers also say cities have been allowed to grow without worrying about the water they will need.

The farmers are doing many things right, said Robert Glennon, a law professor at the University of Arizona who studies water issues. Glennon also warned that they may have only so much control over their fate. Farmers in California who depend on other rivers are learning the same lesson during the historic drought there, he said. Glennon has encouraged farmers to grow smaller crops and sell the rights to their water back to the cities.

## Federal Government Built Canals To Help Farms

The federal government began building canals to carry water from the Colorado to the farms in the early years of the 20th century. Edward C. Cuming arrived in Yuma in the summer of 1902 and homesteaded 160 acres, irrigating them with water from the new canals. During the Great Depression, the poor economy led the federal government to build large projects to create jobs, including the canals — and one of them, stamped "CCC 1940," is known as the Cuming Canal.

The canal still runs directly in front of fields now owned by Edward Cuming's grandson, Jim Cuming, 77. He sat on a concrete culvert above the Cuming Canal while cloudy Colorado River water surged beneath him.

"When we had an abundant supply of water, the farmer was doing a great job," Cuming said. "Now all of a sudden he's a villain because he uses too much to produce your fruit and fiber."
