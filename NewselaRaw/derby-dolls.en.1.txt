LOS ANGELES — Some girls decide to play soccer or go out for cheerleading. Ivy Wolk, on the other hand, chose roller derby.

"This is it, this is for me," the tiny, wide-eyed 9-year-old said to her mom the first time she saw the Los Angeles Derby Dolls hit the roller skating track. Roller derby is a rowdy contact sport played by two teams. A team scores points when one of its players passes members of the opposing team, who try to block her and may bump her out of the way.

Not the safest sport in the world: split lips, black eyes, rink rash and bruises are trophies here. For the girls, their bumps and bruises are signs of achievement, of hard and active skating, of trying their best.

"There have literally been days where I have been like, 'I must be crazy.' But she just picks herself up and gets back out there," said Ivy's mother, Tracy Wolk, who made sure she alerted her daughter's pediatrician about the girl's newfound sport.

## Finding A New Place

Since getting their start 11 years ago, the Los Angeles Derby Dolls have become a Los Angeles tradition. They first laced up their skates at Skateland, a roller skating rink; then on a rooftop in Chinatown; then on the third floor of a Little Tokyo shopping mall, with various parking lots in between. They teach girls 7 and older as well as young women how to skate, and they compete against teams from across the country.

Now the volunteer league is moving again. Their headquarters at the "Doll Factory," a former dairy covered in pink and black paint, is in LA's Historic Filipinotown. The neighborhood may be knocked down.

But finding a new place is a challenge, said league co-founder Rebecca Ninburg. It has to be big and affordable, with a landlord willing to look outside the box. Roller derby doesn't have the greatest reputation, but the Derby Dolls are not the violent, rowdy crowd some might think. To raise money for the move and the new space, the Dolls have started an online campaign with a goal of $100,000 by the end of the month. So far, they've raised more than $79,000.

"I'm just gonna be so sad that we're gonna lose this place. It's my home, it's my home away from home," said Yesenia "Cherry Bomb" Hernandez, 15, who said roller derby is what gave her the confidence to stand up to bullies at her school. The member of the Derby Doll's Junior Ri-Ette team has been knocked out of the rink before, but her mom isn't worried. The girls take care of one another, said her mother, Julie Hernandez.

Practices are intense. Team members are known by their derby names — funny puns or tough-sounding nicknames — such as RegulateHer, Jackie Nimble and Cirque d'Slay.

## Rough And Tumble

On a recent day, young women shot around the slanted track under a skate-shaped disco ball. Players at the back of the pack — who are called "jammers" in roller derby-speak — fight to get through, take a lap, pass the group to score, and go again. The women are pushing and yelling when one falls hard. She rolls around in pain on the ground, but she's smiling. A teammate skates to the first aid cart to grab supplies.

The league has gotten dozens of offers for reality shows and documentaries, but Ninburg, whose derby name is Demolicious, said they'll continue to turn them down unless they get a say over what the final show looks like. Television creates drama and tries to spice up the sport, she said, but that's not what the Derby Dolls are about. They're serious athletes.

"We're not going to compromise who we are," she said.

At halftime of a recent game, spectators milled around the Doll House with food and drinks in hand. They browsed merchandise stalls, stopping to listen to bands.

It was the first time David Hale and his friend George Tevelde had seen the Derby Dolls. Once he found them online, it took only about 20 minutes for Hale to get hooked. Derby was like pro wrestling in the 1970s — matches were staged and the winners were decided ahead of time. But roller derby had a revival that has turned it into much more of a real sport, he said.

"It's not polished. It's not baseball, it's not the Lakers," Hale said of LA's basketball team. "You can see it in their faces. It's not LA. They're not doing it for the money, they're doing it for the love."

## "I'm Home"

Ivy — known here as Shematoma, after the scientific word for bruise — is sure of herself when she whips around the track. Her teammates, ages 7 to 17, wear skirts and patterned leggings, and some have shirts with their derby names printed on the back. They practice the basics, stopping and maneuvering around cones set up on the rink, to an upbeat soundtrack including "The Bare Necessities" from Disney's film "The Jungle Book" and rock singer Phil Collins.

Ivy gets quiet and a bit shy when asked, really, what it is about roller derby she loves so much. It makes her feel normal, her mother said, which is a big deal for a kid with a rare protein allergy that prevents her from eating 19 major foods. She can't have any outside food, but Ninburg made sure there were frozen grapes, her favorite treat, at a recent team party.

Last summer, Ivy took several weeks off to rest and get medical tests. She was nervous about coming back, but her coach greeted her with a shout and a big hug and her friends acted as if nothing had changed.

She turned to her mom and said, "I'm home," Wolk recalled.
