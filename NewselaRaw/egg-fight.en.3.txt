WASHINGTON — California is being sued for a law it passed. Californians voted to prevent the sale of eggs in California that come from hens kept in cramped cages.

And now six states are suing California. It's a case that could affect farmers and people shopping for eggs all over America.

Alabama, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma sued California. Farmers in those states sell eggs in California. The states argue that the law forces their farmers to make expensive changes to farms. New cages and henhouses would have to be bought. Paying for the changes could make eggs more expensive at grocery stores.

"We think that California is dead wrong on this," said Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. Iowa produces the most eggs in America.

The states said the egg ban goes against the U.S. Constitution.

## Hens In Tight Spaces

"In Alabama, consumers are free to make their own choice of which eggs to buy at their grocery stores," the Alabama Attorney General said. It is "wrong for California to tell Alabama how we must produce eggs."

California voters passed a law in 2008 that stopped the state's farmers from keeping hens in tight spaces. Now, hens must be able to turn around freely, lie down, stand up and fully extend their limbs. The first law just applied to California farmers. Then, two years later, California lawmakers banned the sale of eggs from hens in tight cages no matter what state they come from. The law goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2015.

The small cages are known as "battery" cages.

Battery cages give each hen only about 67 square inches of floor space. That's smaller than an 8x10 sheet of paper.

About 95 percent of eggs in the U.S. are produced in battery cages.

## "Higher Animal Welfare"

The European Union banned battery cages in 1999. They gave farmers 12 years to get rid of them and buy bigger cages.

People "are demanding higher animal welfare," said Joe Maxwell. Animal welfare is how an animal is treated. Maxwell is a farmer who helps run the Humane Society, an animal-rights group.

He said that some people will pay higher prices for eggs if they know the hens were treated well.

On the other side of the fight is Blake Hurst. He is also a farmer, and president of the Missouri Farm Bureau. Hurst said that some people who care about animal welfare can't afford to pay a higher price for eggs.

"That's the person who doesn't get a voice," he said.

Missouri farmers sell one-third of their eggs to California. Now they must decide if they are going to spend more than $120 million for new cages and henhouses to follow California's law. The other choice is to stop selling to California. Yet that would mean a huge loss of money since California buys more eggs than any other state.

## Cage Confusion

Meanwhile, some other states are following California's example. Michigan, Oregon and Washington have passed laws demanding more space for hens, and Ohio has banned the construction of new battery cages. Lawmakers in New York and Massachusetts also have considered laws.

While the lawsuit makes its way through the court, egg producers around the country are rushing to meet California's rules by Jan. 1. The 2010 law did not say what size or type of cage is acceptable, which has led to confusion. Many farmers believe the EU standard of 116 square inches per hen is about right. That gives each hen space of about 8.5x14 inches.

Dermot Hayes is a professor at Iowa State University. Hayes estimates that 40 percent of the laying hens in Iowa will be killed so farmers can make room in their henhouses for the bigger cages.

"Egg prices will go up everywhere — California, too, for a while," Hayes predicted. Then, egg producers will build new henhouses and barns, produce more eggs, and prices will settle down.
