Lake Mission Viejo is Southern California at its most picturesque and, when it comes to water, its most extravagant. Multimillion-dollar homes surround the 1.2 billion-gallon lake, which was created solely for recreation. On sunny afternoons, local children frolic on the lake's flawless sandy beaches as sailboats sway across the blue waters.

Since its creation in the 1970s — in the middle of a drought — the manufactured lake has become a part of south Orange County's identity. Indeed, it is the backdrop to Mission Viejo's city seal.

Now, almost 40 years after first-term Governor Jerry Brown criticized officials for filling the lake "while others use buckets to collect water in their showers," Mission Viejo is under scrutiny again as the state struggles through another relentless drought. In California's third consecutive drought year, state officials are beginning to consider whether the sparkling waters that are the city's recreational haven might be put to a better use: filling bathtubs and drinking glasses in the most parched regions.

## Town Planning Needs Have Changed

Private lakes for a few wealthy suburbanites are an old-fashioned and glamorous approach to town planning, critics say. It is inappropriate for these dry days.

"You have to hand it to them — (a lake) was a fantastic idea. But today, that water should be available for indoor use, not outdoor recreation," said Stephanie Pincetl, director of the California Center for Sustainable Communities.

The association that owns and operates the lake is quietly discussing with the local water district ways to use less water while keeping the lake filled. However, the very presence of the vast watery playground raises questions about Californians' outsized relationship with water.

## Waiting For Water

Much of the city of Mission Viejo was developed by a single company, the Mission Viejo Company, beginning in the 1960s. Houses in the quickly growing community were hot properties from the start.

Then in 1973, the company announced plans to spend $5.6 million to build a lake with about 3.5 miles of shoreline.

When it came time in 1977 to fill the lake, developers sparked a political firestorm. Amid one of the worst droughts in state history, the company planned to import up to 40 percent of the lake's water from Northern California through an aqueduct crossing the Tehachapi Mountains. That did not sit well with some northerners, who, according to news reports, were counting water by the glass.

As political pressure mounted, the California Water Board ordered Mission Viejo Company to stop filling the massive hole it had dug for the lake.

A year later, the drought subsided, and the board allowed the company to fill the lake with water from the Colorado River.

## The State Is Still In A Drought

Today, the lake is part of a "complete, year-round resort," with beaches, parks, clubhouses and a stage that hosts summer concerts. High-end custom homes along the lake can sell for more than $3 million.

The lake is not open to the general public. To use it, residents must join the Lake Mission Viejo Association, pay dues of more than $200 annually and live within portions of the city originally developed by the Mission Viejo Company. The association now includes more than 24,000 households.

Once again, though, state officials are raising concerns about "nonessential" water uses, such as recreational lakes.

After three dry years with no relief in sight, Governor Brown has asked Californians to reduce their water use 20 percent. Some parched communities are living on the verge of waterlessness, trucking in water and praying for rain. Many other local water districts, including the Santa Margarita Water District in which Mission Viejo is located, have issued restrictions that limit car washing and water used for lawns. If the drought worsens, state Water Board scientist Max Gomberg said, private lakes could face restrictions, too.

"When there's not enough water to meet all the needs, some needs have to be put ahead of others," he said.

## Stages Of Water Restrictions

Santa Margarita Water District officials are working with the lake association to find ways to cut back. With 124 surface acres, the lake loses about 88 million gallons of water to evaporation each year — enough to fill more than 130 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The lake association refills it with fresh, drinkable water, making it one of the district's largest water users.

Association leaders are considering cutbacks in other areas of the resort to offset the lake's water use. The association could also help fund projects that would switch some large irrigation systems to using recycled water.

If the drought worsens, though, the association might not get those options. The Santa Margarita Water District has already implemented Stage 2 water restrictions. Stage 3 would force the association to obtain a permit to replace water lost to evaporation, while Stage 4 would ban such filling altogether.

## The Lake "Makes No Sense"

Tampering with the lake's water can be a touchy subject for some longtime association members. They bristle at the suggestion of reducing or changing the lake levels.

"We love coming down here where there aren't too many people," said Carlos Lopez, an association member whose 4-year-old daughter, Dayleen, splashed in the water. "She's a fish. I'd have to take her down to the beach, and that's a pain."

Mission Viejo, state officials said, may be the largest manufactured lake in the Greater Los Angeles Area that is solely recreational.

Drought or no, the lake makes no sense to some. According to water conservationist Conner Everts, creating a "giant swimming pool for the few" with a public resource "makes no sense at all."

In a state with a lot of inequality when it comes to water, Mission Viejo stands out for its level of "water abuse," Everts said. "You want lakes? Move to Minnesota."
