WASHINGTON â€” The head of the FBI admitted for the first time Wednesday that the bureau had used unmanned spy planes inside the United States.

Robert S. Mueller III also told a Senate committee that the National Security Agency spy program has helped track terror plots. He called it "one dot, among many dots." The NSA's spy program has been a hot topic of debate. Americans are arguing whether privacy is more important than security.

The FBI chief said the bureau uses unmanned planes "in a very, very minimal way and very seldom." He added that bureau had very few of the planes, which are called "[drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone)."

Mueller's comments were the first time an FBI official publicly said that the bureau used drones.  Other government law enforcement agencies have tested drones for use in cracking crimes.

## Drones A Threat To Privacy

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked Mueller to explain how the FBI would limit how video and other information collected by the drones was used by investigators. She called drones "the greatest threat to the privacy of Americans."

Mueller said he would have to check on what images from the drowns were actually kept. But he said that they were limited to particular needs and particular cases. That was the main privacy limitation the bureau had, he said.

Mueller said the FBI was in the "initial stages" of writing policies to limit the effect on the privacy of American citizens.

"We're exploring not only the use but also the necessary guidelines for that use," he added.

## Spying On Citizens

The appearance was probably Mueller's last in front of a congressional committee before he leaves office. Because of recent events, spying on people inside the United States was a major topic.

The NSA has admitted using information gathered from Web sites like Google and Facebook to try to stop terror plots. That came out after a man who worked for the NSA gave away information that the agency was gathering information about people's telephone calls. That man is currently in hiding.

The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the government to try to stop it from gathering phone records.

But NSA Director Keith Alexander said this week that the programs have helped stop more than 50 terror attacks around the world.

Mueller defended the NSA's actions to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said NSA's use of telephone logs and Internet records was especially important in learning which U.S.-born suspects or foreign immigrants were in contact with al-Qaida or other terrorist networks overseas.

"You never know which dot is going to be the key," he said. "But you want as many dots as you can. And if you close down a program like this, there will be ... fewer dots to connect."

## Left His Mark On The Bureau

Mueller said the bureau already was making transition plans for his replacement. President Barack Obama had not yet nominated somebody for the Senate to confirm.

Mueller said he had met with Obama to discuss his replacement, but would not detail their conversation.

No matter how much the FBI prepares, and who ultimately takes over, some unexpected crime or attack probably will change everything, Mueller said. A week after Mueller took office, the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks instantly changed the FBI. It went from a traditional anti-crime organization fighting gangs and bank robberies into one with anti-terrorism and national security as its top priority.

"It will take, I would say, a month to really get one's feet on the ground," Mueller said. "But in that month, I can tell you something's going to happen. So whatever you planned in terms of sitting down and looking at something, something else will come up and your attention will be diverted."

Committee members from both political parties complimented Mueller. They thanked him for his 12 years of running the bureau.

Some proclaimed his success in making the FBI a more sophisticated, highly technological organization. The upgrades helped the bureau combat computer crime and international terrorism, and investigate complex Wall Street money schemes.
