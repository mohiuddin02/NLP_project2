SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” The crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 has given the safety improvements of the past 30 years the chance to prove how much they matter.

As sad as the loss of three young lives in the crash is, 304 people lived. In other words, almost everybody survived.

The loss of life was "nowhere near what you would have anticipated, " said Larry Rooney. He is an executive with an important pilots group.

Several things helped save lives. Seats were stronger and fireproof.  Materials inside the cabin and around the cargo areas slowed down flames from spreading. Lighted strips on the floor led to the exits.  Flight attendants were also taught to speak up when they saw something wrong. And pilots were taught to pay attention to them.

## One Of The Safest Jets

The Boeing 777 that crashed July 6 has a record as one of the safest planes in the sky, said Kevin Hiatt. He is president and chief executive officer of the Flight Safety Foundation.

That said, there are problems to study. Some escape slides opened inside the aircraft. Two flight attendants got trapped for a short time. Getting people out of the plane was delayed for 90 seconds.  Seat belts in most of the seats hurt some passengers. Of course they also helped save their lives.

"Accidents are very rare, and this one will be closely looked at," said Todd Curtis. He who worked on safety features of the 777 at Boeing. Now he operates a Web site that provides information for travelers on safety and security. Industry rules could change because of the crash, he said.

The airplane had its first flight on Feb 5, 2006. It was built when safety features developed in the late 1980s and 1990s were being put into new airliners.

## Among The Safety Features:

## Stronger Seats

The seats on the Asiana aircraft were able to stand up to 16 times the force of gravity. Firefighters entering the aircraft found the seats toward the front of the aircraft in almost perfect shape, "like you could fluff the pillows and almost go out," National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said. The damage was worse near the back.

Hiatt said passengers may have climbed over the seats, pushing them forward.

## Easier Escape

The escape path lighting on the floor worked. This was added to aircraft built in 1986 and later.  The public address system was still working so an important order to get out of  the plane could be heard. FAA rules say passengers should be able to leave the aircraft in 90 seconds, even if some exits are blocked.

## Safer Materials

Although the aircraft burned, passengers had time to escape. In the 1980s, the FAA issued regulations requiring materials inside the cabin that are hard to burn. Improvements continue today.

Also, materials inside the passenger area are designed not to crack and create sharp surfaces. "Everything in the airplane is engineered for the ultimate design of safety," said Thomas Anthony. He is the director of the University of Southern California's Aviation Safety and Security program.

## Crews Better Trained

"The crews are better trained than they were," said Rooney, who has flown for 30 years. That includes flight attendants.

Crews are now trained to worry about giving information to each other. It does not matter who is in charge. The order to get out of Flight 214 was given after a flight attendant noticed fire outside the cabin and passed word to the captain. He reversed an earlier instruction not to evacuate.

But investigators will want to know why there was a delay. "When the aircraft has gone through that crash landing, the chances of a fire starting are almost 100 percent. Why not order an evacuation?" asked Vahid Motevalli, who helped write a 2005 study of aircraft accidents.

## Improved Technology

Improved navigation technology and better instruments for flying in bad weather have made flight much safer.
