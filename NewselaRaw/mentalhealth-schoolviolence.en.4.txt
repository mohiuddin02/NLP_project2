PITTSBURGH â€” Deadly attacks by students have taken place at schools in the past few years. School leaders say to prevent these tragedies, students should be taught how to avoid violence. They say that counselors should also be made more available to help students who might become violent.

But school leaders say they do not have enough money for counselors and safety programs. Also, school-safety programs have not worked. Schools have failed to train teachers and students, they say.

"We're 15 years after Columbine, and you'd have thought we would have solved that problem," said John Matthews. He is an expert on school safety in Texas. Matthews was talking about the 1999 killings at Columbine High School in Colorado. In that attack, seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher. Then they killed themselves.

A new study by Vanderbilt University says teaching younger students to talk calmly about a problem helps. Such skills would help kids to think before they do something mean.

## Counseling In And Out Of School

Manny Sethi is a Vanderbilt professor who worked on the study. He said we need to teach those problem-solving skills before high school.

He said it is better to change students when they are younger.

Learning to talk calmly of problems helps. Yet, more mental-health services are needed, like counseling, in and out of school.

In April, more than 20 students and teachers were stabbed by a classmate at a high school in Pennsylvania. Afterward, Gov. Tom Corbett spoke of the need for mental-health services. But mental-health workers in Pennsylvania schools say money for such services has been cut. As a result, there are fewer school counselors.

U.S. Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania is pushing for a new law. If passed, help would be easier to get and be set up through a child's regular doctor.

Violent acts in schools do not just happen, Murphy said. Many had "been developing over a long period of time." He says this gives us a chance to help.

Schools have added programs to stop bullying. Metal detectors and setting up ways for students to report threats have helped, too.

## How To Deal With Conflict

But some programs just do not work, Sethi said. He and his team reviewed 27 programs. Then they chose one that seemed best for their study. The team tried it in a middle school in Tennessee known for violence.

Before the study, the students completed a list of questions. They gave their thoughts on violence and how to handle tough situations. Over several weeks, students tried role-playing exercises. Students acted out different situations, like when one student calls another a name. The idea was that they learn how to avoid violence at moments of anger.

Sethi said the exercises helped. Students gained in "understanding conflict and how it progresses and how to get yourself out of it."

After the exercises, students filled out a second list of questions. Students reported that they were less likely to be a target of bullying, and less likely to hit or push others. They were also less likely to cheer if a fight broke out. Students said they were now more likely to try to prevent a fight.

Schools may be able to spot students who are troubled. Yet, even then students often do not get the help they need. What help they do receive may not be enough or last long enough, Matthews said. He gave the example of Seung-Hui Cho. In 2007, Cho killed 32 people and himself at Virginia Tech University. Cho had received care at home before the shooting.

When he went to college, that was all gone, and things got bad, Matthews said.
