WASHINGTON â€” In July 2014, Eric Garner died in New York City after a police officer grabbed him around the neck. In August, 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in Missouri. Both Garner and Brown were black and were not carrying a gun or knife.

These events caused anger and outrage across the United States. Many African-Americans opened up about how they do not trust police officers. In response, President Barack Obama ordered a group of experts to study the issue and make suggestions on how law enforcement could be improved. The task force released its report this week.

## Making Changes, Building Trust

Police departments need to build trust with minority communities, Obama said. The police must make real changes in their policies, he said.

The experts on the task force recommended outside investigations in case of police killings. Today, many police departments have their own officers investigate when a fellow officer fires their gun. Some people believe police will protect other police officers, even if the officers did something wrong.

The deaths of Garner and Brown exposed "deep-rooted frustration in many communities of color around the need for fair and just law enforcement," the president said.

## Three Main Areas To Fix

Overall, the task force called for police to improve in three areas: training, record-keeping and cooperation with their communities.

"The moment is now for us to make these changes," Obama said. He was at a White House meeting with members of the task force. They worked on the recommendations for three months.

Obama said that the tragedy of the killings and the conflicts they caused are an opportunity. We should think about relations between community and police so that people can feel safe and police can feel supported, he said.

The task force held seven public hearings across the country. It heard testimony from more than 100 people. The panel also met with the leaders of groups fighting for the rights of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, veterans, gays, the disabled and others.

## Trust Is Important

In the end, the task force made 63 recommendations.

One recommendation was for more police training. In particular, training could help officers reduce their bias and deal with stressful situations, Obama said.

He recognized that another recommendation would be controversial with police groups: independent investigations after police shootings.

When there is a police shooting, it is important to make sure there is accountability, Obama said. This means that people must be held responsible for their actions.

Today, police often investigate their own shootings and other deadly incidents.

The task force recommended outside, independent investigations. They should be run by other cities or counties, the state government, or the next highest level of government, the panel said.

"In order to restore and maintain trust, this independence is crucial," the report said.

## Organizing The Numbers Better

An organization representing police officers disagreed with the recommendation. An outside investigation may make sense if the police department cannot afford its own, the group said. In general though, outside investigations do not make sense, a representative for the National Association of Police Organizations said.

"I think it sends a message that your local police can't be trusted," Bill Johnson said. This policy would cause more distrust between communities and their police, he said.

The task force also focused on police record-keeping. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director James Comey have called for better records to be kept on police-involved shootings across the country. Currently, local police report these incidents voluntarily. There is no place where these numbers are all collected.

"There's no reason for us not to have this data available," said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, who co-chaired the task force. He said he was surprised to learn that there were no reliable records kept.

"Now that we know that this does not exist, it is our responsibility to do everything we can to develop that information."

## It Will Take Time

The task force also looked at police in immigrant communities. Some immigrants might be afraid to call the police for help because they or a loved one are in the country illegally.

The panel recommended that local police should not deal with immigration enforcement.

Earlier, the president called for Congress to help pay for 50,000 body cameras for police to wear. These cameras would record police interactions with the public. But the White House task force found that the cameras raise extremely complex legal and privacy issues.

Obama said that technology like body cameras cannot be the only solution to this issue. Technology can play a role, he said, but it must be part of a larger change.

Laurie Robinson teaches at George Mason University and helped lead the task force. She told reporters that it will take time for police to build good relations with the communities they cover.

"It takes time. It takes relationship-building. And it doesn't happen overnight," she said.
