Rapper Jay Z and a group of top pop stars got together to announce the start of a new music-streaming service called Tidal.

Jay Z, who recently bought Tidal, was joined at a news conference by a dozen or so famous singers. Among them were his wife, Beyonce, rapper Kanye West and singer Madonna.

Tidal aims to take customers away from other streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora. Its music starts at $10 a month. Jay Z and the others say artists will be paid fairly for their work. The music will be streamed with higher-quality sound.

"Together, we can turn the tide and make music history," West told fans on social media.

## Big Money In Music Streaming

Music industry experts said it was not clear that Tidal would succeed. Most music groups earn just fractions of pennies for their streams. Tidal was not likely to change that.

"Jay Z has recognized that there's an opportunity to bring personality and quality to streaming music services," said Mark Mulligan. He is a music business expert at MIDiA Research. But, Mulligan added that it will take more than Tidal to change the music-streaming business.

Fans pay billions of dollars for music streaming every year. Artists have been critical that streaming services pay most of the money to record companies and music publishers. The singers and artists who created the music receive very little for their work.

Tidal has promised to pay them more, and some artists may become part owners. Jay Z bought the service last month for $56 million.

Tidal officials did not say how it would pay artists.

"Our goal is simple. We want to create a better service and a better experience for both fans and artists," singer Alicia Keys, one of the owners of Tidal, said at the gathering. "We believe it's in everyone's best interests to preserve the value of music."

## Who Will Win The Race For Subscribers?

Singer Taylor Swift was in the news last fall after she yanked her latest album "1989" from Spotify. She did not want her songs offered on the service's free version. Swift said that music should not be free. People should have to pay for listening to albums, Swift said.

Tidal describes itself as the first music-streaming service that combines the best sound quality and HD music videos. It also offers original content like playlists by musicians and videos. Fans will not be able to get these anywhere else.

A basic service at $9.99 a month will offer regular streaming quality with high-definition music videos. The more expensive level costs $19.99 monthly. It will offer higher-quality streaming, HD videos and the extra content. There will be no free service.

Tidal is available in 31 countries. It had 500,000 paid subscribers by the end of 2014.

However, it faces heavy competition.

Spotify charges about $10 a month. It has more than 15 million paying subscribers, according to the streaming service's website. Pandora also has millions of listeners.

In November, Daniel Ek, Spotify's chief executive, responded to musicians' criticism. He said that an artist as big as Swift could make up to $6 million a year on Spotify.

"The more we grow, the more we'll pay you," Ek said in a post aimed at musicians.

## Tell Us Why We Should Buy It

Still, several experts are not convinced. They argue that it takes more than celebrities to bring in paying subscribers. Many people have not even gotten used to the idea of paying for their music, experts say.

To separate itself from the competition, Tidal will need to offer extremely good reasons for people to pay, analysts said. Tidal promises to offer original content. However, there are already plenty of free social media services and ways for artists to connect with fans.

Also, most young music fans are not interested in sound quality. Even if they noticed the difference, it is not clear that it is worth nearly $20 a month to them. Many young music fans listen on low-cost headphones or Bluetooth speakers, which would not show off the high-quality sound anyway.

However, if Jay Z can help musicians make more money, they might be willing to sign on to Tidal.

MIDiA's analyst Mulligan isn't so sure. "My gut tells me that Jay Z has bitten off more than he can chew," he said.
