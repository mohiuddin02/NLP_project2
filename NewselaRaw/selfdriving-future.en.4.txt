LOS ANGELES â€” Someday we might not own cars. We may not even drive them.

In the future, cars will drive themselves. It could cause a revolution in how we get around.

Traffic jams are increasing. Self-driving cars could lead to less traffic. And if you are stuck in traffic, you can do something while your car drives you.

Ride-sharing is becoming popular in cities. Using a phone, a person can ask for a car to pick them up. A driver knows where the person is through GPS. It uses satellites to pinpoint where someone is. Nearly every cellphone has GPS now. If a driver is close by, they can pick up a passenger. They just pay for the ride, like a taxi.

In the future, ride-sharing could be different. Instead of a human driver, a robot might make the pickup. Or people might rent a self-driving car from a large fleet of them. Cars may be left in big parking lots. People could take a car when it is needed. Garages would no longer be necessary. Buying cars could even become a thing of the past.

## Cars Mean Freedom

The Los Angeles Auto Show this week offered a look into the future. Driverless cars were there to be seen.

Already, the cars can park themselves. They can slam on the brakes to avoid crashes. And they can adjust steering to stay in the center of a lane.

For a century, cars have meant freedom. They were a sign of wealth. In the future, cars may become just another type of public transportation, like a bus or a train.

Google is already building experimental self-driving cars. They are not for sale.

Cars might look very different in the future, said Harald Belker. He used to work at Mercedes-Benz. Now, he creates cars for movies set in the future, including "Iron Man 2 and "Total Recall."

"You can have a two-seater where the passengers face each other," Belker said.

## Warming Up To Coming Changes

Not everyone believes self-driving cars will take over the roads.

Beau Boeckmann runs a car dealership. He thinks there will always be people who want to own a car and drive it. The car is something "people fall in love with." He thinks people will let the car drive itself in traffic. Then they can drive it when it is fun to drive.

James Lentz works for Toyota. He believes people will still want to own cars. Some might travel long distances each day. Others might have a big family to haul around and things to move.

Peter Schwartz writes about how businesses will look in the future. He says cars will slowly take over more of the driving. Over time, the feelings people have for their cars will fade away.

It will happen in stages, he said. "You don't have to make one big leap."
