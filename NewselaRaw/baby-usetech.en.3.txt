Have you ever seen a 6-year-old use an iPhone? They're pretty good at it. A new study helps explain how this happens.

Most children have been using smartphones and digital tablets like iPads almost since birth.

Not long ago, scientists asked some parents about their children's use of iPhones and iPads. More than one-third said their kids had "touched or scrolled a screen" before their first birthday. Another third said their kids had done so when they were 1 year old.

## Before The Age Of 1

Only a very small number of the parents waited until their children were 4 to show them a touch-screen.

We're not talking about the children of technology experts, either. The families in this survey live in a poorer part of Philadelphia.

In fact, some of the parents had not finished high school. Still, most had a smartphone and a tablet and used the Internet.

Many of the babies and toddlers may have been just playing with the screens. But their parents said at least some of them knew what they were doing.

About 1 in 6 children had used an app before they turned 1. And about 1 in 4 had called someone. The most common age to start using apps was 2. And more than one-third of the children started playing video games when they were 2.

## Some Screen Playtime

The children definitely enjoyed playing with the phones and tablets. And their parents liked it too. Two out of 3 parents said they used the devices to calm their children. About 1 in 3 said they used them to get their children to sleep.

The iPhones and iPads also entertained the children while their parents were busy.

The American Academy of Pediatrics is a group of children's doctors. It says that children should avoid screens until they turn 2.

The answers to the questions surprised the scientists. Dr. Hilda Kabali was the leader of the study.

"We didn't expect (to see) children using the devices from the age of 6 months," said Dr. Kabali. "Some of the children were using the screen for as long as 30 minutes."
