NEW YORK — Apple is turning its retail stores into art galleries. Around the country, Apple Stores will now feature the output of professional photographers and other artists who use iPads, iPhones and Mac computers to create their work.

Travel photographer Austin Mann used an iPhone 6 to take otherworldly photos of an Icelandic glacier. Mann says that when it comes to professional work he now uses an iPhone about as often as he does a high-end camera.

"In the photography industry especially, when you are getting started you are always seeking gear, 'If I could only get this $1,000 lens,'" he says. Using just an iPhone to take great photos encourages people to "shift away from focusing on gear and equipment."

## His Canvas? An iPhone

Apple asked 12 artists to create works on Apple devices, to showcase what the devices can do and to inspire others to get creative as well. The resulting artwork is now displayed both on Apple's website and in all its retail stores.

Just as technology has transformed the way we work and interact with one another, it has also changed the way we create. For painter Roz Hall, that change has meant shifting away from the canvases and paint he started out using in art school to an iPhone app called Brushes. After not painting for many years, Hall in 2010 read about a group of artists who had started using their iPhones and iPads to create artwork. Their example inspired him to try it himself.

The switch from canvas to iPhone was also challenging for Hall, because of the change in scale. Before, he had been creating life-size works. Now, he was painting on a 3.5-inch screen, an entirely different thing.

"What I liked about it was that there was no setup," Hall says, meaning no time has to be spent on gathering materials, stretching canvas, mixing paints, and so on. With traditional painting, he says, so many hours are spent on preparation that by the time you are ready to start, the inspiration may have passed.

## "Connected To The Artwork"

Hall, who lives in Britain and who has shown his work in cities from New York to Shanghai, says he has not painted traditionally for many years. He added that he prefers painting on the iPad to using a laptop or desktop computer. Hall now uses the app Procreate, which allows him to paint with his fingers on his iPad. "You don't feel like you are fighting a computer to create your art — you feel connected to the artwork," he says. "When I first used an iPad, it made me think of cave paintings, or when a child first paints using their finger."

Some artists look at digital painting as "cheating." After all, you can delete mistaken brush strokes. Yet Hall thinks it actually makes artists more daring, because they do not have to worry about the expense of throwing something out and starting all over again.

"If you spent 50 pounds ($75) on canvas and another 50 pounds on paint," he says, "at some point you are going to get careful" about scrapping what you have already done. "You don't want to waste what you spent."

For the Apple project, Hall used Procreate to paint portraits of people he encountered at the university where he teaches. They include a bearded, mustached young man with bright yellow glasses and an intense stare, and a woman in a floppy black hat lost in thought.

## iPhones "Have Opened Up The World"

Alistair Taylor-Young is another of Apple's featured artists. His photography career spans two decades, during which he has shot for fashion brands such as Armani and Fendi and magazines ranging from Conde Nast Traveler to Vogue. For Apple's project, Taylor-Young took photos of rainy cityscapes with the iPhone 6.

Taylor-Young bought an iPhone in 2007, when they first came out.

"The moment I picked up the phone and started taking pictures, it reminded me of photography in its infancy," he says of the early iPhones. "You couldn't focus, change exposure — you just saw something and took a photo."

The quality of phone cameras has certainly improved in the last several years, but it is their ease of use and the fact that they are always on hand that has proven most important. Because smartphone cameras are so easy to use, they encourage picture-taking. In the past, most people took photos only rarely, in order to record special events or trips. Today, many of us use our cameras constantly to capture daily moments.

The spread of digital photography has not made pictures look any better than they did before, Taylor-Young says. However, digital cameras and now iPhones "have opened up the world to people who would have not necessarily thought of taking pictures, or sharing them."
