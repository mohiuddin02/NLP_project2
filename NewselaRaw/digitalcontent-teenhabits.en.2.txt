If you asked adults what they thought of Tyler Oakley, most of them probably would not know who you were talking about. Most have never heard of KingBach or Cameron Dallas. Yet for many teens, these are household names.

Oakley, KingBach and Dallas are some of today's most famous online video makers. They record short videos that are watched by millions of viewers around the world. For young people, online videos have become as popular as traditional media such as movies and television.

## Why They Watch What They Watch

Defy Media is a company that focuses on the media content that teens are interested in. Defy did a study recently to find out why Internet videos are so popular with young people.

It surveyed about 1,350 people nationwide, ages 13 to 24. Defy interviewed 36 people. About 18 of those interviews were in-person in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Minneapolis, and the rest were conducted online. Through the surveys and interviews, Defy asked people how they felt about online videos, and why they watched what they watched.

Defy released its findings on Tuesday. The research suggested that, on average, teens watch 11.3 hours of free online video and 10.8 hours of subscription online video weekly. That is nearly twice as much time as they spend watching TV.

## Personally Connected

Why are online videos so popular? One reason may be that teens feel a personal connection to online videos and the people who make them. According to Defy, 62 percent of 13-to-24-year-olds watch videos online because digital content makes them feel good about themselves.

Andy Tu is executive vice president of marketing at Defy Media. He said young viewers find online videos more relatable than movies or TV. Sixty-seven percent said that they can relate to online content. By comparison, only 41 percent said they can relate to traditional media content.

This might have to do with how online content is made. Tu explained that many people work on a TV show or movie. An idea may start with a writer, but then goes through a team of producers, directors, actors and designers.

## YouTube Stardom

Online videos are simpler. "YouTube has a deeper connection because the content comes from the creator," Tu said. Many online videos are made by individuals recording themselves on their computers or phones. Viewers can see who made these videos, and can relate to them.

Also, viewers tend to have more in common with the makers of online videos than they do with famous performers. One person Defy interviewed said that she loved singer Nicki Minaj, but she found it difficult to form a connection with her.

According to Tu, the teenager said: "Nicki Minaj is all about making money and I can't make money so I can't relate to her."

Some teens consider YouTubers to be role models. An estimated 32 percent of 13-to-17-year-olds, and 26 percent of 18-to-24-year-olds said that they were more likely to look up to a YouTube personality than to a famous actor or performer. Of 18-to-24-year-olds, 52 percent said they feel closer to their favorite YouTubers than they feel to other famous people.

When asked if they could be a YouTube star, more than half of those surveyed said yes. However, when asked if they could be a TV or movie star, only about 40 percent said yes.

## Over 30 And Confused

The study also found that YouTube personalities have a lot of influence on viewers. For example, if Katy Perry is in a commercial for Pepsi, people might not pay much attention. When YouTube personalities recommend products, however, people may be more likely to listen.

About 63 percent of the people Defy surveyed said they would try a product or brand recommended by a YouTube personality. Just 48 percent reported that they would try something recommended by a TV or movie star.

Online videos seem to be getting more and more popular. Tu said he was walking around the Grove shopping center in Los Angeles last weekend when he spotted an event that featured famous online video makers.

According to Tu, there were huge crowds of people gathered to see the Internet stars. Older people walking by did not understand what all the fuss was about. Tu said that everyone older than 30 just looked confused.

Nevertheless, Tu is confident that online videos will become popular with teens and adults alike. As teens get older, Tu thinks they will keep watching online videos. "They are going to continue carrying these viewing habits," he said.
