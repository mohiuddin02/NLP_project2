CALAIS, France â€” A new school began in a migrant camp in France. Its students come from around the world. Some of them are escaping danger in their home countries. Others left because they were very poor. They came to find safety in Europe. They are waiting in the camp. The students hope they will be allowed to stay in Europe.

The school has only one room. Its floor is sandy from the beach nearby. The roof is made of cloth and held up by tree branches. Inside, the students sit at small desks. They are learning French.

## African Man Started School To Improve Lives Of Migrants

Zimako Jones started the school. He is from the country of Nigeria, which is in Africa. About 3,000 migrants live in the camp. Some of the students hope to stay in France.

Five Sudanese helped Zimako build the school. Sudan is also in Africa. Zimako wanted to improve the lives of people in the camp. He also wants to bring people together. Many of the migrants have very hard lives.

The school teaches French and English. Students can also learn how to paint. Another class is tai chi. It is a Chinese form of exercise. All the classes are packed. Most of the students are adults.

## Classroom Is Filled With Hopes And Dreams

The students have many hopes and dreams. One student wrote that they should never give up.

Students get notebooks and pens. Chris Jaumotte is an art teacher. She bought the paints and brushes for her art class.

At one desk, a young African made a painting. It showed migrants in boats crossing the Mediterranean Sea. The boats were full of people. It is a very dangerous journey. The African called his picture "Dangerous Days."

Zimako thinks big. He wants to build a second school in the camp. The new one will be even larger and teach even more people.
