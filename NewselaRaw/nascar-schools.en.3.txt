WASHINGTON — There is a lot of math and science that is involved in driving a race car.

NASCAR, the racing organization, wants to teach kids the science behind the racing.

Recently, NASCAR said that it will promote education on STEM subjects. STEM is short for science, technology, engineering and math. The lesson plans will teach kids how STEM is involved in races like the Daytona 500. It plans to encourage STEM subjects inside classrooms and out.

## Racing And Winning Are "Pure Science"

The NASCAR Acceleration Nation project focuses on the laws of motion. It calls them the three D's of speed — downforce, drafting and drag. Downforce is the downward force created by a moving car. Drafting is the idea that two or more cars move faster when they are lined up one in front of the other. Drag is the force of resistance. Race cars have to push through a lot of air as they go around the track, which slows them down.

NASCAR wants to show the fun side of engineering and math, said Brent Dewar. He is a top official with NASCAR. Dewar also wants to encourage fans to see NASCAR in a new way.

"A lot of people see cars racing and they love the sport for the sporting element of cars winning, and racing and passing," Dewar said. "Behind all of that is pure science."

## Math In The Passenger Seat

Carl Edwards was a substitute teacher in Missouri long before he became a race car driver. He is known for back-flipping off cars after winning races. As a sub, it was tough for him to keep students' attention. He hopes that racing will get kids interested in science.

Edwards said that science is involved in every lap around the track. Drivers must think about how to avoid crashing at different parts of the race. They also must figure out the amount of fuel used by the engine at different speeds. Edwards still uses the science and math he learned in school. However, he wishes he had learned even more.

"You can take any part of the car and talk about how it was engineered and why it's designed the way it is," he said. "There's a physics or a math or a science lesson in any of that."

## So That's Why Cars Line Up That Way!

NASCAR has teamed up with Scholastic Corporation, which publishes books for kids. They will develop fact sheets and quizzes mainly for middle school teachers to use. One question asks why do race cars in a drafting formation go faster? In a drafting formation, the cars are lined up behind each other.

The answer is that the air acts like a vacuum. It sucks the rear cars forward. Leading cars also get a boost. The trailing cars push high-pressure air over the leading cars' spoiler. These are the wings at the back of a car that help keep it from flying into the air.

NASCAR plans to mail more than 7,400 kits to teachers. Teachers can also go online to download the material and see demonstrations. A website will feature math and other games. Special activities will be available on race days.

There has been a big push recently to promote STEM education. Some people are worried that the United States is falling behind in these subjects. Also, many jobs will be created in science and technology fields. There is a need for educated people who can fill these positions. NASCAR hopes that their lesson plans will get kids dreaming about working in these types of jobs some day.
