INDIANAPOLIS â€” The state of Indiana passed a law last week. It has made people angry. The law is the state's religious-freedom law. Some people say that the law is bad for people who are gay. They say the law will let people treat them unfairly.

Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Tuesday that he wants lawmakers to fix the law. He wants them to make it more clear. He wants to show that the new law was not meant to treat people who are gay unfairly. People who are gay are attracted to people of their own gender.

Pence did defend the law. He said it was meant to protect religious freedom. Still, he said he has been meeting with lawmakers to answer concerns about the law.

The Republican governor signed the religious-freedom law last week. He said he did not mean for the law to treat people unfairly. He did not think that lawmakers meant to be unfair, either, he said.

## Worries About The Law

The law stops the state from making other laws that make it difficult for a person to follow his or her religion. Under the law, a "person" can be a religious group or a business.

People who are gay are not mentioned in the law. However, some people say the law will affect them. It is designed to protect businesses and people who do not want gay customers, they say.

Businesses and other groups have said they are worried about what the law means. These include Apple and the NCAA, which runs college sports. The people who run the NCAA work in Indiana. Some states will not let government money be used to pay for travel to Indiana.

The Indianapolis Star newspaper said Tuesday that the law needed to be fixed.

The Star printed an opinion article. It was titled "FIX THIS NOW."

The newspaper says the arguments caused by the law have been bad for the state. It said the law could hurt business in the state in the future.

## Protest In Arkansas

Meanwhile, Arkansas was ready to pass a law like Indiana's. A lot of businesses and gay-rights supporters are upset about it.

The Arkansas law would stop state and local governments from interfering with a person's religion. Arkansas lawmakers said they will not change their planned law.

"There's not really any place to make any changes now," said Republican Bob Ballinger. He proposed the law. "If there are questions in two years, we can fix it."

Hundreds of protesters filled Arkansas' government building. They argued against the proposed law. They held signs that read "Discrimination is not a Christian Value." They chanted "Shame on you" at Ballinger.

More than 12 other states are thinking about laws like the one in Indiana. Nineteen other states already have similar laws.

## Will Law Scare Business Away?

Republican Asa Hutchinson is the governor of Arkansas. He had said he was worried about an earlier way that the planned law was written. He thinks the new way that the law is written is OK. He said he will sign it, making it a law.

Mark Stodola is the major of Little Rock, Arkansas. He asked Hutchinson to turn down the planned law. He said it would make it harder for the state to bring in business.

Hutchinson promised to bring jobs to the state when he ran for governor. People who do not like the planned law say the law scares away businesses with jobs.

Apple boss Tim Cook wrote in The Washington Post over the weekend. He argued against the Indiana law and the planned Arkansas law. Wal-Mart has said that the possible law sends the wrong message about Arkansas. The bosses at Wal-Mart work in Arkansas.

A lot of groups have reacted to the law in Indiana. The band Wilco canceled a May concert. Another group canceled a big meeting in the state. Their decisions cost the state money.
