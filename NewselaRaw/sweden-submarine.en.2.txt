STOCKHOLM — Sweden is worried that the past has come back to haunt it. The Scandinavian country is searching for a submarine that has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.

Swedish naval ships, helicopters and soldiers searched carefully through the waters around the capital of Stockholm on Monday. For four days they have been looking for signs of a foreign submarine. Officials believe that the craft entered Swedish waters illegally.

While Sweden hasn't accused any country specifically — and the Russian capital denies involvement — the incident caused fear throughout the Baltic Sea region. For many, Russia is the natural suspect. In recent months, Russian forces have been accused of a series of border violations on land, sea and air.

## Sweden Releases Photo Of Mystery Craft

"Closely following events in the Swedish territorial waters," Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics wrote on Twitter. The incident, he added, "may become a game changer of the security in the whole Baltic Sea region."

Latvia is another country on the Baltic Sea. It is also a country that used to be controlled by Russia.

Swedish military officials say there have been three sightings of the elusive craft since Friday. On Sunday, they released a photograph taken at a distance of what they said could be the mystery vessel. The photo shows a dark speck surrounded by foaming water.

Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said more than 200 people were involved in the operation. However, he stressed that the search wasn't like Sweden's submarine hunts in the 1980s when Sweden used depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.

## Growing Fears Of Russia In Baltic

The search made headline news in countries across the Baltic Sea region including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. All three are former Soviet republics that have been spooked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this year, Russia seized the Crimea region of Ukraine. Since then, it has continued to support people in eastern Ukraine who want to be a part of Russia.

Russia justified its intervention in Ukraine by saying that Ukrainians were discriminating against ethnic Russians in the country. What has alarmed the Baltic states is that a top Russian official recently made similar claims about their countries. In addition, Russia recently arrested an Estonian security official, who was charged with spying. It also seized a Lithuanian fishing boat for allegedly entering Russia's territorial waters.

There is now growing fear throughout the Baltics that Russia may support any rebels in Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania who also want to join Russia.

Estonia has stepped up its monitoring of its territorial waters. Its border guard is on the lookout for unusual activities, spokesman Priit Parkna said.

In Lithuania, the events in Sweden sparked concerns over the safety of a floating natural-gas import terminal. The terminal is currently being transported on the Baltic Sea to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda. It will be key to Lithuania's plans to reduce its reliance on Russian oil.

## Russia Says Swedes Overreacting

Meanwhile, Russian media claimed the Swedes were overreacting. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper even suggested that the submarine hunt could be a trick by the Swedish military to boost its defense budget. Sweden's military has undergone a series of cuts since the Cold War.

Russia's official government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta questioned whether there was any submarine at all. It noted the Swedes hadn't found anything.

"Either Sweden's echo location equipment is working badly or, as the old saying goes, the eyes of fear see danger everywhere," the paper said.

A Russian Defense Ministry official pointed fingers at a Dutch submarine that participated in an exercise with the Swedish navy last week. He suggested Sweden should ask the Netherlands for an explanation.

The Dutch navy said that its submarine left Sweden on Thursday and had been in Estonia since early Friday. In Sweden, Armed Forces spokesman Philip Simon said the Dutch submarine was not what triggered the Swedish search.

In 1981, a Soviet sub carrying nuclear weapons was stranded off Sweden's southeastern coast. The incident caused an 11-day diplomatic standoff. Eventually, Swedish authorities allowed the submarine to return home.
