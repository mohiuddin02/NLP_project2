Which is healthier for elementary and middle school students: a lunch packed at home or a lunch purchased from the school cafeteria? The answer has surprised many people.

Researchers did a study recently to try to answer this question. They observed 337 kids at a dozen schools in Houston, Texas.

They found that the average home-packed lunch didn't meet nutritional standards. Home-packed lunches didn't contain enough vegetables, fruit, meat (or meat alternatives) or whole grains. They also included too much salt, soda and dessert.

The researchers published their findings in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

Since 2012, schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program have had to follow the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In other words, meals served in many school cafeterias have to meet strict health standards. Lunches packed at home do not have to meet these standards.

## By The Numbers

In the Houston schools studied, the gaps between cafeteria food and packed lunches were significant. Researchers noticed a number of differences:

— Cafeteria lunches included 2.5 cups of fruit. Elementary school students' home-packed lunches included only 0.33 of a cup of fruit. Middle school students' home-packed lunches included just 0.29 cup.

— Cafeteria lunches served up 3.75 cups of vegetables. Younger students' packed lunches included only 0.07 of a cup of vegetables. Middle schoolers brought just 0.11 of a cup of vegetables.

— Students should eat at least 4 ounces of whole grains during lunch. Packed lunches for elementary school kids contained only 0.22 ounce of whole grains. Middle school students' packed lunches had 0.31 ounce of whole grains.

— Elementary school lunches included 8 to 10 ounces of meat or a meat alternative. Home lunches had only 1.87 ounces. Middle school kids packed even less: 1.63 ounces.

Overall, home-packed lunches were missing a lot of essential nutrition. What did they have instead? Among elementary school students, they included 4.43 ounces of sugary drinks, 0.58 of a serving of snack chips and 0.67 of a serving of dessert. Sugary drinks, chips and dessert are not served in many cafeterias.

## The Bad And The Good

Researchers also found that the sodium, or salt, level of packed lunches was higher than federal guidelines recommend. Cafeteria lunches sold in elementary schools can't have more than 640 milligrams (mg) of sodium. Meals that elementary school students brought from home contained 1,110 mg, on average. Cafeteria lunches sold in middle schools can have up to 710 mg of sodium, but middle schoolers' packed lunches had 1,003 mg of sodium.

The study included a lot of bad news about home-packed lunches. There was also some good news, however.

Calories are a common measurement of how much food a meal contains. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, elementary school lunches should contain between 550 and 650 calories. The home-packed lunches observed in the study averaged 661 calories, but because only 85 percent of the food was eaten, only 559 calories were actually eaten. Middle school lunches averaged 616 calories, within the range recommended for middle schoolers.

Federal standards recommend that fewer than 10 percent of total calories come from saturated fat. Saturated fat is a kind of fat that is considered unhealthy. Lunches packed for elementary school students delivered 9.92 percent of their calories in the form of saturated fat. For middle school home-packed lunches, that figure was 9.03 percent.

## Packing Some Surprises

The study produced several more findings. Some of them were surprising. The lunches packed at home for elementary school students were more expensive than the lunches students could have bought at school, the researchers reported. The total cost of the ingredients in these lunches ranged from 69 cents to $4.78 per meal, with an average of $1.93. The average school lunch would have only cost $1.80.

The opposite was true of middle school lunches. The cost of middle school lunches packed at home averaged $1.76, less than the $2.05 that students pay to buy lunch at school.

Researchers also learned that home-packed lunches at poorer schools cost more than home-packed lunches at richer schools. Researchers were surprised by this finding. It seems expected that students at higher-income schools would pack more expensive lunches.

"This is a new finding that warrants more investigation," the researchers wrote.

There may be more studies of packed lunches in the future. Now that schools have improved the quality of lunches they serve, it is time for policymakers to turn their attention to parents and others who pack lunches at home, the researchers concluded.

The researchers pointed out that home-packed lunches could have a large effect on student health. However, much research has been done on them. Given how many American children are overweight, perhaps more attention should be paid to the food packed in their lunch boxes.
