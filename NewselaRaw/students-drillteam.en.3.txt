CAMDEN, N.J. â€” Inside a water tower in a rough part of this rough city, girls and a few boys peeled off coats and scarves. The kids gathered in giddy groups, chatted, laughed and practiced dance moves and cartwheels. A man pulled drums from a storage space.

At the center of it all was a cheerful woman. She wore orange jeans and a baseball cap.

"Get ready!" the woman, Tawanda Jones, yelled. Her voice soared over the noise.

The crowd, including a few parents watching from the side, fell silent.

## Drum's Thunderous Beat

"One line!" Jones hollered.

Three dozen pairs of feet shuffled across the concrete floor. The youngsters organized themselves from tallest to smallest. They did it with speed that comes from practice.

Jones sent them marching. She adjusted their arms, shoulders and posture as they stomped the length of the room to the thunderous beat of the drum.

She spotted someone chewing gum and ordered her to spit it out, then swooped down to pick up a pair of eyeglasses that had flown off the face of a marcher. She yelled advice, orders and encouragement.

It was another night of practice for the group called the Camden Sophisticated Sisters Drill Team.

Jones started the team as a teenager in 1986. She and her husband, Robert, have guided the team from practicing under highway overpasses to performing on "Dancing with the Stars." They've also provided a safe place for children in one of the nation's most troubled cities.

Jones relies on people giving money to send team members to shows across the country. She also uses the money to buy costumes, drums and meals on the road. Practices take place in the abandoned water tower. The space is warm and dry but has a moldy ceiling. There isn't enough room for the entire team, which has about 320 members. So Jones splits up the practice. She holds it four nights a week for different groups.

## Watching Over Them

Each practice seems to bring a new problem.

"What happened to your face?" Jones asked a girl who arrived tonight with marks on her cheeks. The teenager said she had been fighting with classmates who bullied her.

A tall young man approached Jones to say "hi." The young man had been beaten with a gun a few days earlier in a robbery. "How you doing, baby?" Jones said.

Two other drill team members have been shot, with one of them permanently injured.

"They come in here with war marks," Jones said.

But the drill team keeps going. Jones also does all she can to keep the children in school. She meets with their parents or other adults. She wants to be sure someone is watching over them.

"This whole thing has to do with saving lives, not just marching in front of the cameras," she said.

Jones grew up in Camden. It is considered one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. She attended its public schools and still lives here with Robert, their three children and her mother. Her stepbrother was shot dead six years ago.

When she was 13, her classmates drifted into gangs and drugs. Jones looked for a way to keep herself off the streets. She joined a city-run drill team. As the oldest member surrounded by kids half her age, Jones basically became the troupe's leader. When funding for the team dried up and it folded, parents asked Jones to start a new one.

## Team's Strict Rules

Her grandfather bought uniforms and three drums. Jones could not afford to rent a hall. So the drill team practiced under bridges. They practiced in parks or on streets. Robert, her high school sweetheart, played drums as Jones taught dance steps and led the team through marches and exercises.

Jones attended college for two years. Then she dropped out to care for her grandfather. She and Robert oversaw drill team practices, fundraisers and shows in their free time.

Last year Jones quit her job so she could work full time for the drill team. Her daughter, LaQuicia, 23, volunteers time to choreograph routines; her oldest son, Robert Jr., 17, helps his father on drums at practices.

The Sophisticated Sisters have to follow Jones' strict rules: Children must complete 200 hours of community service a year, keep up with their homework and keep up at least a C average.

Jones takes the older children on college tours. She often pays for the trips herself. Destiny Bush, now 24, went on one of the tours, visiting three universities with Jones after joining the drill team as an eighth-grader.

"I come from a family where over 90 percent of the people don't even have high school diplomas," said Bush. Now she is pursuing her master's in education at Washington State University.

"She told me I was worthy, that I could succeed," Bush said.
