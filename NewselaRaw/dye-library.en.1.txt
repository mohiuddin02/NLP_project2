RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina State University's newest library is a little strange. For now, it consists mainly of 98,000 glass vials and slim envelopes containing cloth samples.

But chemistry students have begun the painstaking work of turning the huge collection of dyes, test swatches and documents into an online resource. When they're done, crime-scene investigators and a host of other kinds of researchers around the world will have an enormously valuable new tool. They will be able to search through three-dimensional models of the thousands of unique molecules associated with particular dyes. Alongside these models they will find detailed information about a dye's attributes.

The materials in the university's new Max A. Weaver Dye Library were all donated by the Tennessee-based Eastman Chemical Company. Eventually, however, other chemical companies will be approached to see if they too have dyes in storage they're willing to donate.

## Creating A Very Powerful Tool

The library is part of N.C. State's push to become a national leader in forensic science research — that is, research aimed at finding new and better scientific tools for the fight against crime. The university has created a multidisciplinary Forensic Sciences Institute and has several forensics projects underway involving about 30 faculty members across several colleges and departments. It's also planning the state's first master's program in forensic science.

The idea behind the library was to create a powerful tool for forensic investigators. The online resource will make it easier to identify the sources of dyed fibers from such things as clothing, car interiors, furniture and carpeting.

The library also will be open to other kinds of researchers, however, and is expected to become an important tool for scientists working in a host of disciplines.

"The intention is basically advancing science for the common good in forensics and other areas, too, including some we can't even foresee," said David Hinks, the Institute's director. "It's an amazing array of compounds, and we haven't even begun to understand its full potential."

## A Multitude Of User Potential

Likely users include chemists seeking new dyes for textiles and paper that are friendly to the environment; medical researchers interested in dyes for use in treating cancer; and even engineers trying to make solar panels more effective at absorbing the energy from sunlight.

Also, some of the dyes could be used by the military to develop camouflage that's more effective in darkness. For example, fabrics treated with dyes that absorb infrared light would be harder to see through night-vision devices.

For cancer therapy, substances in the collection may turn out to perform well at tinting cancer cells, Hinks said. Such tinting would allow surgeons to better see whether they have removed an entire tumor. Other surgeons might dye cancer cells, then kill those cells by aiming lasers at them.

Eastman's carefully organized collection of dyes, which dates to the 1940s, was legendary among textile insiders. But after the U.S. textile industry waned in the 1980s and Eastman eventually got out of the dye business, it was largely neglected.

The samples of dye and of patches of cloth that they were tested on are housed at N.C. State's College of Textiles.

There are so many dyes, Hinks said, that NCSU gave up on counting all of them and instead counted part of the collection and estimated the rest.

## Making Sense Out Of The Collection

The glass vials are lined up in rows in the drawers of a long wall of filing cabinets in a range of hues that go well beyond the rainbow. Some are powders, some tiny crystals or nuggets. Most have small, fading labels that bear hand-drawn diagrams of the dye molecules inside.

Undergraduate students have begun digitizing information about each dye molecule. That information is then put into a database that can be searched by chemical compounds or fragments of compounds and by other attributes, such as how they perform when heated or exposed to light.

Once a compound with a desired characteristic is found, the ability to search by fragment will make it easier to locate other compounds with the same characteristic. And what is known about these dyes and their performance can be used to design dyes that haven't been created yet.

The students have only digitized about 1,000 of the dyes so far. The rest are expected to take a couple of years, even with a small army of 20 undergraduate students working on the task during the school year, and half a dozen or so in summer.

## One Man's Detailed Work

The multihued collection represents the life's work of chemist Max Weaver, who worked for Eastman for 29 years beginning in 1958. Weaver was the company's most productive inventor. He was known for being unusually careful and precise in his methods of storage and documentation.

Weaver learned how to invent while on the job. For much of his career, he worked side by side with chemists with much more schooling, but he more than held his own.

Weaver was the first person to win the top two awards of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists in the same year. By the time of his death in 2012, he held more than 260 patents.

Weaver created the single largest portion of the dye library, but more than a dozen other chemists also contributed.

Now, once it's online, their work will become permanently preserved.
