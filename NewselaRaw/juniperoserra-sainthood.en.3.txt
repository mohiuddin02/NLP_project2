Junipero Serra, the Spanish priest who helped spread Christianity in California in the 1700s by building missions up and down the state, is loved by some. Yet others hate him.

At the time Serra lived, California was controlled by Spain. The missions were outposts, or forts, used by the Spanish military and Catholic priests.

The missions were built to spread Christianity to Native Americans — and Native Americans were the ones forced to build them.

Many admire him for giving up a comfortable life in Spain to come to North America. Others say he took advantage of Native Americans, forcing them to work, often in harsh conditions.

## A Good Example

Pope Francis recently announced that Serra will become a saint — a holy person who lived a good life that can be an example to others.

The pope told reporters that Serra helped spread Christianity in the United States.

The announcement was a surprise to many people, who thought Serra would never become a saint. That is because of opposition from Native American groups.

The pope is planning to visit the United States in the fall. He may visit California for Serra's canonization — the ceremony to declare him a saint.

In the Roman Catholic Church, becoming a saint is a long process with several steps. Serra was beatified in 1986, a step in which the church documented one miracle that Serra had performed. They said a nun in Missouri was cured of a serious disease after people prayed to Serra.

## Strong Opinions On Sainthood

Native American groups have strongly been against Serra becoming a saint. They say the Native Americans who built the missions across California were forced to work and often were treated badly.

Valentin Lopez is a Native American activist who is disappointed by the pope's decision. Lopez hopes the Catholic Church will reconsider Serra's sainthood.

"Pope Francis is from Argentina and knows the history of the New World," Lopez said, referring to Spanish and other Europeans who mistreated native peoples.

"But maybe he thinks it's more important that he brought Christianity to the New World than what happened to the native population," Lopez said.

Elias Castillo recently wrote a book called "A Cross of Thorns: The Enslavement of California's Indians by the Spanish Missions."

He said the general opinion of Serra as a great man is a "horrible lie." Statues of Serra stand at all of California's 21 missions and at the state Capitol building.

"I'm astounded. I couldn't believe the pope was doing this," Castillo said. He thinks there will be protests by Native Americans.

The Catholic Church has apologized for how Indians were treated, Castillo said, calling Serra "one of their great monsters."

## "You Can't Change The Past"

Another Native American, Andrew Galvan of the Ohlone tribe, said he was very happy to hear of Serra's sainthood. Galvan helps to run the Mission Dolores in San Francisco. His ancestors were converted to Christianity at the missions.

"I'm ecstatic," Galvan said.

He admits Native Americans were treated poorly at the missions, but he does not blame Serra. He blames colonialism. During the period of colonialism, the Spanish and other Europeans came to the New World to acquire natural resources, like gold and silver. They took over land and made the local people work for them.

"You can't change the past," Galvan said. "The bottom line is I believe Junipero Serra was a very good person in a very bad situation, which I call colonialism."

Pope Francis' announcement came as a surprise to many people who thought Native Americans would continue to block Serra's sainthood.

## A Missionary's Life

Robert Senkewicz is a history professor at Santa Clara University. The school was started by Serra in 1777. He believes things have calmed down since Serra's beatification in the 1980s, when things were "very intense."

How will Serra be remembered? Will he be known for the poor treatment of Native Americans or just as a missionary spreading Christianity in a new land?

Senkewicz, who wrote a book on Serra, said some saints were known for helping the poor while others were known for being great scholars. Serra, he believes, will be known for "giving up a very, very prosperous life in Spain for a difficult missionary life."
