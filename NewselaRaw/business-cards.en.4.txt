SPOKANE VALLEY, Wash. — Once a month collectors come to Spokane Valley Sportscards to try to make a little money. They break open boxes of sports cards. They're looking players with big names. The cards of some athletes are worth hundreds of dollars.

Joseph Branda is a regular at the Sportscards shop. He is known for taking risks.

He once bought a $600 box of basketball cards. His card collection might be worth as much as a car. On this Saturday, the others hold back their spending. But Branda asks for another box of football cards. It costs $140.

Branda, 22, quickly goes through the box. He opens six packs and flips through football players.

## Card Gets A Shout-Out

He tosses away most of them. Then Branda's eyes widen. He breaks into a smile.

"RG III!" he calls out.

It's a hit. He's scored Robert Griffin III, the starting quarterback for the Washington football team. The card is autographed. It also has a piece of his jersey attached to it.

All conversation in the room stops. Several of the others huddle around him. They stare at the card.

"Whoa!"

"Oh, that's awesome!"

The shop's owner, Alan Bisson, looks up the value: $150.

"That's what I'm looking for!" Branda says.

## A Thrilling Hunt

The third Saturday of each month is trading night. The regulars who come to Bisson's shop are not interested, however, in making trades.

They're here for the thrill of the hit. They come month after month, hoping they will turn up one of the collectibles. Cards that were printed in limited number are collectible and worth more money.

"It's like pulling the handle on a slot machine," says Bisson, 60. The shopowner admits that he's one of his own best customers. "It's the chance of pulling the big one."

His love of cards is what drew him into this business 20 years ago. He runs the store from an old house. In what was once a living room, racks of card boxes block the windows.

On good days, maybe a dozen people walk in. There are many days, though, when it's just Bisson.

A number of those who show up are looking to sell, not buy. Their collections are usually from the 1990s, when sports cards were popular. But card makers produced too many cards then. Now people have boxes of worthless cards. It's as good as garbage, Bisson says.

## One Collector Has 400,000 Cards

Most of the card business has moved online, Bisson says. At the moment, trading night keeps the shop in business.

Zach, 9, may be the youngest there. He has been coming since December. He picked up a love for sports from his father.

"Instead of watching cartoons in the morning," Zach says, "I get up and watch 'Sports Center.'"

At some point, many kids outgrow the hobby. Branda has inherited many of his friends' collections. He has about 400,000 cards.

The regulars say their family, their friends — wives and girlfriends, especially — don't get it: Why would they spend so much money on cards?

"It's a better hobby than doing drugs and being in a gang," says Scott Brewster. He's 20 years old and in college.

## Some Cards Worth Big Bucks

Sometimes they earn some money off their expensive hobby. Branda has sold a card, signed by eight Yankees who played in the 1996 World Series, for $750. Brewster made $300 on a card autographed by two NBA players. He bought it for just $25 at a yard sale.

As trading night winds down, Bisson adds up their bills. One customer racks up a tab of $643.50. It's so big that he doesn't want his name printed on the bill. He's worried what his wife will say.

For Branda, it's $260. For Brewster, $140. He can only pay part of what he owes. He will pay the rest when he's back next month, with more money and ready to try his luck again.
