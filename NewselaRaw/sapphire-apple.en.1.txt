CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple is investing heavily in sapphire — not the precious gem, but a synthetic version that is nearly scratch-proof and more sensitive to the touch.

It also oozes the luxury feel that Apple craves.

While the ever-secretive company has been mum on its plans, Apple has been stockpiling patents about its use. Recently, the technology company signed a $578 million deal with a manufacturer to grow a man-made version of the mineral at a massive Mesa, Arizona, plant. The facility will pump out more sapphire than the rest of the producers in the world combined when it reaches full capacity, said Eric Virey. He is an analyst at research company Yole Développement.

That has triggered wild speculation that iPhones will soon receive a luxurious upgrade. By using sapphire, one of the hardest minerals in the world after diamond, Apple could give consumers a much tougher screen. Experts say sapphire is not only harder than glass, but more sensitive to the touch. The material will perhaps help Apple as it tries to feel its way into new industries such as mobile payments, gaming and medicine.

"It opens up a lot of doors for Apple," said Matt Margolis, an analyst at PTT Research.

## A Big Risk Investment

Current models of the iPhone already contain touches of sapphire, which shields the camera lens and the fingerprint scanner. With an increased supply, analysts predict Apple will use the material to make screens for the next version of the iPhone and perhaps for a wearable device like a smartwatch. The next generation iPhone is widely expected to be unveiled next week. Apple and GT Advanced Technologies, the manufacturer with which it is working, declined to comment.

It's a big investment, even for deep-pocketed Apple. Sapphire is far more expensive than the glass it now uses. However, Virey said that manufacturers often have to take chances to distinguish themselves from the pack in the fiercely competitive smartphone market.

"The display remains one of the major opportunities for differentiation," he said.

When searching for materials for smartphone screens, manufacturers' key concerns are hardness and transparency. Sapphire, which is clear in its pure form, is a top choice, said Andrew Hsu. He is director at Synaptics, which develops touch-screens.

"Other than the fact that it's expensive, it's pretty much a better material than glass," he said.

## Move Over Gorilla Glass

Sapphire's hardness means that a screen made of it would likely be more difficult to scratch or crack than Gorilla Glass, a chemically strengthened glass Apple has used in recent iPhones, experts say. Its toughness could be a strong selling point. According to SquareTrade, which sells warranties for electronics, 11 percent of iPhone users have a device with a cracked screen.

But sapphire has a softer side. Touch-screen devices recognize a user's finger by detecting the change in the electrical field above the display. Sapphire has better electrical properties than glass, enabling it to pick up on touch more easily, experts say. GT has claimed that sapphire performed 42 percent better than Gorilla Glass in touch testing.

A spokesman for Corning, which manufactures Gorilla Glass, defended the product's durability and sensitivity. Experts note that the toughness of sapphire depends on how it's cut. A screen made from the mineral might not necessarily hold up better than one made of Gorilla Glass.

## Improvements For Users Wearing Gloves

Touch-screen technology is already advanced, but analysts see ample room for improvement. With a sapphire screen, Apple might be able to extend fingerprint sensing across the display. That could make online payments easier by letting users register the prints of multiple fingers or sign their signature more easily on their smartphone screens, Margolis said.

Sapphire screens would also allow for more precise typing, and they could even recognize instruments ranging from styluses to old-fashioned pencils, experts say. A more responsive screen also promises to make virtual games more engaging.

"This can improve the user experience in gaming, typing and playing instruments in apps like Garage Band," according to Carolina Milanesi. She is chief of research and head of U.S. business at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.

Users might also be able to use their phones while wearing gloves, a boon for people in industries such as medicine, Hsu said.

## Sapphire Could Be The Next Trend

The technology could also make Apple products more useful to preschoolers. Although many young children love technology, touch-screen devices with glass screens do not always pick up the movements of their tiny fingers, Hsu said.

What's more, sapphire is more dense than glass, meaning Apple may be able to use a thinner layer to shield its devices, Hsu said. With slim phones in fashion, that's no small consideration, he noted.

"Everyone's looking at ways to save tenths of millimeters," Hsu said.

Apple was not the first to adopt sapphire, but it may be the company to set the standard for the smartphone industry. Luxury smartphone-maker Vertu offers phones with sapphire screens, and Kyocera recently released a device with a sapphire display.

Analysts say smartphone manufacturers will be watching Apple as they debate whether to use sapphire in their own devices. Of course, if sapphire spreads across the market, Apple would have to find a new way to wow consumers. Could a diamond-encrusted screen be next?

"I wouldn't rule that out," Hsu said, laughing.
