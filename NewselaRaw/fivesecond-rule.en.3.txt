Have you ever heard of the five-second rule? It's an old belief about dropping food on the floor and having five seconds to pick it up. The rule says that if you wait longer than five seconds, then you shouldn't eat it.

Recently, science students at Aston University in England tested the five-second rule. They claim to have found some truth to it.

They discovered that the faster you pick food up off the floor, the less likely it is to contain bacteria that could make you sick. Their study was released on the university's website on March 10.

Students worked with professor Anthony Hilton. They dropped toast, pasta, cookies and sticky candy on the floor and then left the food on the floor for three to 30 seconds.

Students then checked the transfer of two common bacteria, called E.coli and staph.

## From Floor To Food

Normally bacteria cannot be seen by the human eye. You need a microscope to see bacteria. It's a single-celled creature and is very tiny. Millions of bacteria could fit on the tip of a needle.

There are good bacteria and bad bacteria. Yogurt has good bacteria in it. Humans have bacteria in their guts to help break down food. All bacteria feed off the surroundings they live within.

In some cases, bacteria find a home in the human body. Bad bacteria can cause infections in the body like a sore throat, tooth cavities and pneumonia, which affects the lungs.

But the study in England found that bacteria do a pretty lousy job at moving from the floor to food. That is especially true when the food isn't given much time on the ground.

The type of surface mattered, too. The study found that bacteria were least likely to spread from carpet to food. The study also found that bacteria were most likely to move from tile floors to food.

But don't go picking fallen Fritos out of the rug just yet.

The study goes against an earlier one done by scientists at Clemson University in South Carolina. They studied a bacteria called Salmonella.

The scientists in South Carolina tested how fast Salmonella made its way from floors to bologna and bread. They discovered that it happened instantly.

## Zero Better Than One

The British study hasn't been published yet in a science magazine. That makes it impossible for other scientists to copy the study and find out if the results are right or wrong.

Jeffrey T. LeJeune is a food safety expert in Ohio. He says he would be very "cautious about the results" of the British study.

LeJeune said eating food off the floor is not a good idea. It goes against nearly all the advice for stopping illnesses caused by eating food.

Scientists also know from past studies that our floors are littered with nasty bacteria that can make us sick. Bacteria are even present in the homes of people who have been educated about proper cleaning.

Another problem with the British study is that it didn't test Norovirus. It is a virus that causes about half of illnesses from food, LeJeune said. Viruses are even smaller than bacteria. The flu is a type of virus. The British study doesn't look at how fast Norovirus gets transferred to food.

LeJeune's bottom line: Don't eat food off the floor. Ever.

It may be true that fewer bacteria get transferred to food in five seconds than in 10 seconds, "but waiting zero seconds is far better than waiting any seconds," he said. "I think one second is too long."
