Rudo Boothe and his daughter count down along with the microwave timer. They also add up the cans of tomato sauce in their grocery cart when they go to the supermarket.

Boothe's daughter may be just 19 months old. But he says that's not too early to introduce her to shapes, numbers and word games whenever possible.

"My attempt is to make numbers very important," said Boothe. Greatness is his goal. The Florida technology expert says his professional success — anyone's professional success, actually — is due to learning to read and do math at age 4.

Boothe may seem like a super competitive parent who wants his child to learn to read before her classmates. Instead, he is laying the groundwork for his daughter's future ability to make money. Scottish researchers say that better reading and math skills at age 7 mean bigger paychecks later in life.

## Reading Early For Later Success

Educational skills predict future salaries better than even intelligence, education, and family wealth. That is what a study at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland found. American educators agree that early childhood education is critical for later success. But they say that other influences shouldn't be ignored.

Good things happen to children who read better at age 7, said Timothy Bates, a professor at the University of Edinburgh. They "are earning significantly more" as adults.

How much more? Bates studied 17,000 people in the United Kingdom for 40 years. Youngsters who were better at reading and math had higher incomes, nicer homes and better jobs when they grew up. They did better even than people who were smarter or had richer parents, but weren't as good at reading or math. A 7-year-old who read even a level higher earned $8,000 more at age 45.

Bates said that the effect would be stronger in the United States. Here, rewards are based more on how well you do your job.

This means educational skills will be important through a person's life. It doesn't matter how smart you are, Bates said. Also, this still holds true even if you stay in school longer or you come from a richer family.

## Study Doesn't Add Up, Some Say

Hold it right there, say a bunch of U.S. educators. They agree that early learning is important for job success. Early learning creates kindergarten-ready kids. These kids eventually become job-ready adults. But the U.S. educators point out that the amount of money a child's family has definitely affects what happens.

For starters, only 40 percent to 55 percent of American children attend good pre-kindergarten programs, said Libby Doggett of the U.S. Department of Education.

There, kids learn the basics of reading and math, of course. But they are also introduced to important skills like self-control, problem-solving and decision-making. These also are tied to future success.

"It's not about ability," Doggett said. "We create ability. And we create it early on."

The kids most likely to miss good pre-K programs are — you guessed it — poor children, said Greg J. Duncan. He is a professor at University of California-Irvine. That they aren't in these programs partly explains the difference in educational abilities. There's a big gap in reading and math skills between nation's richest and poorest kindergarteners

## A Divide Between Rich And Poor

Even worse, American schools do not erase this gap, he said.

"Most of the gap comes from what goes on in the home," Duncan said. Intelligence is part of it, he added. But it also comes from different styles of raising children.

Parents can make reading and math lessons more exciting, said Silvia P. Tarafa. She is the principal of the Key Biscayne K-8 Center in Florida. They can introduce educational ideas through daily life. For example:

When parents read with their children, they should choose nonfiction books on topics their children are interested in, she said. When parents bake cakes, they can use measuring cups and spoons to teach fractions. At the store, compare prices, and count your change with your child. Show that four quarters make a dollar. And when they paint pictures, frame the artwork. That requires measuring the length and width.

When a parent introduces an educational idea to a young child, that child will make the connection later when he or she learns about it in school, Tarafa said.
