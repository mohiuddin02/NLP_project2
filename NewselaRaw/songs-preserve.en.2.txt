WASHINGTON â€” Ben E. King's "Stand by Me" is one of the 20th century's most popular songs. In honor of that distinction, it has been selected for preservation at the Library of Congress. Other recordings selected include albums and songs from Joan Baez, The Righteous Brothers, Steve Martin and Radiohead.

On Wednesday, 25 sound recordings were added to the library's National Recording Registry. The oldest is from 1890; the most recent, from 1999.

Each year the library chooses recordings that are "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."

## Classic Rock To Classic Comedy

Among the unforgettable tunes being archived are Johnny Mercer's "Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive" from 1944 and The Righteous Brothers' "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'." Also picked were folksinger Joan Baez's first solo album and Steve Martin's "A Wild and Crazy Guy" comedy album. Martin's record broke new ground in the 1970s. It left standard jokes and punchlines behind in favor of less predictable humor.

Upon hearing that his record has been declared archive-worthy, Martin said: "I could not be more proud of this honor. This means the record was probably funny."

The Library of Congress began preserving important sound recordings 15 years ago.

In the 1960s, King originally intended his song "Stand by Me" for his former group, the Drifters, but he ended up recording it himself. The song has one of the best-known bass lines in history. A few years later, The Righteous Brothers recorded "Lovin' Feelin'." They thought the song was wrong for them at first, but ended up with a hit.

## Wax Cylinder: The 19th Century's CD

The oldest recordings being saved are a group of 600 wax cylinders. They were played on phonographs, which came before record players. The wax cylinders being preserved were recorded by ordinary people in the 1890s, 1900s and 1910s as snapshots of everyday life. Wax cylinders are among the most endangered audio formats because their grooves are fragile and the wax decomposes over time.

Another set of wax-cylinder recordings being preserved is from the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. They capture the sounds of musicians from around the world performing at the fair, giving Americans their first exposure to "world music."

Radio coverage of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's funeral in 1945 was also chosen for preservation. So too was the 1953 theatrical recording of "John Brown's Body." Based on a Civil War poem, "John Brown's Body" was a popular and successful non-musical play.

## Radiohead By Popular Demand

Curators also judged some more recent recordings to be worthy of preservation, including tunes from TV's "Sesame Street." The children's show used music as a core part of its educational program and drew stars ranging from B.B. King to R.E.M. and the Dixie Chicks. The library chose the 1995 recording "Sesame Street: All-Time Platinum Favorites" for the registry.

Radiohead's 1997 album "OK Computer" was chosen for preservation after being nominated repeatedly by members of the public. The album centers on a dark view of our modern technological age.

Matt Barton, who was involved in choosing this year's picks, sees Radiohead's album as part of a darker strand in pop music. "I sort of see it as part of a certain ongoing phenomenon in rock music that maybe begins with the Velvet Underground but also The Doors," he said. "Pop music is not entirely positive in its outlook, shall we say," he added. "I think we can say that 'OK Computer' really sums a lot of that up."
