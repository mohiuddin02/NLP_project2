Scientists have found an unusual material on Mars. It is called "impact glass." The discovery is important. Impact glass could help show us if anything can live on Mars. It could also reveal if anything has ever lived on the planet.

Signs of impact glass were discovered by Kevin Cannon and John Mustard. Cannon is a student at Brown University. Mustard is a professor at Brown. They found the impact glass with help of a NASA Mars spacecraft.

Impact glass can be formed when a big space rock crashes into a planet. These space rocks are called asteroids or comets. The crash creates a lot of heat. The heat can melt rocks. When the melted rock cools it becomes solid. If it cools quickly, the solid rock becomes impact glass. It is different than the glass we usually think of. It is dark brown, almost black. It is only partly see-through.

## Fake Glass Used To Find Real Glass

Asteroids and comets often slam into planets. Because of this, scientists have believed that impact glass exists on other planets. The new study helps to show this idea is true.

It has been hard to find impact glass on Mars. Scientists identify different types of rocks on the surface of Mars by looking at the sunlight that is reflected off the planet. Different rocks leave different marks in the reflection. The marks are sort of like fingerprints. The fingerprint is a rock's spectral signal. Impact glass has a weak spectral signal. Rocks have strong signals because they are so dark and absorb sunlight. Signals from rocks are so strong that they can block out signals from impact glass. It can make it hard to see the signals from impact glass.

Cannon solved this problem. He made his own fake Martian impact glass. First, he mixed together powders that are like what rocks on Mars are made of. Then he melted the powders in an oven. After that, Cannon and Mustard measured the spectral signal of this fake glass. It helped them to know just what to look for on Mars.

Their search turned up a bunch of glass in deep holes called craters on the planet's surface. One scientist said it was the first time impact glass was found on Mars.

## Digging Into Tiny Tunnels

Impact glass has also been found on Earth.

Last year, a team of scientists from Boston University found plant leaves inside impact glass. The glass was found in a crater in Argentina. It could mean impact glass on Mars might also hold bits of tiny life. But there is still no proof that there ever was life on Mars. However, if there was once life on Mars, bits of life inside impact glass could let scientists figure out what the planet used to be like, he said.

Impact glass could also hold tiny life-forms from ancient times. The life-forms are microbes.

Scientists think these microbes were some of the earliest life on Earth. They can dig into the glass and live. They eat it for food.

Some of the microbes make acid. The acid melts the glass. As the glass melts, the microbes dig in deeper. They make tiny tunnels.

If these tiny tunnels were found in the Martian glass, it could mean that there used to be life on Mars.
