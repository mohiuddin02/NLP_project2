WASHINGTON â€” Doctors have a warning for Congress: If it cuts food stamps, the federal government could be socked with bigger health bills. Maybe not immediately, they say, but over time if the poor wind up in doctors' offices or hospitals as a result.

There are many health risks of hunger. Among them are spiked rates of diabetes and, for young children, developmental problems down the road.

The doctors' lobbying effort comes as Congress is working on a bill that's certain to include food stamp cuts. Republicans want heftier reductions than do Democrats.

Food stamps are issued through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. They feed 1 in 7 Americans and cost almost $80 billion a year, twice what they cost five years ago. Conservatives say the program spiraled out of control as the economy struggled and that the costs are not sustainable. They say the neediest people will not go hungry if food stamps are cut.

## Cut Could Backfire

The health and financial risks of hunger have not played a major role in the debate. But the medical community says cutting food aid could backfire by leading to higher Medicaid and Medicare costs.

Medicaid is health coverage for people with low incomes. Medicare is health coverage for people age 65 and over.

"If you're interested in saving health care costs, the dumbest thing you can do is cut nutrition," said Dr. Deborah Frank of Boston Medical Center.

"People don't make the hunger-health connection," she said.

A study published this week helps illustrate that link. Food banks report longer lines at the end of the month as families exhaust their grocery budgets. And researchers found that more poor people with a dangerous diabetes complication are hospitalized then, too.

The researchers analyzed eight years of California hospital records to find cases of hypoglycemia. It's a condition in which the blood sugar level of diabetics drops dangerously low. They then linked these cases to patients' ZIP codes.

Among patients from low-income neighborhoods, hospitalizations were 27 percent higher in the last week of the month compared with the first, said lead researcher Dr. Hilary Seligman. Most states send out government checks and food stamps at the beginning of the month. So, many poor families find their benefits stretched thin by the end of the month.

Hospitalizations didn't increase among diabetics from higher-income areas, she reported.

## Children Could Be Hit Hard

Seligman couldn't prove that running low on food was to blame for the spike in hospitalization. But she called it the most logical culprit and said the money spent on increased hypoglycemia treatment could provide months of food stamp benefits.

"The cost trade-offs are sort of ridiculous," Seligman said.

Research last year looked at the possible effects of cutting $2 billion a year in food stamps. The conclusion was that it could trigger an estimated increase of $15 billion in diabetes treatment costs over the next decade.

Other research shows children from families with not enough food are 30 percent more likely to have been hospitalized for a range of illnesses. But after a temporary boost in benefits in 2009, children whose families used food stamps were significantly more likely to be well than kids in low-income families that didn't participate. About half of those receiving food stamps are children, and 10 percent are elderly.

How much would be cut from the food stamp program ranges from $400 million a year in a Senate bill to $4 billion a year in the House version. Congressional negotiators now are eyeing about $800 million a year in cuts to split the difference.

That would be on top of cuts in November, when a temporary benefit expired. According to the Agriculture Department, a family of four receiving food stamps is now getting $36 less a month. The average household benefit is around $270.

Since November, food banks are reporting more demand because people's food stamps aren't stretching as far.

## "Food Is Medicine"

Conservatives pushing for the cuts say they want to give benefits to the neediest people. They argue that those who are truly hungry should have no problem getting assistance if they apply.

The bill will likely add some money for food banks. And in a few test states it will probably also introduce new work requirements for those receiving benefits. Such changes are a priority for many Republicans.

"While this program is an important part of our safety net, our overriding goal should be to help our citizens with the education and skills they need to get back on their feet so that they can provide for themselves and their families," said Eric Cantor. He's a Republican from Virginia and the House of Representatives Majority Leader.

Democrats and anti-hunger groups opposing the reductions have said that cutting food stamps could worsen health and raise health costs for the poorest.

"Food is medicine," says Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, who has led the Democrats' defense of the food stamp program. "Critics focus almost exclusively on how much we spend, and I wish they understood that if we did this better, we could save a lot more money in health care costs."

Dr. Thomas McInerny, former president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said too often, poor families buy cheap, high-calorie junk food because it's filling. Such food lacks nutrients needed for proper child development. The two main consequences are later-in-life diabetes, and low iron levels. A lack of iron in the body, especially in the first three years of life, can damage a developing brain so that children have trouble learning in school.

"The children may not look malnourished the way children in Third World countries look," he said, "but they are malnourished."
