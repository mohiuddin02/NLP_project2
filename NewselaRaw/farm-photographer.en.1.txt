FRESNO, Calif. — Picture the award-winning photo taken by Time magazine's Instagram Photographer of the Year. What flashes through your mind? A perfectly timed picture of an incredible, Super Bowl-winning touchdown or maybe a shocking photo that gives you a glimpse of what your favorite stars' lives are like behind the scenes? How about a hard-earned shot taken from the eye of a dangerous storm or the middle of an overseas conflict?

Matt Black's photographs do not resemble any of those. Black, who won Time's 2014 Instagram honor, focuses on a subject matter that some find boring or depressing by comparison. He photographs California's Central Valley farmworkers, capturing the stories of their sunburned faces and physically demanding lives.

## "The Highest Form Of Photography"

Noted photographer, journalist and historian Richard Steven Street describes Black's work as "the highest form of photography." Street points out that it would be much easier for Black to snap pictures of Kim Kardashian. He says they would sell like crazy, too.

Street praises Black for "throwing (his) talents into recording a subject that is in some ways depressing but is way more important."

Black's photographs provide an in-depth look at large-scale agriculture: the expensive tractors, the abundant yields of produce, the once-dry land transformed into a remarkable food-making machine through irrigation. He photographs drought: the cracked earth, the dust, the human misery. And, like the pioneering photographers of the 1930s such as Dorothea Lange, best known for her Depression-era Dust Bowl images, Black photographs migrations of farmworkers as they travel from countries like Mexico to California for work.

## His Process Is Unique

Black has pursued his own persistent, patient, stubborn brand of journalism for more than 25 years. But it's not just Black's project choices that set him apart from so many other photographers today. The process he uses to create such gritty images is also quite unique.

Black does not flit from one assignment to the next — the issues he's tackling are just too important for that. The world's attention span might be shrinking to 140 characters on Twitter messages, but Black is taking the long view.

It takes him months, sometimes years, to really get to know a story and create the trust that allows him to get images that few photographers have the patience to catch. During California's last big drought, he rented an apartment for three months on the edge of Mendota. He wanted to let the character and nature of the place seep into him. He built a level of familiarity and trust with the residents that could never be attained by out-of-town photographers "parachuting" into a story for a few days.

## Picky About Projects

Black's appreciation for the storytelling power of photography began in high school. He worked weekends at a local newspaper, where he got hooked on black-and-white photography. One day in 1988, he volunteered to cover Cesar Chavez, a farmworker activist who was breaking a 36-day fast to protest poor working conditions on farms.

Black went on his own to shoot the pictures and, reluctantly, his editor ended up deciding to print them in the newspaper. "To me, it was a moment of empowerment for what photography can do. Because I went on my own, the story got published. It got told. It was based on nothing more than the fact that I did it."

Black came back to the central San Joaquin Valley after college because it was home to the type of photography he wanted to do. He has always worked for himself as a freelancer, picking and choosing projects with a social element.

Black could have made more money with a steady job at a magazine or daily newspaper, but he wanted to concentrate on projects that mattered to him. His wife, Melissa Martell Black, had similar goals. She wanted to focus on her writing, which also has an activist bent. She also taught classes at a community college to help keep money coming in on a regular basis.

"We decided that Matt was going to pursue these stories and that he would do whatever was necessary to make that happen," Martell Black said.

## His Images Are His Voice

Without his wife's support, Black says he would never be where he is today. Whether through sheer talent, luck or just sticking with it, he has managed to get every single one of his major projects published.

Black had an especially good year in 2014. The New Yorker magazine published eight pages of Black's photos of California's drought, a rare honor. He broke into the world of fine-art photography with a solo show titled "From Clouds to Dust," at the elite Anastasia Gallery in New York City.

Black has also received support from MSNBC.com that will expand his "Geography of Poverty" project with a three-month road trip across the country. He wants to let people know that the Central Valley is not the only area with economic and environmental struggles.

Despite his recent success, Black remains humble. He didn't jump up and down with excitement when he learned about the Time magazine or New Yorker honors. As his wife explains, that isn't his way. He is by nature a quieter man, but he is still gratified by the national attention because it means his work — and the issues it explores — is being seen by more people than ever before.

"I've devoted myself to these images," Black says. "That's the one voice I have. I've got a lot I want to say."
