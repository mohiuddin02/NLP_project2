One of the world's most endangered crocodiles, the Cuban crocodile, is facing an identity crisis that is threatening its survival. The island's rare, native species has been interbreeding with its more abundant cousin, the American crocodile. The result is genetically mixed offspring.

In each baby, a portion of the Cuban crocodile genome — the species' complete set of genes — is replaced by American crocodile genes. With each new generation, more and more Cuban genes are lost, and eventually the species could become extinct.

Scientists knew the two species were mating with one another in the wild, but only recently determined the extent to which this was occurring.

## Cuban Crocodile's Slow Demise

A team of Cuban and Canadian researchers, led by Yoamel Milián-García of the University of Havana, analyzed genes from the scales of 227 wild crocodiles. The results showed that the level of interbreeding is much higher than previously believed: 49 percent of the wild crocodiles sampled had mixed genes.

The Cuban crocodile is considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It was once found throughout the island, but extensive hunting from the mid-19th century onward caused its population to drop drastically.

Now the estimated 4,000 remaining individuals are at risk of genetic swamping by the more abundant American crocodile. As more genes from the American crocodile move into the population, the Cuban crocodile is losing what made it distinct. The loss of genes it once carried also has the potential to reduce the species' ability to adapt to environmental challenges.

Researchers say the Cuban crocodile's distinct characteristics make it unique — and worthy of protecting.

## Questions Of Interbreeding

Milián-García is trying to determine whether the interbreeding of the two species is a natural phenomenon. Illegal hunting and the gradual disappearance of the animals' natural environment may be driving the two species into the same areas, where they are then able to breed.

The issue is further complicated by evidence that American crocodiles in Cuba are actually more closely related to the Cuban crocodile than to other American crocodiles found on the U.S. mainland. It appears that in the Caribbean, American crocodiles took on some genes from their Cuban relatives a little more than 200,000 years ago. That implies there are three distinct genetic groups rather than two.

Nonetheless, scientists believe that the interbreeding going on now poses serious problems. "We feel pretty confident," said George Amato of the American Museum of Natural History, that the current interbreeding "is a threat to what we recognize as a distinct species." Amato was not involved with the recent study but is familiar with the work.

## Some Hopeful Signs

Milián-García and the other researchers also studied 137 captive Cuban crocodiles from the Zapata Swamp Captive Breeding Farm. There were some hopeful signs in the genetic analysis of those crocodiles, who have been isolated from American crocodiles since 1974.

Approximately 30 percent had a unique subset of genes — DNA they do not share with the rest of the captive population at the farm. That makes them valuable reservoirs of Cuban crocodile DNA. The animals could be used to help the entire population maintain its genetic identity.
