LOS ANGELES â€” Kris Ramirez grew up in Southeast Los Angeles. He says he never felt angry at the police. When police cars drove by he was not afraid.

Then last year something terrible happened. Sheriff's deputies shot and killed his 28-year-old brother, Oscar. The shooting happened near some railroad tracks.

Earlier that day a girl saw two men with a knife and gun. Deputies stopped Oscar because he looked like one of the men. Deputies say he ran away.

## Family Does Not Believe Deputies

The deputies chased Oscar. When they caught him he would not follow orders, they say. They say Oscar moved his arm suddenly. Deputies thought he would attack.

The Ramirez family does not believe the deputies. They say Oscar was no danger to the deputies. He did not have a knife or gun.

The family protested in front of a police station. Most people did not notice.

## Police Killings Of Latinos Are Not Uncommon

The story was very different when Los Angeles police killed another man soon after. The man was named Ezell Ford. He was black. Many people showed up to protest his killing.

The difference made Kris Ramirez unhappy. He wonders why his family is not able to get more help.

Police killings of blacks have been getting a lot of notice. Police killings of Latinos have not. Yet, killings of Latinos are very common.

Twenty-three people were killed by Los Angeles police this year. Fourteen of them were Latino.

None of those killings got a lot of attention. There have been very few protests.

## Latinos, Blacks See Police Differently

One reason might be that Latinos and blacks see police differently. African-Americans have been mistreated by police for years. Latinos do not have the same long history.

Latinos are less likely to think police are wrong. They do not protest as much.

Another reason might be because there are Latino officers. Almost half the police in Los Angeles are Latino. Only around 1 in 10 officers is black.

Also, some Latinos are afraid to speak out. In Latin American countries, police officers can be mean. Protesting can get a person in serious trouble. People from these countries learn to say nothing.

## Family Is Still Fighting

The Ramirez family is still fighting. They will never forget Oscar.

In June, Oscar's father planted a tree in his son's honor. He planted it on Oscar's birthday. It grows by the train tracks where Oscar was killed.
