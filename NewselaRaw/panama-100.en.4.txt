The Panama Canal turns 100 years old this month. It was completed in 1914. The canal is considered one of the greatest engineering projects in history.

The canal is a waterway that cuts through Central America. It creates a shortcut for ships. Before the Panama Canal, ships had to take a long journey all the way around South America. Ships have been using the Panama Canal for 100 years, saving them time and money.

The idea for a canal through Central America was first discussed in the 1500s. The French first started building the Panama Canal in 1881. They had recently built the Suez Canal in Egypt. The Panama Canal turned out to be a much more difficult project.

More than 20,000 workers died from tropical diseases or in accidents. It was difficult to work in the heat and humidity. Muddy soil made digging difficult.

## Building It Was A Huge Task

The United States bought the French machinery and took over work on the canal in 1904. The U.S. also helped Panama break free from Colombia and declare independence.

The Americans had a huge task to complete. They brought in a new army of workers and the latest technology. They had a plan to keep workers healthy. They dug deep into the muddy soil to build huge locks that raise and lower ships.

The locks use gates to hold and release water. Rising or falling water allows ships to move up or downhill as they pass through the canal.

In 1912, Scientific American wrote an article about the canal. In it, a U.S. official pointed out the benefits expected from the canal. He said it would make trade between the Atlantic and Pacific cost a lot less money because it would save time. Before the canal was built, ships had to go around the tip of South America. The official added that it would make the United States a greater military power.

A hundred years later, the world still depends on the canal for moving goods. It still benefits the U.S. military even though the United States no longer owns it.

## Adding New And Bigger Locks

The canal is still a work in progress. Some cargo ships today are too huge to fit through the canal. Panama is expanding the canal. It is adding new and bigger locks.

People have been suggesting other shipping shortcuts for a long time. Some have suggested a canal though Nicaragua which is also in Central America. Others thought of a railroad that could carry ships across Panama.

Today, one of those plans is back. The government of Nicaragua has joined with a Hong Kong company to build a canal in Nicaragua. This new canal would try to take business from the Panama Canal. It is expected to cost $40 billion.

No one is sure if this new canal will really be built. Still, the Maersk Line, a shipping company that owns the largest ships in the world, said the new canal "makes good sense."
