TOKYO, Japan — Toyota Motor Corp. has plans to become a key player in the growing market for robots that can help the elderly and other people.

The company believes it can use its manufacturing experience to become as important in the new field it calls "partner robots" as it is to making cars. Toyota currently employs only 150 robotics engineers out of a worldwide staff of 300,000. But it is putting money into robotics research and development.

Toyota last month announced a $1 billion investment in a company to develop artificial intelligence and robotics. The Japanese car maker is already working with Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on robotics.

Akifumi Tamaoki is the general manager of Toyota's partner robot division. "We are preparing for a future in which people may not be able to drive cars," or may need artificial intelligence to help them drive, he said. "And once they get off their cars, they may need help from partner robots."

## Japan's Government Counts On Robotics

In the future, Japanese people could well use the help. Japan's population is aging more quickly than in any other industrial nation, and the government is counting on the robotics industry to grow. Other companies have jumped in, including Internet company Softbank Corp. It sells a humanoid robot that carries on simple conversations.

Tamaoki said Toyota's interest in robotics goes back decades, and the company uses them in manufacturing at its car factories. But it now sees the technology as a potentially successful business on its own.

Some of that comes from the the auto and tech industries, which are using artificial intelligence to develop cars that can drive by themselves. Google Inc. is testing driverless vehicles. Also, Toyota's Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. is especially confident about the technology and has plans to start selling such vehicles by 2020.

## Honda's Robot Not Very Useful

Honda Motor Co. was a leader in robots with its Asimo walking and talking child-shaped robot. But critics say that Honda focused too much on duplicating human movements and behavior, and lost sight of trying to be useful.

After the March 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan, the Asimo could do nothing to help people. Honda was publicly criticized over this, and took the criticism seriously.

Toyota demonstrated a one-armed partner robot on wheels earlier this year. Called the HSR, or Human Support Robot, it looks a bit like R2-D2, the robot from "Star Wars." The  HSR is loaded with sensors and cameras. It can pick up after people, bring an item to a bed or open curtains.

## Universities Help With Research

The robot is not yet for sale to the public. Toyota is working with 10 universities in Japan to figure out how the robot can be useful to people, Tamaoki said. The company plans to start working with overseas educational organizations next year.

Tamaoki believes robots like HSR will gradually become widespread. That possibility may take another decade, though.

Toyota is planning on adding another arm to HSR, which will allow it to perform more complicated tasks. The car company also will give it the ability to have a conversation. The robot now comes with a flat panel that works like a videophone or video player, but can't talk.

One research group has proposed using it for taking care of pets. It could jiggle a toy for a lonely cat, according to Toyota.
