BALTIMORE — A little girl was dropped in a Russian orphanage. She had a spinal condition that left her paralyzed below the waist. As she scooted down the halls on her hands, no one imagined much of a future for her.

Now that girl is a 24-year-old woman nicknamed "The Beast." She is a fearsomely muscled athlete who believes her body can do anything her mind dreams up.

Tatyana McFadden was once that little girl — but she certainly has come a long way. Adopted by an American woman years ago, she now lives in Clarkville, Md. And she is a champion athlete.

Starting Friday, she'll compete in at least three events at the Winter Paralympics. These games are just like the Olympics, but are for athletes who are disabled. This year, they are being held in Sochi, Russia.

## St. Petersburg's Orphanage 13

McFadden has already conquered the Summer Paralympics and wheelchair marathons. But this is a brand-new challenge for her: She'll be taking on the best in the world after just 50 days training on snow.

And she'll do so in the very country where she was born, and where her future once looked so unpromising. She'll perform in front of her birth mother and the head of her old orphanage.

In 2011, McFadden made her first return visit to St. Petersburg's Orphanage 13. Staffers there were astounded by her transformation.

"They were absolutely amazed — from scrawny to how strong I've become," McFadden says. "It amazed them, because they've never seen someone with a disability become so successful and so independent."

"Very few women in the world are as fit as she is," says her track coach, Adam Bleakney. "Or can generate the power that she does, no matter what the sport."

In 2013, McFadden became the first person to win four major marathons in the same year: in Boston, London, Chicago and New York. And those victories were sandwiched around a world championship performance in which she won every race between 100 and 5,000 meters.

Even as her remarkable 2013 unfolded, McFadden had her eye on the next hurdle: winter sports.

## Always Looking For A Challenge

McFadden had hatched her plan to try cross-country skiing. In the Paralympics, this is known as sit skiing.

McFadden seems to thrive on attempting what sounds impossible to most.

"What can I do next?" she says, describing her approach to sports. "I think that's the fun part."

McFadden brought up the cross-country idea with coaches from the U.S. Paralympic team, and they agreed she'd be perfect for the sport because of her upper-body power. She can also be active for a long time without stopping.

But the shift from champion marathoner to Olympics-ready skier wasn't instant, McFadden says. True, her strength made her competitive. But some skiing motions are hard for her because she has trouble moving anything below the waist.

On the snow McFadden isn't yet the powerful force she is on the track or a marathon course. Shorter-distance events are where she's most likely to do well. A top-10 finish would be a good result for her.

"She is still very new in the sport," says her winter coach, John Farra. "But I would not count her out in any event she enters. They don't make them much tougher than this one."

## Birth Mom And Cousins At Sochi

McFadden is of course focusing on Sochi as an athletic competition. But there's little question the games will have extra meaning for her because of her Russian background.

Back in 2011, Tatyana also met with her birth mother, Nina Polivikova.

Some say McFadden was "abandoned" by Polivikova. But McFadden doesn't see things that way. Polivikova, she says, was young and couldn't afford to care for a baby with spina bifida.

"My birth mom, she had to do the hardest part," Tatyana says. "Just to give me life and then put me in the orphanage, because I was extremely sick."

She added, "Going back and showing her the person I've become was almost a way of saying thank you to her. I wanted her to know, 'It's not your fault. You did what you could. You did the best that you could at that time and moment.'"

McFadden has remained in touch with Polivikova since their meeting. She is looking forward to racing in front of her and various cousins in Sochi.

"That's the first time they get to physically see me compete," McFadden says. "For me, that's going to be fulfilling. I'm sure I'll never forget being able to see them at the starting line or being there when I cross."
