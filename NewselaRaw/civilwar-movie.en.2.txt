KENOSHA, Wis. — Inside a building next to Lake Michigan, the Civil War rages on. Cannons boom and smoke wafts across a battlefield as men in blue and gray charge screaming at each other.

America's Civil War pitted brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor, Northerner against Southerner. By the time the conflict ended, hundreds of thousands were dead or maimed. Only Civil War veterans really knew the fear and chaos of battle.

Shortly after the war ended, however, painters began to re-create those hellish scenes in so-called cycloramas. These were round 360-degree pictures meant to be viewed from the inside. If you stood in the center, it seemed as if you were in the middle of the historical event. Cycloramas drew curious visitors seeking a taste of war.

Now Kenosha's Civil War Museum has updated the cyclorama approach to the 21st century. Using 360-degree technology and 11-foot-tall screens, the museum is presenting an 11-minute movie called "Seeing the Elephant." The film opened this month.

## Capturing The Feel Of Cycloramas

The movie was filmed over five days last summer at Old World Wisconsin — an outdoor history museum — with the help of 200 re-enactors. It follows three men who join the Union Army for different reasons and head off to battle.

"Our idea was to produce a 360-degree film that puts the viewer in the middle of the action," said museum curator Doug Dammann. The movie is "sort of a living, breathing cyclorama."

Cycloramas were a popular form of entertainment in the late 1800s. The panoramic paintings were first developed in Europe before migrating to the United States in the 1880s. Oftentimes they featured huge paintings of Civil War battles. German cyclorama artists were recruited to come to America by a Milwaukee man, William Wehner, who owned American Panorama Co. Another cyclorama company, Northwestern Panorama Co., also was busy in Milwaukee painting battle scenes.

A handful of cycloramas can still be seen more than 125 years later, including one in Gettysburg, Pa., and another in Atlanta. The Battle of Atlanta painting was created with the assistance of Union and Confederate veterans of the battle and a magazine war illustrator.

"In the age before movies and television, it was a way to transport the viewer to Gettysburg," Dammann said.

When the Civil War Museum was built and opened in 2008, organizers left open an area for a cyclorama to be installed someday. Plans got underway last year for the $1 million film.

The call went out to Civil War re-enactors from throughout the Midwest as well as other states. Old World Wisconsin was the location chosen for filming, particularly the Norwegian farmstead area, Catholic church and town hall.

"Looking in every direction you feel you're in the past," said the film's director, Bob Noll.

## "A Lot Of Pyrotechnics"

A special 360-degree camera, which was actually nine high-definition digital cameras attached to a periscope rig, was used to film the battle scenes. During filming, Noll and the camera operator huddled inside a compartment and used a camera sticking out of it to film the re-enactors as they shot blanks at each other. The battle scene was painstakingly mapped out in advance. And a re-enactor coordinator helped choreograph the fighting.

"We had a lot of cannon explosions. As they were going across the field, there was a lot of pyrotechnics," Noll said. "Everything was staked out with flags so people wouldn't step on them."

The battle in the museum's movie is not a recreation of an actual event. However, it is based on an incident that happened right before the Second Battle of Bull Run as the Union called it, or Second Battle of Manassas as the Confederacy called it.

"We talked about doing an actual battle," said Civil War historian Lance Herdegen, who helped write the script. "But the problem is when you do that some expert will come up and say, well the fence is in the wrong place."

Much of the dialogue of the three main characters joining the Union Army was authentic, Herdegen said. It was taken from actual letters and journals.

At the Civil War Museum, visitors climb up to a platform. There they hang on to the railings and rotate as the action unfolds in front and behind. The theater features eight projectors and seven speakers above viewers, as well as speakers underneath the platform.

And what about the film's unusual title? It was chosen because "seeing the elephant" was a common phrase used by Civil War soldiers to describe their first experience of battle.
