Thousands of protesters blocked the streets of Hong Kong on Monday. The protesters are calling for the Chinese government to give them free elections.

Hong Kong is a territory of 7 million people on China's south coast. It was long ruled by the British. In 1997, power was transferred to China. The Chinese government promised that the government of Hong Kong would be able to govern the territory for at least 50 years. Hong Kong's people enjoy more freedoms than people in mainland China.

Now, the territory is protesting because China announced new election rules at the end of the summer. The rules would limit free elections. Only people approved by the Chinese government could run for election as Hong Kong's top official in 2017.

People in Hong Kong are unhappy over other issues, as well. These include high housing prices. There is also a growing income gap between the rich and poor. In addition, young protesters don't feel connected to mainland China. Instead, they feel a strong sense that they are Hong Kongers.

## Protesters Block Streets

Monday's demonstrations forced schools, banks and other businesses to close. Government officials said they would stop the plans for a big fireworks celebration on Wednesday. The holiday marks the founding of China.

The protesters demonstrated in neighborhoods throughout Hong Kong. They sat down on roadways and blocked streets. Police backed away from fighting directly with the demonstrators. On Sunday, police had fired tear gas at protesters. Tear gas is a chemical that irritates the eyes. It is used to break up protests.

The Chinese government had warned that the demonstrations could cause serious damage to Hong Kong businesses. Some workers refused to work in support of the protesters. Also, a number of businesses opened late or closed early. But for the most part, business went on as usual.

The protests were started over the summer by a group called Occupy Central.

## What Will Happen Next?

Chi-Keung Choy is a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Choy said the protests have become much more widespread. No one seems to be in control. Choy said he does not know what will happen next. However, to get the protesters off the streets, government officials will have to give in to some of their demands, he said.

Western governments are concerned about the situation. But they have been careful about showing support for the protesters.

Hua Chunying is a spokeswoman for the Chinese government. She warned other countries not to interfere.

"Hong Kong belongs to China," she said. "We strongly oppose any countries interfering or supporting Occupy Central by any methods."

## "This Is A People's Movement"

In Hong Kong, demonstrations are usually well organized and calm. The wildness of the protests have surprised people. It has also encouraged many people to stand with the protesters.

Jerry Ip is 25 years old. He and a few friends were tear-gassed by police Sunday night. He said, "I felt like I'd die." Even so, Ip said he would not give up. "We're fighting for the future of Hong Kong. This is our homeland."

Hong Kong's government has tried to calm the situation. Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying is the top official in Hong Kong. He promised that police would treat protesters with respect. He also said that he hoped people would "keep calm."

Leung said government officials would soon hold talks about the election rules. Then on Monday, he took it back. He said the government would listen to what people think another time.

A local lawmaker named Alan Leong said that people in Hong Kong were going to be upset about this decision. "This is a people's movement," he said.
