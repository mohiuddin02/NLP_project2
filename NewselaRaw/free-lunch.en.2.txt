WASHINGTON — Thousands more students around the country could be getting a free lunch in the fall. That's thanks to a 4-year-old federal program that is finally expanding to all 50 states.

The growth comes through the Community Eligibility Provision. This was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010 as part of a bigger set of school nutrition laws.

The [Community Eligibility Provision](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch) opened the door for districts with free or reduced-price lunches to offer the meals to every student at the school. There is no cost to them — no forms necessary and regardless of household income.

The program has seen more and more states slowly adopt it since 2010. Certain schools in three states (Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan) were able to join first, based on need and their data-sharing capabilities. Last year, 4,000 more schools in 11 states participated. But all states will be covered starting this school year. Now the question facing district officials in other states is whether it makes sense to join.

## Weigh In And Sign Up

Originally, districts had until the end of June to decide. The federal government extended the deadline into August to give districts more time. There were delays in publishing the list of schools or districts able to join.

There's no real-time tracking of how many new districts will join this year, but state and local education officials are weighing it. In most states, hundreds of schools are able to join, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

In areas where the program has been put into place, it's been praised by state and district officials, teachers and child nutrition experts. They say it is a help to the low-income school lunch program. The program provided 21.5 million free or reduced-price meals in schools last year. That's more than 70 percent of all meals served through the National School Lunch Program.

"Everyone's got a great meal that they can get at no charge. It just becomes the standard; it really unites the campus," said Madeleine Levin of the Food Research and Action Center. "We're wrapping our arms around these (schools) that need support just like we do in other educational programs."

## Schools Do Some Budgeting

Under the Community Eligibility Provision, the federal government pays for only a share of the growth, leaving states to pay the balance. As a result, not all school districts are expected to join.

Schools where 40 percent or more of the students automatically qualify for the school lunch program are able to use community eligibility. There are more than 28,000 such schools nationwide.

In schools where nearly all students are already receiving a free lunch, there will be little change in federal funding. That's because the school is already being paid back for nearly all lunches served.

It's different if only 40 percent of students can join. Then, the school will have to make up the balance for a portion of the meals.

In Fort Wayne, Indiana, officials will offer the new lunch program at all elementary and middle schools starting this fall. But high schools there will have to wait. Lunch program participation at the high school level tends to be lower. Officials there weren't sure including them would make sense for their budget.

The district had some elementary and middle schools that already had 95 percent or more of their students covered by the free-lunch program, said Krista Stockman. She is a spokeswoman for the district. At that point, "It really becomes easier to give everyone the free meals," she said.

"It starts to become more of a hassle to have to deal with some students who are paying," she added. "Overall, it just makes a much smoother process for our schools, our students and for our families."

## Test-Driving The Program

High schools have always been more difficult when it comes to the free and reduced-price lunch program. There's more shame about participating, officials and experts say. In some cases, families' situations might improve as children grow. Parents are freer to work and don't have to pay the high cost of child care. That can reduce the number of students eligible for the program.

Apart from the high school question, though, other districts have taken a timid approach. Indiana's East Allen County Schools chose not to join. Officials wanted to wait and see the effects in neighboring districts, spokeswoman Tamyra Kelly said.

In Chicago, officials have moved slowly: They started with 215 schools, expanded to 465, and will cover all 658 schools starting next school year.

Leslie Fowler runs nutrition support services for Chicago schools. She said that to make the new program work, they had to be sure enough students would be able to join under existing rules. They reached their set level under older free lunch rules, 62.5 percent of all students in the district. This made sure the difference in payment from Washington didn't cost the district any money.

"It doesn't make sense to do district-wide if you don't get to that threshold." At that point you're probably losing money, she said.

St. Paul, Minnesota, is another district that is moving slowly. Jean Ronnei is in charge of schools there. She said the district is doing a "test drive." They are starting the program at one high school, one middle school and a few elementary schools.

Starting with just a few schools helps them, she said. It gives them "a chance to see more about what the impact will be," she said. She said that there is some unrelated government money that is tied to the paperwork.

The money could be more difficult to collect if no paperwork is necessary for the free lunch program.
