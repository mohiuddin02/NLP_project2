LOS ANGELES — On Tuesday the Los Angeles City Council backed a plan to raise the city's minimum wage to $15 per hour.

Lawmakers agreed to draft legislation raising the $9-an-hour base wage to $15 by 2020 for as many as 800,000 low-wage workers. Los Angeles is now the largest city in the nation to have adopted a significant minimum-wage hike. Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle already have approved similar increases, and raising the federal minimum wage has moved to the forefront of the Democratic Party's agenda.

"Make no mistake," said Councilman Paul Krekorian, who was involved in shaping the city's plan. "Today the city of Los Angeles, the second-biggest city in the nation, is leading the nation."

On a vote of 14-to-1, the council instructed City Attorney Mike Feuer to prepare legislation carrying out the wage hikes. The decision set the stage for a final vote on the measure next month. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has already promised to sign the wage increase into law, allowing the first wage boost — to $10.50 per hour — to take effect in July 2016.

## Vote Shows Strength Of City's Unions

The vote was the latest show of organized labor's clout at City Hall. During nearly a year of often emotional debate, labor leaders never gave ground on their central demand that the minimum wage rise to at least $15. The City Council ultimately favored that approach over Garcetti's proposal to raise the minimum wage to $13.25 by 2017.

The council's decision is part of a broader national effort to reduce poverty, said Maria Elena Durazo, former head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. Raising the wage in Los Angeles, she said, will help spur similar increases in other parts of the country.

"Without a doubt, it was a very big victory," said Durazo, now with Unite Here, the hotel and restaurant workers' union.

## Groups Warn Of Business Exodus

Some labor leaders have expressed dissatisfaction with the gradual timeline elected leaders set for raising base wages. On Tuesday, however, the harshest criticism of the law came from business groups. They warned lawmakers that the wage increase would force employers to lay off workers or leave the city altogether.

The very people the increase is intended to help, "it's going to hurt," said Ruben Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce senior vice president.

"It's simple math," Gonzalez said. "There is simply not enough room, enough margin, in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus percent increase in labor costs over a short period of time."

Councilman Mitchell Englander, the council's only Republican, cast the lone opposing vote. In a statement, he said the council action could "make it impossible for entire industries to do business" in Los Angeles.

"The very last thing that we should be doing as a city is creating a competitive disadvantage for our businesses with those in neighboring cities," said Englander.

The council's vote followed months of public debate and back-room lobbying. The issue has animated City Hall like few others over the last year.

## Workers Testify About Hardships

"That's a monumental change in wages," said Jerry Newman, a professor at the University of Buffalo School of Management. "It's going to have both an economic impact and a social impact."

The stakes for some low-wage Angelenos were reflected Tuesday in testimony from workers such as Juan Moran, a line cook in Little Tokyo. Moran told the council the current statewide minimum wage of $9 per hour is not enough to live on.

"Sometimes I have to walk half an hour from work to get to my apartment because money's not enough to pay a ride on the bus," the Boyle Heights resident said. "Or I work 12 hours straight without stop ... just to pay rent."

In recent years, the campaign to raise the minimum wage has spread across the nation. Once Los Angeles' wage hike is finalized, the city will join other West Coast cities that have enacted higher minimum wages in the last two years.

New York City and Washington, D.C., are also weighing $15-an-hour minimum-wage proposals.

## Increase For Hotel Workers Paved The Way

In Los Angeles, the move toward a higher citywide minimum wage gathered steam last year as council members pursued a plan to raise the base pay for workers at the city's large hotels to $15.37 per hour. That measure passed last fall.

Newly elected council members representing very different areas of the city — Mike Bonin from a wealthy coastal district, Curren Price from South Los Angeles and Nury Martinez from the San Fernando Valley — led the push for the hotel pay increase. Supporters saw that increase as a first step toward a citywide minimum-wage hike.

Last summer, minimum-wage advocates found a key ally in Garcetti, who put forward his own proposal to raise base pay to $13.25 an hour.

In a telephone interview from New York City, the mayor praised the measure passed by the council.

## Some Council Members Cautious About "Experiment"

The council plan approved Tuesday would raise wages higher than the mayor's proposal, though more gradually.

As city lawmakers congratulated themselves on raising the minimum wage, some council members sounded a cautious note. They pointed out that the effects of their plan are not easy to predict.

"This is an experiment," Councilman Paul Koretz said. "If anyone tells you they know exactly how this is going to go ... they're not being honest with you."

Bonin, one of the pay increase's early champions, acknowledged that uncertainty but said the council made the right choice.

Concerns about "potential unintended consequences" are outweighed by the "real and known consequences" of low wages, he said. Every day in Los Angeles, he said, people are "getting a poverty wage for working full time."
