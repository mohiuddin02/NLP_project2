WASHINGTON â€” A new study has found a significant change in the religious makeup of the United States. The number of Christians in the country has fallen in the past eight years. It is probably the first time that this has ever happened.

Christianity still remains the country's main religious tradition, however.

Meanwhile, the number of Americans who say they do not follow any religion increased sharply. The study was conducted by a group called the Pew Research Center.

The decline in the number of people who say they follow traditional religions is likely to continue. About half of Americans aged 18 to 33 call themselves Christian. The number is larger for older Americans, the report showed.

That compares with 8 in 10 in the baby boom generation and older age groups who call themselves Christian. The baby boom generational generally refers to people born between the end of World War II in 1945 and 1964.

## Traditional Religion And Politics

In addition, younger Americans do not appear to follow traditional faiths more as they become parents. Just the opposite seems to be happening. Members of the millennial generation have grown less religious as they get older. Millennials generally are considered people born between the early 1980s and early 2000s.

The idea that there are more adults that do not follow a traditional religion could be a challenge for the Republican Party, a political group.

Traditional religion is strongly tied to the Republican Party. Some scholars believe that close ties between traditional religion and the Republican Party have driven some people away from religion.

Some people may not like how religions treat issues like same-sex marriage, said Phil Zuckerman. That may make the people become less religious, he said. Zuckerman is a sociology college professor who studies how groups of people behave.

Almost 1 in 5 American adults were raised in a religious tradition but are now not religious, the study found. Only 4 percent have moved from not being religious to becoming religious.

## South Remains Heavily Christian

One leading traditional religious figure thinks this is a good thing. Some people used to pretend they were Christian. Now they are being more honest about what they believe, said Russell Moore. He is an important figure in the Southern Baptist Church, a Christian group.

Churches should not try attract more people by being less strict, he said.

The Pew survey questioned 35,071 U.S. adults last summer.

The study found that the United States is still far more religious than most other wealthy countries. But the increase in Americans who do not follow a traditional religion is similar to patterns in Europe and elsewhere.

"It's becoming much more possible" to say you are not religious in the U.S. today, Zuckerman said. In the past, not being part of a religion was viewed as being un-American. Now, "people are starting to see being nonreligious as an OK option," he said.

Nationwide, about 1 in 4 Americans describe themselves as not following a particular religion. That is up from roughly 1 in 6 in 2007, according to the new study. The study called those people "nones." The ranks of the "nones" have grown in large part from people abandoning the religion in which they were raised.

That trend toward being nonreligious is particularly strong in Western states, the report said. In contrast, Southern states remain the most heavily Christian part of the nation.

## Judaism, Islam, Hinduism And Buddhism

The decline in organized religious belief has been sharpest among Americans born since the mid-1960s. Also, in those groups, organized religion does not appear to be gaining followers as people age.

Married people are more likely to belong to a religion than the unmarried. However, both groups have grown less religious in recent years, the report said.

Roughly 173 million adult Americans identify as Christian, or about 7 of every 10 people in the country. That is down from 178 million, or almost 8 in 10, in 2007.

Judaism remains the largest non-Christian religion in the U.S. About 2 percent of the U.S. population identifies as Jewish.

Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism each have less than 1 percent of the U.S. population. However, the Muslim and Hindu populations have both grown rapidly as higher numbers of people have moved to the U.S. from Asia.
