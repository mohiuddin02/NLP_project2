PRIVAS, France â€” In 1994, French explorers found a huge cave. Inside, the walls were covered with some of the oldest pictures ever painted.

Most people will never see them. The French government quickly closed the cave to visitors. They worried that people could destroy the pictures. Even breathing on them could damage them.

Soon, people will get to see the next best thing. France has made an almost perfect copy about a mile away.

The copy includes more than 400 paintings of horses, bears and rhinos. There are handprints and carvings. Experts even copied the shapes of rocks from the old cave. The copy of the cave will open to visitors in a few weeks.

## First They Saw Red Paint

Jean-Marie Chauvet is one of the three men who discovered the old cave. Chauvet is still amazed by what the men found.

Chauvet said he and the other explorers saw air coming out of a crack in a rock. They decided to look more closely. Chauvet crawled through narrow tunnels with only his flashlight. Suddenly, another explorer saw two lines of red paint on a cave wall.

Chauvet said that the paintings were still very bright. They looked as if artists had just finished painting them. The deeper the explorers went, the more beautiful the art became.

The cave was very well-preserved because rocks fell in front of the opening about 23,000 years ago. The rocks hid the cave's entrance. The drawings stayed in perfect shape. At first, some experts could not believe that they were real.

## What Shall It Be Named?

The paintings were likely made 30,000 to 37,000 years ago. When the cave was found, experts thought they were the oldest human cave drawings ever. Now they think that pictures in a cave in Spain were painted earlier. The Spanish cave drawings were made at least 40,000 years ago.

Today, the French government calls the Chauvet cave, Pont d'Arc Cavern. It is not officially named after the men who found it. Chauvet is not happy about that. In fact, most people call it Chauvet's Cave. He thinks it should be named after him and that he should get money for finding it.

Experts have recorded more than 1,000 paintings from the cave. Last year, it was added to the United Nations' list of world treasures. A famous filmmaker made a 3-D movie about it called "Cave of Forgotten Dreams."

## The Caves Look Alike

Artists tried to make the copy look as much like the original cave as possible. No one really knows how the ancient artists painted it. Experts have a good idea though. The artists tried to paint it the same way it was done 30,000 years ago, using the same tools.

Pascal Terrasse is a French lawmaker in charge of making the new cave look like the old one.

Terrasse said the next step could be to make 3-D images of the original cave. Then people would not have to come to France to see it. A 3-D copy of the cave would bring the paintings to life for people around the world.
