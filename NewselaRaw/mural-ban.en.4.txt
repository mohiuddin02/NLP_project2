LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles City Council has ended a 10-year ban. From now on, public murals — that is, large paintings on outdoor walls — will be legal. The new rules are a big victory for city artists.

Artists say it makes no sense for murals to be against the law. After all, Los Angeles is famous for its street art.

Murals have recorded generations of city history. They have shown the struggles of poor people. And they have pictured many important events.

The decision comes after years of fighting. Now, said mural-supporter Isabel Rojas-Williams, the city can once again become the "mural capital of the world."

## Some Murals Done During Ban

The new rules will try to strike a balance. Neighborhoods that don't want the large artworks can ask for a ban. And there are rules to stop advertising disguised as art.

That last concern led to the ban 10 years ago. The city first banned only murals that advertised stores and products. Advertisers then sued the city. They argued that it wasn't fair that artists could put up murals when businesses couldn't. So officials decided to ban all new murals.

"It's been a long 10 years," said Nyla Arslanian, president of the Hollywood Arts Council. "We have in Hollywood some of the most beloved and internationally known murals. And it's about time that we have more."

Not all murals were treated equally in the past. Some were permitted by the city. Car wash owner Ben Forat had no problems when he put up a 75-foot-long painting.

The same was true for Robert Vargas. His picture of a mariachi band was permitted.

But when pop star Chris Brown put up murals of 8-foot-high fanged creatures things were different. Neighbors complained strongly. The city quickly forced the singer to remove the paintings.

## Different Rules For Different Places

The new rules permit murals in areas with lots of businesses. But in areas mostly full of private homes the rules are different. Murals won't be allowed without permission from the city.

Artists will have to pay the city $60. And their murals are not allowed to advertise anything.

Councilmen Paul Koretz and Bob Blumenfield voted against the new rules. Both think neighborhoods that don't want murals may still end up getting them.

Koretz said people have told him they worry about the appearance of the murals. And they also worry that murals will attract graffiti.

Blumenfield said some people wonder what kinds of murals will be allowed. They are afraid giant pictures might scare their children.

## Important Piece Of City's History

Several artists say the new rules still don't give them enough freedom. Muralist Kent Twitchell is disappointed that murals can't be painted on single-family homes.

It was good that the city lifted the ban, he said. "But they've made it illegal for people to decorate their homes."

He said there were no rules back when he painted his famous mural of actor Steve McQueen. "We were a free country then."

Murals became very popular in Los Angeles during the 1970s. Artists used them to express their thoughts about civil rights and problems in other countries.

According to Councilman Gil Cedillo, they are an important part of the city's history.
