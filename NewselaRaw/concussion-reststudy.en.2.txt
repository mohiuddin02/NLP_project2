A concussion can happen when someone takes a hard knock to the head. The concussion can lead to headaches, feeling dizzy or confused, or mood changes. Rest and quiet are the most important steps to recovery.

Sometimes, doctors want to "cocoon" a child who has a concussion. That means they are kept at home in a dark room with no TV, music, bright lights or smartphones. Sometimes the injured child is cocooned for up to five days.

A new study has found that this strict treatment is not necessary. Researchers at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee compared the results of treating teens for two different lengths of time. They found that resting for one or two days was enough in most cases. After that, the injured young person can slowly return to normal activities.

Strict rest of up to five days for adolescents — young people and teens — did not help them recover faster, the study found.

## Worries Caused More Symptoms

The Children's Hospital researchers studied 88 young people — ages 11 to 22  — who had suffered mild concussions. Forty-five of them rested for one to two days and then slowly returned to their normal activities. Forty-three teens were restricted for five days: they were kept in quiet rooms, and not allowed to go to school.

The study found that the longer rest did not help kids. It might have even made them feel worse.

The researchers were "startled" that the strict rest "was not making a difference," said Dr. Danny G. Thomas of the Children's Hospital.

"(We were) more startled when kids who were resting longer began complaining of more symptoms," Thomas said. The doctors believe that worries over missing schoolwork and being kept away from friends led to those kids feeling more symptoms.

## Different Kinds Of Concussions

Getting rest is helpful after a concussion, but there has not been much research on just how much rest is best.

Experts do know that too much physical or mental activity too soon after a concussion can mean that it takes longer to get better. The symptoms of a concussion fade slowly. It is more like a light dimming than a light being switched off, Thomas said.

Concussions are caused by brain trauma — often being hit on the head hard while playing sports.

Neurons are nerve cells in the brain that exchange information. With a concussion, chemicals enter and leave the neurons, draining their energy. The neurons do not work correctly again until their energy levels come back to normal. This takes time.

If someone has a concussion, they might feel dizzy or confused. They also could feel anxious or have mood changes. There might be problems with vision, bad headaches, nausea, or neck pain.

Different types of concussions have different effects. Also, different people have different symptoms.

## "The Study Was Well Done"

"I thought the study was well done," said Dr. Micky Collins, a concussion expert at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). "More research like this is needed."

Collins said research at UPMC has identified six types of concussions. Each type requires a special treatment plan designed for the patient by a concussion expert.

One thing is clear from the study and UPMC research: "Never restrict the adolescent to a dark room," Dr. Collins said. "You'll never hear us say, 'Sit in a dark room and get better.'"

Dr. Kevin M. Kelly, who runs concussion services at Allegheny General Hospital, said the study was a good one. The researchers collected so much information, that it was "heroic," the brain doctor said.

It is important to remember that one treatment is not always right for all patients, Kelly said. He recommended personalized treatment and "brain rest" for most children.

Kelly said that a bigger study is necessary. He suggested hospitals and universities could work together to develop guidelines on how to treat different types of concussions.
