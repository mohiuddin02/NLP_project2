### PRO: Prohibition spurs black market, creates long-term consequences

LAS VEGAS — Prohibition doesn't work. As our history books show, the Volstead Act, prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s, closed the doors of legal, regulated businesses and opened a Pandora's box with unintended consequences.

These consequences — criminal activity, illegal manufacturing and distribution, and more — took years and significant resources to fully combat. All for the act to later be repealed.

Let's not let history repeat itself. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is woven into American history, having existed in some form since our nation's establishment.

Let's rely on common-sense safeguards and consumer protections by extending well-established and effective gaming regulations to the newest form, online gaming, at the onset — not retroactively.

Naively assuming a ban would absolve American's interest and participation in online gaming sets up local, state and federal law enforcement with tremendous expenses and turn millions of average American citizens into criminals.

The black market exists. Today's unregulated online operators are flouting their products in clear violation of state and federal law with no regulatory controls or tax obligations.

Estimates show growth in unregulated online gaming markets is explosive: an estimated 1 million Americans or more spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming sites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to participate in the newest form of gaming — online.

The U.S. should harness this practice, not vilify or ignore it. Moreover, the billions of dollars this new form of gaming technology generates presents a healthy funding model to cover costs associated with regulation and legal enforcement.

Modern technologies associated with online gaming exist to protect consumers — including minors, gambling addicts and others — and these safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow for online gaming within its state borders. These technologies, while not perfect, will continue to improve for the financial, health care and gaming industries.

Moreover, when properly implemented, the tax revenue generated through online gaming can cover not only the necessary expenses to ensure consumer protections for Americans but also to support local communities' budget deficits to pay for essential public services such as education.

As with previous versions of draft legislation, states and licensed industry participants should have the option of whether they support online gaming at all. For those that do, many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.

It's no secret that many state and local governments are woefully in need of new revenue streams. Online gaming holds the potential to assist with these budgetary shortfalls.

State lotteries are a perfect example of leveraging long-standing entertainment to help subsidize public-sector treasuries. However, the large number of states that have kept up with 21st-century technologies by offering online lottery would also be jeopardized through wide-sweeping federal prohibition.

The slippery slope of a proposed ban, doesn't stop at the state level. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was recently warned that popular sports fantasy leagues could end up banned by this legislation as well.

It wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming — through social media channels such as Facebook and others — were brought under scrutiny through federal prohibition, too.

America is well known for its [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur). Innovators like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents and policymakers.

Let not the federal government impede innovation. Set up the parameters to let Americans innovate —and play — on a level playing field with the rest of the world.

Instead of pretending that innovation and the Internet doesn't or shouldn't exist, America should look back to both our historical mistakes and our historical innovations for inspiration on how to best navigate the challenges and opportunities associated with Internet gaming today.

### CON: Restore ban on online gambling before it harms more families

WASHINGTON — Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos are newly licensed to operate online gambling sites. It's good news for them: After seven straight years of sinking profits, the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada predicts that if brick-and-mortar casinos continue to shrink at the same rate as this year, their online presence will have to double to make up for lost revenue.

It's no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey, who have grown reliant on gambling revenues, are taking advantage of the Department of Justice's 2011 decision gutting the Wire Act to expand gambling online.

Be careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.

In 1999, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC) recommended an explicit moratorium on gambling expansion and a complete ban of Internet gambling until more research could be done on its harms and benefits. Unfortunately this research has not been done and online gambling advocates are petitioning Congress to approve a regulatory regime that would help them spread online gambling nationwide and give them the trappings of a legalized market — most important among these, the illusion that online gambling is somehow safe.

Online gambling will increase availability. But where there is an increase in availability there's also a documented increase in incidences of problem gambling and the attendant social harms of bankruptcy, divorce, incarceration, suicide.

Advocates for online gambling say problem gamblers make up only a small percentage of overall players, but that does not take into account ripple effects. Studies estimate that a compulsive gambler will affect an average of five to 10 other people.

Even recovering problem gamblers may not be able to undo the damage done to their finances and relationships, particularly their marriages.

The NGISC reported receiving "abundant testimony and evidence that compulsive gambling introduces a greatly heightened level of stress and tension into marriages and families, often culminating in divorce and other manifestations of familial disharmony," and that "respondents representing 2 million adults identified a spouse's gambling as a significant factor in a prior divorce."

The total costs to society are untold. The increase in crime, financial hardship, lost work and family break-up have led Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols to estimate the cost of gambling to outweigh its benefits by 3-to-1.

Internet gambling is particularly worrisome because evidence overwhelmingly shows that compulsive gambling is three to four times more prevalent among online gamblers than non-Internet gamblers.

The 24/7 ease of access, speed of the game, lack of clear cash markers, solitary nature of play and ability to play multiple games at once make online gambling inherently more dangerous than other forms of gambling.

Online gambling vendors claim they will be able to screen out minors, ensure a player's identity and validate that players are physically located within proper jurisdictions.

However, the FBI countered this claim in a 2009 letter to the Financial Services Committee stating, "While the (online gambling) vendors may claim that they can validate age and location, they are more than likely relying on credit card information and geo-location to gather this information. Both can be spoofed."

While legalizing online gambling may seem like an attractive solution to a state's budget woes, evidence suggests the contrary. Gambling is a regressive tax that disproportionately impacts the poor, diverting money away from local businesses and displacing existing sales tax revenue while fueling societal ills.

Both sides of this debate agree a state-by-state patchwork of online gambling regimes will not work. Congress needs to act in the interest of families and communities by updating the Wire Act to ensure enforcement of federal law prohibiting Internet gambling.
