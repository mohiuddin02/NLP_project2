CHICAGO, Ill. - Breanne Heath had a big idea. She wanted to start a garden in Chicago.

Chicago is a big city. There is not a lot of land for gardens. Still, Breanne found the perfect patch of dirt. Now she has a small farm. She calls it The Pie Patch.

## Berries And Pumpkins

It is a place where people can pick fruits and vegetables. The Pie Patch is on Chicago's South Side. The farm sells fruits and vegetables. People can buy berries. They can also buy pumpkins. People can pick the fruits and vegetables from the garden.

Breanne loves gardening. She loves helping people, too. There are very few farms near Chicago. Breanne wanted to pick her own apples or strawberries. The closest place to go was outside of the state. She had an idea. She wanted to make it easy for people in Chicago to find fresh, healthy food.

## And Veggies Too

Breanne works with a charity. It is called Su Casa. The charity helps women and children. Su Casa helps Breanne care for the garden. Su Casa then gets to keep some of the fruits and vegetables. They use the garden to feed the women and children.

Many people live in Chicago's South Side. There are not a lot of places to buy healthy food there. The garden helps.

## From The Garden

The Pie Patch makes it easy to find healthy food. Breanne also wants the food to be cheap.

The Pie Patch will open around June. Breanne hopes the farm is special. She wants people to like going there.
