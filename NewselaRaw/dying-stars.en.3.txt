LOS ANGELES â€” When ancient stars die, they give off colorful clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae. Recently astronomers discovered something mysterious about some nebulae at the heart of the Milky Way: They all line up in the same direction.

The discovery was made by two researchers from the University of Manchester. Their findings help explain how the stars behind the nebulae formed. And they also may show what unknown forces pulled the nebulae into their strange formation.

A dying star's nebula is a sight to behold. Like a flower shedding its petals, an aging star casts off its outer layers. Soon, it is surrounded with cloud-like shells of gas and dust.

But these shells aren't just interstellar eye candy. Planetary nebulae can tell scientists much about the environment in which they were formed. Nebulae reflect their stars' individual characteristics. And they can reveal whether a star is one of a pair of stars.

## Lined Up In The Same Direction

The two researchers, Bryan Rees and Albert Zijlstra, studied 130 nebulae. All are located roughly 26,000 light-years away in the center of Milky Way. This is the galaxy that contains our own planet.

The majority of the nebulae were elliptical, meaning they had a mostly roundish shape. But around 44 of them were bipolar; that is, they had formed into twin gas clouds. They often resemble butterfly wings.

Soon the researchers began to notice something strange: More than half of the bipolar nebulae seemed to be aligned. In other words, they were lined up in the same direction. This was particularly surprising because they were many light-years apart. Just one light year equals about 6 trillion miles.

"The surprise is that there's a relationship between things that are so widely separated," Rees said. "Now, how can we explain it?"

Other bipolar nebulae closer to us aren't neatly arranged. This means there must be something going on in the galaxy's center that's causing nebulae to line up.

The nebulae's alignment points to "a powerful magnetic pull in the galactic bulge when they were formed," Rees said, referring to the center of the galaxy. "It's not necessarily there now."

## A Powerful Magnetic Force In The Center

Say you're holding a magnet near a bunch of scattered nails. Now suppose that only some of the nails are magnetized. Only the magnetized nails will turn and point if you bring the magnet near. The unmagnetized ones won't move.

Something like that could have happened at the center of the Milky Way, astronomers say. The bipolar nebulae were probably two-star systems with strong magnetic fields. Like the magnetized nails, they would have been unable to resist a powerful magnetic force. Such a force may have existed in the galaxy's center about 8 to 13 billion years ago.

The bipolar nebulae ended up looking something like hourglasses lying on their sides. The elliptical nebulae lacked a strong magnetic field. Thus, they remained unmoved.

The findings could help explain how bipolar nebulae are formed, Rees said.

The study doesn't go into what could have caused that magnetic field. But a recent study suggests there is a strong magnetic field around the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Whether that field was responsible for the unusual nebulae formation remains to be seen.
