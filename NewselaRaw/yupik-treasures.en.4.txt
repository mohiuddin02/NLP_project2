QUINHAGAK, Alaska â€” A very old village has been frozen in place for hundreds of years. It is on the coast of the Bering Sea in Alaska. Now, that coastline has begun to wash away. Scientists from around the world are digging up its history before it is all gone.

The scientists are digging up artifacts of the Yup'ik people. They lived in the village long ago. The Yup'ik were there before Russians and other Europeans arrived in the early 1800s.

In Alaska, artifacts normally are not touched and stay in the ground. But the Yup'ik people of Quinhagak asked the scientists to dig.

Why? "Because we had nothing," said Warren Jones. He is the head of the village. Yup'ik culture was hurt by European church missionaries. Their culture was almost lost, Jones said.

## Uncovering The Hidden Village

The dig began five years ago. Scientists, students and Quinhagak villagers are working together. They are trying to save items from a house area they call "Nunalleq," or old village.

It is the first dig in a Yup'ik house, said Rick Knecht. He is the head scientist.

People first lived there in the 1300s, he said.

The old houses collapsed in a fire. Over time the village was hidden by tall grasses.

Scientists say they found a large men's winter house at the center. Men usually lived separately from women and children.

The old village was kept in good shape by the frozen earth. Even wooden cooking spoons were saved. Then the ice began melting. The edge of the tundra washed into the sea.

In the last five years, 30 feet of land near the dig have been lost.

"It's really going fast, right in front of our eyes," Knecht said. The dig started in 2009. If they had waited, thousands of items at the village would have washed away.

## "We Only Get One Shot"

The diggers have collected close to 50,000 ancient items. They have found old animal bones. They have found bits of grass rugs that covered the walls and pieces of wooden tools.

Scientists collected stories from Quinhagak elders about the objects they found. They showed the elders what they had dug up. The elders talked in Yup'ik about the finds. One elder knew the stone used for an ulu blade just by its color. The ulu is a curved knife.

"We only get one shot at it," Knecht said. "These are all pages in the Yup'ik history book."

Village leaders work with elders and the scientists. They talk about when to dig, how to preserve the site and what to do with what they find.

The scientists put their most interesting finds on display in a community building. They invited the whole village to see and touch them. A tiny seal amulet made of mammoth tusk. Wooden masks that had been broken in half. Stone harpoon tips. Pieces of tiny model kayaks.

## More Stories Waiting To Be Discovered

John Smith stood at a table with tiny pieces of carved ivory jewelry. Smith is a master carver. He marveled at the skill of his ancestors before they had electric tools and metal blades. It inspired him to try some of the designs.

Scientists and villagers say they want to build a village cultural center. It will show some of the ancient tools and art. It could also be a place for artists and craftsmen to work and teach others.

Quinhagak may be just the start, Knecht said. Other ancient Alaska villages along the coast and on rivers are washing away too.

Their stories may soon be uncovered.
