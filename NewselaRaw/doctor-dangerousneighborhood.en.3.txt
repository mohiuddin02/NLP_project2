CHICAGO â€” Dr. Fred Richardson Jr. was born on Chicago's tough South Side. He became a doctor in 1990. Since then, he has been making house calls in the city's most dangerous neighborhoods. A house call is a home visit by a doctor. Treating people at home helps keep them out of hospitals, experts say.

Richardson also helps poor students make it through medical school. Three days a week, he helps them with their schoolwork for free.

Richardson has saved 50 students from dropping out. Twenty years ago, Clyde Whiting was one of those students.

Without Richardson, he said, "I could have been lost." Today, Whiting is an emergency room doctor.

## Education Is A Ticket Out

Richardson did not know any black doctors when he entered Rush Medical College in Chicago.  His mother was a bookkeeper and his father was a construction worker who drank too much. The family lived in a poor area with few jobs and a lot of crime. They moved a lot. Richardson remembers spending a night in a homeless shelter.

Richardson became a doctor for many reasons. It all started with his mother, Gladys Richardson.

"Her goal in life was to educate her children because she thought that was the only way out of Englewood," Richardson said. Englewood is the South Side neighborhood where he grew up.

His mother supported the family. Somehow, she earned enough to keep her four kids in private Catholic schools. Homework was taken seriously, and straight A's were expected.

That was her way of making sure her children stayed on the right path.

## Always Working Hard, Helping

Richardson's neighborhood friends "were into all sorts of bad things." But they protected him and his younger brother, Lendell, who also became a doctor. Their friends respected their dream of becoming doctors.

They thought, "OK, don't mess with them because they may have to take care of us" one day, Richardson said.

In high school, he was one of the three best students in his class and earned a scholarship to Loyola University in Chicago. In medical school, he was the only black male in his class.

To get through medical school, he relied on his mother's example. He worked hard. He still does.

Now, Richardson works six days a week. He works at a hospital during the day. At night he visits patients in their homes. He tells them they can call on him 24 hours a day, seven days a week if they feel poorly. Richardson sleeps four hours a night, and does not drink alcohol or coffee.

What keeps him going is a wish to help people.

Last fall, Richardson walked into Louise Cannon's house. When the 79-year-old woman saw her doctor, she beamed.

Richardson checked her blood pressure and hearing. After that, he let her 2-year-old great-great-granddaughter listen to her own heartbeat with his stethoscope.

"There you go," Richardson said. "You could be a doctor someday."
