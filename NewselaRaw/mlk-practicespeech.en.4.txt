RALEIGH, N.C. â€” Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was a famous speaker. He spent his life fighting hard for other people. He wanted black people to be treated fairly. His work changed America.

King's most famous speech is the "I Have a Dream" speech. He gave it in 1963 in Washington, D.C. There were hundreds of thousands of people there.

## Finding Tapes Wasn't Easy

Now the public can hear King giving a similar speech. The speech is from 1962. It lasts 55 minutes. He did it 8 months before the Washington speech. King gave it in a high school gymnasium in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The crowd was small. The speech was also recorded. More than 50 years later, the speech can be heard again.

The tapes were found by someone named Jason Miller. He is a researcher. Miller also is a professor. He read an article in an old newspaper about the first speech. Miller found the newspaper at a state museum. He thought there was probably a recording out there, too.

Miller found the tapes, finally. It wasn't easy. The tapes were in the library in Rocky Mount. One day the library called Miller. He learned that the library had found a box with the tapes in it. They didn't know much about the speech. They also didn't know who the box was from. There was a note on the box that said King's recordings were inside.

Miller listened to the tapes. He read the notes King used from his Washington, D.C., speech.

## Encouraging Words

Miller played the recording for the public recently. Three people who were in the audience for King's 1962 Rocky Mount speech had the chance to hear it. Herbert Tillman remembers it well. He was 17 years old at that time in 1962.

Tillman said King's words were encouraging. He remembers the crowd listening closely. The town of Rocky Mount really needed to hear King's inspiring speech during that time, Tillman said.

Now, anyone can hear the tapes. The speech is important. It helps us understand King and inspires people who listen.
