WASHINGTON, Ill. â€” A cluster of thunderstorms marched across the Midwest late in the season. Luckily, forecasters were able to draw a bright line on a map. It showed where the worst of the weather would go.

Their correct predictions were combined with television and radio warnings, text-message alerts and storm sirens. They almost certainly saved lives. The storms howled through 12 states. They flattened entire neighborhoods within minutes. But only eight people died.

By Monday, another, more ordinary reason for the low death count came out. In the hardest-hit town, most families were in church.

"I don't think we had one church damaged," said Gary Manier, mayor of Washington, Ill. His community of 16,000 lies about 140 miles southwest of Chicago.

## A Twister Warning At Church

The tornado cut a path about the size of two football fields from one side of Washington to the other. It damaged or destroyed as many as 500 homes. The heavy weather also battered parts of the Midwest, from Michigan to western New York.

Back in Washington, Daniel Bennett was leading Sunday services in front of 600 to 700 people when he heard a beeping noise. Then another. And another.

"I'd say probably two dozen phones started going off in the service," he said.  "And everybody started looking down."

What they saw was a text message from the National Weather Service. It warned that a twister was in the area. Bennett stopped the service and made sure everyone got to a safe place until the threat passed.

Many townspeople said those messages helped keep deaths and injuries low. "That's got to be connected," Bennett said. "The ability to get instant information."

In Indiana, Taylor Glenna heard emergency sirens go off and received an alert on his cellphone. A friend also called to warn him the storm was nearly upon him.

Glenna went outside, saw icy hail and heard a loud boom. He ran to his basement just in time.

On Monday, he was surveying the damage on crutches. He suffered a leg injury when the wind knocked his home off its base.

"I would say we had pretty good warning," Glenna said. "We just didn't listen to it."

## Forecasts Much More Accurate

Forecasting has steadily improved with the arrival of faster, more powerful computers. Scientists are now better able to find out more about the weather using mathematical equations.

In the last 10 years, forecasters have doubled how far in advance they can predict large storms, said Bill Bunting. He is the chief forecaster at the National Weather Service. He said it was not until Saturday that it was clear the conditions for a large storm were there.

That's when information from weather stations, weather balloons and satellites came together. It suggested there was more than enough moisture in the air. Moisture is fuel for storms.

This has been a mild year for twisters in the U.S. The number of twisters is running at or near record lows.

So far this year, there have been 886 early reports of tornadoes. There are about 1,400 early reports usually sent to the weather service by mid-November.

Similar slow years were 1987 and 1989.

## A Tornado Trigger

An outbreak like the one that developed Sunday usually happens about once every seven to 10 years.

There were similar November outbreaks in 1992 and 2002. The 1992 outbreak was even bigger than this year's.

The storms erupted because of unusually warm, wet air from Louisiana to Michigan that was then hit by an upper-level cold front. That crash of hot and cold, dry and wet, is what triggers tornadoes.

Like most November storms, this one was high in wind shear and lower in moist energy. Wind shear is the difference between winds at high altitude and wind near the surface.

Because it was high in wind shear, the storm system moved fast, like a speeding car. That meant the system hit more places before it died out, affecting more people. But in places where it hit, the system may have been slightly less damaging because it was moving so fast, he said.

About 90 minutes after the tornado plowed through Washington, rain and high winds slammed into downtown Chicago. Officials at Soldier Field emptied the stands and ordered the Bears and Baltimore Ravens off the football field. Fans were allowed back to their seats shortly after 2 p.m. The game resumed after about a two-hour delay.
