JOHANNESBURG — Nelson Mandela, one of the world's most beloved leaders and a hero of the 20th century, died on Thursday, Dec. 5. He was 95.

Mandela was best known for his fight to end apartheid in South Africa. Apartheid was a system that forced non-whites in South Africa to live separately and with fewer rights.

His fight cost him 27 years in prison. But he won the struggle. Apartheid ended and Mandela became South Africa's first black president.

He built bridges of peace between blacks and whites with well-chosen gestures of forgiveness. He even had lunch with the government lawyer who sent him to jail.

South African President Jacob Zuma made the announcement of his death late on Thursday. "We've lost our greatest son," he said.

## Birth Of A Freedom Fighter

Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born July 18, 1918, the son of a tribal chief. He grew up at a time when nearly all of the African continent was under European rule.

Mandela attended Christian schools. After that, he entered a university for black students in 1938. He was expelled two years later for taking part in a student strike.

Mandela first showed signs of leadership in 1944, when he helped form the African National Congress (ANC) Youth League. The ANC played a large role in the fight against apartheid.

In 1952, he urged others to not follow laws that segregated schools, marriage, housing and jobs. The government got back at him by keeping him from going to gatherings. They also didn't let him leave Johannesburg.

He was arrested in 1962 for leaving the country illegally and inciting blacks to strike. His punishment was five years of hard labor.

A year later, police uncovered documents outlining plans for an attack. Mandela and seven co-defendants were sentenced to life in prison.

## Prison Walls No Match For Mandela

Mandela had been convicted of crimes against the government in 1964. He was sentenced to life in prison. While Mandela was in prison, it was forbidden to use words he had said or show his photo in any public way. But Mandela was still able to sneak out messages to help others fight against apartheid.

From the late 1960s, more countries began to shun South Africa for its racist system. It was kicked out of the United Nations. It was banned from the Olympics. In 1973 the government offered to release Mandela on condition he agree to stay in his native land of Transkei. He refused. In 1982 he and other top ANC prisoners were moved to a mainland prison. Three years later, Mandela was offered freedom again. Again, he refused it unless segregation laws were put to an end.

As time passed more and more people around the world found out about apartheid. By the time Mandela turned 70 years old, he was the world's most famous political prisoner. Through mental toughness, he was able to turn down offers of freedom from his jailers.

In 1989, F.W. de Klerk became president. De Klerk was a white South African who realized that the white-only rule of South Africa was coming to an end.

On Feb. 11, 1990, Mandela walked out of prison. He was a free man. Blacks across the country erupted in joy — as did many whites.

## A Nation's Healer

Mandela took charge of the ANC. He shared the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk in 1993. In the following year, he easily won South Africa's first all-race election.

South Africa's white rulers warned that Mandela was too extreme. They said black rule would lead to the same chaos and bloodshed that had happened in many other African countries.

Yet since apartheid ended, South Africa has elected three presidents. They have always been elected peacefully. The country has set an example on a continent where democracy is still new and easily broken.

With his fellow Nobelist, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, he set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Commission allowed people of all races who had violated human rights to admit their crimes publicly. In return, they would receive a lighter punishment. It helped heal the nation. Other countries facing similar problems copied South Africa's example.

More and more, Mandela turned over his duties to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. When Mandela's term ended, Mbeki became president in 1999. Mandela decided not run for another term, which is rare for African presidents.

"I must step down while there are one or two people who admire me," Mandela joked at the time.
