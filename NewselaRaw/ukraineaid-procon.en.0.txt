### PRO: Putin's aggression against Ukraine won't be stopped by mere sanctions

WASHINGTON — The president sets U.S. foreign policy but, with regard to Ukraine, Congress has an opportunity to push the United States in a more fruitful direction by approving bipartisan legislation from the Senate that would give Kiev $350 million in military aid to help it fend off Moscow's advances.

Russia's Vladimir Putin, who dreams of resurrecting the Soviet empire, scoffs at U.S. and European actions to date, and he won't be deterred from seizing more of Ukraine and plotting his next moves in the region by somewhat tougher sanctions or more Western poo-pooing about his growing "isolation."

That's important because Putin is not just carving up a former Soviet republic but, increasingly, he's threatening the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, all of which are now members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). More broadly, he's threatening the very norms of international relations that have mostly ensured global stability in the post-Cold War world.

Only U.S. military aid to Ukraine's besieged government holds the potential to give Putin any pause. As Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko told Congress recently with regard to U.S. non-military aid, "Blankets and night-vision goggles are important. But one cannot win a war with blankets."

For the U.S.-led West and its efforts to halt Putin's advances, 2014 has been a weak year of verbal condemnation, limited sanctions and military posturing.

Far from disturbing Putin, the West's actions to date have only encouraged Moscow's strongman to push ahead.

Russia annexed Crimea in March after its troops seized control of the peninsula and, in a fraudulent election, Crimeans voted 95.5 percent to join Russia. U.S. and European leaders denounced the action, imposed limited sanctions, and conducted military exercises in the area — none of which deterred Putin.

Then, Russia aided pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine, sent troops and arms across the border, cut off natural gas supplies on which Ukraine relies heavily, and forced concessions from Kiev as part of a cease-fire that separatists have already violated.

President Barack Obama vowed that "there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine," the United States and Europe ramped up sanctions and Obama visited Estonia to voice U.S. support for the Baltics — but Putin barely noticed.

Regarding the Baltics, a top Russian official recently complained of discrimination against ethnic Russians and the Russian language, laying the groundwork for a Ukraine-like intervention.

In addition, Russia seized an Estonian security official along their shared border and charged him with espionage, captured a Lithuanian fishing vessel in what it said were Russian waters, and asked Lithuania to extradite some 1,500 former Soviet citizens who supposedly hadn't fulfilled their military service in the Soviet Union.

Weak Western action is emboldening Putin. In mid-September, Russian strategic nuclear bombers flew within 63 miles of Alaska's coast and 46 miles of Canada's, forcing U.S. and Canadian jets to intercept them.

That Russia sent its bombers as Poroshenko was meeting with top Canadian and U.S. officials signaled Putin's disdain for the West. In the same vein, Russia sent nuclear bombers on a practice cruise missile attack off Canada's coast earlier in September around the time of NATO's summit in Wales in response to Russia's activities in Ukraine.

Such Russian brashness comes as Moscow is upgrading its nuclear arsenal with new missiles, submarines and a new bomber; test-firing new missiles, and strengthening its forces and bases in the Arctic.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the $350 million in aid for Ukraine on Sept. 18. Congress should quickly follow suit, and President Obama should shift course and sign it.

Otherwise, we'll surely see more brazen Russian attacks both in Ukraine and beyond, forcing Washington to ponder what comes next and how much more it will let Putin chip away at the U.S.-led global order.

### CON: Providing lethal aid will shatter cease-fire; add to death and destruction

COLUMBUS, Ohio — President Barack Obama is right to reject the request of Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko for military aid of the lethal type. Poroshenko wants weaponry to fight separatist elements in his country.

Obama gave Poroshenko a feel-good moment during his visit to Washington by letting him make an impassioned appeal in Congress for lethal aid, generating applause from lawmakers. But in a meeting just after, Obama turned Poroshenko down. Obama will come up with military aid of a non-lethal type for Ukraine.

A cease-fire is in place — more or less — in Ukraine between the central authorities and the separatists, who hold the major eastern cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. If the cease-fire holds, the warfare that has devastated some areas in eastern Ukraine will not resume. Giving Ukraine more lethal-type aid would risk fueling the hostilities in eastern Ukraine at a time when matters seem to be getting resolved.

Poroshenko has just made an important concession to the separatists with the passage of a law on autonomy for the separatist-inclined areas. That law, along with the cease-fire, has set a path to a way out of the deadly conflict.

Obama's rejection of lethal aid does not satisfy everyone in Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has called for lethal aid to Ukraine. But what the United States should now do is to help solidify the cease-fire and encourage implementation of the new autonomy law.

That law is a good first step toward giving the population in eastern Ukraine more control over local affairs, and allowing for maintenance of the closer ties that that area has historically had with Russia.

In the public discussion over a proper U.S. approach toward the situation, focus has been on U.S.-Russia differences. There is a tendency to see anything that looks like a gain for Russia as a loss on our side.

The focus needs to be on what is best for Ukraine. The United States is a participant in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been working in Ukraine to bring about an agreement between the central authorities and the separatists over their relationship.

Finding the right balance will not be easy. The new law on autonomy is more a road map than a precise recipe. It leaves unclear exactly which parts of eastern Ukraine are involved, and just what autonomy will mean.

One factor of some uncertainty is the desire of the population in eastern Ukraine. One segment of the easterners wants nothing to do with the government in Kiev. It is that opinion that fuels the separatists. But others in that part of Ukraine are comfortable with rule from Kiev. And perhaps a third segment just wants calm.

One key element in the new autonomy law is an assurance that the Russian language can be used in the public sphere in eastern Ukraine. That is a good step, even though it is only a reversion to the situation that preceded the turbulent events of last winter in Ukraine.

In the midst of that political turmoil, Ukraine's parliament passed a law to repeal a 2012 law that had allowed for the use of Russian as an official language. Protest followed that move, leading Ukraine's president to nullify the repeal. Now at least the prior situation has been restored.

Just what kind of relationship eastern Ukraine will have with Russia remains to be worked out. Annexation by Russia — as happened earlier in the year for Crimea — is not in the cards for eastern Ukraine. The central government and the separatists have to work out an accommodation.

The United States should promote that process. There is every reason to believe that an acceptable arrangement can be achieved that will end the bloodshed in Ukraine.
