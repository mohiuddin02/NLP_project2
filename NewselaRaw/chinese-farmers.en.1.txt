BEIJING — When Ma Wenfeng was a boy, the last thing he would have dreamed of was becoming a farmer. His father earned so little money growing wheat and corn that the family mainly ate mantou, a steamed bread that is a staple of the poor.

Now it is his greatest ambition to start a farm — but not in China, a country where the word "farmer" is synonymous with "peasant." Many Chinese farmers are long past retirement age but still tilling tiny, inefficient plots of land.

Motivated by the search for wide open land with abundant supplies of clean water, the Chinese are looking far afield. They have turned their attention to, among other places, the United States, Chile, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Australia.

"We're the world's fastest-growing economy, with a huge demand for agricultural products," said Ma, an agricultural analyst. "When we look overseas, we see large tracts of land where you can operate a farm that makes sense economically."

## "Our Land Was Never Enough"

From an economic standpoint, Chinese investment in farmland makes perfect sense. China has 20 percent of the world's population, but just 9 percent of its usable agricultural land.

"Throughout Chinese history, our land was never enough," said Tian Zhihong, a professor of international agriculture.

China suffers from frequent droughts and desertification. In recent decades it has added to its problems by polluting the land or paving it over as it rushes to expand its economy.

The Ministry of Land and Resources in December revealed the results of a five-year study: 8 million acres of farmland, or roughly 2 percent of the country's agricultural land, is now too polluted for farming.

A series of food scandals has made foreign-grown foods more popular in China than homegrown produce. These scandals have involved everything from tainted rice to exploding watermelon, both the result of excessive fertilization.

"We want to bring American sunshine, land and water back to China," said Zhang Renwu, who owns two farms in Utah.

## Controversy At Home

Many countries ban the sale of land to foreigners, but Chinese companies are acquiring farmland wherever they can. Where land sales are prohibited, they have been forming partnerships with farming enterprises overseas.

When China's largest pork producer, Shuanghui International, bought its U.S. counterpart, Smithfield Foods, last year, it also acquired a vast amount of farmland: more than 100,000 acres in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina.

In Australia, a Chinese-led group of companies acquired a sprawling 200,000-acre cotton plantation, said to have the largest irrigation system in the Southern Hemisphere.

In Chile, the Chinese company Joyvio is growing blueberries, kiwis and grapes and is scouting for new investments.

These investments are controversial both at home and abroad. The Chinese government has been criticized at home for allowing too much farmland to be paved over for apartments and shopping malls. It also has been blamed for dragging its feet when it comes to making long-overdue changes that would help modernize domestic agriculture.

Worldwide in 2012, there were at least 54 Chinese agricultural projects overseas. Together these accounted for almost 12 million acres.

## Provoking Anxiety Abroad

China's farmland investments take many forms. Large state-owned enterprises are investing in plantations in Tanzania, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia, among other countries, to grow corn, rice, cassava and sesame. Some products are sold locally and some are exported to China.

Smaller privately owned Chinese businesses have leased farms across the border in Russia as part of a deal with Moscow. Unlike in Africa, where the employees are local, Chinese workers have crossed the border into Russia as well.

But China's interest in farmland often provokes anxiety. For many, it conjures up visions of a dragon devouring the world's resources to feed its 1.3 billion people.

A furor erupted over alleged Chinese aims this past September, for example: A Chinese company was said to be planning to farm up to 11,562 square miles of Ukraine, long referred to as the breadbasket of Europe.

A farm that size would account for an area almost as large as Belgium or Maryland.

"China 'land grab' sees it given control of 5 percent of Ukraine," read a headline in Britain's Daily Telegraph.

The Chinese company in question, Xinjiang Production &amp; Construction, quickly issued a denial. The arrangement, however, has proceeded but with a far smaller amount of land being farmed under a 50-year lease. The Chinese agreed to develop irrigation systems in exchange for favorable terms on importing crops, mostly wheat, grown on the land.

## Farming, Fishing And Forestry

China's Africa moves have been particularly controversial, with accusations that the Chinese are exploiting the much-colonized continent.

"Zimbabwe now a full-fledged Chinese colony," read a headline in the Zimbabwe Mail in November about Chinese-owned wheat, soybean and tobacco fields.

Many countries prohibit foreign ownership, and in others there is strong opposition to selling land to the Chinese. For that reason, new Chinese farms are being set up as leases, where the Chinese company rents the farmland for a long fixed period. Alternatively, Chinese companies are promising to build infrastructure, such as roads and water systems, in exchange for favorable purchase prices.

"When you say China is involved, it is like pushing a red button," said international studies professor Deborah Brautigam. "There is a China effect."

China is far from the world's largest investor in agriculture, however. The United States still ranks first, with Britain, South Korea, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore all holding investments larger than or rivaling China's.

But China is closing the gap fast. Its direct foreign investments in farming, fishing and forestry totaled nearly $5 billion at the end of 2012, almost double where they were two years earlier.

"It is only the last two years that the big agricultural companies are going overseas in a big way," said Ma, the agricultural analyst. "I think you will see much more."
