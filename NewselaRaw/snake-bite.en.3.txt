DALLAS — When a man was bitten by a poisonous snake, the Dallas Zoo had the cure.

The zoo has the country's best collection of poisonous snakes. It also has one of the nation's largest supplies of antivenom. Made from the venom of poisonous snakes, antivenom is used to treat snakebites.

Most snakebites come from snakes native to the United States and happen because of people's bad judgment, Bradley Lawrence said. He is the zoo's reptile and amphibian supervisor. Native snakes are from the United States. Exotic snakes come from other countries.

"Most of the time it's native venomous snakes that somebody has decided to mess around with, late at night," he said. People say, "Oh, look, there's a snake. Let's pick it up!'"

## Treat The Snakebite Fast!

Most native snakes' antivenom is kept in hospitals. When someone in the Southwest is bitten by an exotic snake, the zoo is often asked for some of its antivenom.

The zoo will send the antivenom quickly by helicopter or plane.

The zoo keeps thousands of tubes of antivenom in a small refrigerator. It is worth about $200,000.

The most recent call for help came in January. A man was bitten by his African bush viper. It is an exotic species that has no antivenom.

In these types of cases, the zoo checks if there is another kind of antivenom that would work.

When treating a bite, doctors determine the kind of snake involved. They study the effects of the poison and the best antivenom to use. They also check to see if there are any risks.

## Each Snake Has An Information Sticker

Antivenom is not cheap. The basic price for antivenom costs $200 a tube for snakes from Asia. It can cost up to $2,500 a tube for Australian snakes.

Doctors give a snakebite victim four to six tubes of antivenom to start. Up to 30 tubes might be needed if the person is very sick.

At the Dallas Zoo's reptile house, each cage is labeled with information about the snake and correct antivenom in case of a bite. About 65 of the zoo's 90 species of snakes are poisonous, said Ruston Hartdegen. He is the head of the zoo's amphibians and reptiles department.

All staff members learn how to work with the poisonous snakes. To handle cobras and other especially dangerous snakes they must have special training, Hartdegen said. On the walls are red buttons labeled "snakebite alarm."

In more than 100 years, only three zoo workers have been bitten by a snake. None of them needed antivenom.

## Safest To Visit Snakes In Zoos

The zookeepers are as fascinated with the snakes as their visitors. Bradley Lawrence is a fan of the cobras and mambas. Matt Vaughan, who also works at the zoo, is a pit viper guy.

Pit vipers get their name from the two heat-sensing pits under their eyes.

Vaughan grew up near a lake full of reptiles and amphibians. For a kid who was fascinated with dinosaurs, "I was in heaven," he said.

Lawrence has a green mamba snake tattoo swirling up his arm. He got his first snake — a green snake — from his father when he was 10.

The zoo workers say people should only visit deadly snakes at the zoo. The snakes are much too dangerous to keep at home as pets, they say.

## Snakebite Steps From Parkland Memorial Hospital:

—Go to the emergency room or call 911.

—Take a picture of the snake or try to remember what it looks like.

—Keep your arm or leg still.

—Do Not try to suck out the venom like in the movies. That does not work.

## The Antivenom Process

Healthy snakes are typically milked about every two weeks to collect the venom.

Snakes are held between a finger and thumb. The person holding the snake puts gentle pressure on its mouth so the fangs are exposed. It bites onto a glass funnel. The venom runs down the funnel into a tube.

The venom is injected into an animal — either a horse or a sheep — which will produce antibodies. These are cells that recognize a threat to the body, like poisonous snake venom, and kill it.

After several months, blood containing the antibodies will be taken from the animal and made into antivenom.
