WASHINGTON â€” Over the years, many people have said they didn't like the name of the Washington Redskins football team. On Wednesday, a governmental board ruled on the matter: The name is insulting to [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American), it said. The team, it said, shouldn't have a special right to sell products bearing the name.

The ruling was 2-1 against the team. It doesn't force the team to lose the name. However, it says that the team's use of the name should no longer be protected.

Right now, the team owns the Redskins name. No one else is allowed to sell sweatshirts, caps or other clothing featuring the name.

The new ruling could change that. It may make it very difficult to stop others from using the name as well.

Sports teams make a lot of money from selling team-related clothing. The Redskins stand to lose much of that money if anybody can use their name. That puts pressure on the team to change what it calls itself. If it came up with another name, that name could be protected.

## Team Owner Says The Name Stays

The Redskins aren't ready to give up yet, though. The team quickly announced it will fight the new ruling.

It may be years before a final decision is made. Still, the new ruling shows that more and more people believe the name must be changed.

This was actually the second time the board has ruled on the team's name. In 1999, it ruled almost the same way it has now. That earlier ruling was reversed in 2003.

In 2003 the courts had reversed the decision because those who objected to the name had waited too long to complain. Too many years had passed since the team began using its name.

In 2006, the case was relaunched. This time, the case was brought by a younger group of Native Americans. They were too young to have been able to complain to the courts earlier. For that reason, they were allowed to do so now.

## Lining Up For Change

Over the past year, more and more people have come out against the name.

On Saturday, the United Church of Christ asked its members to not attend Redskins games or buy Redskins clothing. Some members of the government recently wrote letters urging a name change. One letter declared that "racism and bigotry have no place" in sports.

On Wednesday, Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray added his voice. The Redskins name will almost certainly have to change, he said, if the team ever wants to build a new stadium in the city.

Team owner Dan Snyder refused to comment following the ruling. In the past, he has said repeatedly that he will never change the name.

Redskins players have mostly avoided the topic.

"Our job as players," quarterback Robert Griffin III said, is to play ball "day-in and day-out." It's up to team lawyers to handle the problem, he added. Players will speak out "when it's the right time."

## Maybe It's A Matter Of Time

The Redskins have responded to attacks in various ways. One thing they have done is to form something called the Original Americans Foundation. This group has been giving money to Native American tribes.

Suzan Shown Harjo is a lead figure in the latest case. According to her, the Original Americans Foundation is simply trying to buy support. She compared what it is doing to bribery.

Supporters of a name change quickly hailed the new decision.

It is "just a matter of time," Senator Harry Reid said, until a name change happens. Sooner or later, he added, Snyder will give in. He will be "forced to do the right thing."
