In the spring of 1920, President Woodrow Wilson had suffered a stroke. He was seriously ill. He realized his illness was not only hurting him politically. It was also hurting the country.

He confided in his good friend, the White House doctor, Cary T. Grayson: "My personal pride must not be allowed to stand in the way of my duty to the country. If I am only half-efficient I should turn the office over to the vice president. If it is going to take much time for me to recover my health and strength, the country cannot afford to wait for me."

But his friend and doctor convinced Wilson to stay in office and keep the illness a secret.

Both Wilson's doctor and his wife Edith Wilson worked together to cover up the president's medical condition.

Wilson's illness is a remarkable example in American history of the public being kept in the dark about a president's health troubles.

## Hidden From Public View

Wilson, the nation's 28th president, was trying to convince the Senate to ratify, or approve, the Treaty of Versailles, the agreement that ended World War I. The treaty would also create the League of Nations, an international organization dedicated to world peace.

To increase public support for the treaty, Wilson toured the country by train, giving speeches along the way. Three weeks into the tour, in Pueblo, Colorado, he collapsed from exhaustion.

The train sped back to Washington. But a week later, Wilson suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed his left side. For days he could not move. Eventually, he recovered some ability to walk, but he was badly weakened for the final 17 months of his presidency.

During this time, Wilson's advisers and his secretary kept things running smoothly.

In those days it was possible for a public figure to stay out of sight for months without causing much concern.

Here are other examples of presidential illnesses that weren't known to the public. In some instances, like that of a presidential running mate, it did come to light:

## Abraham Lincoln

During Lincoln's time, friends and observers noticed that he suffered from "melancholy" â€” sadness without a particular reason. We now know Lincoln had the classic symptoms of depression. He likely dealt with depression all his life, even before the Civil War and the deaths of his two sons.

Lincoln often cried in public and recited sad poetry, according to Joshusa Wolf Shenk, who wrote a book called "Lincoln's Melancholy." Lincoln told jokes and stories at strange times, explaining that he needed laughs for his survival.

As a young man, Lincoln talked of suicide more than once. As he grew older, he saw the world as a dark and difficult place. Despite his apparent depression, Lincoln was able to lead the country through one of its darkest periods, the Civil War.

## Grover Cleveland

During the 1893 financial panic, Cleveland noticed a sore on the roof his mouth, according to an article by Maureen Salamon. The sore seemed to be cancerous, and Cleveland had it removed while sailing on his yacht to his summer home. The crew of the ship was sworn to secrecy.

## Franklin D. Roosevelt

FDR was president for 12 years, from 1933 to 1945. He led the United States during the Great Depression and World War II. But the public during that time didn't know that FDR was paralyzed from the waist down due to polio.

The media helped to keep the secret, only photographing him from the waist up, never showing his wheelchair. White House officials made sure to keep his disability secret from the public.

## John F. Kennedy

Kennedy had a variety of health problems, including serious back pain and Addison's disease, which caused physical weakness and jaundiced (yellow) skin. JFK took as many as 12 pills at a time to cope with his illnesses.

## Tom Eagleton

During the 1972 presidential election, Democratic nominee George McGovern chose Eagleton as his running mate. But Eagleton didn't tell McGovern's people that he had been treated for depression in the 1960s, even receiving shock therapy. Shock therapy was once a common treatment for major depression, schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses. It involved doctors giving electric shocks to the patient's brain to cause seizures.

Rumors began to circulate about Eagleton's past, and he acknowledged his treatment at a news conference. At first, McGovern stood behind him, but eventually Eagleton was asked to step down. He was only the vice presidential nominee for 18 days. McGovern lost badly to Richard Nixon, but Eagleton was re-elected easily to the Senate in 1974.

## Ronald Reagan

After a speech at the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., Reagan was shot by John Hinckley. Reagan was wounded in the chest and arm. At 70 years old, the wounds were especially serious for the president.

But the White House didn't want to show confusion or weakness. Reagan left the hospital after only 13 days even though it took him about seven months to recover fully.

Later in his presidency, in his late 70s, Reagan sometimes had trouble remembering names and other details. His doctors said that he was not impaired. In 1994, Reagan announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
