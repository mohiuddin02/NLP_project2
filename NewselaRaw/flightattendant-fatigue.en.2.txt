Henry Lund was beat after a long day as a flight attendant when he arrived at his Anchorage, Alaska, hotel desperate to sleep. He had a 4 a.m. wake-up call for the trip back to Minneapolis-St. Paul. He remembers taking a sleeping pill — maybe two.

That return trip last summer ended his long career at Delta and Northwest airlines.

Lund, 49, says he has no memory of the incident that got him fired: shoving and berating another flight attendant.

His experience illustrates a broader problem for the nation's flight attendants. They work with less rest than foreign flight attendants and can rely more on sleeping pills than pilots do. Yet they share responsibility with pilots for passenger safety.

Flight attendants exhausted from long hours and little rest have forgotten to carry out safety duties. In some cases they've forgotten to engage or disarm emergency chutes, and failed to properly stow baggage. The federal government says mishaps may have increased as airlines cut rest periods to save money.

## Too Exhausted To Work?

"They're showing up to work impaired," said Peter Roma, who does research for the Federal Aviation Administration on sleep deprivation and fatigue.

The hazards of fatigue appear in flight attendants' own words.  Dozens of voluntary reports have been filed with the FAA.

"If there were an evacuation, I doubted my abilities," wrote one about the impact of working 12 hours without a break. "I also felt like an endangerment to my passengers."

Another injured a foot after she was struck by full coffee pots she forgot to secure. "This occurred because I was very tired," the flight attendant wrote. "I did not sleep well the night prior … constantly watching the clock in anticipation of my early wake-up call."

"None of us (was) alert enough to have been able to efficiently respond to an aircraft emergency," said another.

There has been plenty of concern about tired pilots. The FAA in 2011 toughened its rules for pilot rest after the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in New York. Investigators determined that pilots in the crash were likely so fatigued, they couldn't operate the plane safely.

The FAA set a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots prior to duty. The rule goes into effect next January.

## Attendants Should Get Same Rest As Pilots

But the government has paid less attention to flight attendants. That's even though the FAA calls them "safety professionals" and the first line of defense in an emergency.

"These are not just cocktail waitresses, for God's sakes," said Jim Oberstar, a former chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, who is now a transportation consultant in Washington, D.C. "If the flight attendant has to get you out of that plane in 90 seconds, they have to be alert, at their top performance. They can't be run down."

One aviation expert thinks flight attendants should have rest requirements like those of pilots.

"Why would we not want to keep fatigue managed to the same degree?" asked John Cox, a pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems, an aviation safety company. "The stresses are different, but the days are equally long or longer."

In Minneapolis, rest times for many Northwest Airlines flight attendants shortened after the company was acquired by Delta Airlines. Their union contract also expired. "Our duty days have gotten two to three hours longer in a lot of cases," said flight attendant Julianna Helminski.

The FAA typically requires at least nine hours' rest. That can be cut to eight hours on occasion.

## Studies Show Attendants Getting Less Sleep

FAA studies were conducted from 2008 through 2012 by its Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. Surveying thousands of flight attendants, they focused on sleep patterns of 200 working domestic and international flights. They revealed that:

—U.S. flight attendants catch fewer than six hours' sleep a day on average on domestic routes. They get fewer than five hours' sleep on international layovers.

—Sleep requirements declined during the recession. Airlines routinely scheduled flight crews "up to the regulation limits," the FAA researchers wrote. The change "could increase the likelihood of … fatigue-related mishaps."

—To cope with short rest, four of every 10 flight attendants used sleep aids during layovers.

The routine is familiar to an American Airlines flight attendant who flies between Miami, the Dominican Republic and Panama. He says he often works 14-hour days with a 10-hour layover twice a week.

"By the time you close that door behind you at the hotel, it's usually 9:30 or 10 o'clock," he said. He had a  wake-up call at 6:30 the next morning.

"The first thing I do when I get to the hotel is take my Ambien because it takes a good hour to kick in," he said. Ambien is one of the more popular prescription sleep aids. "I can't sleep without it."

On short sleep, he said, he'll sometimes fail to make sure that carry-ons are stowed in overhead bins. He asked to not be named for fear that his airline would fire him.

Under FAA rules, pilots "are generally prohibited from using prescription or over-the-counter medications for sleep," a spokesman said. But airlines are allowed to decide if flight attendants can use sleeping pills.

## Bad Sides Effects From Sleeping Pill?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration label has a warning about Ambien and other sleep aids with the ingredient Zolpidem. They've been linked to rare but "serious side effects" that include "more outgoing or aggressive behavior than normal, confusion, agitation."

That described the behavior Lund supposedly showed on his final flight. According to his employee file, other attendants and passengers saw Lund shoving a colleague and calling him a jerk.

Lund's reported behavior was out of character for the 14-year veteran, said Tim Oyler, a former Northwest manager who oversaw flight attendants. "He was known as an excellent flight attendant. … I was shocked when I heard."
