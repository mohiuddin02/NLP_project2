CORNUCOPIA, Wis. â€” Kevin Hunt sees ice and people, everywhere he looks.

Hunt stands at his Star North gas station. It is located in Cornucopia, an ant of a town on Lake Superior. He is amazed at his own luck.

People warned Hunt not to open a gas station there. Tourists leave in the fall. Only about 100 people live in the tiny town full time. People said he'd be out of business by March.

Then Lake Superior did something it hadn't done in many years: It froze.

## Winners And Losers

"It's been the worst winter on the lakes in 35 years," said Mark Gill. He directs shipping traffic for the Coast Guard. "The ice is thick. The coverage is vast. And the weather has been (extremely) cold over a long period of time."

The ice has created both winners and losers.

Ships can't get through the ice, but fishermen are thrilled. Scientists are also happy. When the ice melts, the water will raise the low lake levels. The Great Lakes hold one-fifth of the planet's fresh water.

In Cornucopia, there are wonderful sea caves. The caves are normally out of reach in the winter. This year, visitors just walk on the lake to explore the caves. A husband even pushed his wife across the ice in a wheelchair. The wheelchair was on skis.

Business has taken off. On weekends, 20,000 tourists visit the community. They pack the only restaurant. Hundreds of cars block the road. And, of course, everyone needs gas.

The gas station is so busy, someone needs to tell cars where to go. "There was a 40-foot line to the toilets," Hunt said.

## Too Many Tourists?

The freeze has been good for some things. The ice will keep the lakes cooler in summer. It also helps wildlife. Eggs of cold-water fish are better protected in icy waters.

But not everyone likes the freeze. Some people think there are too many tourists. Also, ships can't get through the ice.

Shipping has nearly stopped. Trips through the Great Lakes normally take two days. Now they take seven days or more.

The Coast Guard is trying to clear the ice. If it can't, shippers may lose $160 million.

And the ice may get worse.

For now, Lake Superior is quiet. But the quiet cannot last. The lake, as people say, is the boss.
