TAIYUAN, China — Air China Flight 1236 was supposed to take off at 8:10 p.m. for Beijing from Xian, hometown of China's famous terra cotta warriors.

It felt like the warriors could have marched faster. What was supposed to be a 100-minute flight last month ended up delayed, diverted and finally canceled. In the end, it took passengers 18 hours to get to Beijing.

China's skies are in a state of almost permanent gridlock. During the month of July, only 17.8 percent of flights departing from Beijing's airport were on time. In August, on-time departures improved, but only to 28.8 percent. Out of the 35 top international airports, Beijing is ranked the worst for punctuality, with Shanghai close behind.

The maddening delays have become a drag on the economy. They have also been the trigger for near-riots. In a nation that prides itself on social order, state media reported 26 major fights at Chinese airports between May and August. One Hong Kong airline has started teaching its flight attendants kung fu.

## Skies Crammed With Planes

Flights here are delayed for pretty much the same reason highways are backed up: Explosive economic growth has produced traffic faster than infrastructure has improved. In other words, airports and highways haven't kept up with the rising number of travelers and flights.

Since 2003, the number of airline passengers in China has nearly quadrupled. Last year, there were 319 million.

Meanwhile, airspace is limited by the People's Liberation Army, which controls 80 percent of the skies above China. In the U.S., roughly 17 percent is controlled by the government.

Air traffic controllers in China also are extremely cautious. Strict regulations were imposed after a series of accidents in the early 1990s. Flights are spaced about 7 to 10 miles apart, which means only 20 to 40 planes can land on a runway every hour. In the U.S., 60 per hour can land.

In preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics, China spent more than $3.5 billion building its showcase Terminal 3 at Beijing Capital International Airport. The glass atrium is the world's second-largest airport terminal and makes Beijing look rich. But it did nothing to reduce crowding in the air.

"It is like building a bigger parking lot. It didn't expand the airspace, so things only got worse," said Xu Hongjun, a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China.

## Long Delays Lead To Brawls

Xu said it would be very difficult to shift much airspace away from military use. Probably only President Xi Jinping could bring about such a change.

"Airspace is a sensitive topic. You have to figure out how to divide the airspace and balance national security with economic growth. That has to be done at the highest level of government," Xu said.

China is a huge country, full of mountains and gorges. This makes it better suited for travel by plane than train. In 2011, the Chinese government announced it would spend $230 billion to construct 55 new airports. One in Beijing is expected to be the world's largest.

For the time being, more passengers has meant more delays. And more frustration. One can now find YouTube videos of angry passengers throwing chairs and smashing telephones and computers.

On one night in July, there were three separate incidents at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Passengers beat up airport staff members, some of whom suffered serious injuries. The following weekend, 30 passengers stormed a runway in Nanchang after a seven-hour delay.

"The airlines are always coming up with different excuses. You never find the right person to ask, and the passengers just get angrier," said Tao Yuanyong, a Beijing travel agent.

## Unlimited Takeoffs But Limited Landings

The stock answer when passengers ask why a flight is delayed is "air traffic control." This vague phrase implies there's no permission for an airplane to take off or land.

The crisis hit a breaking point this summer. Stung by all the bad publicity, authorities introduced a new rule known as "unlimited takeoff." This lets planes from the busiest airports take off whether a landing strip is available or not. Aviation authorities also threatened to punish airlines if they had too many delays. Airlines could even lose their routes.

The result is that airlines tend to hustle passengers into planes that then pull away from the gate, making it look like the flight is on time. The passengers end up strapped in their seats on the tarmac, waiting for a runway. Or, even worse, they end up in flight, circling an airport. In addition to fraying nerves, this wastes fuel and creates pollution.

The Air China flight from Xian last month, already delayed nearly two hours, landed in Taiyuan rather than Beijing. A thunderstorm was the cause, passengers were told.

After an hour on the runway in the coal-mining capital, the flight to Beijing was canceled. Passengers were placed for the night in shared rooms in a guest house.

After all this, many passengers decided to no longer trust Air China. Rather than waiting, they took a train for the remaining 300-mile journey and arrived in Beijing at 3 p.m. Those who waited for a plane did only slightly better: They made it to Beijing at 1:30 p.m. — nearly 16 hours late.
