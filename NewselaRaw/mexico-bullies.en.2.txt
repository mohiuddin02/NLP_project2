MEXICO CITY — Violent drug gangs have brought Mexico international attention, but now public officials are focusing on another form of violence: school bullying.

In recent weeks, President Enrique Pena Nieto railed against [bullying](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying) during a visit to the troubled state of Tamaulipas. Mexican celebrities joined a Twitter campaign, holding signs with the hashtag "#ElBullyingNoEsUnJuego," Spanish for "Bullying is not a game."

On television, frightening pictures and videos of children being bullied have played in a loop during news programs. On June 11, Mexico's human rights commission announced that it would work with teachers as part of a national campaign to tackle bullying.

"The government has made a commitment … to make schools free of acoso escolar," Pena Nieto said in his late May appearance in Tamaulipas. He used the Spanish term for abuse of students, before adding, "what is known publicly as bullying."

## Listen Up!

People started to pay more attention to the anti-violence messages when a 12-year-old boy from Tamaulipas died in May after being grabbed by a group of young attackers who flung him against a wall. Newspapers said the boy had complained to his teacher about being bullied but was ignored.

But Roberto Campa, a top official in the federal Ministry of the Interior, said the administration of Pena Nieto has been working on this issue since last year. He started working on it shortly after he took office as part of a broader violence-prevention program.

Campa said that the issue had been largely overlooked.

"I think it was given less importance for many years. It was considered normal," he said. "Clearly, it's not normal, and things have changed and the issue is becoming more visible and central in public discussions."

## Schools Should Be Safe Places

Campa said the problem of bullying originates outside school, often within families. But he said that schools should at least be a protective space for students.

Others, such as Mexican newspaper journalist Monica Garza, said the word could just become an easy and trendy term to use in a country full of social ills. The mistreatment and abuse of people of all ages and of laws has long been a problem, she says. And it often comes from police or gangs.

Some say children who are abusing others now might one day join dangerous gangs.

"Mexico is a violent country that tolerates violence," Garza wrote. "Bullying," she said, "has become the word of the moment, signaling any kind of violence, at school or at work, and it's time to call things by their names. Murder is not bullying. It's murder. Assault is not bullying. It's assault … Many violent children in the schools aren't bullies, they're" future criminals.

## The Translation Is The Same: Bullying

The anti-violence message follows in the footsteps of high-profile anti-bullying efforts in the United States. As such, it's not surprising that in Mexico the English word has been adopted into regular speech.

Because there is no single word for "bullying" in Spanish, children outside a middle school in Tetelpan on the southern edge of Mexico City use the English word, which they pronounced "boo-leeng." Sometimes they used Spanglish verbs like "buleando."

"We're very worried about the bullying," said Brenda Quiroz Arteaga, 42. "My daughter was harassed for a long time because she's a little chubby and she suffered a lot. … I'm all for expelling from the schools all the students who bullean their schoolmates."

Using the word "bullearon," 12-year-old Julian Perez said, "I've been bullied because of my stature. I'm short. But I've become used to it and if I don't pay it any mind, they leave me alone."

Sandra Torres, 13, declared one boy in her class a "bulleador" who was under watch, but was a real "nightmare."

Parent Renata Fernandez, 44, had a slightly different thought.

"I think bullying has always existed," she said. "But now it's in fashion to talk about this theme. Before it didn't get a lot of attention."

## Anti-Violence Message Grows

The newspaper Milenio reported recently that a mother filed a complaint with Mexico City police against her own son for bullying students at his middle school. The mother knew that he had been abusing and embarrassing other students. The newspaper said that he was even forcing other students to give him money online. After she attended a talk about cyberbullying, the mother decided to go to the police.

Mario Cruz is a professor at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City who coordinates its human rights program. He said the problem is an old one, but that many Mexicans — especially youths — are only now being exposed to the idea of trying to stop it.

This is something that has was out of their hands and they had no plan for working with different government offices to do something about this, Cruz said. He said the anti-violence message the government is promoting is a corrective step, but at least it makes bullying and its effects more visible.
