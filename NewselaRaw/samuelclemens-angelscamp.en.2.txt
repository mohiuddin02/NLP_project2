ANGELS CAMP, Calif. — In a humble-looking notebook a century and a half old, there's an important entry that's barely longer than a tweet:

"Coleman with his jumping frog — bet stranger $50 — stranger had no frog &amp; C got him one — in the meantime stranger filled C's frog full of shot &amp; he couldn't jump — the stranger's frog won."

That short note was the framework for the story that introduced the world to Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. He had left Missouri to find gold in California and was working in a mine. After hearing fellow miners' tales in Angels Camp, he sketched out "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" — the short story that proved to be his big break as a writer.

Twain spent just 88 days in the California mountains, but that rainy winter became a major turning point in his career.

## Friendships Pointed Him In New Direction

Though he had little to show for his attempt at mining, he developed friendships that helped point him in a new direction. In his younger days, Twain dreamed of running a paddleboat up and down the mighty Mississippi River. Instead, he decided to "excite the laughter of God's creatures" through his writing.

Robert H. Hirst, official curator at the Mark Twain Project and Papers, says that Twain's time in California brought him to a key fork in the road. "Even when he's in Angels Camp, he still has not made up his mind to make his career in literature. And he's not going to make that leap until he is forced to, economically."

When Twain ran out of money, he finally decided to give writing his full attention. His friend, Artemus Ward, was a well-known humor writer who mentored Twain in those early days.

Ward asked Twain to write a short story for his new book of western experiences. Twain decided to use the frog tale he'd heard in Angels Camp, but it took him a few tries to get it just the way he wanted it. The story wasn't finished in time for Ward's book, but Ward's publisher liked it and sent it on to the Saturday Press.

The frog story turned out to be a huge hit — Twain had finally struck gold.

## Twain's Brand Of Humor Became Famous

Over the next 45 years, Twain classics like "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" showcased a new American style of humor.

The author didn't spend much time talking about his own writing, with the exception of a piece called "How to Tell a Story," in which Twain explained the difference between European and American humor.

"There are several kinds of stories, but only one difficult kind — the humorous," Twain wrote. "The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French."

For Twain, comic and witty stories had to be about a funny subject. Humorous stories — like his own — were funny because of the way they were told.

During his mining days, Twain stayed in a run-down cabin owned by Jim Gillis, a friend's older brother. Jim Gillis was well-educated and funny and became a major influence on Twain's brand of humor.

## Notebook Recalls A Night Of Clowning Around

According to Twain's journal, Gillis was known for entertaining groups of friends with tales he made up on the spot. Another entry talked about how he and Gillis goofed around during dinner one night. Twain recalls the two of them "talking like people 80 years old &amp; toothless."

Twain was impressed with Gillis' hilariously serious "deadpan" delivery. When he started performing in public in 1866, Twain found that style worked well for him, too.

Angels Camp, the mining town where Twain first heard about frog-jumping, continues to celebrate his time in California. For four days each year, the town hosts its annual Calaveras County Fair &amp; Jumping Frog Jubilee.

It's the perfect time to show off the town's "Hop of Fame." Three blocks of the Main Street sidewalk feature bronze plaques with the names of prize-winning frogs all the way back to the 1920s.

## Town Celebrates 150-Year-Old Frog Story

During the fair, the Angels Camp population usually swells from 3,836 to about 50,000. This year's attendance was expected to surge even higher because it's the 150th anniversary of Twain's frog story being published.

"People can explore gold mining in any number of places," said Jim Fletcher, a retired middle school English and history teacher. "They come here because of Mark Twain."

Fletcher is known as the "official storyteller of Calaveras County." He educates audiences about Twain's life every Wednesday in the Mark Twain Library at a local restaurant.

Next month, Fletcher will publish a short book about Twain's 88 days in California. He is also helping filmmaker John C. Brown with a documentary on Twain.

Brown noted that, in the past, people didn't always understand what a big difference Twain's short time at Angels Camp had made. Now, that is changing.

"There is now a wonderful energy about Twain and his importance to our town," Fletcher said. "The 150 celebration will change everything in our town for the better."
