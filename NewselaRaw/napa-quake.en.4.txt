NAPA, Calif. â€” Years ago, government officials in Napa worried that an earthquake could wreck the city's old brick buildings.

So they made brick buildings get retrofitted. Retrofitting buildings makes them stronger by bolting their brick walls to ceilings and floors.

The 104-year-old Alexandria Square building was one building that got retrofitted. The work was finished years ago.

Then a powerful earthquake struck Sunday morning. The walls on the top floors of the Alexandria crumbled. Bricks fell down onto the sidewalk and an outdoor cafe.

## Retrofitting Has Saved Lives

Engineers had worried that retrofitting buildings was not enough. It still leaves weak spaces between bricks. Whole chunks can fall, sending bricks crashing down.

"We can't keep every single brick in place in many of these older buildings," said Fred Turner. He is an engineer with the California government. He says retrofitting only makes the damage less.

Many cities have laws to make owners retrofit buildings. The work has saved lives by keeping buildings from crashing. Turner said things would have been much worse in Napa without retrofitting.

Parts of brick walls can still tumble. The problem is the mortar. Mortar is the paste that holds bricks together. It can give way during the shaking, Turner said. Over time, mortar can break down and grow weak. Then bricks can begin to slide.

Turner said mortar should be tested on old buildings. Owners may need to add new mortar.

## Bricks Fall Onto The Sidewalk

There are ways to make brick buildings stronger. Concrete or sticky glues can be added to the brick walls. Braces can be added for support. But most cities don't make owners add them. They are very expensive.

When the quake struck at 3:20 a.m., part of the Alexandria fell onto the sidewalk. A restaurant below it has outdoor seating. It was lucky the earthquake had not struck when the restaurant was open, said Mike DeSimoni Jr., the son of the building''s owner. "We could have lost lots of people."

David Cocke runs an earthquake retrofit business. He examined photos of the building. He said it looked like the mortar between the bricks was in poor shape.

Vintner's Collective is a wine bar in Napa. Part of its building crashed to the sidewalk too.

Owner Kim Erasmy said the building was retrofitted. It may not have helped enough. Now, the building may be too unsafe for people to go in.

"Everything that was original has crumbled," Erasmy said. "Everything that makes it a historic building is gone."
