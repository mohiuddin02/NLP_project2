The Cuban crocodile was already considered to be one of the world's most endangered crocodiles. Now it is at even greater risk of disappearing than scientists had previously realized.

The problem is that the Cuban crocodile has been mating with its American cousin.

It seems the island's native species has been doing quite a bit of interbreeding with the more common American crocodile. Over time, its offspring are becoming less and less "Cuban."

## Gene Pool Is Not As Deep

Scientists consider the Cuban and the American crocodile to be separate species because each has its own set of genes. Genes can be thought of as instructions that are passed down from parent to child. They are unique. They shape how living things look and behave. In humans, for example, there is a gene for red hair. In Cuban crocodiles, there are genes that make them what they are. A species' complete set of genes is known as a genome.

As Cuban crocodiles mate with American crocodiles, the Cuban crocodile genome is becoming more mixed. In each baby, a portion of the Cuban crocodile genome is replaced by American crocodile genes. With each new generation, more and more Cuban genes are lost. Eventually, the species could disappear.

Scientists already knew the two species were mating with one another in the wild. However, they only recently discovered just how frequently this was happening.

## Wild Crocs Tell The Story

A team of researchers led by Yoamel Milián-García studied genes found in the scales of 227 wild crocodiles. They found that the level of interbreeding is much higher than previously believed: 49 percent of the wild crocodiles sampled had mixed genes.

The Cuban crocodile was once found throughout the island of Cuba. However, over-hunting starting in the mid-1800s caused its population to drop. Today there are only about 4,000 Cuban crocodiles left.

Now the Cuban crocodile is at risk of losing what makes it distinct. Its genome may become so "American" that it will not be a separate species anymore.

Scientists say the Cuban crocodile is special and worth protecting.

Milián-García is trying to determine what causes the interbreeding. He suspects that hunting and the disappearance of swamps and marshes is driving both species into the same areas. Once living side by side, the two types of crocodile are much more likely to interbreed.

## Captive Crocodiles Offer Hope

In addition to the wild crocodiles, Milián-García's team also studied 137 captive Cuban crocodiles. The animals live at the Zapata Swamp Captive Breeding Farm. Since 1974, Cuban crocodiles at the farm have been kept apart from American crocodiles. A study of their genes gave scientists some reason for hope.

Around 30 percent still had certain Cuban crocodile genes that were not found in other crocodiles. In the future, those animals could be used to help keep the Cuban crocodile from disappearing.
