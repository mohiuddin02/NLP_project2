A player was recently accused of cheating at an important chess tournament in Italy. He was kicked out.

His eyes gave him away.

The 37-year-old player was "batting his eyelids in the most unnatural way," referee Jean Coqueraut said. Coqueraut said he figured out that Arcangelo Ricciardi was blinking in a special code.

There were other reasons to be suspicious of Ricciardi. He kept his thumb tucked into his armpit. He refused to get up from his seat even after playing for hours. He also was quickly beating players ranked much higher than him.

## Tiny Video Camera For Good Luck?

Ricciardi was sent through a metal detector. It showed that he was wearing a necklace beneath his shirt. It contained a tiny video camera. The camera was connected to a small box underneath his armpit.

It is believed Ricciardi was using the video camera to send his games to a helper or a computer program. The helper or computer then sent signals for suggested moves to the armpit box. Ricciardi said that the necklace and box were just good-luck charms. Yoga and training had helped him to play better, he said.

Coqueraut said that he thinks Ricciardi was testing the cheating system for another player. The tournament's prize is only about $1,100. The prize amount is not enough to risk a career, he said.

## More Ways To Cheat Than We Can Count

The Guardian newspaper's Stephen Moss has written often about chess. He said there seems to be more and more cheating. Computers can beat even the best players. There are a million ways a cheater can use a computer.

One example came in April. The 25-year-old Georgian chess champion Gaioz Nigalidze was disqualified from the Dubai Open tournament. Officials had found an iPhone hidden in a bathroom stall. It had an open computer chess program on it. Nigalidze went to the bathroom after every move. It made his opponent suspicious.

Claude Shannon is a math expert. He said the number of possible ways for a chess game to play out is enormous. There are more possible mixes of moves in any chess game than there are stars that can be seen in the universe.

Even super-fast computers are outmatched. It would take a standard machine longer than the age of the universe just to look at all the possible things that could happen from its first move, Shannon said. The universe is billions of years old.

## "Easy To Cheat With A Phone"

Yet computers do have a better shot at winning than humans. In 1997, an IBM supercomputer named Deep Blue beat a world champion. Since then, computers have only gotten smarter. An iPhone can now do what Deep Blue did.

Experts believe the current best chess computer programs would be rated between 3200 and 3300 on the scale used to measure chess players. Magnus Carlsen is the world's top living chess player. He is rated 2862.

"It's incredibly easy to cheat with a phone,"said English chess grandmaster Nigel Short. He once was ranked third in the world. "My dog could win a major tournament using one of these devices. Or my grandmother. Anybody could do this."

Chess fans worry that nobody will bother to play if anyone with a phone can win. They believe the best way to keep the game competitive is to not allow iPhones and hidden cameras.

Tony Rich is a top U.S. chess official. He said it is hard to stop cheaters.

You cannot ask players to take their shoes off and be searched before every game, he said. "I doubt you'll find many people who'd want to come out to the chess tournament," he said.
