KHULNA, Bangladesh â€” Flooding is a frequent problem in Chandipur, a village in southwestern Bangladesh. When storms increase the water levels of surrounding rivers, salty water pours in. As a result, farmland throughout the village is ruined, and growing crops becomes harder.

The situation became particularly bad after Cyclone Aila hit in 2009. The storm sent salty water surging onto farmlands and it soaked into the soil. After 2009, vegetable crops in Chandipur produced small harvests. Some failed completely.

## Lots Of Plants In Little Space

For the past three years, however, hundreds of villagers have found a new way to grow crops. They have built "vertical gardens." Vertical gardens consist of a variety of containers in backyards and on rooftops, packed with soil and plants. Vertical gardens can produce a lot of vegetables while taking up very little space. Also, they are protected from the harmful effects of flooding. They let farmers continue to grow vegetables despite the damage done to farmland.

These gardens are built vertically. They are raised off the ground, protecting the soil and plants from floodwater. This means they can make it through a storm without the soil, and crops, being destroyed.

Shakuri Rani Debnath, who lives in Chandipur, says her vertical gardens produced more than 400 pounds of fruits and vegetables this summer. They included pumpkins, squash, cauliflower, tomatoes, spinach and chili peppers.

## Climate Change Cycle

Bangladesh is located at the delta of three of Asia's largest rivers, and most of the country is at or below sea level. The country also experiences extreme weather. When storms bring rain and rising tides, water floods onto the low, flat land.

The problem has only gotten worse with climate change. As the global temperature has increased, average sea levels have risen. Together, rising sea levels and violent storms have caused frequent and severe flooding in Bangladesh.

Flooding brings salty water onto dry land. Salt then soaks into the soil, making it difficult for crops to grow. The situation has been particularly bad in coastal areas of Bangladesh, which are right next to rivers.

## Disappearing Farmland

The loss of usable land is a pressing concern. Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries. There are about 156 million people in Bangladesh, roughly half the size of the U.S. population. Yet they live in an area about the size of Iowa. Growing enough food for all of those people is already a challenge. The loss of land due to flooding makes things even harder.

The hope is that vertical gardens can increase food supply in Bangladesh. They can let farmers grow crops in countries where space is limited and flooding does damage to the soil.

Vertical gardens were brought to villages like Chandipur by an organization called WorldFish. Working with local groups, WorldFish trained about 200 villagers in southwestern Bangladesh to make vertical gardens. The organization plans to expand the program to include 5,000 people over the next two years.

## Any Container Will Do

Growing the vertical gardens is easy. Villagers harvest soil around November. At that time of year, soil tends to be less salty because heavy rains from July to October wash salt away.

Villagers then put the soil into containers. They place containers on bricks to protect them from flooding. It keeps the soil safe until planting season.

Small holes are cut into the sides where short-rooted vegetables such as Indian spinach and tomatoes can grow. Long-rooted vegetables such as gourds grow on top.

Small containers, which cost around $1.30 to $2.00, can produce up to 17 1/2 pounds of vegetables in one season. Larger containers can produce more than 220 pounds of vegetables, at a cost of around $11.50 to $13.00. WorldFish provides seeds and some materials to villagers.

## Fresh Water Still A Challenge

Shobitha Debna, a 35-year-old mother in Chandipur, has a vertical garden. It takes up a small corner of her dirt yard. Nevertheless, each season it produces hundreds of pounds of pumpkins, gourds, green beans, eggplant, red amaranth, beets, carrots, cauliflower, coriander, cabbage, green chili peppers and spinach. Another garden on her roof is producing gourds.

Vertical gardens like Debna's produce a lot of extra food. This goes a long way for the rural poor in Bangladesh, who survive on a few dollars a day.

Debna says she used to grow just one or two kinds of vegetables. Now her vertical gardens grow a large variety. Finding enough fresh water for her new gardens is challenge. Still, she is able to grow crops with soil that, not long ago, was too salty to be of use.
