COMBINED LOCKS, Wis. — Glen Martin's pumpkins are gigantic. They are so large that they seem like pumpkins from another planet.

It's nearly Halloween so his pumpkins are on display in his front yard. Strangers drive by just to stare at them. They are amazed.

Martin's pumpkins weigh more than 1,700 pounds each.

Martin is president of Wisconsin Giant Pumpkin Growers. His group shares tips on growing the huge fruit. They also enter their giant pumpkins into contests every fall.

Growing healthy pumpkins comes naturally in Wisconsin, Martin said. The state has a long history of raising milk cows.

"It's in our blood here. That comes from our dairy farming background in Wisconsin," he said. "It's like taking care of a calf — you have to take care of it every day."

## It's All About The Pumpkin

Wisconsin Giant Pumpkin Growers started 20 years ago. It had just 14 members.

Martin said it started with "A bunch of guys standing around saying, 'I can grow a bigger pumpkin.'"

Now the group has 120 members. Everyone who joins gets a how-to booklet, a packet of seeds and a list of growers. The group organizes a free pumpkin-patch tour every July so people can see the giant pumpkins covering the ground.

"It's not a simple thing" to grow a giant pumpkin, says University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Irwin Goldman. He studies horticulture, or plant science, and he has tried growing them himself. Goldman's pumpkins grow to about 400 pounds.

Growing a giant pumpkin begins with a seed. If you want an enormous pumpkin, it's a good idea to get seeds from another giant pumpkin. Many growers trade or give away seeds.

## Get An Early Start

The growing season begins in April. The seeds are first planted in small pots. They grow indoors for two weeks before they are put into the ground.

Gardeners must plan ahead. The pumpkin vines need room to spread, and of course, the giant pumpkins themselves need space. Most pumpkin growers leave a space of about 25 feet by 35 feet for each one.

Once the pumpkin plant begins to grow, it grows fast. A pumpkin vine can grow 6 inches in one day. In one hour, a giant pumpkin can grow 2 pounds.

Pumpkin growers must pay close attention to their plants. Each flower on a vine may produce a pumpkin, so the growers remove all the flowers but one. This is to make sure all the plant's energy goes toward one giant pumpkin.

## Grow Them Big, Move Them Out

Chris Stevens of New Richmond, Wisconsin, is an expert pumpkin grower. He broke the world record in 2010 with a 1,810-pound pumpkin.

Still, Stevens' record was quickly broken. This year, a man from Switzerland set a new record with a 2,096-pound pumpkin.

Scientists from the University of Wisconsin wanted to find out why pumpkins kept getting bigger.

One reason is selection, they said. Choosing seeds from the biggest pumpkins led to even bigger pumpkins.

The environment is also important, they found. Wisconsin has many lakes and is very wet. It is a perfect place to grow pumpkins.

Moving the pumpkins to contests is not easy. Growers must use a tractor and a special harness to get the pumpkin onto a truck. At the competition, a pumpkin cannot be broken, have holes, or be rotted.

Bringing the biggest pumpkin can mean prize money and bragging rights. But the growers say that's not why they do it.

They love to see the looks on people's faces when they see a giant pumpkin for the first time. Eyes open wide. Mouths drop.

"People think it's just absolutely amazing," Stevens said.
