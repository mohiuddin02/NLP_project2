CHICAGO — For the past 10 months, geologist Erin Argyilan has been trying to solve the mystery of the holes that appear and vanish in the sands of Mount Baldy at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.

"We're seeing what appears to be a new geological phenomenon," she said.

She is one of many experts looking for clues on the origin of these potentially dangerous holes. She has studied sediment, analyzed wind patterns and mapped terrain.

The holes are about a foot in diameter and seem to survive for less than a day before filling in naturally with sand. Investigators have used radar and specialized GPS devices to look underground.

But no one knows why the holes form along the surface of this park, which attracts thousands of visitors each year.

The National Park Service announced this week that Mount Baldy will remain closed indefinitely due to the discovery of two new holes and a number of depressions on the north side slope. A depression in geology is when an area of land has sunk below the area around it.

The rest of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore will be open.

## Boy Swallowed By Hole Rescued

Argyilan is driven professionally and emotionally to try to explain what is happening. The geology professor had been conducting research at the base of Mount Baldy in mid-July when she heard the screams of parents some 400 feet away. They were frantically pointing at the ground that swallowed their 6-year-old son.

At first, she thought they were mistaken because there should be no holes in a dune. A dune is made up of grains of sand with no room for air.

Then rescue crews saved Nathan Woessner of Sterling, Ill., after a three-hour burial under 11 feet of sediment. That shattered the scientist's understanding of the terrain. It also hurt her emotionally.

"I cried for three days," said Argyilan, associate professor of geoscience at Indiana University Northwest. She was seven months' pregnant at the time and couldn't stop replaying in her mind the horror of the day. "I couldn't help in the moment. So now I have to do what I can to learn why this is happening."

## More Holes, Lots Of Theories

In August, a second hole was spotted nearby, this one about 10 inches wide and at least 5 feet deep. That prompted further study.

One theory is decaying trees beneath the sand might cause the holes to form.

Human activity on the dunes and along the shore has led to the erosion of Mount Baldy. The 126-foot dune has been shifting away from the lake shore at an alarming rate, covering the old landscape in sand, experts have said. They think cascades of sand drifting south are burying trees. The trees could be rotting and creating the holes beneath the surface.

Argilyan believes that holes are unlikely to start appearing at other sand dunes that have been kept in a more natural state.

"This particular dune has a complicated history," she said.

She said historical mining of the sand to make glass jars could have contributed to the erosion problem. So could the jetties on the harbor. She said she's looked at pictures of the landscape from 1938, and the changes are huge.

Most sand dunes are covered in vegetation. But not Mount Baldy. There, the trees and grass — and even an old staircase that once led to a viewing spot — are now buried, Argyilan said.

## Planting Grass Might Help

During the closure, the National Park Service will be planting new grass where the old grass once grew. The hope is that vegetation will hold the sand in place and perhaps prevent new holes from forming.

Argyilan added that the holes in Mount Baldy are distinct from the "sinkholes" that typically make headlines for consuming cars and homes. These are usually from rock surfaces that dissolve over time due to water damage.

National Park Service officials say they're preparing for a more thorough investigation of the dune this summer, including mapping of holes and using special ground-penetrating radar.

The government has used ground-penetrating radar to find abnormalities beneath the surface, but experts aren't certain what caused these patterns.

"We don't know exactly what's going on out there; we can't let folks out onto the area until we know it's safe," said Ken Mehne, who works as a law enforcement expert for the park.

He said rangers will be enforcing the closure, which will likely last through the summer and possibly into the fall. The rest of the national lakeshore will remain open, though officials request visitors stay on designated trails to prevent erosion and damage.

"There are 14.5 miles of other beach areas in the park," Mehne said. "There are plenty of other places open if folks want to come out to the park."
