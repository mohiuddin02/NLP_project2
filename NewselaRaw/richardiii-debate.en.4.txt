King Richard III of England died in battle more than 500 years ago. On Thursday, his bones will be re-buried. They will be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral.

For hundreds of years no one knew where the king was buried. Then in 2012 his bones were finally discovered. They were hidden under a parking lot in Leicester.

## Caught With No Horse

Richard III was killed in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth Field. His death was described by the great playwright William Shakespeare.

Shakespeare told the king's story in the play "Richard III." In one of the play's most famous scenes the king realizes he is in great danger. However, he has no horse to escape on. Full of fear, he cries out: "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse."

Richard did not manage to get away. Instead he was killed by the soldiers of his enemy, Henry Tudor.

His death was particularly cruel. His body was battered and pierced from his head to his waist.

On Thursday, Richard III will finally receive a burial fit for a king. However, many people will still think of him as a very bad ruler.

## Did He Kill His Nephews?

Richard III's brother ruled England before Richard. He was known as Edward IV. When Edward died, his 12-year-old son was supposed to be king. He was known as Edward V. However, Richard declared that the young boy was not the rightful king. Richard made himself king instead.

Both Edward V and his young brother were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Later, both boys disappeared.

Many believe that Richard III murdered his two young nephews. They say he did it to make sure neither brother could ever become king.

## Just Another Warlord?

Richard III does have his defenders, though. They say there is no real proof that he killed the two princes. They argue that Edward V was too young to rule England. They also claim that Richard introduced good new laws during his time as king.

Phil Stone heads the Richard III Society. His group is trying to change people's minds about Richard. They say the many good things Richard III did have been forgotten.

No one really knows for sure if Richard III murdered his nephews. However, he was most likely a hard and cruel man anyhow. Most men who ruled in his time were. He was just another warlord in an age of warlords.

Richard III was probably not the sort of ruler we would admire today. Even a grand reburial will not change that.
