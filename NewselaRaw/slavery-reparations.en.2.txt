UNITED NATIONS —  Caribbean countries face plenty of problems, including rising unemployment, high crime and a health crisis.

But almost every Caribbean leader who spoke at the United Nation last week brought up one issue: paying descendants of enslaved and oppressed Africans in Europe's former colonies for the damage of slavery. The payments are called reparations.

The lasting effects of slavery and colonialism have severely damaged the ability of the countries to improve their economies, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer said. "Reparations must be directed toward repairing the damage inflicted by slavery and racism."

For decades, cultural leaders, black scholars and others across the United States, Caribbean and Africa have unsuccessfully sought reparations from Britain, France and the Netherlands. They want the European countries to pay for sponsoring and endorsing kidnapping, enslaving and selling Africans. But their efforts always lacked support from a majority of citizens, and political leaders — until now.

## Caribbean Community Coalesces

In recent weeks, the movement for reparations has been gaining steam, occupying the attention of leaders of the 15-member Caribbean Community regional bloc. Those leaders have unanimously agreed to make a case for the former colonial powers to pay up. They have met with a British law firm and called for apologies. There is even talk of going to the International Court of Justice, the United Nations' main legal arm, should efforts to bring their former colonizers to the negotiating table fail.

The leaders say their focus is money for development programs.

"It has to go beyond an apology," Spencer said in an interview.

Ralph Gonsalves is the prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. He is helping to lead the movement.

"It's a historic wrong that has to be righted," Gonsalves said. "Look, the Germans paid the Jews." He also noted payments to Japanese people in the United States who were forced into camps during World War II. The Maori people received reparations from New Zealand, too.

A regional reparations commission was launched at a conference Gonsalves hosted. Hilary Beckles, a leading historian on the issue of slavery and reparations, was selected as its chairman.

Beckles recently published a book in which he argues that Britain built its economic empire on the back of slave labor. The effects of slavery continue to play out in the continued problems Caribbean countries have with improving their economies, he wrote.

## Leaders Pressing For Action

"It's not a confrontation, it's a conversation" that the Caribbean nations are seeking for the 400-year-old problem, Gonsalves said. "It's not a protest. It's an engagement."

It is unclear whether other nations will join the Caribbean's call. On Monday, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and newly elected President of the General Assembly John William Ashe joined global leaders for the unveiling of the winning design of a permanent memorial at U.N. headquarters to honor the victims of slavery.

Gonsalves and other leaders say they welcome the memorial and the U.N.'s efforts. But more action is needed to address the "native genocide and African slavery."

"I saw the president of South Africa, the president of Ghana, the prime minister of Ethiopia, and they are all on board," Gonsalves said. "We're going to build the links. We have to build it inside of Europe, too, with ordinary Europeans."

But if Europeans are willing to listen, their governments may not be.

French President François Hollande has continued to resist demands on his nation to pay reparations for its role in Haiti's independence and the slave trade. He refused, just like Jacques Chirac. He was the French president who, on the eve of Haiti's Jan. 1, 2004, bicentennial, quickly rejected a demand by Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide that France repay Haiti for the amount it was forced to pay for its freedom in 1804.

Aristide had sent Paris a bill for the amount, down to the last penny, of $21,685,135,571.48.

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's may have said in 2007 that slavery was "a crime against humanity." But Britain still hasn't apologized, activists say.

## A Tough Uphill Struggle

Blacks in America have had no more success than their counterparts. Attempts to have the courts force the U.S. to pay reparations have gone nowhere. The same goes for their efforts to cash in on the 40 acres and a mule promised to former slaves after the Civil War ended in 1865.

Still, Heather Russell, a professor of Caribbean and African-American literature, says she is "cautiously hopeful" about the Caribbean Community's latest efforts.

"You have 15 heads of government who have signed on for this proposition," said Russell, a Jamaica native. "You have to make the moral stakes really high and so you do that through raising awareness. This issue has never been squarely put on the table."

Verene Shepherd is a historian and who has fought a long time for reparations. She said people are more aware about the impact of slavery today.

"The cause is just. And whatever the outcomes is going to be, we are going to press on," she added. "Remember, slavery lasted 300 to 400 years. In the scheme of things, we have not been fighting a long time."
