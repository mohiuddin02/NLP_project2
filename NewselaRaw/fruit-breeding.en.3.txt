LOS ANGELES — Imagine a grape that tastes just like cotton candy.

In rural California, David Cain has come up with just that. It's a grape that could win the stomachs and wallets of a nation of junk-food lovers.

Cain is a fruit breeder. His job is to combine characteristics of thousands of grapes. He and other breeders come up with varieties that can be registered with the government, or patented.

They have developed varieties with enough sugar that they may as well be Skittles on the vine. That's no accident.

"We're competing against candy bars and cookies," said Cain, 62. He is a former government scientist. Now he heads research at a company called International Fruit Genetics in Bakersfield, Calif.
## "Looking For More Flavor"

Cain's latest invention is called the Cotton Candy grape. Its taste is like eating a puffy, pink ball of spun sugar.

The marketplace for fruit is very competitive. So farmers make money by coming up with new types of fruit that they can put a name on.  Producers are constantly tinkering. They hope to come up with the next Cuties Clementine orange or Honeycrisp apple. Those products stand out in the crowded fruit aisle.

"People are looking for more flavor," said Mark Carroll at Gelson's Markets. The store will carry the Cotton Candy grape. "Once they get hooked, they want more no matter what."

Cain's company is in the heart of California's $1.1 billion table grape industry. It specializes in bold flavors and unusual shapes. Purple Funny Fingers are long and thin like chili peppers. A variety named Sweet Sapphire comes as round and fat as D batteries. Like the Cotton Candy, the special varieties are patented. Farmers then pay to grow them.

Ordinary grapes can cost as little as 88 cents per pound. The Cotton Candy could fetch around $6 a pound. Prices would come down if enough farmers grow the grape.
## Fruit With Strange Names

The U.S. designer-fruit craze kicked into high gear in the late 1980s.  The cause was the pluot. It is a fruit that is part plum and part apricot. The crispy stone fruit took 20 years to develop. It was such a hit that more farmers started spending money on  breeding.

California is now putting out other sweet inventions. Those include apriums (a pluot but with more apricot in it), peacharines (peach and nectarine) and cherums (cherry and plum).

Cross-breeding methods employed by fruit breeders are centuries old. It involves a lot of waiting. Then replanting. Then repeating the process — for many years.

"It's a bit like fishing. You never know when you're going to get the big one," said Cain.

Nutritionists don't seem all that bothered about the extra sugar in some of the grapes.

You would have to eat about 100 grapes to get the same amount of calories as in a candy bar, said David Heber of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition.

Cain moved from the government to private business in 1987. U.S. grape consumption was exploding at the time, thanks to new seedless grapes developed in California.
## Concord Finds A Princess

Cain helped start International Fruit Genetics in 2001. A few months later, he tasted the grape that has obsessed him ever since.

Researchers from the University of Arkansas were showing off a purple Concord grape that didn't look like much. The flesh was mushy and speckled with tiny seeds. The skin slipped off easily after biting, a no-no in the grape business. But the cotton candy flavor transported Cain to a carnival or county fair.

International Fruit Genetics signed a licensing agreement with the University of Arkansas. By 2003, Cain was breeding their grapes with a dozen California varieties on his test field.

Eventually, he married the Concord to a green grape called Princess, a variety developed by the USDA. The Cotton Candy was patented in 2010. A Bakersfield grower is set to harvest the first large crop in August.

Cain doesn't like to fuss over such things, but the Cotton Candy has him excited. He thinks its signature flavor has a chance to hook shoppers like nothing before.

"It's going to be introduced slowly," Cain said. "Whether it will be a niche grape or start a revolution is hard to say. What we're hoping is it will do for grapes what all these new varieties have done for fruit like apples."
