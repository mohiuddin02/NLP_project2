CHICAGO â€” Robert McDaniel was puzzled when the Chicago police commander dropped by his West Side home unannounced last month. Commander Barbara West was polite, but her message was clear: Don't commit any more crimes or face the consequences.

West told the 22-year-old that she knew his best friend had been slain last year in Austin, their crime-plagued South Chicago community. She cautioned that he could meet the same fate if he didn't change his ways.

McDaniel has only a minor arrest record, so he was surprised to learn he was on the police department's so-called "heat list." This list identifies people whom the department considers the most likely to be involved in violence.

McDaniel had been arrested for minor offenses like smoking marijuana and gambling, which are common activities where he grew up. "I haven't done nothing that the next kid growing up hadn't done," he said, disbelievingly.

## Ranking Risks Of Violence

Chicago police are trying to figure out who is most at risk of shooting someone or being shot themselves. To do that, they enter arrest records and other information into a computer system. Then, they use a set of mathematical formulas to come up with rankings.

Police officials said their list contained the names of 420 people from around the city. To produce the list they had weighed the answers to a series of questions, such as: How many times had a person been arrested? Are they on parole, or do they have outstanding warrants for their arrest? Have they been arrested on drug charges, or for carrying weapons? What kind of criminal records do their associates have, and have any of those associates been shot in the past?

Those with the highest ranking on the heat list stand out dramatically. They are over 500 times more likely to be involved in violence, according to the police.

People on the list are warned that further criminal activity, however minor, will result in severe punishment. But police don't just issue a threat: They also offer help obtaining social services or a job.

McDaniel most likely made the heat list because of a childhood friend with whom he had once been arrested on a marijuana charge. That friend was fatally shot last year in Austin.

Interviewed at his Austin home, McDaniel said he was offended at being singled out by West, who is commander of the Austin police district. "I have no background, so why watch me?" said McDaniel. "And if you're watching me, then you can obviously see I'm not doing anything."

## One On The List Was Killed

But the list proved prophetic in the case of Jacobi Herring. This month, the 21-year-old was fatally shot in his South Chicago neighborhood. He had just left a late-night party a few blocks from his home when he was gunned down.

His uncle, Koland Herring, was not surprised to learn that his nephew was on the heat list. Jacobi, he said, had given in to neighborhood peer pressure.

"He wasn't a hard-core gangbanger," Herring, 49, said outside his nephew's home as friends and relatives stopped by to pay their respects. "He was never a shooter. Some of the people that he knew did. They're hard-core. And in order to get around and to be accepted out here, you have to be around them."

Cook County court records show Herring was arrested only a handful of times, mostly on suspicion of trespassing and for loitering with known gang members. However, four others who were once arrested with Herring also made the list. In addition, another man who was once arrested with Herring was shot and killed in March in broad daylight. And Herring himself was shot in 2008.

"We talked about him getting shot all the time," said Herring's father, Floyd Redmond, 41. "I used to see my son hanging out, and I used to ride down on him. I feared for my son being out on these streets because I know what these streets are all about, man."

## Police Defend List

Another Austin resident who made the heat list is Terry McCoy, 20, who's currently in the Cook County Jail awaiting trial for a 2011 armed robbery. McCoy's legal guardian, Yvonne Carroll, wasn't surprised to hear McCoy was singled out, but she questioned the value of the list.

"They stereotype a lot of the blacks anyway," said Carroll, who is African-American. "The black community is not the only community that has violence. They have it in other neighborhoods, but they don't stereotype it like they do in the black community."

But police officials defended the list, noting that the names aren't chosen randomly.

As for McDaniel, in spite of his misgivings over being named to the list, he's considering taking up the offer of social services. A high school dropout, he has a 2-year-old daughter to take care of and another child on the way.

But he insisted he doesn't belong on the department's radar.

"As far as them trying to make me a product of their work," he said, "I don't too much appreciate that."
