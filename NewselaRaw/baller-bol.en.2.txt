The 14-year-old looks very different than the other students. That's because Bol is already 6 feet 10 inches tall. He is already taller than the vast majority of American adults and even most professional basketball players.

Bol is tall enough to be a professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). For now, he plays on the junior varsity team at his school.

Bol goes to Bishop Miege High School in Kansas. One day he complained that his school uniform did not fit. He is so tall that the sleeves of his shirt only went past his armpits. The bottom of his shirt did not even reach his belt. He had to order extra long pants made just for his body. They cost nearly $100.

## Dad Was Even Taller

Bol's father was a famous basketball player named Manute Bol. Manute was almost 7 feet 7 inches tall. He played 10 seasons in the NBA as a professional athlete. That's who Bol gets his tall body from. Manute was also famous for giving his time and money to help people in Sudan, the country in Africa where he was born. He spent all the money he made playing basketball to build schools and hospitals there. Manute died in 2010 from an illness he caught while helping people in Sudan.

Bol is similar to his father in many ways, besides being tall and thin. They have the same cheek bones, brown eyes and long hands. Bol's mother and Manute's former wife, Ajok Kuag, said the men even act the same.

"I know he's my son, but he has nothing from me," Kuag said. "He's all Manute."

## Shooting Baskets With Dad

Manute still plays a big role in Bol's life. He was the one who taught Bol about basketball. Bol and Manute used to visit the gym together. Strangers would stare at the very tall men as they took shots on the court. Bol did not like the sport right away. Through his father and older brothers, he learned to enjoy playing.

Bol is very good for a 14-year-old player. He even looks like his dad when he plays.

"The sky is the limit," says L.J. Goolsby, one of Bol's old coaches. "He's got natural abilities a lot of kids his age don't have."

## Still Lots Of Work To Do

The coaches at Miege, Bol's high school, are helping train him to become a better player and young adult. At school, they remind him to tuck in his shirt or take off the sweatshirt that isn't part of the school uniform. In practice, they remind him to focus on different skills, like getting closer to the basket, keeping up his hands, and his concentration through the game.

"He likes to shoot around and play basketball," Rick Zych, the boys basketball coach at Miege said. "But does he like to play competitive basketball? That's what we've got to figure out."

If Bol wants to become as good as his dad, he still has a lot of work to do. He spends time practicing and learning to play smart so he can become a better player on the court.

"I'm trying to go to the NBA," he said. "To help my family."

Bol smiles. "Like my dad."
