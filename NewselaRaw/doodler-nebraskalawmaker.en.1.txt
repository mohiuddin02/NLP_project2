Being a lawmaker can be a demanding job, depending on how you look at it. But one politician in Nebraska has managed to become a well-known sketch artist while simultaneously serving as a state senator. The state's longest-serving lawmaker, Senator Ernie Chambers, is famous for his artistic talents. In his office, he dropped to one knee and spread more than five dozen sheets of notepaper across the floor.

Senator Chambers pointed to pencil sketches of a man, a pig and a hairy cyclops while behind him sat a box of framed portraits. During his 40-year legislative career, Chambers has been quietly honing the drawing skills he first learned as a child.

When he's not attending drawn-out committee hearings or debating political issues, Chambers has been compiling a portfolio of sketches. He draws a little bit of everything. His subjects vary widely, from Malcolm X to Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts to President John F. Kennedy.

"It's therapeutic," said Chambers, 77. "I watch the pencil and things just flow out of it — words that rhyme and pictures that shade themselves. Sometimes, I'm not even concentrating on making a picture. I'm just putting lines on a sheet of paper."

## Beneath A Cyclops

This talent hasn't gone unnoticed. His colleagues ask for copies for of his sketches.

Chambers was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and served 38 years as a state politician. He took a short break and was elected back into office. He has a reputation for being the "Defender of the Downtrodden" and stands up for people and issues that other people may ignore. He supports many liberal causes. Chambers has repeatedly tried to end the death penalty and tries to prevent laws he does not agree with. Chambers also stands out for dressing differently than other lawmakers. While most politicians wear suits and ties, Chambers shows up to work in sweatshirts and jeans.

Chambers said he doodles during work meetings and hearings to pass the time, especially when familiar issues arise and the days get long and boring. In the first 45 days of this year's session, he scrawled more than 60 images on notepad-size sheets of paper.

The captions he writes to accompany the drawings are often hard to understand. Beneath his cyclops, Chambers wrote: "Man, oh, man. I can't wait for evolution to kick in! Things can only get better!!!"

## Depth Of The Art

Chambers sometimes lets himself be inspired by the daily happenings in committee meetings or the Legislature's floor. Recently, when an Omaha attorney spoke during a hearing related to the Keystone XL pipeline, Chambers was sketching the man's portrait. As the attorney argued for tougher regulations on oil pipelines — a bill Chambers pushed for — his pen gave shape to a slender face, suit and glasses.

Chambers tends to draw in hearings when the side he favors is testifying, said Senator Adam Morfeld of Lincoln, who serves with him on a committee. When people he opposes or doesn't agree with speak, Chambers puts down the pencil and instead throws questions at them.

Morfeld said he was amazed by the quality of art, which Chambers sometimes combines with poetry and distributes to lawmakers. "I've thought about asking him for one or two," Morfeld said. "I call them Ernie-grams."

Senator Bob Krist of Omaha noticed Chambers pencil-sketching a human eye earlier this year. Krist was struck by the depth of the art. He asked Chambers for a copy to share with his wife, who is an oil painter.

"He's a great multitasker," Krist said. "He sits there and draws, but he's always listening to every word of the arguments."

## "That's What It Is"

Chambers started drawing in art classes in high school and continued through law school. A law professor noticed his work on a piece of poster board and suggested Chambers consider a career as an artist. "In my mind, he was telling me anything he could to get me out of his school," Chambers said.

Chambers' collection is diverse. It features portraits of President Kennedy and his wife, and a smiling young mother with her infant son. His 2001 drawing of Elvis Presley was so detailed that a Capitol staffer framed it and hung it in her office. Other sketches are more political or make a statement about society, such as Joe Camel with skull and a pack of cigarettes.

Despite the praise he receives for his talents, Chambers insists he's not an artist but a "drawer," because he lacks formal training.

"What I do is like Burger King: Have it your way," he said. "If some people see it as good art, that's what it is. If people see it as bad art, that's what it is."
