CARACAS, Venezuela â€” Many people in Venezuela are angry about school books. They complain the math and language lessons include sentences that say how great the government is.

Math problems add up food bought at stores run by the government. English classes practice saying where Hugo Chavez was born. He was the president until he died in 2013.

People in Venezuela are divided about how well the government is running the country. Some people support the government. Others are against it. Now, textbooks are causing more trouble.

Parents have even burned books on the street outside some schools.

## The Country Changed

Chavez became president of Venezuela in 1998. He was against the United States and turned Venezuela into a socialist country. That means the government owns many of the businesses. It sets prices for many things, even food. People cannot buy and sell on their own as much. When Chavez was president, his government took over many businesses.

Chavez was accused of shutting down newspapers that said things against him, and of attacking his enemies. He won the election in 2012 by a few votes. He died from cancer soon after. His vice president took over and has kept most of his plans.

Children are back in school now after their winter break. But many Venezuelans are still angry about their school books and how the books talk about Chavez.

## Making The Books Better

They are brainwashing children, said Hector Cuevas. He has a son in the sixth grade. The books change the country's history to how the government wants people to see it, he said.

He said the books always use exercises like adding up how much grocery shopping someone does. But in Venezuela it can be hard to get some foods. A real book would add up all the hours you stood in line just to get things like sugar, he said.

Cuevas uses an old math textbook to help his son. He dreams about textbooks that show the real Venezuela.

Defenders say the books show real life in the country. They include history that had been left out before, they say.

The minister of education defended the books. He said they are not perfect, but people who do not like them should help make them better.

The minister said the people should point out the mistakes. That way, the government can correct them.

## Many People Have Found Mistakes

The people who do not like the books say mistakes are not their biggest problem. It is the hype for the government that is the problem.

A social studies book shows a picture of an old person writing, "Thanks, Chavez." It asks students to explain why. A math lesson praises a government food program.

All children get the books. But schools in poor areas use them more often. They are the only choice for teachers in some schools.

One of those schools is Consuelo Navas Tovar in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. It is a high school near a very poor area called a slum.

There, students in navy-blue uniforms are crammed into dirty desks. They sit in a classroom with bare walls, studying their English textbooks. The teachers do not have other books for the students.

Tomas Guardia is a math professor. He has spent months finding mistakes in math books. One book says a square is a shape with four sides. But that could be a rectangle, too.
