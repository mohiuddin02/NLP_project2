BEIJING â€” Nearly every day in China, women go to work in smoke-filled offices. Most of the time, though, they are not the ones smoking. The fumes they are exposed to mainly come from cigarettes smoked by men. After work is over, many go home to breathe in secondhand smoke created by husbands or other family members.

China is so addicted to smoking that the country is known as the Smoking Dragon. However, that addiction to tobacco is not shared equally by both sexes. According to the most recent national survey, 288 million men smoked regularly in China in 2010, compared with just 13 million women.

## An Important Step

Now the women are striking back. Last fall, China's State Council proposed the nation's toughest restrictions yet on indoor smoking and the advertising of tobacco. The announcement was a major victory for China's tobacco-control movement, which includes several women who have been on the front lines for many years.

"This is a very important step," said Yang Gonghuan, a doctor who has been documenting tobacco's toll on Chinese health since the 1980s. "It is very difficult to push for these kinds of changes on a national level," she said. "It has taken many, many years."

China is known for its smog and other environment problems. However, no public health issue poses more of a threat than tobacco. An estimated 1 million Chinese die each year from lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases.

China's anti-smoking movement includes many prominent men. For example, ex-NBA player Yao Ming has lent his name to the cause.

## Dangers Of Secondhand Smoke

Yet it is women who are leading the charge, both in government and in anti-smoking groups. China's female health commissioner, Li Bin, has been outspoken in seeking a national indoor-smoking ban. Li is on the State Council, a top-level panel that came up with the restrictions released in November.

The battle against smoking is far from won, however. Although smoking rates have declined in recent years, more than half of Chinese men smoke regularly. Some 700 million Chinese are routinely exposed to secondhand smoke, which kills about 100,000 people there every year.

It is not entirely clear why so many women are leading China's tobacco-control movement, but those smoke-filled rooms might be a factor. Secondhand smoke is a big issue for women, many of whom have become aware of the danger it poses for children.

## A Very Powerful Industry

The Chinese have smoked tobacco for centuries, and up until the early 1900s women regularly could be seen with men puffing on pipes. Things changed with the arrival of cigarettes, however, as cigarette-smoking soon came to be seen as not ladylike.

As a result of the new social attitudes, many women quit smoking. At the same time, male Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping smoked openly in public. Their highly visible smoking encouraged the habit among men.

Today, Chinese people are the world's biggest buyers of tobacco. China is also the largest manufacturer, producing more than 2.3 trillion cigarettes yearly, nearly half the world's total. Unlike in the United States, cigarettes are not made and sold by private companies. Instead, the government controls nearly all the cigarette brands sold through the China National Tobacco Corporation.

The Chinese government is in an unusual dual role. One arm of the government, the Health Ministry, tries to limit tobacco use and warn of its dangers. At the same time, the government benefits from tobacco. Tobacco sales and taxes on tobacco raised $120 billion for the government in 2012.

"This is why tobacco control in China happens so slowly," Yang said. "The tobacco industry is very powerful."

## New Warning Labels

Smoking has remained common in public places across the country, particularly in the countryside, where half of the population lives. Large numbers of doctors in China smoke. It was not until 2010 that the Health Ministry banned smoking in its own building.

In recent years, attitudes toward smoking have started to shift. Top Chinese leaders are either nonsmokers or are careful not to be spotted lighting up. Late in 2013, the government banned officials from smoking in public. Individual cities have made their own restrictions on tobacco.

If the new rules go into effect, the treatment of smoking will change dramatically. The proposed rules would ban indoor smoking. They would also limit advertising of tobacco in China and require larger warning labels on cigarette packs.

## Try And Stop Us!

Xu Guihua, of the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control, said enforcement of the rules would be very important, and would require a big shift in Chinese attitudes. Average citizens will need to get involved, since police cannot be everywhere.

"In the past several hundred years, people have cultivated the habit of smoking wherever they want," she said. "Changing this will take some time."

Even so, Xu is hopeful that change will indeed come. For one thing, China's new president, Xi Jinping, sees reducing smoking as an important issue. In part, he and others in the government are concerned with the rising cost of treating those with smoking-related illnesses.

Xi's position is thought to be influenced by his wife, Peng Liyuan. She was once a popular singer and has been a vocal anti-smoking campaigner.
