FORTH WORTH, Texas â€” North Texas school districts continued their assault on the Ebola virus Friday. Workers disinfected campuses and educators kept tabs on absences.

They also had to try to fight rumors.

Two weeks ago, Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person in the United States to be diagnosed with Ebola. Duncan infected two nurses caring for him before he died in Dallas on Oct. 8.

Since Duncan was found to have the disease, fears about the deadly virus have spread into schools in the Dallas area.

Some of the concerns are warranted; others are largely false.

## Many Children Kept Home

Attendance at Lake Pointe Elementary in the Eagle-Mountain Saginaw school district dropped significantly after parents were notified Wednesday night that a student had been placed in voluntary isolation. The student's father is a Marine stationed at Naval Air Station Fort Worth. He was on a Frontier Airlines flight with infected health care worker Amber Joy Vinson.

"It is the first time it really got real for our community, because it brought Ebola from Dallas right into our school community," said Kristin Courtney, spokeswoman for the school district. "And our community needed some time to process the information."

Absenteeism at Lake Pointe Elementary soared to 40 percent on Thursday, Courtney said. Twenty-eight percent of the students were absent again on Friday. Normally, Courtney said, about 4 percent of the students in the district are absent on any given day.

The school district did not close any campuses, but did extra cleanings Wednesday night and again Thursday morning. The school district already does regular cleanings that use hospital-grade disinfectants, Courtney said.

## "I Just Got Real Nervous"

Roland Kennedy, the father of a 7-year-old at the elementary school, said it was difficult to send his son to school. Lake Pointe's communication with parents and cleaning efforts played a role in his decision.

"It reassured me that that it is OK, that he can go back to school," Kennedy said. "And if he did come into contact with that student, the damage is done. I hope they do keep us informed, keep up with the phone calls and notices, because communication is key in this."

Chelsea Salas, the mother of a first-grader, said she and her husband made the decision to send their daughter to school.

"I just got real nervous. I couldn't sleep. I kept worrying about if we should keep her home," Salas said.

The district is developing a specialized education plan for the isolated student, Courtney said. The student will use technology and interactive programs to complete schoolwork and not fall behind.

## Judge Defends Health Care Workers

Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins on Friday urged North Texans not to overreact to the threat of Ebola. He said this was especially necessary in the case of schoolchildren.

He said some workers at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas were being treated unfairly. They told him that their children were being advised to stay away from day care facilities.

"These hometown heroes are in a difficult situation, dealing with their children being discriminated against in day care and school," Jenkins said. "It's not representative of North Texas and American values."

He said, "Anyone doing it should apologize to those families and show their children love and laughter."

Jenkins defended those who have been on the front line in the fight against Ebola. He has been working to educate the public about the virus from the beginning.

Workers who do not have symptoms have "zero" chance of spreading Ebola, Jenkins said.

## Cleaning Classrooms And Buildings

In the Highland Park school district in Dallas, Superintendent Dawson Orr posted a message Friday on its website. He explained that all campuses would be cleaned over the weekend and that the custodial staff will step up cleaning during the school day.

The district also said its nursing staff has been trained to spot symptoms of Ebola. It also listed what steps would be taken if a case of Ebola is suspected.

And in a proactive approach, the district has a section on its website called "Help with rumor control." There it addresses rumors. An example is questions about an elementary school student and his mother being on the same Frontier Airlines flight with Vinson.

The Fort Worth school district is also trying to answer rumors, said Clint Bond, its director of communication. The district had not even had any reported exposure to Ebola.

To be safe, Bond said, they have reinforced rules for their school nurses on how to deal with diseases that can spread quickly.

The district has also put up information on the website. In a release called "Know the Plan," the district outlines their questioning method for possible exposures.
