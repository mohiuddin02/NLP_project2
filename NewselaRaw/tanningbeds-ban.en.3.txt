WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. government does not want anyone under the age of 18 to use tanning beds. These devices make people's skin tanner or darker. Some people think tanned skin makes them look better, but it can also be dangerous. Tanning beds can cause skin cancer. This is a very serious disease that can be deadly.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the government agency responsible for protecting the public's health. It is asking for the new rules to ban tanning beds for young people. The FDA also wants adults who use tanning beds to sign a form. The form would talk about the dangers of tanning beds. When people sign the form, they would be agreeing that they understand the dangers.

##  Skin Doctors Worried

For years, dermatologists and health groups have wanted stronger restrictions on indoor tanning. Dermatologists are skin doctors. They want people to know that more teenagers and people in their 20s are getting skin cancer. Women get skin cancer more often than men.

The American Academy of Dermatology is a group made up of skin doctors. One of the doctors compared indoor tanning to cigarettes. Both of these things can cause cancer. The group says it is happy that the FDA wants to limit tanning beds. 

Twenty three states already have laws saying people under the age of 18 cannot use tanning beds. The FDA wants all 50 states to have this law.

## Tanning Salons Want Parents To Decide

Last year the FDA required tanning beds and sun lamps to carry new warnings. These warnings say the beds should not be used by anyone under age 18. The FDA has regulated, or controlled, tanning machines for over 30 years. Until now, it had taken little action to limit their use. 

The Indoor Tanning Association is a group that represents makers of tanning beds and related products. It said decisions about tanning should be left to parents, not the government. Some people think it is none of the government's business.

This year, doctors are expected to tell thousands of people they have melanoma. This is the deadliest form of skin cancer.  The American Cancer Society is a group that is dedicated to eliminating cancer. It says the disease is expected to cause nearly 10,000 deaths. 

## Worried About Skin Cancer

Most cases of melanoma are discovered in people in their 40s and 50s. However, experts believe the disease is caused by being in the sun at a young age. It can also be caused by using tanning beds at a young age.

Using a tanning bed is like being in the sun but it is even more dangerous. Tanning beds deliver more ultraviolet radiation than the sun. This type of radiation causes many skin cancers. 

More than one million U.S. teenagers tan indoors each year. The FDA says thousands of businesses offer tanning beds. You can find them in tanning salons, gyms and spas. 

## Hearing From The Public

The FDA also wants the makers of tanning equipment to make changes to their machines. These changes would include warnings that are easier to read and emergency shut-off switches. 

The FDA will spend 90 days hearing what the public thinks of its plan. There is no deadline for putting the plan in place.
