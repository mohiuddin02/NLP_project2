Jellyfish may not look like the most athletic of swimmers, but they're remarkably efficient in the water. Aspects of their body design could work well in the air too. A team from New York University has designed a flying jellyfish-like robot that uses four flapping wings to keep itself aloft.

The unconventional robot was recently described at the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in Pittsburgh, Pa. There, scientists discussed how the jellyfish robot could lead the way for flying mini-robots to be used in search-and-rescue and military operations. The robot might even work as a sensor to detect environmental conditions.

"I wanted to think of something very different," said Leif Ristroph, a mathematician at New York University. "So I actually tried about five or 10 different schemes, all of which failed except this one." And that was the jellyfish.

## Small, Simple And Still Stable

Engineers are trying to build all sorts of robots based on the wing motions of such animals as birds, bats, hummingbirds and butterflies. Those working on the smallest robots tend to rely more on insect-like designs. That's because bugs have already mastered the mechanics of flight on a tiny scale.

The vast majority of flying animals and insects rely on the same flying technique, with the same weaknesses: wings that sweep back and forth in a sort of S-shape. Only a few creatures, including dragonflies, move their wings in the simple up-down motion that many people expect.

Designs modeled after animals and bugs with wings are "a great place to start in terms of building a flying machine," said Ristroph. "But there are some technical problems with it."

One problem is wind. Bugs with flapping wings have to spend a lot of time dealing with a violent environment, sensing every gust of wind and then adjusting accordingly. It takes a lot of work, and it's unstable.

Researchers wanted to build something that can be small, simple and still remain stable in the air without too much thinking.

The jellyfish, in some ways, appears ideal for this task since they are very simple creatures. They not only don't have brains, but they are mostly made up of water with a small amount of a thick jelly-like substance. Jellyfish are also invertebrates, which means they don't have a backbone. They also don't have bones and the complex joints that come with them.

Their bodies resemble an umbrella or a bell-shaped figure with tentacles dangling down. A large mouth, where food comes in and waste goes out, is located at the bottom of the bell shaped figure.

## "Bio-Inspired Engineering"

The jellyfish's simple body structure has its advantages when it comes to building flying robots on both a large and small scale, because they vary so much in nature. Lion's Mane jellyfish can exceed 7 feet in diameter. The Irukandji jellyfish, on the other hand, can be less than an inch wide.

The scientists' flapping-wing robot is three inches wide and weighs less than one ounce. With four wings like flour petals that flap up and down, it moves more like a moth than jellyfish, who move with the ocean's current and by squeezing water in and out of their bells.

So far the robotic flying jelly still has to be attached to a power source and can't yet be steered, but that doesn't mean they don't work. Just the opposite. The first round of robot jellyfish models show that such a design can indeed work, perhaps for more sophisticated flying machines and on much smaller scales.

The design could be useful for the military, Ristroph said, though he was more excited about how everyday people can use the robot. Theoretically, he said, mini flying jellies could be tossed into the air from a building and float around as environmental sensors and record data and adjust their position when necessary.

"It's an excellent example of bio-inspired engineering," said Caltech University professor John Dabiri, who attended the Pittsburgh meeting and is an expert on how jellyfish swim.

"The final product doesn't copy the jellyfish body design, but it does achieve a similarly stable motion," Dabiri said. "Although it doesn't look like the jellyfish that inspired it, I'm sure they would be proud."
