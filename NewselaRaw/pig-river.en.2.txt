DONGHUI VILLAGE, China â€” The pig farmer was not in a good mood. The man with muck-splattered boots stood in front of barns that hold more than 500 pigs. He said he has been losing money as the price of pork falls and the costs of feed and other supplies climb.

When some of his pigs started dying early this year, there was little choice but to throw them out. Earlier, farmers in the area would have sold them to dealers who bought dead and even diseased pigs. They illegally resold them for consumers to eat. But late last year, the government began cracking down on the dealers.

"We had no place to put them. We can't sell them anymore. If we do we will be punished," said Wang, 43. "So there's nothing we could do but dump them secretly."

The results were nauseating. More than 14,000 pig corpses were found floating in the Huangpu River and its streams in March. The fleet of rotting flesh bobbed along in a major source of drinking water for Shanghai, home to more than 20 million people.

## The Two Sides Of China

Chinese President Xi Jinping has spoken about working toward a "Chinese Dream" and a great renewal of the country. But the pigs-in-the-river scandal is a reminder of the distance that lies between those dreams and the grimmer aspects of life in China.

Last week, a group of tall, slim models could be seen readying for a fashion show near Shanghai's Bund promenade on the banks of the Huangpu. In the pig farming communities along the network of murky waterways upriver from Shanghai, China's challenges that come with its fast growth were harder to ignore.

In Donghui, southwest of Shanghai in neighboring Zhejiang province, farmers spoke of their need for money and information. With money worries never far, locals say the decision to sell dead pigs to shady brokers was easy. They know it could mean dangerous meat making its way to the dinner table, but they take the risk anyway.

The roundup of illegal meat dealers was an effort to address China's many problems with food safety. But soon after, another problem formed. Farmers without many resources were left with a lot of dead pigs. Officials have since promised to expand both pickup and disposal services.

## Puzzled By Pigs

Like the other pig farmers standing around him in Donghui, Wang had no answer for what had killed his animals this year. Asked about the government's approach to the situation so far, one of the farmers spoke up.

"Those people sit in offices and they hear about the pigs in the river from lower levels ... so how can they learn what's really happening?" said Wu Qibin, 42.

The feelings were similar in Zhulin, a village about 65 miles from Shanghai. State media has identified Zhulin as a trouble spot for the pig deaths.

One farmer complained in an interview, "When there's disease we don't understand what's going on, and they (officials) don't tell us which vaccines to use."

## Risky Solutions

The man had pulled up on a black scooter in front of a small livestock dumping station next to a trash shed. The roadside station was an open-air space with a slanted roof. It was slapped together by the government only after the public outcry about the floating pigs.

Once the pigs began showing up in the Huangpu River, the public started to question the official explanations. China's chief government veterinarian said last month the deaths were caused by common disease and bad weather.

He also said that "water in the Huangpu River, where a great number of dead pigs were found, meets national standards for drinking water," according to an article in the state Xinhua newswire.

One online user of the popular Sina Weibo micro-blog service echoed the comments of many others. "I suggest the leaders fill a bowl with that water, and finish it."

## Looking For Blame

State media showed a TV report in late March that tried to pass blame. It featured an interview with a former dead-pig trader from Zhulin named Pan Huimin. Wearing handcuffs and a yellow vest, Pan said that all of the dead pigs showing up were "100 percent" linked to the squeeze on him and his colleagues.

But it was not clear how Pan could answer with such certainty. He had been in detention before the floating pigs came to light. The backdrop of the conversation was a bare courtyard, from which the camera at one point turned to a guard tower and high walls.

In Zhulin, Pan's relatives had an explanation for why he had gotten mixed up in that line of work. His wife, Hang Yaqin, hiked up her T-shirt, unwrapped a strap of gauze and pointed to a tube. She explained she had received a kidney transplant in December 2010.

Speaking in a low tone as she slouched back on a folding chair, Hang said the new organ did not make her as healthy as doctors had hoped. Many expensive medicines followed. The family took on more and more debt, she said, and there was simply nothing else to do.

"We just didn't have the money," said Hang, 45. "If we had the money, who would ever get into this sort of business?"
