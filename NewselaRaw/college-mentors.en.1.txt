SEATTLE — Buzzing with fifth-grade energy, nearly 900 10- and 11-year-olds filled Western Washington University's gym one day in October.

The gym had all the excitement of a pep rally before a big game. It rocked with the sound of the college band as the school's Viking mascot high-fived his way across the room and cheerleaders shook pom-poms onstage.

These fifth-graders are on the brink of an important new phase in their lives. In the next few years, how they perceive themselves — as smart, average, college-bound or not — may change the path of their educational careers.

Western's goal is to convince these kids that college should be in their future.

## Compass 2 Campus

Much of the national conversation about college-going rates has been focused on high-poverty, inner-city schools. But in Whatcom County, where the university is located, the number of high school graduates who go to college also lags behind the state average, which is low to begin with.

Fewer than 1 in 4 high school graduates from two county districts, for example, go to four-year colleges. Just a little over half of all graduates in surrounding districts go to college at all. And the majority head to community colleges, which have even higher dropout rates.

Western isn't the first university to use college students to help younger students. What sets the program apart is that it starts in fifth grade, a critical moment when students start to size up their own skills compared with their peers.

Three times a year, Western sends about 400 students into 29 schools in a program called Compass 2 Campus. Since it began five years ago, the program has reached into 350 classrooms and touched the lives of about 9,000 school kids. The college mentors spend the first three weeks learning how to work with preteens and teens from different cultural backgrounds. They spend the remaining seven weeks working in their classrooms as tutors and role models. A mentor acts as a guide and role model to another, usually younger, person.

The university won't know if the program is effective until its original group of fifth-graders, now in ninth grade, graduates from high school. And even then, it may be difficult to separate the effects of the program from other efforts.

But Compass 2 Campus is making strides toward building what experts say is a key part of getting more kids to go to college: creating a college-going culture in schools.

## Mentors In The Classroom

One day last fall in teacher John Sage's social studies class at Shuksan Middle School in Bellingham, three Western student-mentors watched Sage teach a lesson on the Middle East.

The mentors are trained to watch for academic hiccups — moments when a student stumbles on an idea or a project.

They gave gentle praise to students working on map interpretations, and they helped correct wrong answers when the quiz was over.

"They're smart, they're college students, they've done this before," Sage said. "I love having them in my room."

Shuksan Principal Jay Jordan asks his teachers to set aside time every Thursday so the mentors can talk to students about what college is like.

"Hey, 35 college kids in our school, four hours a week — that's a great connection," Jordan said.

As the mentors talk about how they came to be students at Western, they are also imparting a subtle lesson: I'm a college student. I'm like you, just a few years older. Study hard, and you can go to college, too.

Eleven years ago, when her husband was chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, Cyndie Shepard met a fifth-grader who was in trouble for misbehaving.

Shepard asked him what he planned to be when he grew up. Defiant, the boy crossed his arms and said he expected to end up in jail — just like his father.

An educator, Shepard was stunned that a 10-year-old could have such a bleak view of his future. But researchers know that by middle school, students have strong ideas about their own skills and potential — ideas that can open avenues, or cut them off.

Studies have linked better job prospects, higher salaries, even lower prison rates with at least some level of college education.

Shepard thought that lighting up the path to college was especially needed in Green Bay. Only about 21 percent of adults in the Wisconsin town have a bachelor's degree or higher, and the rate of the college bound among high school graduates is low.

Last year, more than 170 student-mentors from the Green Bay campus participated in a program Shepard and others developed. It is called Phuture Phoenix and reaches 27 schools.

Phuture Phoenix high school graduates have been going to college at slightly higher rates in the last two years. That's happening at a time when national college enrollment has started to level off and drop in many states, including Wisconsin.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Washington is 46th among the 50 states in students who enroll full time in college after high school.

This has led policymakers to try a variety of measures to get more kids to go to college.

At the heart of Compass 2 Campus lies two ideas. The first is that middle school students form strong ideas about their own skills and their potential. The second idea is that by starting in fifth grade, schools can encourage more students to go to college by bringing college mentors into the classroom.

Between elementary and middle school "is the place where we see the strongest negative changes in achievement and motivation, consistently," said Eric Anderman. He chairs the Department of Educational Studies at Ohio State University and has done extensive research on this issue.

"Right around the fifth grade, it's a really, really important time to plant those seeds and get kids thinking about their futures," he said.
