NEWARK, Del. â€” When a team of researchers traveled to Africa two years ago to search for model chickens, they weren't looking for plump thighs or delicious eggs.

They were seeking birds that could survive a hotter planet.

The researchers from the University of Delaware are at the forefront of food scientists. Backed by millions of dollars from the federal government, they are racing to develop new breeds of farm animals that can stand up to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).

Some climate change activists dismiss the work, which is just getting under way. They consider it a distraction and a concession to large-scale agriculture, which they blame for making the world's environmental problems worse. The scientists, however, say that new breeds of farm animals, which can resist the heat, will be essential to feeding the world.

## Changing Climate Response Tactics

The experiments reflect a shift in the federal government's response to climate change. The government first attempted to slow global warming by reducing carbon emissions worldwide, but that's not going well. So the government increasingly is looking for ways to protect key industries from the impact of a warmer Earth.

In agriculture, "we are dealing with the challenge of difficult weather conditions at the same time we have to massively increase food production,"  said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Larger populations will mean a need for more meat.

And that means efforts like the one in which Carl Schmidt and other scientists are trying to map the genes of bizarre-looking African naked-neck chickens. They want to see if the chicken's ability to withstand heat can be bred into flocks of U.S. broilers.

"The game is changing since the climate is changing," Schmidt said. "We have to start now to anticipate what changes we have to make in order to feed 9 billion people."

Warmer temperatures can create huge problems for animals farmed for food. Turkeys are at risk for a condition that makes their breast meat mushy, disease can rip through chicken coops, and brutal weather can kill entire cattle herds.

"It's a big problem when it happens," said Gale Strasburg, a professor of food science and human nutrition at Michigan State University. His quest is to develop more robust turkeys. "Within a day or two after the heat wave hits, you will go from there being no problem at all on a farm to 40 percent of turkey breasts having a problem."

He added, "If we start seeing a lot more shifts in summer temperature extremes, there is going to be more of this."

## Taking Some Heat

Strasburg's research involves turning up the heat lamps on hundreds of turkey chicks and eggs. Researchers then study the animals and attempt to figure out which genes could help the animals endure hotter temperatures. The hope is ultimately to enable industry to breed turkeys that can withstand the heat.

"The reality we deal with is that worldwide the demand is growing for meat," he said. "There will be more and more pressure to produce it more sustainably and of consistent quality."

Some well-known climate experts, however, question the federal government's emphasis on keeping up with the growing global demand for meat. Raising animals requires many resources that make greenhouse gasses. So the only realistic way to reduce greenhouse gases may be to encourage people to eat less meat, they say. Scientists are just about certain that global warming is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gasses, created by burning fossil fuels and cutting down trees.

## Tastes Like Chicken

Alan Miller recently retired as a principal climate change specialist at the World Bank. He said the meat industry should be more radical in controlling climate change.

"There's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people," Bill Gates wrote recently on his blog. Gates, the founder of Microsoft, is in favor of technology that would use pea proteins to create beef and chicken that looks like the real thing.

The scientists working to create breeds of animals that can cope with a warmer climate argue that they, too, are focused on depleting fewer resources.

At Oklahoma State University, scientist Megan Rolf says she is trying to develop cattle that need less water and feed.

"The idea is to create animals that are more efficient," Rolf said.

Picky eaters, who want their food to taste good, complicate her work.

The Brahman breed of cattle, for example, does well in hot, harsh conditions. One place it doesn't do well, is in American taste tests. Rolf's goal is to create a steer as hardy as a Brahman and as tasty as an Angus, a breed of cattle known for its delicious meat.

Back in Delaware, Schmidt pulled up an image of the African bird. He pointed to the lack of feathers on its bare neck, which help it keep cool.

"What the industry really wants is that in a meat producer," he said.

## Mapping Temperatures And Genes

He pulled out a climate map of the United States. The map is marked with yellow dots where the temperature spikes above 100 degrees Fahrenheit more than 10 days a year.

"It is not the 2 degrees" average temperature rise projected by climate scientists that Schmidt is focused on. "It's the increased number and duration of heat waves. The issue is helping these chickens or any animals survive in a state of increased heat stress."

A few buildings away, some of his graduate students delicately place drops of chicken blood into test tubes to map their genes. Schmidt predicts the hardier chickens will start being mass produced in about 15 years.

But Schmidt says where he hopes his work can be most beneficial is in increasing the chances of survival for chickens in poverty-stricken areas of Africa and South America.

"If the developing world runs into problems with food security," he said, "that affects everybody."
