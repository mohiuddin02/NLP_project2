EDINBURGH, Scotland â€” Scottish voters decided on Thursday to remain part of the United Kingdom. They rejected independence in a historic vote that shook the country to its core.

The decision prevented a breakup of a 307-year union with England. A huge sigh of relief was felt among Britain's long-standing political leaders. Scots voted 55 percent to 45 percent against independence, with a greater percentage of people turning up at the polls than ever before.

Independence was a long-cherished goal for Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. He campaigned intensely to launch a new state. But a majority of voters chose instead the security that comes with staying in the United Kingdom, which includes England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

## Younger Scots Versus Older Scots

Salmond accepted the results, saying "we know it is a majority for the No campaign." He called on his fellow Scots to accept the results of the vote.

Despite his defeat, he said the vote "has been a triumph for the democratic process."

Salmond had argued that Scots could do well all alone because Scotland is rich in oil and has smart, educated people. He said Scotland would flourish on its own, free of interference from any London-based government.

Nonetheless, Salmond came close to winning independence. His campaign scared London politicians into promising new powers for Scotland.

Many saw it as a "heads versus hearts" campaign. On the one side were cautious older Scots who worried that independence was something Scotland couldn't afford. On the other side were younger Scots who fell in love with the idea of building their own country.

The result saves British Prime Minister David Cameron from a historic defeat.

## "Built Together By Sacrificing And Sharing"

The man who served as prime minister before him was Gordon Brown, a Scot. Brown crisscrossed Scotland in the final days before the vote. Brown rejected the idea that independence was the patriotic choice. He argued that Scots could be devoted to Scotland but still be proud of their place in the United Kingdom.

"There is not a cemetery in Europe that does not have Scots, English, Welsh and Irish lined side by side," Brown said in his final speech before the vote. "We not only won these wars together, we built the peace together. What we have built together by sacrificing and sharing, let no narrow nationalism split asunder."

Cameron is aware that his Conservative Party is hated in Scotland. The prime minister begged voters not to use a vote for independence as a way to bash his party.

The vote against independence keeps the U.K. from losing a major part of its territory and oil reserves, and prevents it from having to find a new base for its nuclear weapons, now housed in Scotland. Losing Scotland could have hurt the U.K.'s role within the European Union and the United Nations.

The decision also means Britain can avoid a prolonged period of money problems that had been predicted by some if Scotland broke away.

In return for staying in the union, Scotland's voters have been promised new powers by the British government, which had feared losing Scotland forever. What exactly those powers are is still somewhat unclear.
