LOS ANGELES â€” Should you have to be a Christian to lead a Christian student group? A new rule at California State University says no.

InterVarsity Christian Fellowship is a Christian group for college students. The group requires that its leaders be Christians. As a result, it has gotten into a fight with Cal State and other universities.

The disagreement at Cal State began when the university made a rule change. It put in place a new "all-comers" rule. Now a student can join any group, no matter his or her background. The rule also says that anyone can be president of a group. For instance, a white student could lead the Chinese Student Association.

## Tough Questions

InterVarsity and some other Christian groups disagreed with the new rule. They refused to go along with it. The university removed them from the list of official student groups.

Unofficial groups can continue meeting. However, they do not get the same rights as official groups. For example, unofficial groups cannot take part in student fairs. The fairs are events where groups find new members. Unofficial groups also cannot take money from student groups.

InterVarsity members say the new rules are unfair. They want their leaders to fit the group's values. In InterVarsity, certain students lead Bible study and prayers. InterVarsity thinks they should believe in Christianity.

"I don't think a non-Christian would want to be a leader in a Christian group," Cal State student Jasmine Kim said. She still opposed the rule, though. Kim felt that it blocked InterVarsity's rights.

The disagreement raises tough questions. Should religious groups be held to the same rules as everyone else?

## Arguing About Freedom

Cal State is not alone. Other universities are dealing with the same questions. Vanderbilt, Tufts and other universities have added rules like the one at Cal State. InterVarsity has fought changes at those universities, too.

The disagreement at Cal State is especially important, though. It is the nation's largest university system. It has 450,000 students.

Edward Whelan works for a group that supports Christianity. He disagrees with the new rules. Whelan says that Christian groups should be able to choose Christian leaders. It is a matter of freedom, he says. Americans are free to form whatever groups they want. Groups are free to choose their own leaders.

But the new rule is also about freedom. Some people think a student be free to join any group, even if he or she is of a different religion.

Daniel Mach works for a group that fights for the rights of individuals. He says Cal State is not keeping Christian groups from meeting. The all-comer rule only matters if a group is an official student group. Cal State only gives money and support to groups that are open to all. It does not take away their freedom to meet.
