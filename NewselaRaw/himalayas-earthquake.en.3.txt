Nepal is a nation of 27 million people located in Southeast Asia. Some of the tallest mountains in the world are in the north of Nepal. They are part of the chain of mountains called the Himalayas. Among these mountains are hundreds of dams. A dam is a large wall that blocks the flow of a body of water. Scientists are worried that if a large earthquake hits Nepal, some of these dams might burst. The damage could be immense.

The people of Nepal are still recovering from the two earthquakes that hit in April and May. More than 8,500 people died and many more were injured. Several dams were cracked or damaged. Luckily, none burst.

The next earthquake to hit the Himalayas could be even stronger. Some scientists worry that the dams might burst if the shaking is bad enough.

## Broken Dam Would Cause Huge Flood

A burst dam would release a sudden flood of water, threatening people nearby. The water would rush down through the mountains towards towns and cities. For example, if the Tehri Dam in the central Himalayas burst, it would set loose a wave more than 500 feet high. The water would hit two towns on its way down the mountainside. Another six cities, with a combined population of 2 million people, would be flooded.

There are earthquakes in the Himalayas because of what is happening miles beneath the ground. Within the earth's crust, there are huge rocks called "plates." The plates are in slow, steady motion. They drift, and sometimes collide. Below Nepal, one plate is pushing under another plate. It moves a few feet every hundred years. Sometimes, it gets stuck. This leads to a build-up of pressure. When the pressure reaches a certain level, the plates become unstuck, causing an earthquake.

Laurent Bollinger is a scientist who studies earthquakes. He has studied the effects of the earthquakes that hit Nepal earlier this year. Bollinger says the earthquakes made the area less stable. As a result, an even bigger earthquake is now more likely.

## Pressure Builds Toward Next Quake

Scientists can measure the pressure that builds up between plates. They have found that the earthquakes earlier this year in Nepal released only a fraction of the pressure beneath the surface. This suggests that more earthquakes are likely in the coming years.

Given the danger of more earthquakes in Nepal, the dams in the region have to be specially built. Martin Wieland says they must be able to withstand the strong ground shaking of an huge earthquake. Wieland works at the International Commission on Large Dams.

However, scientists are not always allowed to study the dams, making it hard to know whether the dams in Nepal are strong enough. Most of the dams in the area are owned by India and China. Both countries are secretive about their dam designs. Outsiders are rarely allowed to examine them.

Scientists who have been able to study dams in the region are concerned. For example, Canadian scientists studied a Chinese dam called the Three Gorges Dam. They found that the designers had not been careful enough in preparing for earthquakes.

It is possible that the Indian and Chinese governments have not designed their dams to be strong enough. If so, hundreds of dams could be in danger of bursting when the next big earthquake hits the Himalayas.

Scientists who understand the hidden dangers of the Himalayas are arguing for safer dam construction. They have had only limited success, though. For now, all they can do is call attention to the problem.

Scientists hope that the dams in the Himalayas will be reinforced to withstand future earthquakes. Otherwise, the next earthquake in the area may not just shake the mountains, but also flood them.
