BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” In July, the city of Beirut closed its garbage dump.

Smelly garbage has been piling up ever since. The government could not decide what to do. Finally, people had enough. Thousands of people protested in the streets of Beirut.

Beirut is the capital of Lebanon. Lebanon is in the Middle East between Europe, Asia and Africa.

Some Beirut citizens started a new group. It calls itself "You Stink." The group came up with a new way to solve Beirut's garbage problem. They demand that the entire government quit.

## Dozens Hurt When Demonstration Turned Violent

The "You Stink" protests began peacefully. They became violent last weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, police fought with protesters. There was gunfire in the streets. Dozens of people were hurt.

The "You Stink" group says it will not give up.

Marwan Maarouf is with the group. He said the group got the Lebanese people to take action.

Maarouf called for a large protest Saturday. Another protest can mean trouble for Lebanon. The country is already trying to deal with thousands of Syrian refugees. Syria is in the middle of a war.

## Crowds Gathered Even Though Protest Was Canceled

"You Stink" decided not to hold a protest on Monday. Hundreds of people still gathered in downtown Beirut. The protests were peaceful.

Lebanon's government expected more trouble. It sent the army to guard downtown Beirut.

The protest was Lebanon's largest in years.

Rami Khouri is with the American University of Beirut. He said the protest will likely lead to some kind of change.

The government will have two choices, he said. It will have to change. It also may have to work better together and be more fair.

## Official Says Government Working To Clear Trash

The government has tried to answer the protesters. Mohammad Machnouk is Lebanon's top official for the environment. He said the government is working to get rid of all the garbage. It already hired companies to handle the trash.

Protesters do not think he is taking the problem seriously.

Ambassador David Hale is America's top official in Lebanon. Hale said he was upset by the violence at the protests. He was also upset that people were hurt. He said Lebanon needs to figure out what happened. Also, all sides need to show better behavior.

Hale met with Tammam Salam. He is the head of the Lebanese government. Afterward, Hale said that Lebanon's citizens deserve garbage collection. They also need a government that can work together.
