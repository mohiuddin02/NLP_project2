Amaiya's religion is Islam. She is a Muslim. Amaiya wants to wear a hijab when she boxes. A hijab is a scarf for Muslim women. It covers their head. Boxing rules say it is not allowed. They also do not let her wear leggings or long sleeves. The rules say she cannot cover her arms or lower legs. Amaiya thinks the rules should change. She will not take off her hijab.

## Amaiya Works Hard At Boxing

Amaiya started to like boxing two years ago. She saw a boxing ring at a gym. But her father told her to learn fencing. It is a kind of sword fighting. Amaiya did not like fencing. She wanted to box.

Amaiya's parents became excited about boxing. Her mother is Sarah O'Keefe-Zafar. She said Amaiya trained for a year. Amaiya used to be shy. Boxing helped her to become strong.

Some boys did not think Amaiya could box. They did not think girls could fight. Then they saw her fight. The boys changed their minds.

## Waiting To Hear Yes Or No

USA Boxing is a group in charge of boxing. USA Boxing asked its bosses if Amaiya can wear the hijab.

Jaylani Hussein is in charge of a big Muslim group in Minnesota. He said that USA Boxing did the right thing. They asked permission about the hijab. Amaiya should have a chance to box.

Amaiya is not the first athlete to fight to wear a hijab. FIFA runs world soccer. In 2014 it said players could wear hijab in games. It also said OK to head coverings of other religions.
