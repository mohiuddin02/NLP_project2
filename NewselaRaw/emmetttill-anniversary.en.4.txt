MONEY, Miss. â€” Emmett Till was a 14-year-old black boy. He lived in Chicago. On Aug. 28, 1955, he was killed. He was just on vacation.

Emmett had come to Money, Mississippi, to visit his mother's family. After a few days, he went to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to buy bubblegum.

Some people said he whistled at a white woman. She was married to the store's owner. Her husband was angry that a black boy had whistled at his wife.

The next night, the man and his half-brother had guns and grabbed Emmett. He was murdered. Emmett's body was found in a river.

## Store Holds Many Memories

Sixty years later, the grocery store is in bad shape. It is covered in thick weeds and vines. Some say the grocery store should become a museum. Or it should at least be kept from falling down.

Emmett's death helped to begin the civil rights movement. That was the fight for black people to be treated fairly.

Eddie Carthan is related to Emmett's mother. He was once the mayor of Tchula. It was one of the first towns in Mississippi to have a black mayor. He said the store should be saved.

## The South Was Very Different

In 1955, many white people in Mississippi were racist. They believed that black people were not as good as whites. Many laws in the South treated black people unfairly. A lot of blacks were prevented from voting. Black children were not allowed to go to school with white children.

Last weekend, Emmett's family visited Money.

One of the oldest was Charles Kelly, who is 66. He said he played with Emmett just days before he died. One of the youngest was an 11-year-old boy. His name is Emmett Louis Till Marshall.

The family members watched a movie about Emmett's death. They marched through a nearby town where black people live. The parade was to honor Emmett's memory. They also went to Bryant's grocery store and other important places.

## Visiting Was Painful

At sunset, the group visited a farm shed. Emmett was probably killed there.

In the shed, Kelly said it was hard to return to the area. It brought back many bad memories. Emmett's cousin wore a T-shirt covered in photos of the boy.

Deborah Watts is another family member. She held her hands together near her chest and cried. She said she was so sorry about what happened.

Teri Watts is her daughter. She wrapped her arm around her mother's shoulder. She said that Emmett "knows we are sorry."
