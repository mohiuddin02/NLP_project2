WASHINGTON — More and more medical devices are getting hooked up to the Internet these days.

These devices include pumps that deliver drugs to the body. X-rays and defibrillators – which regulate the heart – are also linked up.

This connection can be a security risk. The devices can be attacked by criminals to make money. Hackers who want to show of their technical skills could also take a crack.

Chris Carroll remembers the first time he saw someone hack into an insulin pump. They made it deliver a deadly dose of insulin.

The pump wasn't connected to anyone. Still, the danger was real.

It hit home, too. Carroll has Type 1 diabetes. He wears a pump. The pump delivers insulin directly into his body. The insulin helps people with diabetes keep their blood sugar at safe levels.

## Be Prepared For Anything

The FBI says the health care industry is not prepared to fight against cyber criminals. It also said banks and stores are more prepared for these attacks.

Experts also are worried that deaths could happen accidentally. People are becoming more dependent on medical devices that share information. This increases the chance for problems.

Frank Painter is a health care expert. He said it's not the criminals and hackers we really need to worry about. The worst risk is that a system could be scrambled by accident, causing devices to go haywire.

Wired magazine published a report in April. It said that an official from Essentia Health found that people can change how drug pumps work online. They can do the same thing to defibrillators and X-rays. They can even change temperature settings on refrigerators that store drugs and blood.

The security official is Scott Erven. He ran the study over two years in the Midwest. Erven couldn't be reached for a comment for this article.

## Hackers See Dollar Signs

Hospitals are moving patient records onto computer networks. The change means hackers can make a lot of money. The FBI says that even partial electronic health records are being sold. The sales are illegal. But people can get $50 for each record. They only get $1 for Social Security cards or credit card numbers.

Electronic health records contain detailed patient information. This is a good thing. It allows all the patient's health care providers to share that information. But these records are attractive targets to hackers. They can be used to sell drug prescriptions.

Michael Carome is the director of health research at Public Citizen. The group fights for consumer rights. He said it was hard to say how big the risk of medical information leaks was. But public health officials should be paying attention, he said.

The FBI report mentions research from the SANS Institute. SANS is a private company. It specializes in Internet protection training. SANS said some systems and devices could be broken into. They could stay open for extended periods. Companies notified of the problems did not repair them, SANS said.

"The time to act is yesterday," the report says.

## Get A Clue

Carroll said he contacted his own pump provider about hacking.

"Both of the people I talked to had no idea this was possible," he said. They also could not say how the issue would be fixed, he said. They said nobody would try to break into a device, Carroll said.

So far, Carroll's pump maker has been right. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it is not aware of any patient injuries or deaths related to hacking. The FDA is in charge of what medical devices can be sold.

Still, at least some users think the risks are real. Dick Cheney was vice president from 2001 to 2009. In 2007, he had the wireless function on his heart defibrillator disabled. He feared it made him more at risk of a terrorist attack. But most people don't face the same level of personal risk.
