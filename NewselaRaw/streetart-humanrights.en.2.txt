NEW YORK â€” A woman in a head scarf gazes from the side of a New York building. On another building, a flock of spray-painted birds breaks free. In a different part of the city, a teal gazelle is shown against a black background, bare trees and a peacock feather.

The street art are among about a half-dozen murals painted around New York City and Jersey City, New Jersey. Their purpose is to draw attention to journalist Maziar Bahari's campaign for press freedom and education in Iran. Bahari spent 118 days in jail there after he appeared on "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" television show.

## Art As Conversation Starters

Bahari's story was told in Stewart's film "Rosewater." Bahari has founded a nonprofit group, Not A Crime, to focus on journalism and education for Iran's largest religious minority, the Baha'i. The group believes in one God and emphasizes that humans are equal and differences should be cherished.

Bahari hopes the art will get the attention of diplomats and world leaders attending the United Nations General Assembly, and start a conversation about human rights.

"At least some of them will talk about the situation of the Baha'is in Iran, some of them will talk about the journalists in Iran," Bahari said.

## Spy Jokes Are Not Funny

Bahari was working for Newsweek magazine in June 2009. Iran's Revolutionary Guards took him from his mother's home in Tehran on charges of spying. Iran's government is anti-West and does not allow freedom of speech. The charges against Bahari were based on a video of him joking with a "Daily Show" correspondent about being a spy. During four months in Tehran's Evin prison, he was beaten, held in a cell by himself and treated very badly, he said.

He was released on bail after four months and left the country. He later was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison. The charges included spreading propaganda - or false information - against Iran, collecting secret documents and insulting Iran's supreme leader.

Iran has imprisoned 30 journalists. It is second only to China in jailing reporters, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Cases like those of Bahari and Jason Rezaian have spotlighted the issue. Rezaian is a Washington Post reporter held in Evin prison for more than a year on spy charges.

## These Art Pieces Carry Messages

The mural of the woman is a portrait of Atena Farghadani, an artist and activist serving a 12-year prison sentence in Iran. She created a cartoon that criticized a law limiting women's ability to get birth control. The mural, created by artist Faith47, shows her without a mouth.

Another artist, Ron English, is painting a large, official-looking warning. It suggests that photography is not permitted.

Street art is a perfect way to deliver political messages, he said. "Everybody experiences it."

Argentine artist Marina Zumi created the mural of the gazelle. She said she hopes that her painting leads people to begin talking about social justice.

Parris Douglas was passing by and was drawn to the gazelle Zumi was painting.

"I feel like this is liberating," he said after asking Zumi what prompted the mural. "It's the fact we're allowed to express how we feel with anyone saying or telling us what we can and can't do."
