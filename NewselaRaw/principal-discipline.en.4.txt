Children attacked adults. They smoked in school. They teased other kids. Almost half of the students were suspended for being bad.

"When someone says Spurgeon, it's like the worst thing in the world," a parent said.

Over the summer, a new principal took over. His name is Todd Irving. He wants to get the school back under control.

## Understanding Their Problems

Irving has a plan. First, students must follow small rules, like getting to class on time. Second, he will give troublemakers attention.

Irving asked the school to put together a list of the 50 most troubled students. He promised to be responsible for them.

He met with each of the students and their parents. The meetings helped Irving understand their problems at home. These aren't bad kids, he realized. They are kids who have had hard lives.

Some of the students don't have beds to sleep in. Some of the boys have fathers in jail. Others have mothers who were sent home to another country. There are also students who are addicted to drugs.

Irving set goals for all 50 students. Each signed a piece of paper called a contract. It says they must come to class every day. And they must follow the rules.

## Dealing With A Troublemaker

On the second morning of school, Irving explained the rules. Students must pick up their own garbage. They must get to class on time. They must not fight or threaten to hurt anyone.

That afternoon, a father told Irving that another kid was bullying his son. The father was so angry he was almost crying.

The troublemaker was an eighth-grader with braces in his mouth and spiked hair. His name was Ernesto. Irving called Ernesto into his office. His mother and a police officer came also.

The officer told Ernesto that Spurgeon has become a new school.

"Who's the man in charge?" asked the officer.

"Him," Ernesto said quietly, looking at Irving.

Irving asked Ernesto to sign the contract.

## Kids Are Behaving Better

During the day, students are in and out of Irving's office. Sometimes Irving pulls troublemakers out of class. Irving lets them sit in his office. They can do homework or just talk.

So far, his plan is working. Many of the kids on his list are behaving much better.

But Irving knows that students behave best at the beginning of the year. As the year goes on, they can get out of control.

So Irving is trying not to get comfortable. He knows the kids could get worse if they aren't made to follow the rules.
