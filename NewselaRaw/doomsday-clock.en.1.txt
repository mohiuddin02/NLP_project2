STANFORD, Calif. — The world is under grave threat, said the scientists behind a "Doomsday Clock" that measures the likelihood of a global disaster.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced that the minute hand on the metaphorical clock remained at three minutes-to-midnight. The clock reflects how close the world is to catastrophe from nuclear weapons, climate change and new technologies. Midnight symbolizes the end of humanity. 

"Unless we change the way we think, humanity remains in serious danger," said Lawrence Krauss, chair of the bulletin's Board of Sponsors.

Krauss said there is some good news, too. Last year, the United States reached an agreement with Iran to prevent the Middle Eastern country from developing nuclear weapons. Also, nearly 200 nations promised to work to prevent climate change.

## Good News Offset By Bad News

But any good news was offset by rising tension between Russia and the United States, North Korea's recent nuclear test and a lack of aggressive steps to address climate change. There is also much uncertainty over whether the climate change agreement will lead to concrete action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are causing the Earth to heat up.

The scientists behind the bulletin adjusted the clock from five minutes-to-midnight to three minutes-to-midnight last year. They cited climate change, modernization of nuclear weapons and large nuclear weapons arsenals as "extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity." The clock was previously at three minutes-to-midnight in 1984, when the bulletin said talks between the United States and Russia — then called the Soviet Union — virtually stopped.

If midnight on the clock represents the disappearance of humanity because of climate change, three minutes-to-midnight is overly dire, said Michael Oppenheimer. He is a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University and is not affiliated with the bulletin.

## "The Jury Is Out"

On the other hand, Oppenheimer said if midnight means humans have emitted so much greenhouse gas that dangerous climate change is inevitable, then three minutes is a "fair analysis."

"I think the jury is out as to whether the Paris agreement will make a significant difference," he said. "The key is whether countries over the next couple of years are able to agree on some important details that were left out."

Michael Shermer is the publisher of Skeptic magazine, which examines social and scientific controversies. He said in an email that the Doomsday clock is "an exercise in pessimism and PR with little connection to the reality of moral progress made in the past half century." Shermer cited reductions in the number of nuclear weapons since the 1980s and the fact that there has not been a war between Europe's major powers since World War II.

## Gov. Brown: Climate Change Could Be A "Tipping Point"

California Governor Jerry Brown joined former Secretary of State George Shultz and former Secretary of Defense William Perry for a discussion after the clock was unveiled. The event was at Stanford University in California.

Perry raised concerns about rhetoric from Russia regarding the use of nuclear weapons. He said the threat of nuclear disaster was greater today than during the Cold War, the period after World War II until the early 1990s when Russia and the United States were enemies. Shultz said the U.S. needs to engage Russia and China. Brown warned about "tipping points" in the fight against climate change.

"And around a tipping point, we may not be able to come back to a stable planet or one we'll find very comfortable to live in," he said.

## Scientists Make The Clock Decision

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded in 1945 by University of Chicago scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons. The clock was created two years later.

The decision to move or leave the clock alone is made by the bulletin's science and security board. It includes physicists and environmental scientists from around the world. They make the decision in consultation with the bulletin's Board of Sponsors, which includes more than a dozen Nobel Prize winners.

The closest the clock has come to midnight was in 1953, when the scientists set it to two minutes away. That year, the Soviet Union tested a hydrogen bomb in response to a U.S. hydrogen bomb test.
