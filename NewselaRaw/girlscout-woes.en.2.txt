NEW YORK, N.Y. — The Girl Scouts' membership is dwindling faster than a box of Thin Mints. But its leaders hope technology can help reverse that decline. They are expanding a program that allows Girl Scouts to sell cookies through apps and on their personalized websites.

The Digital Cookie upgrade, announced in early December, comes at a challenging time for the 103-year-old organization. According to figures, youth membership for this year was 1.88 million, down 6 percent from 2014. Adult membership was 784,120, down 3 percent.

The total membership is now 2.66 million — a drop of more than 15 percent over three years. Even worse, membership has decreased 30 percent from a peak of more than 3.8 million in 2003.

The Girl Scouts are a charity and depend on donations to keep running. Lately, they also are struggling to raise money. The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper that covers nonprofit groups, showed the organization received $103 million in donations in 2014, down from almost $195 million in 2006. Back then, the Girl Scouts ranked 83rd among U.S. charities for such donations; the Chronicle now ranks it 257th.

## Many Youth Groups See Declines

Some other major youth groups are also losing donations and members. Changes in society and people's habits are thought to be one cause. However, Anna Maria Chavez, CEO of Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA), says her organization can gain new members through technological improvements.

For paid workers and volunteers, these include online toolkits. One tool makes it easier to join the Girl Scouts. Another empowers volunteer troop leaders to plan a full year of meetings and activities with a single online visit.

"Our volunteers need more tools to serve more girls," Chavez said. "So we're really doubling down on technology."

For the girls themselves, Digital Cookie is the biggest opportunity to become more tech savvy. Chavez said the tool helps girls run and manage their Girl Scout cookie business online.

## Website Includes Learning Games

About 160,000 Girl Scouts participated in the program over the past year. They sold cookies the traditional in-person way, but also sold nearly 2.5 million boxes of cookies online. For the coming year, about 90 percent of the GSUSA's 112 regional councils will participate in Digital Cookie. Various new features have been added to make it more educational and fun.

Some of these include an online game called Cookie Booth Bounce to help girls improve decision-making and skills in managing money. A "Learning to Run a Business" section can also be found on the website. Girls can post videos about themselves and how they plan to spend the money they earn.

Digital Cookie's fans include 18-year-old Claire Houston, who spent 13 years with the Girl Scouts in New York. Claire is college freshman in Massachusetts. She studies computer science and is a coach for a Girl Scout robotics team.

Digital Cookie "is a great way to connect with how the world is changing right now," she said. "Technology is such a big part of our lives."

## Some Speak Out Against Changes

Expanding its technology has not been problem-free. A memo from the Girl Scouts' communications office said some councils across the United States experienced membership declines and service disruptions while adjusting to the new systems.

To make improvements for the long run, GSUSA decided to accept the short-term problems, the memo said.

Some complaints about program changes and cost have been posted on the "GSUSA, Are You Listening?" Facebook page. It serves as a place for complaints by Girl Scout volunteers who are uneasy about the organization's direction. Some worry that the GSUSA is moving too far away from camping, the earning of badges, and other traditional activities.

Suellen Nelles is the most outspoken objector among the 112 council CEOs. She recently posted a detailed complaint to the Facebook page. She criticized the national leadership and urged it to work more closely with staff and volunteers at the councils.

## Girls Will Show The Way, Leader Says

"The leadership is fine with maintaining all the power," and leading from the top-down, said Nelles, who heads the Farthest North Girl Scout Council in Fairbanks, Alaska. "We have forgotten ... that we are only as strong as our all-volunteer membership."  

Nelles, however, has received little support from other council CEOs. Chavez insisted the national office and the councils are collaborating more now than at any time during her seven years running the Girl Scouts.

"We know we'll continue to have challenges," Chavez said. "But here's our secret power: We're a family with a clear purpose — creating girls of courage, confidence and character. The girls are going to lead the way for us."
