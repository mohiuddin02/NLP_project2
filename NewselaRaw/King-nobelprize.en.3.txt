ATLANTA â€” Fifty years ago, Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize.

King learned that he won the prize while he was in the hospital. He had just returned to Atlanta and became ill. The doctor lectured King about eating fried foods. The doctor also told him that he was run-down, overweight and sick.

King's wife called his hospital room the next morning. She told him had won the Nobel Peace Prize. King said he thought he was dreaming.

"It was a shock," said Andrew Young. He is a civil rights leader and was one of King's closest friends.

## The Importance Of The Prize

It was Oct. 14, 1964, and King was 35 years old. He was the second black American to win the peace prize and the youngest person. King fought for black people to be treated equally. In 1955, he led the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott after Rosa Parks, a black woman, refused to give up her seat to a white person.

The prize was not just important for King and civil rights. It was also important for Atlanta. Some say it changed the city. It brought black people and white people together. A dinner to honor King became the first time people of different races shared a meal in public.

A dinner may seem like a little thing, but it almost did not happen. At that time, blacks and whites were not allowed to eat together in public. The dinner tested the courage of people who wanted to make Atlanta a more fair city.

## A Party For All People

After King won the prize, the question became how to honor him.

The problem was that in Atlanta, the races did not mix, and King was black.

Some people wanted to give him a dinner at an Atlanta restaurant. It was a gathering place for civil rights leaders. Young said it was important that the entire city come together to celebrate King's Nobel Prize, not just people working for civil rights.

Important people in Atlanta decided to throw a huge party for everyone in the city at the Dinkler Plaza Hotel.

Two years before, the hotel refused to give a room to the first black Nobel Peace Prize winner. His name was Ralph Bunche.

Even after the dinner had been announced and a date set, nobody bought tickets. Atlanta's powerful businessmen did not like the idea.

## "It Was A Turning Point"

On Dec. 10, King received the prize in Norway. Six days later, the dinner organizers sent a letter to the Coca-Cola Company.

At the time, J. Paul Austin was the head of the soda pop company. He said it was embarrassing for Coca-Cola to be in a city that refused to honor its Nobel Prize winner. He threatened to move the company to another city if people did not attend the event.

Two hours later, every ticket was sold.

On the night of Jan. 27, 1965, about 1,500 people, both black and white, packed the Dinkler's ballroom to greet King.

"Because of the race issue, it could have been very explosive," said Samuel Dubois Cook. He was college friend of King. "It was a turning point, without question."
