Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. Malala is the teenage girl who was shot by religious fighters in Pakistan after standing up against laws that stopped girls from getting an education.

She will share the important award with Indian children's rights supporter Kailash Satyarthi.

Malala has become a symbol of hope in Pakistan. Girls there are sometimes killed by their own families in "honor killings" if they dare to marry for love. They are even kept out of school in very traditional communities.

The award comes as girls are under attack in other countries.

## "Whose Voices Need To Be Heard"

In Nigeria, hundreds of schoolgirls have been kidnapped by the violent group Boko Haram and are still being held.

In Iraq, the group Islamic State (ISIL) has kidnapped hundreds of girls. The girls belong to a minority religious group called the Yazidi. The group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The Levant is the English term for the land stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

In India, two girls were killed in a village in May. They had gone outside their home at night to relieve themselves in a field because there were no bathrooms inside.

"This award is for all the children who are voiceless, whose voices need to be heard," Malala, age 17, said. She was the youngest person in history to receive the Peace Prize. The award is not often given to women.

## To Free Children From Forced Labor

The Nobel committee announced in Oslo, Norway, that the award was also being given to Satyarthi, age 60. He founded Bachpan Bachao Andolan, or the Save the Childhood Movement. The group has campaigned to free thousands of children from forced labor and being sold as slaves. The Nobel committee wanted to highlight the problems of both boys and girls.

Both Malala and Satyarthi could have been killed for their work for children.

The decision was packed with meaning. The award was shared by a Pakistani and an Indian, each struggling for children's rights. They live in neighboring nations that have gone to war with each other several times and both have nuclear bombs. The two countries' borders in Kashmir have seen intense bombing in recent days. The difference in the two winners' ages illustrated that the struggle for basic human rights is everyone's concern.

The committee said the award was "for the right of all children to education."

## The Strength She's Shown

Malala is a high school student in Birmingham, England, which she moved to from Pakistan for medical treatment after she was shot. She was at school when the prize was announced and made the world wait until after school let out to give her comments.

"This is not the end. â€¦ I want to see every child going to school and getting an education," she said.

From age 11, Malala had fought a rule by the Taliban group banning education for girls. She wrote a blog pushing for girls' education and has also appeared on TV and in a documentary movie.

In October 2012, she was on a school bus in northwestern Pakistan. Taliban gunmen got on board, asked for her by name and opened fire. A bullet to the head nearly killed her.

Malala has impressed television audiences with her soft-spoken ideas of forgiveness and peace, and the strength she's shown. Her comments to the United Nations last year showed her hope for something better for girls. She said only one thing changed for her after the shooting: "Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born."

## "It Will Take Time"

Shahidullah Jan is an activist for the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. Jan said that Malala's campaign had helped girls get an education in Pakistan. Still, it had done little to change practices such as forced early marriages and honor killings in deeply traditional regions, Jan said.

"It will take time for the girls inspired by Malala to become educated and start speaking for their rights. It will take time to bring change, but she at least has started the process," Jan said.

For Malala, the life she escaped but which millions of others endure represents a prison.

"I didn't want my future to be just sitting in a room and be imprisoned in my four walls and just cooking and giving birth to children," she said in a BBC interview last year. "I didn't want to see my life in that way."
