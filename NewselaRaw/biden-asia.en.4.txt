BEIJING — China and Japan have been arguing for years over some tiny islands in the East China Sea. They are fighting about who owns the islands.

On Nov. 23, China set up a restricted flying zone over the islands. It said any planes that want to fly over the zone must first tell China their plans.

This made Japan nervous. The Japanese worry China is trying to take greater control of the region.

On Wednesday, China said the United States was taking Japan's side. The United States has refused to accept the zone.

## Biden Meets With China's President

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was in China on Wednesday. He was meeting with the country's leaders. But Biden did not publicly ask China to change its mind about the zone. He did not want to make demands that China was likely to ignore.

But he did hope to convince China's leaders not to do anything if planes fly through the zone. He also hoped to get China to agree not to set up similar zones over other territories.

Biden had a private meeting with President Xi Jinping. The meeting went a lot longer than scheduled. When he came out, Biden appeared serious and quiet. He spoke briefly with reporters. But he did not discuss details on differences over the restricted flying zone. Instead he spoke about major countries working together. U.S.-China relations depend on trust, he said.

Earlier Wednesday, Biden met with young Chinese. They were waiting to get travel papers processed at the U.S. Embassy. He urged them to challenge the way things are.

Neither Biden nor Xi talked publicly about the islands. But the China Daily said that Japan was trying to make China angry. It said Washington was ignoring this. China Daily is a newspaper run by the Chinese government.

## An Important Relationship

Biden spoke to reporters after his first talks with Xi. He said that the relationship between China and the United States will matter a lot in the current century. Anything can happen if the U.S. and China can get that relationship right, he said.

Biden said Xi was open and constructive. Openness leads to trust,  Biden said. "Trust is the basis on which real change — constructive change — is made."

The two leaders had a second meeting. More people were to be involved in that meeting.

Biden did not say anything public about U.S. concerns over China's new air defense zone.  But on Tuesday, Biden promised to talk about the concerns with Xi and other Chinese leaders.

China's move "increased the risk" that something bad could happen by accident. Biden said that Tuesday in Tokyo. He met there with Japanese President Shinzo Abe.

After meeting with Biden, Xi said the U.S.-China relationship had gotten off to a good start this year. But he said the situation in the world is changing. Tougher challenges and regional problems keep coming up, he said.

He also said that the United States and China carry important responsibilities for upholding peace.
