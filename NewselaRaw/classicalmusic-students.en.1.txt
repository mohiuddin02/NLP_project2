CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Sometimes, a cello or a violin can turn out to be life-changing. Justice Crawford and Nathaniel Nitkin are learning how these instruments can change their lives thanks to a school program.

Justice and Nathaniel are sixth-graders at Northwest School of the Arts. They came to the school from Winterfield Elementary, which has a long-running experiment sponsored by the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra. They are the first two students to leave the program and attend Northwest School of the Arts.

For the past six years, the CSO has taught after-school classes to kids in grades 2 through 5 at the school in east Charlotte, North Carolina. More than three-quarters of the students come from low-income homes.

## Music May Improve Behavior, Grades

Now, there is a full-time CSO staffer assigned to oversee school programs. The symphony is trying to determine whether this training also cuts down on absences and behavioral issues, and improves study habits and grades.

For Justice and Nathaniel, music enabled them to avoid middle schools their parents didn't want them to attend. It launched them on a path that will provide a lifetime of pleasure and — who knows? — maybe a job in the arts.

"I would love to see him go on to play in an orchestra someday," says Endora Crawford, Justice's mom. "Having him in a class where he flourishes, a class he enjoys — that makes the whole school day more attractive. That's the main thing right now."

"As he adds technical skills, he's showing more confidence all around," says Neil Nitkin, Nathaniel's dad. "He's better able to concentrate on what's in front of him, both the musical and nonmusical stuff. It makes a big difference."

## One Goal: Take Responsibility

That's the kind of talk Courtney Hollenbeck has hoped to hear since she founded her first music program at Winterfield in 2007. She was using a violin in a second-grade science class to help students understand pitch and volume when a student said, "It sounds like angels." That inspired her to start an orchestra. By the 2009-10 school year, she had personally bought 30 violins for beginners and asked the symphony for help.

The goals were simple but meaningful. The program wanted to teach kids to take responsibility for something of value, giving them a sense of ownership in the program. Students are allowed to take smaller instruments home to practice. The program also encourages cooperation by placing them among children they might not otherwise know. Students also learn practice habits that become valuable study habits in other subjects. Finally, the students are exposed to arts experiences they might not get any other way.

## Family Moves Affect Attendance

Attendance has fluctuated over the years. CSO director of education Chris Stonnell said, "Winterfield has a constantly changing population, and we struggle with that. Not a lot of kids go there for four straight years. This year, we're working with 82 to 84 students, (and) we have a school programs manager on our staff. We look at the musical component, but it's also about the community component. It's about getting parents who may never have come to the school before to participate in the process."

Until recently, music was something Justice and Nathaniel found on YouTube or a download, not something to play. Justice had never picked up a stringed instrument before coming to Winterfield two years ago. Nathaniel had not until he joined the music program a year before that.

## Finding A "Forever Instrument"

Students use the first year as an exploratory process to find a "forever instrument," as Hollenbeck calls it. Justice flirted with the clarinet and cello before selecting a violin. Nathaniel enjoyed the trumpet but decided on cello and violin.

"When I started, it actually looked easy, but I knew it would get tougher and tougher," says Nathaniel, whose eclectic tastes range from Elton John to country musician Alan Jackson to film scores. "Practicing is a pleasure: I'm always trying to get a song perfect, so I'm playing 15-20-25 minutes a day, plus working on my keyboard. It's a big step for me, going to a school where almost everything you do is (related to) the arts."

Justice recalls the wise saying of violin teacher Shinichi Suzuki: "Practice only on the days you eat." (In other words, daily.) He tries to stick by it and finds that this philosophy helps in other ways: "I didn't always do my homework as well as I should have, and now I know (better). I have started reading more, too, and I like it. What I have learned from music has gone over into my other classes."
