WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” The United States will give $70 million to help educate 200,000 adolescent girls in Pakistan.

First lady Michelle Obama made the announcement Thursday. She welcomed guests to the White House with the traditional Muslim  greeting of "asalaam alaikum," which means "peace be with you" in Arabic.  Obama said the money will help Pakistani girls "fulfill their promise" to become the next generation of doctors, teachers and businesswomen. The money will also help build more than a dozen schools, repair hundreds more, and provide job training and college scholarships.

"These girls are all of our girls," Obama said. "I have passion for this issue because I cannot look into the eyes of young women and not see myself and not see my own daughters, and not want the best for them."

## Pakistani Women Praise Michelle Obama

Obama was accompanied Thursday by the Pakistan prime minister's wife, Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif. His daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who praised the first lady's global effort to educate girls, also attended the announcement.

Maryam Nawaz Sharif said Obama has inspired millions of girls around the world. Her daughters, Malia and Sasha, "could not have a better role model," Sharif said.

At one point, Sharif joined hands with Obama. She said, "We shall see about making a difference and we shall not rest until every girl is learning and in school. We shall not rest until every mother is confident that her daughter will have a better life than what she had."

## Goal Is To Help 62 Million Girls Worldwide

The Muslim country, located next to India, recently promised to double spending on education. It also said that it will enroll more girls in school and provide more female teachers.

The first lady is leading an effort called Let Girls Learn. Its goal is to help more than 62 million teenage girls worldwide enroll and stay in school.

Obama said in the past eight months, the United States has received pledges of more than $800 million for the program. It includes $350 million from Japan and $200 million from South Korea. Another $200 million will come from a partnership with the United Kingdom.

## Educating Girls Helps Everyone

Susan Markham is with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), an agency of the U.S. government that works to end poverty worldwide. USAID is in charge of Let Girls Learn. Markham said girls are less likely to attend primary school than boys. They are also more likely to face difficulties in getting and completing an education. She said educating girls affects and benefits everyone.

Markham said empowering girls and making sure they have a quality education transforms their future. It helps their families, their communities and helps make Pakistan a richer, more prosperous country.

President Barack Obama and the first lady launched Let Girls Learn this year. They urged world leaders to join the effort. Since March, the first lady has traveled to Japan, Cambodia and the United Kingdom to promote the program.
