The rock formation in Yosemite National Park is considered so treacherous no one else has ever dared try to climb it.

The relief of the difficult, three-week journey up the Dawn Wall could be felt thousands of feet below on the Yosemite Valley floor. Hundreds of onlookers let out screams as Tommy Caldwell, 36, and Kevin Jorgeson, 30, pulled themselves over one final ledge just before 4 p.m.

"It has been such a part of our lives, I miss it already," Caldwell's father, Mike, said.

"I'm shaking," added Jorgeson's mother, Gaelena. She left Santa Rosa at 5 a.m. to reach Yosemite National Park in time to witness what is being described as the world's most difficult free climb ever. Although the climbers used only their hands and feet to ascend, they are attached to safety ropes in case of a fall.

## A Whirlwind Week

Gaelena almost didn't make the four-hour trip because she was afraid of getting behind the wheel of a car after a recent accident. The mother called the drive her own Dawn Wall ascent because "I had to overcome that fear."

It was just another event in a whirlwind week as the climbers gained international recognition for overcoming a seemingly impossible challenge.

It took the climbers six years to tackle the trek up a 3,000-foot vertical face of El Capitan.

The duo had failed in 2010 because of bad weather and in 2011 when Jorgeson suffered a broken ankle. Jorgeson fell on the first section Wednesday, slowing down their finish.

Their families and loved ones have shared in their journey, watching the men study, plan and train for the agonizing feat.

"I had a low-grade anxiety in my gut," Gaelena said. "Will he need to come back next year?"

## "The Next Level"

Jorgeson and Caldwell, of course, will keep returning to Yosemite because the granite rocks remain some of the world's prime climbing territory.

Caldwell has been scaling these rocks much of his life. His father began climbing here at 13. He recalled taking his son up one of El Capitan's 100 routes as a kid. The father called the latest feat "the next level in a video game."

This level brought rock climbing into the national consciousness with thousands following them online. It even led the White House to tweet out a picture of President Barack Obama posing for a picture in front of a painting of Yosemite saying, "You remind us that anything is possible."

Caldwell and Jorgeson began the journey Dec. 27 and have been spending their nights in tents suspended 1,200 feet above the valley floor. They have overcome battered and bloodied fingers, falls and mental exhaustion.

No one ever considered trying to scale that particular wall — which has little for a climber to grab on to — before Caldwell seven years ago. It is described by some as the world's most difficult free climb.

## Dawn's First Light

The Dawn Wall got its name because it catches the first morning sun rising over the Sierra. It was first climbed in 1970, but the climbers took bolts and ropes in what is known as an aided climb.

Wednesday's summit is just the latest memorable experience for Tommy Caldwell.

The plucky climber pushed an armed guard off a cliff to help his party escape after six days of captivity.

The four-person team was taken captive by Uzbekistan fighters and became an international story.

Later, Caldwell lost a finger in an accident but kept on climbing.

Caldwell, who grew up in the shadow of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, began climbing at age 3 with his dad. When he turned 17, he became a professional climber after winning a competition in Utah.

## "I'll Try That"

Jorgeson also showed a love of climbing as a child and trained at an indoor climbing gym in Santa Rosa, California. He is known as one of the world's top boulder climbers, tackling 400-foot-high rocks with enthusiasm and no ropes.

Caldwell and his wife, Rebecca Rodden, named their 20-month-old son Fitz after the famed Patagonian peak Mount Fitz Roy in Argentina. Last year, Caldwell and another climber reached the top of craggy Fitz Roy in four days.

Caldwell's climbing instinct is already rubbing off on the family's next generation. His 9-year-old nephew, Grant Van Nieuwenhuyzen, was asked about his own budding career while standing in El Capitan Meadows minutes before the finish.

Grant peered up at the rocky perches and exclaimed, "I'll try that."

Meanwhile, up above, Jorgeson was trying to put the moment into perspective.

"I hope it inspires people to find their own Dawn Wall, if you will," Jorgeson told The New York Times. "We've been working on this thing a long time, slowly and surely. I think everyone has their own secret Dawn Wall to complete one day, and maybe they can put this project in their own context."
