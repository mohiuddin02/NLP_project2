WICHITA, Kan. — Seth Ogden is 8 years old. He is colorblind. Seth can see some colors. Some colors he cannot see. It is hard for Seth to see some colors when they are close together. Seth was born this way. It is sometimes passed down from parents. Seth's mom and dad are not colorblind. His grandfather is.  

Seth picks out his clothes. It is hard. Sometimes they do not match. Sometimes he cannot see different colors of soccer shirts. Colors have different shades. There is fire engine red. There is cherry red. It could be hard for Seth to see the difference. 

## His Video Won A Contest

Seth and his mom made a video. It was for a contest. The prize was a pair of special glasses. The glasses can help people like Seth see color. 

Seth won. The EnChroma company sent him a free pair of color-correcting glasses. They cost hundreds of dollars. 

Seth tried them on. He went into his backyard. 

"Whoa," he said. The sun sparkled through tree branches. Everything looked gold.

His parents asked if the greens looked greener. A little bit, Seth said. He said that the sky looked a lot different, too. 

Seth walked over to a bush. He got excited. He saw berries on it that he had never seen before.

## New Colors In His Own Yard

Seth walked around looking at grass and bird feeders. He picked up a dead leaf. He saw speckles of red. He had not seen them before. The tree leaves looked less clumpy with the glasses, he said.

Seth's mom asked if he could see one color or another. Sometimes he said yes. Sometimes he said no. 

"What color is the umbrella?" his parents asked.

Seth said dark green. He took the glasses off. The umbrella still looked green. Seth realized he could see the color green better than red with or without the glasses. 

The glasses helped Seth see the difference between colors. The colors did not pop out as much as he thought they would.

His parents asked if he wished he was not colorblind to begin with.  

No, Seth said. Wearing the glasses was fun. Regular kids had always seen color. He was getting to see colors for the first time.
