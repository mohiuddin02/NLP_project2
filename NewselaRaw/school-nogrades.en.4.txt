ORLANDO, Fla. — Grades don't mean much to Lynn Barrett.

Lynn Barrett is a teacher in Florida. She has never given out grades. There are a lot of things grades can't tell about a student, she said.

"All that (it) tells you is a number," she said.

Grades don't really tell what students actually know.

Her students are in kindergarten, first and second grades. They help each other work on the iPad. They talk over tough ideas. There is no pressure to earn an A. They have no fear of getting an F.

Barrett teaches at Seminole Springs Elementary School. The school is in Florida. She is the only teacher in the school district who does't give grades.

Education experts say she is unusual. Most teachers grade their students.

## Doing Well In School

Students spend three years in her classroom. She gets to know them very well. She knows how they're doing without giving them a lot of tests.

Barrett takes a good, hard look while her students work. She watches them as they read. She watches them do math. And she can tell which students need more help.

John Fischetti is an education expert. Teachers who don't give out grades pay more attention to their students, he said.

It's unknown if students do better without grades.

Barrett's room has iPads, storybooks, fish tanks and snacks. It even has hula hoops.

Barrett's students do well in school. But because grades aren't important, they spend more time on what interests them. They don't have to worry about failing.

"Make mistakes — you're going to make mistakes," she said. If students make mistakes, they're going to learn more. They also won't make the same mistake next time.

Jennifer Zamfino has two children. They have both been in Barrett's class. When her daughter was in second grade she helped kindergartners.

"It brought her such confidence," Zamfino said.
