WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme Court said Thursday that no company or person can get patent rights over genes found in the human body. This decision could make it easier for scientists and businesses to do more genetic research.

Genes matter because they determine things like eye color and hair color. They can also determine whether you're at risk of a disease like diabetes or cancer.

All nine judges agreed on the decision. They said that nobody can get a patent on natural human genes. Patents give a person or company the right to be the only one who can make, use or sell something. The government normally gives patents to inventors for their creations.

The company involved in the case is Myriad Genetics, which does research on genes. The court decision said Myriad should not have been allowed to claim a patent on two genes found in the body. The patents involved the genes that indicate a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer.

Patients can get tested to see if they have the gene type related to the cancers. Having these patents helped Myriad earn big profits. Since no other company could screen for those genes, Myriad could charge a higher price for its test.

## Ruling Affects Gene Research

The ruling was mixed for businesses that use genes to make drugs and other treatments for diseases.

The court's statement that genes found naturally in the body could not be patented was bad for the businesses. But the court said there was a difference between genes found in the human body and those created in the lab. Patents may be given for genes that are made in labs and not found in nature.

Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion for the court.

Scientists who felt limited by Myriad's patents sued. Lawyer Sandra S. Park represented them.

"We are thrilled," Park said. "The question before the court was a simple one," but it affects lots of research in deep ways.

The ruling means that it will be easier for other companies to develop cancer-testing tools. Park said the ruling also could affect patents that have been issued for about 4,000 other genes.

The cost of genetic testing should fall because of the ruling, scientists said.

## Genes Made In Lab Can Be Patented

Myriad officials focused on the parts of the court's decision that it found favorable. The company stressed how the court agreed that genes made in a lab could still be patented. The scientific methods used in finding genes also can be patented.

About 22,000 genes make up the human genome. This is how traits are passed on from one generation to the next.  Genes must be removed from the body and isolated in order to be studied and used.

Myriad used tools to find the genes that make women more likely to have certain cancers. Scientists called these the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

The average American woman has a 12 percent risk of developing breast cancer. Women with abnormal BRCA face a risk as high as 85 percent. Actress Angelina Jolie tested positive for the BRCA genes. She recently decided to have an operation to remove both breasts. The operation will greatly reduce her risk of the cancers.

Myriad has been able to charge about $3,300 for its tests for breast cancer. The company said that insurance pays for the tests for most patients. The patents made it hard for other scientists to work with the genes.

## Finding A Balance

Lawyer Vernon Winters said that the court's decision has limits. Scientists can still try to get patents. They can get them for specific ways of working with genes.

Attorney Barbara Rudolph said that it was "hard to predict" how the decision will affect companies and inventors. Patents encourage people to invent, but they can also be a roadblock to more research. The court wanted to try to find balance between the two sides.

Justice Antonin Scalia's one-paragraph opinion showed how scientifically complicated the case was. He noted the "fine details of molecular biology" in the court's decision.

Scalia said he didn't have enough knowledge of his own about those details to say if they were true.
