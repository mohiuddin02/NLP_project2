LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Los Angeles is now the official U.S. candidate in the competition to become host city for the 2024 Olympic Games. Being selected was a dramatic turnaround for Los Angeles. Just two months ago the city was considered out of the running.

The tide began to turn in L.A.'s favor after Boston dropped out of the race because of fears there that hosting the games would be too expensive. On Tuesday, the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) named Los Angeles as the U.S. candidate. The city's leaders were left feeling inspired and destined to win.

"This is a quest that Los Angeles was made for," Mayor Eric Garcetti said. "This city is the world's greatest stage."

## L.A. Is Fifth City In Pursuit Of 2024 Games

Los Angeles was home to the Olympics in 1932 and 1984. Garcetti promised that if picked this time, the city would stage games that are both spectacular and profitable.

"I want to thank Los Angeles for standing up, once again, as America's bid city," said Scott Blackmun, the USOC's chief executive.

The city's selection marks the start of a two-year international competition. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will pick the host city in September 2017. So far Rome, Paris, Hamburg, Germany, and Budapest, Hungary, are also in pursuit of the 2024 Games.

"The focus needs to be on convincing the 55 or so IOC members that Los Angeles is the best city to host the Olympics. That process starts immediately," USOC Chairman Larry Probst told reporters.

"We are in this to win it, and I think we will," said Councilman Paul Krekorian. However, he added, it cannot be done in a way that would leave the government — and therefore taxpayers — saddled with out-of-control expenses.

## For Host Cities, Critics Say Olympic Costs Exceed Benefits

Over the years, hosting the Olympics has frequently cost far more than expected. In addition, studies have questioned whether host cities benefit economically. Cities often argue that hosting the Olympics brings in jobs and spending by tourists. In reality, the costs of building stadiums and hosting the Olympics often exceed the benefits. Russia has been struggling with costs from the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which have been called the most expensive Olympics of all time.

Los Angeles's 2024 plan outlines more than $6 billion in spending. Some of the costs would be paid by the government and some by private companies. The plan calls for staging events from volleyball on Santa Monica Beach, where the sport was invented, to mountain biking in Griffith Park. As was the case in 1932 and 1984, the Memorial Coliseum would serve as the centerpiece of the games.

Many details of the Los Angeles plan remain vague, however.

The plan calls for building a $1 billion athletes village to house the players during the games. Much of its cost would be paid by a private builder, which would take over the site after the games are over. However, it is still unclear which company would take on the job or how a company would be selected. Some fear building the village could cause the city to significantly exceed the planned costs of staging the games.

## L.A. Olympic Finances Remain Unclear

Experts say there is still not enough information to determine whether the money the city proposes spending would be enough. At this point it is unclear how risky it would be to the city's finances if Los Angeles committed to hosting the games.

The IOC had set a Sept. 15 deadline for any other cities that might want to enter the race to play host to the 2024 Games.
