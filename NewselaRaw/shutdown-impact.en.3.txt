WASHINGTON — Some Americans might not even notice that the government won't be completely open on Tuesday. But, many government workers and average Americans are likely to be affected.

About 800,000 people who work for the government won't be able to work when the government shuts down. Those workers will not be paid until Congress agrees on a budget.

On Monday night the House and Senate were unable to agree on a plan to temporarily pay for the work of the government. The nation now faces a changed scene. Some of the services immediately affected are largely invisible, but are still important.

The State Department, for example, will have to stop giving out some passports. People need passports to travel to other countries. This might threaten their travel plans.

## Planes Will Fly, Trains Will Run

Most of the Treasury Department's law enforcement will be halted. This may interrupt efforts to crack down on crimes involving money.

But the Department of Transportation said that all air traffic control services will continue. That's good news for people flying. Amtrak doesn't expect disruption of passenger railroad service, either.

Still, nearly a third of the Transportation Department's workforce will stop working; 18,481 of the agency's 55,468 workers, according to the department. Its job of looking into accidents and hazardous materials will continue.

A shutdown won't affect the military immediately. Soldiers will get paid. But they might face delays in receiving that pay if the shutdown lasts for long.

The Defense Department can also keep operating. Its emergency police, fire and medical services will continue. But, training of defense workers will stop.

## Tough Civics Lesson For Some Eighth-Graders

People who served in the military will still receive medical help at veterans hospitals. But veterans may not be able to get help over the phone.

The Department of Homeland Security plans to idle more than 30,000 of its 230,000 workers. But much of the physical work on the U.S-Mexico and U.S.-Canada borders will remain unchanged. Border Patrol, Customs and airport security agents are seen as important to the safety of the country.

Museums and national parks nationwide will close or operate with just a few people. For a class of eighth-graders from Illinois, visiting the nation's capital meant months of fundraising. The shutdown will provide a tough lesson in how the government works, and doesn't.

"It's a shame because the teachers at their school put an enormous amount of effort into planning and organizing this," said Cindy Hunter, a parent. "I feel so sorry for them."

## What's Closed, What's Open

Here's how the shutdown will affect some government services:

— All Social Security check to retired people will continue.

— The Medicare program will continue uninterrupted. However, if the shutdown lasts more than a month, there might be problems. A shutdown also will not affect the launch on Tuesday of the Affordable Care Act. It's the new health program also called Obamacare.

— The Internal Revenue Service will continue to collect taxes. But tax refunds won't be sent out.

— Most federal education spending and aid for college students will be unaffected. But some Head Start programs affecting about 19,000 children may face money problems. Head Start is a preschool program for children from poor families.

— Post offices will be open as usual.

— Most of NASA will be shut temporarily, President Barack Obama said Monday. Space agency workers who support the astronauts orbiting the Earth in the space station will keep working.

— The arts will take a hit. Closures will include the Smithsonian Institution's 19 museums and the National Zoo in Washington.

## Lady Liberty, Museums, Liberty Bell Shut

The National Mall, often called the nation's front lawn, will be closed to tourists. The National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of the American Indian and National Gallery of Art will be shuttered.

Tours of the U.S. Capitol will not be allowed unless conducted by members of Congress.

The Statue of Liberty in New York is one of 401 national parks that will also close. Philadelphia's Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell will also shut down. At Yellowstone National Park, guests in hotels and campgrounds will have 48 hours to leave.

A worker at Yellowstone said that the park was receiving many phone calls from worried people. They had booked trips there and could have their vacations ruined. One call came from a man whose wedding and honeymoon are planned for the park.

"A wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He was kind of frantic," said the worker, who was telling callers to simply stay tuned.
