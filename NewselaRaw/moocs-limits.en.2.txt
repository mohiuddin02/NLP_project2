PHILADELPHIA — The University of Pennsylvania is at the leading edge of a movement to experiment with free open online courses. But the undertaking, as its own researchers are finding out, has yielded mixed results.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have attracted millions of viewers. They've been promoted as a possible way to address skyrocketing education costs. Yet, very few of their viewers — 4 percent on average — actually complete the courses, according to the new Penn study.

Many who register drop off after the first week or two, the researchers found. About half who registered viewed at least one lecture.

The results come on the heels of another Penn study, released last month, that showed a vast majority of students enrolled in MOOCs already hold college degrees. Most people are taking the courses mainly to advance in their jobs. This calls into question the notion that the courses were making degrees available to people who have little money.

## Focus On Job Skills

"The technology offers some promise of a new approach to addressing both" costs and availability of education, said Laura Perna, a lead researcher on the new study. "We just don't know to what extent this is going to be more than a promise."

The researchers looked at 1 million users who registered for the 16 free courses offered from June 2012 to June 2013. Among the classes were ones on calculus, Greek and Roman mythology, and the science of drugs. The classes were taught by Penn professors and offered in partnership with an online education company.

The study looked into when users enter and leave courses, and when and how they participate. The courses varied in how quizzes, homework and instruction time were used. Completion rates were slightly higher in courses with smaller workloads.

Most courses focused on personal enrichment or job skills. One such class is "Cardiac Arrest, Resuscitation Science, and Hypothermia." That class teaches how to save someone who is having a heart attack.

Perna said she was a bit surprised by the results.

"Four percent is low. I didn't expect it to be quite this low," she said.

## Got Something Out Of It

But Ed Rock, who heads up Penn's MOOC program, disagrees. He called the findings "entirely unsurprising and not at all troubling. Four or five percent of 1.6 million (current users) is still 80,000 people, and 80,000 people is a huge number to educate."

Rock also said those who did not complete the courses had gotten something from the experience.

The majority of MOOC users are doing it for leisure learning or job development. So, it's not surprising that few finish, said Cathy Sandeen of the American Council on Education.

She says there is a place for MOOCs to help people earn degrees, but it's probably smaller than originally thought.

Rock acknowledged that educators have a way to go in learning how best to fit MOOCs into the educational mission. So, Penn has partnered with 10 high schools. Teachers in those schools are using Penn's calculus course in addition to classroom learning.

"Our hope is our material will be of value. We won't know that unless (high school teachers) try it out and tell us," he said. "We believe these materials have the potential to revolutionize education, but they're only going to work in a partnership."

Perna agreed that MOOCs could benefit society. She mentioned the case of a neighbor who is taking a MOOC with co-workers. Each week they meet to discuss what they've learned.

"I think there is something there," she said, "but we need to understand better what that contribution is."
