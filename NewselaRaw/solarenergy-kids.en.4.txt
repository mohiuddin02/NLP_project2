WINTER GARDEN, Fla. â€” A group of Tildenville fourth- and fifth-graders crowded around. There were about 25 of them. In the middle of the group was Thomas Dillen. He is a student at Valencia College.

Dillen held a machine up over his head. The sun was setting. He was trying to catch the sunlight. The students watched.

A small light on Dillen's machine lit up. All at once, the students cheered.

The machine is called a solar generator. It captures the light of the sun and turns it into electricity. Dillen was teaching the kids at Tildenville how to build the generators.

Imagine you are lost in the desert and your phone runs out of battery power. If you have a solar generator, you can charge your phone and call for help.

## What's In A Solar Suitcase?

The class is not just about fun. The students will give the generators they build to communities in Africa that do not have electricity.

The program was started by Deb Hall. She is a professor at Valencia College. Hall teaches classes about electricity. Electricity is needed to power lights, washing machines, televisions and many other machines. Hall teaches students how these machines work, and how electricity is made and used.

In 2009, Hall met with a company called We Care Solar. The company designs "solar suitcases." Solar suitcases are generators that are small enough that a person can carry one.

These generators can bring electricity to areas that do not have it. We Care Solar gives its solar suitcases to hospitals that do not have electric lights. Doctors in these hospitals have to work by candlelight. Without lights their jobs are very difficult.

## Exciting After-School Project

Hall was excited by the solar suitcases. She wanted to show them to her college students. Having her students learn to build the generators could be educational and could also help the world, she thought.

She and her students soon built five solar suitcases. When they were complete, four were sent to Haiti, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Kenya. Hall kept one to use in demonstrations.

Then, about three years ago, Hall began visiting Tildenville Elementary School. She wanted to teach young kids about science and technology. So, she and a group of her students started giving presentations to a fifth-grade science class.

One day, she brought along a solar suitcase. The school thought it would be a good project for after-school students.

## Kids Learn, Build And Help

We Care Solar agreed. Tildenville kids would build the generators, and college students like Dillen would help out. The company would then inspect the machines before they were sent to Uganda.

The program teaches students about electricity and teamwork. Students also learn about people in other countries who have less than them.

Ariana Gonzalez, age 9, learned about what life was like for people in the poorest parts of the world. Some of what she learned made her sad.

"In Uganda, in some orphanages, they don't have any light at all," she said. "They have only one little candle, and it doesn't light up the whole room."
