When Audrey Dimitrew won a spot on a club volleyball team in Chantilly, Virginia, the 16-year-old hoped to impress varsity coaches and possibly college coaches.

But when the coach benched her and the league told her she could not join another team, the action shifted from one court to another — she and her family sued.

Audrey said she could miss a pivotal season this spring and feels that a large, controlling league has lost sight of its primary mission: encouraging kids to play sports. The league has said that Audrey is disgruntled with her playing time and that transferring her to another team would create a flood of similar requests.

## The High Cost Of Competing

In recent years, families have increasingly turned to the courtrooms to resolve youth sports disputes. Parents upset that their children have been cut, benched, yelled at by coaches or even fouled too hard are asking judges to referee.

Some experts see such lawsuits as part of a shift in youth sports in recent decades away from sandlot play and intramural teams to professionalized leagues and tryout teams. These types of teams are partly aimed at snagging scholarships for players and giving them a leg up in college admissions.

Parents are spending thousands of dollars and giving up countless weekends so kids can participate on travel teams and prestigious high school programs.

Susan Dimitrew estimates the family will spend $6,000 on her daughter's volleyball this year.

Club teams require substantial investment for coaches, gear and more. Project Play, a group trying to get more kids involved in sports, estimates the average travel team parent is spending about $2,300 a year, while those of the most elite players lay out $20,000 a year or more.

Experts say parents want proof that their investment is paying off. Some are willing to sue if they don't get it.

## No Team Hopping

Audrey said she is not sure whether she will play in college, but the Dimitrews think the spring season of 10th grade is a very important one for getting exposure to coaches who can elevate her game.

Audrey said the lawsuit is not about money or future prospects for her. Amid Advanced Placement (AP) classes and drama productions, volleyball has been a refuge since she followed her older sister onto the court in sixth grade.

She cannot understand why her league, the Chesapeake Region Volleyball Association (CHRVA), won't let her join another team.

## Contract Was Signed

The dispute began after Audrey and about 75 other girls competed for spots on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors in November. The coach told Audrey she was the best setter at the tryout and would get playing time, according to court documents.

Audrey got an offer to join Chantilly as well as three other teams she tried out for. She selected the Juniors and signed a contract with the team — something common among youth travel teams today.

Audrey got practice and scrimmage play with her team, but was benched for the first two tournaments in mid-January.

The coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team and would not play much for the rest of the season, even though she had "college level" skills, according to court documents. The family was disappointed, perplexed and felt they had not been given what they were promised after a significant investment.

"She is devastated," Susan Dimitrew wrote to the coach about Audrey. "It is important that she plays, and plays the position you offered her of setter as that is the position she plays in high school."

## Lawsuits Are Becoming More Common

The coach gave Audrey two options: She could be a practice player for the Juniors or transfer to another team in the league. She chose the latter option, and her parents found a team willing to take her.

But the league has to approve such moves and it said moving would set a bad example. According to league bylaws, players can switch teams only if they demonstrate a "verifiable hardship," a rule that was not spelled out in the contract Audrey signed.

The Dimitrews argue that Audrey's case applies, but league officials disagree. They said that if play time was enough of a reason to switch teams, there would be too many similar requests.

After appeals failed, the Dimitrews filed the lawsuit in mid-March. Many other parents of club athletes have filed lawsuits as well.

## The Sports Moment Has Arrived

Tom Farrey, the executive director of Project Play, said this moment in youth sports has been building for years. Youth sports have become increasingly competitive, particularly in wealthy suburbs.

Some parents are blowing the whistle. A 2014 ESPN Project Play poll found around 70 percent of parents thought youth sports were too expensive and time-consuming and placed too much emphasis on winning over having fun.

On a recent morning, Audrey and her attorney sat in a courtroom across from lawyers for CHRVA and the Chantilly Juniors. With the season quickly slipping away, the family asked for an injunction, a pause in the legal process so Audrey could play the rest of the season with a new team.

The attorneys spent nearly three hours debating the league's rules and how much Audrey would suffer by missing games.

Fairfax County Judge John Tran was sympathetic to Audrey's situation, saying he was "unhappy ... that a child is not given an opportunity to play."

But he said the law did not allow him to participate in the decision-making process of a private organization. He declined to issue a temporary injunction.

The ruling effectively meant Audrey would not play this season, but Susan Dimitrew said the fight will continue.

"I never imagined in my wildest dreams there would be a lawsuit over this," she said. "But I think it's the right thing to do."
