CLEVELAND â€” Roz Quarto decided to pick up and move to Cleveland two years ago because she thought it seemed like a nice place.

She made her decision long before basketball star LeBron James decided to do the same. He announced last week that "bringing one trophy back to northeast Ohio" for the Cleveland Cavaliers is his new priority.

Friends in Quarto's hometown of New York City all reacted the same way.

"They said, 'Cleveland, as in, Ohio?'" Quarto said while sitting on a bustling patio surrounded by blooming flower boxes in the city's Ohio City neighborhood.

Now, she and her partner own a big yellow house not far from Ohio City. The neighborhood was recently named by USA Today as a top place for nightlife.

When friends from New York come to visit, Quarto says, they get it.

Her partner's boss, who lives in Alaska, even purchased a second home in Cleveland.

## Sports, Politics Lead The Way

Three things have put Cleveland in the spotlight in recent days. James decided to move back to his hometown Cavaliers. Then college quarterback Johnny Manziel signed with the NFL's Cleveland Browns. Finally, the Republican Party picked the city for its 2016 national convention. The convention is a meeting of Republicans to nominate members of the party to run for president and vice president.

Locals say all of it is simply proof that Cleveland is coming back.

"The GOP and LeBron are going to grease the skids on a process that's already started," said Richey Piiparinen. He researches population changes at Cleveland State University. "People are realizing it's not your grandpa's Rust Belt anymore." Piiparinen was using the term for the northeastern and central states that used to have a lot of factories.

## Are Changes Helping Everyone?

Changes are already evident in the city.

New construction is booming. Hammers and drills sound at all hours on the Flats East Bank. The area used to be popular, but fell into disarray a decade ago. Now it is coming back.

Downtown, a new convention center just opened. Developers also are rushing to build hotels and luxury condos to keep up with demand. Ohio's first casino opened downtown in 2012. Meanwhile, restaurants are opening where you can get entrees such as frog legs and rabbit pie.

To be sure, Cleveland still has its problems. There is a lot of poverty. Half of the city's children lived in poverty in 2012, a rate second only to that of Detroit, according to the National Center for Children in Poverty. The years of people leaving the city have also led to neighborhoods of vacant homes.

"It's still same old, same old here," said Vickie Williams. She works downtown and has seen the changes there, but says that no boom has trickled into her neighborhood. People there still beg for money outside the Dollar General and tall weeds grow in empty lots where houses once stood.

## Homecomings All Around

Still, Cuyahoga County saw more people move from Brooklyn and Chicago between 2007 and 2011 than it sent to those places, Piiparinen said. Although the Cleveland area lost population between 2006 and 2012, it added 40,000 people with college degrees during that period. Also, the number of educated 25- to 34-year-olds grew 68 percent, according to Piiparinen's research.

Many young people fled Cleveland and other Rust Belt cities in the 2000s for places such as Chicago, San Francisco and New York, Piiparinen said. But as those cities became more crowded, costs began rising and many people were priced out. Now, he said, people are moving home. They are coming back not just to Cleveland, but to Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Buffalo, New York, as well.

"It's what we call 'big fish, small pond' talent migration. Are you going to get lost in the shuffle of New York City, or are you going to come back and make a huge difference in your community?" Piiparinen said.

## Stop In, Look Around, Stay

Roz Quarto was motivated to move to Cleveland in part by the high cost of living in the New York metro area. She feared she and her partner would never earn enough money there.

On a road trip from Alaska to New York, Quarto and her partner, Gail L. Palmer, stopped in Cleveland and intended to stay three days. They stayed for 10. It wasn't long before they decided to try living here.

"We figured we'd see if we liked it, and sign a year lease," Quarto said. "Then we fell deeper and deeper in love with the city."

In late 2010, developers announced that the Flats East Bank project received the funding to begin building. In January 2011, the city broke ground on a $465 million medical mart and convention center.

Something about Cleveland was beginning to lure back young people. Like LeBron, they just needed some time elsewhere before they returned.

"The first inclination that college-age kids in Cleveland used to have was to flee," said Adam Fishman. He works at Fairmount Properties, which is developing the Flats. "Somehow that has now changed."
