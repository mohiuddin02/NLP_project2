His dad told him to "Google it."

So Shubham did. With a few Internet searches he learned about Braille, the writing system used by the blind. Braille is printed with raised dots on paper, which blind people can read with their fingers. He also learned about Braille printers, which, to the middle schooler's shock, cost thousands of dollars.

## Let's See What We Can Build

Using pieces from a Lego set, Shubham created a cheap Braille printer for his school science fair. Today, Shubham is the founder of a company, Braigo Labs. It aims to be the first manufacturer of low-cost, portable Braille printers.

"It was curiosity," explained Shubham, now 13 and an eighth-grader at Champion School in San Jose, California. "I'm always thinking up something. If you think it can be done, then it can probably be done."

Because of his printer, Shubham has been invited to the White House and received many awards. He has become the world's youngest owner of a tech startup company to receive venture capital funding. It is money given to new technology companies to get them started.

The money came from Intel, one of the worlds largest makers of computer chips. On Tuesday it announced that it was investing in Shubham's company.

## A Growing Family Business

Braigo has become a family business. His mom, Malini Banerjee, is the president. His dad, Neil Banerjee, who works for Intel, is on the company's board of directors. He also drives Shubham around and accompanies him to press events, interviews and business meetings.

The money from Intel will allow Braigo to hire engineers and product designers, so that Shubham can concentrate on school.

Intel will not say how much money it is giving Shubham's company.

"It's a classic Silicon Valley story, isn't it?" said Neil Banerjee. Silicon Valley is a nickname for an area in Northern California where many high-tech companies like Apple and Google are located. "Everyone else started in a garage, but (Shubham) started at the kitchen table."

The money from Intel also earns Shubham a place in history. He broke the record for the world's youngest tech company owner to receive venture capital. He is two years younger than Nick D'Aloisio was when D'Aloisio received money for his startup Summly. Yahoo reportedly later bought Summly, a news reading app, for $30 million.

## Now More People Can Afford A Printer

Organizations for the blind welcome an affordable Braille printer. They say the printer could make literature and news more available to blind people. It would also increase the number of people who can read Braille. Only about 8.5 percent of the 60,000 blind schoolchildren in the country can read Braille, according to the American Printing House for the Blind.

"There is absolutely a need," said Gary Mudd, a spokesman for the Printing House for the Blind. "Being blind is sometimes very expensive."

Braille printers start at about $2,000 for a person. They cost at least $10,000 for schools and businesses. Braigo plans to sell its printer for around $350.

"We had no idea that someone could reinvent a Braille printer and bring the cost down" by so much, said Mike Bell, who runs Intel's New Devices Group. Bell said that Shubham's printer could really help a lot of people."

## The Experience Of Creating

Possibly the biggest challenge facing Braigo is whether it can get enough customers. The National Federation of the Blind estimates that fewer than 10 percent of blind people can read Braille. Some experts say the demand for Braille printers will drop as more advanced technology is available. Already, smartphones are equipped with electronic Braille screens and apps that can read text out loud.

"The number of potential sales are quite limited because there aren't that many people who read Braille," said Ike Presley. He is with the American Foundation for the Blind. Presley said he doesn't know if people will really need many hard copies of written material in Braille in five or 10 years.

In five to 10 years, Shubham will be in college. There is no way of knowing whether or not his company will survive. However, his parents will almost certainly treasure the experience of creating it.

His mother tells how Shubham would stay up until 2 a.m. working on his invention. She would urge him to give it up and go to bed.

"He would keep building and breaking things and I would get so discouraged, asking why is he wasting his time?" she said.

But now she tells every mom, "Believe in your child."
