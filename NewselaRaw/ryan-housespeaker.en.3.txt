WASHINGTON, D.C. - Paul D. Ryan was elected speaker of the House of Representatives Thursday. The speaker is the leader of the House.

The House, along with the Senate, make up Congress. The two chambers of Congress make laws in the United States.

After he was elected, Ryan immediately said the House was "broken" and needed to be fixed.

Ryan is a member of the Republican Party. The other main political group in the United States is the Democratic Party. Democrats usually do not agree with Republicans. President Barack Obama is a Democrat.

## "We Are Adding" To Problems, Ryan Says

Ryan was speaking about problems within the Republican Party. Conservative members of the Republican Party have very different ideas about how the government should be run than other Republicans. Conservatives are more old-fashioned and traditional.

Those disagreements drove out former Speaker John A. Boehner. He was a more mainstream Republican, and not as conservative. Boehner announced in September that he would quit his job in Congress. Ryan pleased conservatives by promising to let all Republicans have a say in writing laws.

"We are not solving problems. We are adding to them," Ryan said in a speech after his election Thursday. He said he did not want to blame anyone for the problems of the past and wanted a new start. Ryan added that he wants to make changes so that the Republicans can come together.

## Most Republicans Voted For Ryan

There is evidence that this could work and that Ryan might help unite the Republicans.

Ryan got 236 votes Thursday. Only nine Republicans did not vote for him. They voted instead for Representative Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida who is more conservative than Ryan.

Right now the Republicans lead the House because they have the most representatives. They have more representatives because more Americans voted for them in elections.

## Ryan Calls For Unity

Democrats have their own leader in the House. Their leader just has less power and is called the Minority Leader.

All but three Democrats voted in support of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House.

Following the vote, Ryan made a speech calling for unity among Republicans, and with the Democrats.

"Let's pray for each other, Republicans for Democrats, and Democrats for Republicans," he said. "Pray for a deeper understanding."

## Ryan Is The Youngest Speaker In Almost 150 Years

Ryan has paid attention to the demands of conservatives members of the Republican Party, who felt ignored by Boehner.

"We have nothing to fear from honest differences honestly stated," Ryan added. "If you have ideas, let's hear them."

Ryan, who is 45, is the youngest speaker elected since 1869. He took the oath of office from Democratic Representative John Conyers of Michigan, who is 86. Conyers is the longest-serving member of the House. During the oath, Ryan promised to follow the United States Constitution.

Looking on was Ryan's wife, Janna, and their three children. Kansas Governor Sam Brownback also attended the ceremony.

## It Won't Be Easy

Brownback said Ryan has an important job. He has the power to help decide what problems the next president would work on, if a Republican wins.

Ryan will not have an easy time as speaker. Conservatives have threatened to shut down the government if they can get enough votes from other lawmakers in Congress. They do not want government money going to groups they oppose. During a shutdown, the government does not have the money to run as usual. Some government services like parks could be closed, but some very important government services would continue as usual.

Ryan has until December 11 to get enough votes to give the government the money it needs. The government has only enough money to keep running until then.

## A Brighter Future

Representative Kevin McCarthy is a Republican from California. He said Ryan would be able to meet the challenges. "The future looks brighter," he said.

The Republican lawmakers are more united, McCarthy said, "and when we're united, we can accomplish big things."
