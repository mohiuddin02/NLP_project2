WASHINGTON â€” Jay-Z and Beyonce's trip to Cuba four weeks ago got people talking. Americans are not allowed to freely visit the island. But now more people are interested in going there on a cultural tour.

Insight Cuba says its bookings are way up since the couple's April tour. Insight Cuba is the first and largest Cuba tour group.

"It's had a huge impact. Everything from our call center to our website to our blog to our Facebook page just lit up," said Tom Popper. He's the president of Insight Cuba. "People were Googling it and curious."

The rapper/singer celebrity couple are making a growing travel sensation even more popular. There is demand to visit Cuba. It's an exotic land that's changed little in years. It lies just 93 miles from the Florida coast. Yet few Americans have ever reached its shores.

## Tight Restrictions On Travel

The two countries have been at odds for a long time since Cuba had a revolution. Americans are not allowed to do business with Cuba. That makes visiting Cuba really hard. Americans may travel to Cuba. The rules don't make it easy though. Going without the proper permissions can run the risk of a huge fine. The rules are less strict for Cuban-Americans.

Roughly 400,000 Cuban-Americans went to Cuba last year. President Barack Obama changed a rule in 2009. Unlimited visits to family members are now allowed.

Cultural tours of Cuba for groups were allowed in 2011. But they must be licensed by the U.S. government. The idea was to let Americans meet Cubans. The hope was that closer relations would bring more democracy to the Caribbean nation.

Jay-Z and Beyonce's high-profile adventure was criticized by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and other Cuban-American leaders. But others in Congress want to make it easier for Americans to visit Cuba.

About 90,000 Americans made these "people-to-people" visits last year. That's up slightly over previous years. Insight Cuba expects 5,000 more customers this year. In 2012, it had 3,000.

## No Day At The Beach

But the rules are strict for these tours. That includes the three-day one taken by Beyonce and Jay-Z. Rubio and others demanded these tours stick to serious activities. These must include visits to senior centers, schools and artist studios.

It's no day at the beach.

Beyonce and Jay-Z celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary on the trip. They reportedly stuck to the plan of the tour. They visited a school, a children's theater group and a jazz club. The pair also met with Cuban musicians.

Rubio and people who support the ban say these trips give money to the Cuban government. The government restricts the Cuban people's freedom. That's why Rubio and others even want to limit family visits to the island.

Putting together tours is now more difficult. "Every day has to be chock-full of approved activities, pretty much from 9 to 5," Popper said.

"Not everybody wants to travel that way," he admitted.

## Making Travel Easier

But, Popper said, Beyonce and Jay-Z's trip helped Cuban travel. It made Americans aware that they can visit Cuba legally.

Fifty-nine Democrats in the U.S. House want to make travel to Cuba easier. They wrote Obama in April and urged him to let people go to Cuba on their own without prior approval. Visitors could book their trip through a special airline, as Cuban-Americans do now. They'd sign a statement proving they have a good reason to go.

The White House has not responded. It has been slow to make more changes in policy. That's until Cuba releases Alan Gross, of Maryland. He was jailed there in December 2009. He allegedly brought satellite-communications equipment to the island.

But some people hope changes in Cuba will further loosen U.S. travel rules. Such changes include a new rule that allows Cubans to leave the island without asking first.

"The Cuban government remains repressive. They have serious human rights issues," said U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, after returning from Havana in April. But, she said, "We need to try something new."
