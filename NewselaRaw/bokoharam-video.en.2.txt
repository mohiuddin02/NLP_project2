JOHANNESBURG â€” In Nigeria, parents of more than 200 kidnapped girls desperately scanned a video on Tuesday. They were searching for the faces of their daughters, who had been [kidnapped at school](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian+schoolgirls).

The video was released by the kidnappers, an Islamic terrorist group called Boko Haram.

While one mother recognized her daughter, many others did not.

Newspapers say U.S. planes began flying missions over northeastern Nigeria trying to find the girls. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan asked the government to extend a state of emergency in the area.

Nigeria has been grappling for years without success with Boko Haram. The group, whose name translates to "Western education is a sin," seeks to force strict Islamic laws on the country's northeast side.

## Who Are They Really?

Nigerian media reported that some parents raised doubts about the video released by the kidnappers on Monday. They said that some of those pictured in long dark hijabs didn't look like teenage students. They looked more like adults in their 30s and 40s.

Mallam Zannah Chibok told a Nigerian newspaper that he could not identify his kidnapped daughters in the video, which appears to show just over 100 girls. The newspaper talked to several other parents who also did not see their children on the video.

Dumoma Mpur is the head of the parent-teachers association of the school where the girls were kidnapped. Mpur told another newspaper that one mother recognized her child.

The girls were shown praying in the video. Two said they had converted to Islam from Christianity.

## Talk Of A Prisoner Exchange

In the video, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said he was willing to make a deal. He would release some of the girls in exchange for the release of Boko Haram members in Nigerian prisons.

The Nigerian government has said it will do everything necessary to free the girls. Still, it did not say whether it would be willing to organize a prisoner exchange with the group, which is designated a terror organization by the U.S. government.

Parents of the girls have complained that Nigerian security forces didn't act on their reports. Some parents tried to identify the location where the gunmen were holding the girls in the days after the April 14 kidnapping.

It took weeks for Jonathan to respond to the abduction. He only spoke out after an international Twitter campaign started, asking him to "#BringBackOurGirls." The campaign had been supported by President Barack Obama, his wife, Michelle, and celebrities such as Mia Farrow and Angelina Jolie.

## Retaliation May Not End

Some argue that a prisoner exchange would only encourage further abductions. But it would be difficult for security forces to rescue the prisoners without risking a lot of deaths, leaving Jonathan's government in an awkward position.

In the video, Shekau said he carried out the kidnappings in retaliation for the imprisonment of Boko Haram members and the imprisonment of women and children associated with the group. He said the terrorist group was holding many other people but gave no number.

"There are some of my brethren who have spent five complete years without seeing their wives, without seeing their children. For God's sake, even for ensuring their release, will I not kidnap? After all God says I should kidnap," Shekau said in the video.

Shekau said that he would sell the girls into slavery unless they converted to Islam. He said they would not be released until the Boko Haram prisoners were also released.
