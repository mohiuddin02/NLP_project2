SOCHI, Russia — Seventeen years of teamwork paid off for two American ice skaters. They danced on Monday night at the Iceberg Skating Palace in Sochi, Russia.

Seventeen years ago, an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old were thrown together as an ice dance team. Charlie White was irritated to be paired with Meryl Davis. He was the younger of the two, but had already had been skating for six months. Davis was just starting. With her as a partner, he was back to dance Square One while she caught up — quickly.

Seventeen years led to a physically and mentally demanding free dance. The dance left them looking as if they had spent 17 years of energy on four minutes of skating. When it was over, they were unable to do anything but fall into each other's arms.

They waited 17 years for the moment when the scores were announced. Seventeen years until two kids from Michigan realized all that work and time together was worth it. They became the first U.S. skating couple to win an Olympic gold medal.

"You dream of the opportunity," White said.

"We prepared ourselves so well for what we wanted to put onto the ice and focused so hard on that, we weren't really prepared for what might happen," Davis said.

## Thousand And One Arabian Nights

Davis and White needed an unstoppable effort to beat the 2010 Olympic champions. They were two Canadians, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. The Canadian and American pairs were fierce competitors. The pairs also became friends during the 10 years they trained together under the same coaches in Michigan.

Virtue and Moir had been the first North American ice dancers to win Olympic gold. Both couples had become so good they would lose only to the other in the four years beginning with the Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. In those 2010 games, Davis and White were the silver medalists.

"We're linked forever," White said.

But he and Davis have separated themselves from the Canadians in the judges' eyes. The two Americans skated to music from "Scheherazade." The ballet is based on the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. In the story, a woman named Scheherazade must tell 1,001 stories to the sultan. If he gets bored, she will be killed.

Davis and White won both the short and free dances with season bests. Their total score of 195.52 beat Virtue and Moir by 4.53 points.

"No athlete likes to sit in this position," Moir said, referring to second place, "but it is easier when you know how hard these guys worked."

Virtue and Moir have said this will be their last season as competitors. Meanwhile, Davis and White have made no decision. Both U.S. skaters have occasionally studied at the University of Michigan.

## The Russians Are Coming

The next great dance team clearly is going to be Russians Elena Ilinykh and Nikita Katasalapov. They took third place with the most compelling free dance of the night. Their take on the ballet music of "Swan Lake" made the ice rink feel like a theater. The performance was ballet-like and flawless.

The intense "Scheherazade" music was perfectly suited for Davis and White's power and athleticism. The most striking feature of the way they performed it was a feeling for the beat. Their skating changes of pace matched the shifts in the music's speed. That is an understanding White said they had not developed until three years ago.

Virtue and Moir's free dance music was not as good. The music cut and pasted together Russian classical pieces. It was confusing. Even though they skated very well, their dance seemed to not quite come together.

Davis and White skated last. Two Russian couples had gone immediately before them, sending the crowd into its usual fit of nationalistic pride.

"The moments before we take the ice are difficult," White said. "It is probably the most nervous you will be in a lifetime."

Or at least in 17 years.
