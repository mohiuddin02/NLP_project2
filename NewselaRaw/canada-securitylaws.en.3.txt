OTTAWA, Canada â€” Canada is known as a peaceful country, but it has helped the United States in wars overseas. Now, Canadians are worried that their country's participation in fighting has brought the violence home.

There have been two deadly attacks against members of the Canadian military in less than a week. The Canadian government is looking closely at its laws to see whether they are strong enough to deal with national threats.

Two of its citizens were successful in carrying out two big attacks. Both of the attackers were being watched by the government as safety risks.

The leader of Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, spoke at a government building. He stood just yards from where a gunman was shot dead the day before.

## Gunman Attacks Parliament

Harper promised to speed up a plan to give the government greater power to collect information, hold suspects, and arrest people.

The point of these attacks was to strike "fear and panic in our country," Harper said. "Canadians will not be intimidated. We will not panic."

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau is the gunman who carried out attacks at a government building and a nearby war memorial.

After fatally shooting Corporal Nathan Cirillo before 10 a.m. at the war memorial, Zehaf-Bibeau got into a car he had bought the previous day. He drove a short distance to Parliament Hill, where the government of Canada is located.

Video shows Zehaf-Bibeau parking his car in front of a building entrance. He is then seen running toward government officials' parked cars. He steals one of the vehicles, which he uses to drive to the main Parliament building, where lawmakers were holding meetings.

Police chased him and were seconds behind Zehaf-Bibeau when he ran through the main doors. Inside the building, police and government security shot at the suspect, who shot back. Zehaf-Bibeau was shot and died at the scene.

## Another Attacks Two Soldiers

Security officials said he had acted alone. However, his was not the first attack in Canada. Another attack took place in Quebec on Monday. In that attack, a man described as a Muslim extremist ran over two soldiers with his car, killing one of them. Police shot and killed the man.

Bob Paulson is the commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau was a 32-year-old Canadian who may also had citizenship in the North African country of Libya.

The Canadian police looked at Zehaf-Bibeau's record. They found that he had been staying in a homeless shelter and had a history of arrests for drugs, violence and other crimes.

The suspect's mother, Susan Bibeau, works for the Canadian government. She offered a tearful apology Thursday in an interview with The Associated Press.

"Can you ever explain something like this?" she said. "We are sorry. If I'm crying, it's for the people," she told AP. "Not for my son."

On the streets and in homes and coffee shops, Canadians discussed what the government would do in response to the attacks. Many feel that there will be more restrictions on everyday life in the future.

## "Don't Want Lawmakers To Overreact"

Fences and yellow police tape circled the government buildings, and officers carried rifles on guard.

Security has been increased at military bases and government buildings throughout Canada. Soldiers in the Ottawa area were ordered not to wear their uniforms in public unless on duty.

Shawn Perry is a 41-year-old from Newfoundland. He said he was concerned about the effect the attacks might have on Canadians' rights.

"I know that there needs to be more done here to increase security," he said. "The thing about Canada is we enjoy an awful lot of freedom. I just don't want lawmakers to overreact" and take any of it away.

On a chilly, cloudy day, the war memorial was full of people. They brought flowers, notes or just their thoughts as the capital struggled to deal with the apparent act of terror.

## The Way The World Sees Canada

Sikander Hashmi, a religious leader with the Kanata Muslim Association, said he had brought a bouquet to express his "sadness and outrage."

"This is my home country," he said after placing the flowers at the site. "I don't appreciate anyone trying to spread bloodshed, especially someone identifying themselves as a Muslim."

Senator Jim Munson of the Liberal Party represents Ontario, where Ottowa is located. Munson gave his opinion, too. He said Canada's participation in past and present conflicts in the Middle East has changed the way the world sees the country.

"The Canadian flag was once a symbol of openness and peace," he said in a telephone interview. "Now it is on our head as a target."
