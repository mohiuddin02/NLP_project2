LONDON â€” Racism and extremism are out of control in Russian soccer, according to a new report.

Researchers listed more than 200 cases of discrimination in Russian soccer over two seasons. The report predicts that racism also may threaten the safety of visitors to the 2018 World Cup, which will be held in Russia.

The report shows a disturbing picture of a soccer league full of racism and hatred of foreigners, said Piara Powar, director of Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE). Powar's group helps prosecute racism cases for the governing body of European soccer, UEFA. The report was written by FARE and Russian research group SOVA Center.

"Russia needs to get to a point where people can be assured if they go they won't be attacked," Powar said.

## "Time For Action"

The report listed dozens of cases where fans raised money for imprisoned neo-Nazis, who are anti-black and anti-Jewish. It gave examples of 72 times that neo-Nazi symbols, such as swastikas, have been displayed at games. It also listed 22 acts against ethnic people from the Caucasus region, which includes Dagestan and Chechnya. Just five instances were mentioned where black people were taunted, but the report covers only 2012 to 2014. Anti-black actions seem to have increased this season.

The report is called "Time for Action." It expresses concern that the next World Cup will be held in Russia in just three years.

"Our hope in Russia in the lead-up to 2018 is we get action taken to protect the safety of fans and of players," Powar added. "Players have already said they will walk off if they hear racism. That is a danger. We want that to be addressed in advance."

The Russian Football Union and World Cup 2018 organizers both declined to comment.

## Education And Promoting Diversity

The report was sent on Friday to Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA, the international soccer federation in charge of the World Cup. A post on his Twitter account said a plan was created in December to deal with discrimination before the 2018 World Cup.

In 2010, Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to address the issue.

"We see it and we believe it is a problem and unfortunately we have quite a number of such problems," Putin said at the time. Putin said then that Russia was fighting racism, hatred of foreigners and religious intolerance.

But the report argues that not enough has been done by Russia's government or its soccer authorities. The report says "it will be difficult to ensure the safety of visitors" to the World Cup unless Russia takes action. This includes punishment for discriminatory behavior, creating a plan to take on racist groups, educating Russians about hatred of foreigners, and promoting diversity in Russian cities holding World Cup games.

## What Rules?

Some of the Russian fans have links to racist groups. Some shout racist slogans for political reasons. Many others, though, see it simply as a tactic. They do it to distract the opposition's star players, says longtime Russian soccer fan Dmitry Dedkov.

"A good player on the team of your main or chief opponent is an irritant, like a red rag to a bull," he said. "They can insult an African or any other player."

The report said rules were created in 2011 to combat discrimination at games. Teams can be penalized for racism. Despite this, the number of incidents of racism around stadiums has not decreased, the report said.

"Well-known coaches and players have photos taken with fans wearing swastika tattoos or T-shirts with Nazi symbols." Popular singers sing songs with racist fans in the stands as well.

The report particularly highlights offensive conduct by fans of five Russian teams. Extremist fan groups use neo-Nazi symbols, including Nazi swastikas at games. They also wave banners, which read "White Pride World Wide."

The report says that none of this is surprising. Ethnic hatred inside Russian society has been growing since the early 2000s.

## Not A Lot Of Hope For Improvement

The report includes cases where UEFA, European football's governing body, has ruled against Russian teams. In the 2013-14 season, CSKA Moscow fans made monkey noises at Manchester City player Yaya Toure. UEFA fined CSKA for racism. Toure, who is from Ivory Coast in Africa, said, "If we aren't confident at the World Cup, coming to Russia, we don't come."

Just five cases of abuse against black people were recorded in 2012-14. However, Powar said the actual problem is far worse and there have been many racist incidents this season.

Sometimes the Russian Football Union punishes the victims.

In December, fans of the Moscow team Spartak made offensive racial comments to another team's player, who is from Gabon in Africa. He responded with a rude gesture and was banned for three matches. Yet Spartak was only fined about $1,300.

A coach, Igor Gamula, even made insulting comments about black players on his own team. He was punished by being banned for five games.

"Racist attitudes" are "widespread among Russian football fans," the report concluded. "It is unlikely that this situation will fundamentally improve in the near future."
