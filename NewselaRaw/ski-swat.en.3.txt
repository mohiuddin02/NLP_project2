MALAM JABBA, Pakistan — Boys in tattered coats whiz down Malam Jabba's powdery slope. They wear homemade pine skis. Galoshes nailed to the planks serve as ski boots. Bamboo sticks work as poles.

A few hundred yards away, jobless men climb a snowy ridge. They are looking for scrap metal in the rubble. This was once the country's only ski resort. Wealthy businessmen and European VIPs once came here for the scenery. The region was nicknamed "the Switzerland of Pakistan."

## Taliban Terror

That changed five years ago. Malam Jabba is in the Swat Valley. In 2008 Taliban fighters temporarily took control of the valley. The Taliban believes in an extreme form of Islam. During its brutal reign, the fighters murdered their opponents. They burned down schools and stopped girls from attending classes.

The fighters said skiing was un-Islamic, so they set fire to the resort's hotel. They destroyed its chairlift, snow-making machine and ski-rental shops.

The government won back control of the valley in 2009, but Malam Jabba remains paralyzed. It is a symbol of Pakistan's struggle to bring tourism back to the Swat Valley.

When the Taliban tried to kill 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai in October, it brought world attention to Swat. People feared the Taliban might bring more violence back to the valley.

## Still Waiting For Help

"The government has been telling us for years that they're going to rebuild the hotel, and it never happens," said Sabz Ali. The 18-year-old trudges up the slope with his skis over his shoulder. His family owns a small hotel nearby that makes about $20 a month. "The [big] hotel is the main thing. If they build it, people will come."

Pakistan tourism suffers from an image problem. It is not just a land of religious extremists and car bombers. It is home to K2, the world's second-highest mountain peak. In the south is Mohenjo-daro, an ancient city with 4,600-year old ruins.

But the crown jewel of Pakistani tourism has been the Swat Valley. It is famous for its velvet-green mountainsides and murmuring. Some of the country's best trout fishing is in the winding Swat River and its network of creeks and streams.

And then there is Malam Jabba.

## Heartbreak Hotel

In its heyday, the resort hosted thousands of people each day; now, the number is usually in the dozens.

The ruined hotel had a modern, white façade. Its striking roof dipped in the middle. It was a refreshing change from the typical boxy Pakistani bulding. Inside the lobby were fireplaces, thick wood paneling and dark red carpeting. There was an ice-skating rink and a souvenir shop stocked with jars of Swat-made honey.

"It was a beautiful, huge hotel, and it was always full," Ali said. He and his family fled Swat while the military was fighting the Taliban. They returned four months later to find the hotel destroyed. "When I saw it, my heart sank. It was so beautiful, but it also meant we had jobs."

## Tourists Remain Wary

The military maintains bases and checkpoints to keep out the Taliban.

"Swat is now totally cleared of the Taliban," said Syed Aqil Shah, tourism minister for Swat Valley. "What happened to Malala was just one incident that made people start talking again about Swat security.

"But I assure you that Swat is as safe as any other place in Pakistan right now." Still, tourism is not what it used to be.

About 50,000 tourists come per year, said Zahid Khan, who represents the hotel owners in the valley. Before the Taliban came there were 300,000 visitors a year. The drop in visitors hurts almost everyone in Swat, Khan said. Hotel workers, cooks, taxi drivers and handicraft artisans are all losing money.

Reviving tourism in Swat is a low priority for the government, Khan said. Top officials ignore his pleas for meetings and funding.

## More Bad Luck for Swat

Making matters worse, the region was flooded in 2010. More than 120 hotels in Swat were damaged or destroyed. Only 20 have been rebuilt, with the owners paying for the work themselves.

Shah, the tourism minister, said that the local government will oversee the hotel's reconstruction. He said rebuilding should begin this summer.

People in Swat say they have heard such promises before. Many scrape by on whatever money they can earn teaching skiers or renting out their own equipment to the few visitors who arrive.

## Skiing Against All Odds

The resort still brings some joy to residents. They fell in love with skiing and have nothing else to fill their days. On a recent cloudless afternoon, a few dozen people spent hours doing jumps on the mountain. One skier in an overcoat and sunglasses whizzed down without poles.

"It's such a beautiful sport that I can't help but ski every day," said Saeed Alam, 22. "But when God has given us this beautiful place and the government doesn't do anything with it, it's just so disappointing."

He pushed off down the slope. On the back of his jacket were the words "Ski and Smile in Swat!"
