SAN BRUNO, Calif. â€” The leaders for the design workshop came with lots of markers, drafting rulers that were too dull to double as weapons, and kiddie scissors.

All the students wore orange. And on this final day, their paper models were taking shape.

The workshop participants were inmates at San Francisco's County Jail No. 5. The spaces they were planning could very well be for spiritual retreats. But these were plans for a new prison building.

Architect Deanna VanBuren adjusted a piece of tracing paper over Anthony Pratt's design. She showed him how to highlight walls and windows, and how to use dots to indicate open spaces.

Pratt, a tall man with with tattoos on both arms, was among the workshop participants.

His vision for a new prison building included a large room with a skylight to provide sunlight, and a fountain with a cascading waterfall. It also included private showers and toilets, and a healing center with lots of windows.

## Healing The Victims And Offenders

Most inmates in the County Jail No. 5 are awaiting trial on charges of violent crimes. All must agree to join in a program called "Resolve to Stop the Violence."

The program includes classes and talks about a new way of thinking about justice. This new way is called restorative justice. It tries to heal crime victims and offenders alike.

The 18 men enrolled in the four-day workshop this summer were thinking about restorative justice through design.

As Pratt concentrated on his drawing, Keith Wilkins cut the waterfall for the 3-D model. Both are facing murder charges. Another participant, Lamar Paschall, helped with the trees. He has been charged with kidnapping, rape and robbery.

Some of the new building models were not very realistic. They included individual cells with Internet connections and outdoor decks.

Some prisons like that exist in Norway. But they aren't likely to become part of U.S. prison design any time soon.

## Maybe Traditional Criminal Justice Isn't Working

Other ideas, such as centers where agreement on punishment is reached outside of courtrooms, are becoming more common.

"I feel an extra sense of purpose today," Paschall told his fellow classmates. "Hopefully this can become fruitful and turn into something real down the line."

A growing number of people now believe that traditional criminal justice models are failing to prevent offenders from committing crimes again.

VanBuren, and fellow instructor Barb Toews, have joined designers, researchers, judges and people in charge of prisons, calling for new spaces to match the new vision of restorative justice.

Restorative justice ideas were first introduced in the 1970s by Howard Zehr, a professor at Eastern Mennonite University's Center for Justice and Peacebuilding. The goal was to make the needs of victims central.

## It Might Be Too Personal

Some people say restorative justice is too influenced by people's personal feelings, tastes and opinions. It could lead to remedies that are very different from each other. As a result, some victims' groups and strict lawyers do not accept it.

But the practice is growing throughout the United States and the world. There's more evidence it helps keep youths in schools and out of the criminal justice system. It also prevents youths and adults who have already been sentenced from re-offending.

VanBuren is an architect based in Oakland. She was working for a big firm when she heard a restorative justice supporter named Azim Khamisa on a podcast.

Khamisa's son was murdered by a teenage gang member. After that, he reached out to the boy's grandfather and the killer, so they could all heal. The two older men launched the Tariq Khamisa Foundation in San Diego to address the roots of youth violence.

Soon after, VanBuren heard the founder of Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth speak about transformations at a West Oakland middle school. The number of African-American students being suspended or expelled had greatly dropped. They teamed up and she designed her first restorative justice room in a portable trailer at an Oakland high school.

## What Would It Look Like?

Toews, meanwhile, got started with restorative justice in the 1990s while doing voluntary service. In 2000, she conducted a workshop in a Pennsylvania prison with 13 inmates serving life sentences, most of whom had committed murder.

The men were reluctant to share their feelings. She told them the traditional system is like a boxing ring, with a winner and loser and outsiders determining the outcome.

"What would a room look like," she then asked, "where you could face anything you've done and be accountable for it?"

Together, they created a vision and called it the "Do No Harm" room. A picture window with a mountain view. A door that locks from the inside. Plants and rugs.

## Piecing Together The Models

On the final workshop day, the inmates pieced together their models with glue sticks and tape.

Deandre Hill, convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and Christopher Gillis, facing murder and commercial robbery charges, sat side by side. They imagined a cell with a computer that allowed for communication with family. It had a lot of natural light, as did all the models.

"The most important thing is to be accountable, but in order to work on yourself you have to be comfortable," said Gillis, who is planning a restorative justice circle to "make up for the harm" he had inflicted on his 16-year-old son through his absence and actions.

Then it was time to present their models to the larger pod and a panel of outside reviewers.

As his teammates stood beside him, Dante Hayes, facing charges of robbery and attempted rape, showed a design with a tree in the atrium representing growth and "the ability for us to grow." A kitchen would feed all visitors.

## More Workshops Are Encouraged

In a closing circle after the presentation, Pratt, who recently participated in a restorative justice-style circle with his girlfriend, said his whole outlook had changed: "Instead of being barbarians and just beating each other upside the head, we can be like family."

VanBuren said she is encouraging big architecture firms that design prisons to hold similar workshops with inmates and guards.

"The goal is to empower those inside the institutions and prod architects to actually talk to the people they are designing for," she said. "That's how an architect would practice in any other setting."
