WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama on Tuesday promised more than $33 billion in public and private investments in Africa. The United States, he said, wants to deliver business and development to the rapidly booming continent, where China already has a massive presence.

Obama made the remarks as he addressed the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the first of its kind and the largest event any American president has held with African leaders.

Countries including China have held similar events for years as they've sought access to African markets for oil and other natural resources. The United States, however, wants a different kind of relationship, Obama insisted.

"We don't look to Africa simply for its natural resources," Obama said. "We recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people and its talents and their potential."

Obama didn't mention any foreign competition. China, however, has been criticized for seeking access to markets in order to purchase raw materials and sell its manufactured goods.

"We don't simply want to extract minerals from the ground for our growth," Obama told the gathering of African leaders and business leaders from the United States and Africa. "We want to build genuine partnerships that create jobs and opportunity for all our peoples and that unleash the next era of African growth. That's the kind of partnership America offers."

## Important For Future Growth

To that end, Obama announced a $7 billion program to promote U.S. exports to, and investments in, Africa under the Doing Business in Africa campaign. U.S. companies have announced new deals in energy, aviation, banking and construction worth more than $14 billion, he said.

The president also announced more than $12 billion in new commitments for his Power Africa program. Its goal is to increase access to electricity to more than 600 million people.

In the past, critics have suggested the United States is late to Africa. Former President Bill Clinton, who preceded Obama in speaking, urged U.S. businesses to embrace Africa now.

"We are missing the boat," Clinton said. "This is a very important part of our future."

Speakers noted that six of the 10 fastest-growing countries on the planet are in Africa. The continent's middle class is the fastest growing in the world.

Other nations are already deeply invested in the continent, and the United States now realizes "we have some catching up to do … we are letting Europe and China go faster than the U.S.," said former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

## A Changing Continent Becoming Stronger

Obama noted that the continent still faces "enormous challenges" in dealing with poverty, conflict, hunger and disease. He pointed, however, to "a new Africa that's emerging."

Tanzania President Jakaya Kikwete echoed Obama's remarks. Africa, he said, still has its "hot spots," but many of its 53 countries have changed over the past decade, with leaders endorsing strong economic and political policies.

"Democracy has taken root, governance is enshrined," Kikwete said. "There is stronger commitment now to fight vices, corruption, drug trafficking. There is more respect for human rights."

Nonetheless, Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden pressed African leaders in particular to crack down on corruption.

"People should be able to start a business and ship their goods without having to pay a bribe or hire somebody's cousin," Obama said.

Corruption in a number of countries hampers the United States to the benefit of countries like China, said Andrew Spalding, an expert on international business and corruption.

The United States aggressively enforces laws that prohibit U.S. companies from bribing foreign governments, Spalding said. Other exporters, particularly China, do not enforce such bans. They are thus able to "fill the void" in countries where corruption is widespread, he said.

## Investment Helps Layers Of People

The attention to Africa included a dinner at the White House late Tuesday night hosted by the president and first lady Michelle Obama. Singer Lionel Richie was to perform and the menu included touches of Africa, including beef served with chermoula, a marinade popular in North Africa.

The push for more investment with Africa comes at a favorable time. Many African countries are increasingly eager to process their natural resources inside their borders, rather than simply exporting their raw material, said Vera Songwe of the World Bank.

She called it a good time "for U.S. companies with the cutting-edge expertise to come in and partner with the continent to do this, and I think this is what we're seeing more and more of."

The U.S. approach to business in Africa "is almost the opposite of the Chinese approach," said Witney Schneidman, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs. He noted that when American companies like Microsoft, Procter &amp; Gamble or GE invest in Africa, they generally hire and train Africans. Their approach "has an incredible ripple effect and it helps to create skills, it helps to create this middle class."

## Plenty Of Trade Opportunities

Chinese trade with Africa has grown more rapidly over the last decade than U.S. trade with the continent, Schneidman said. However, "the African market is so large and there's such an opportunity there and there's so many different needs that I think it's really about how do we get more U.S. companies into the continent."

Obama called on Republicans to reauthorize the imperiled Export-Import Bank of the United States, which helps promote American businesses that want to sell products overseas. His call was echoed by Clinton, who called Republican criticism of the government agency "ridiculous."

"If you're running a country, you've got to try to create an opportunity for all of your businesses to be competitive," Clinton said.
