SAN JOSE, Calif. â€” Autism is usually thought of as a disorder. People who are autistic often have trouble talking to others. They may repeat things over and over, or be interested in only one subject.

Now, though, a new study shows that autism may not be like other disorders. Instead, it may actually be a different way of thinking.

Scientists at Stanford University gave two groups of children math problems to solve. One group was autistic; the other was not. The children with autism turned out to have better math skills.

The scientists took pictures of the children's brains as they worked on the math problems. These showed differences, too. The children with autism used their brains in an unusual way.

## Amazing Visual Memory

This new study shows something important. It makes us better understand the special talents that autistic people have, said Teresa Iuculano, the leader of the study. That may help children with autism have an easier time in school and, later, at work, she said. "We think it could be reassuring for parents."

The children with autism had one problem all people with autism have. They had a hard time talking to other people. They could be very shy, and did not always understand what mood people were in. But they were very good at some things, said the team of scientists.

The autistic brain does not necessarily work less well than a normal brain, Iuculano said. Instead, it could just be "a different brain."

Autism comes in many forms. Some people with autism can have a lot of trouble even doing simple things. But others can have special skills or talents.

They may be very good at calendar calculation. This skill allows them to quickly figure out on which day of the week someone was born, once they know the year. Or they may have amazing visual memory. For example, they may remember how many windows are in a skyscraper they have only seen once.

## Very Good At Math Problems

But the discovery of math talents in children with autism is particularly important.

"The study backs up what we already know. Some of these kids have great talents. But they look at the world differently," said Brad Boardman. He runs a San Jose center for people with autism.

There may be a simple reason for what the scientists found. Children with autism may be better at math just because they practice so much.

But the scientists believe there is more to it than that. They think the autistic brain works differently.

Their study looked at 36 children, ages 7 to 12. Half had autism. All had normal IQs.

The children with autism did much better on math tests than the others. Most scored around 125 on the tests. The children who were not autistic scored an average 100.

## Thinking Things Differently

The children with autism also solved math problems in a different way. Non-autistic children counted on their fingers or memorized answers. Children with autism broke the problem down into parts. For instance, if they were asked how much 7 plus 4 was, they would add 7 plus 3, then add 1.

The scientists used a scanner to take pictures of what was going on inside the children's brains. The scans of the children with autism showed something unusual. When they worked on math problems, they used a part of a brain just below the ears. This area is known as the ventral temporal occipital cortex.

Normally, that part of the brain is used to figure out things we see, including faces. Maybe because the children with autism use it on math, it makes them less able to read people's expressions. That could explain why they are not good at figuring out people's moods.

The different way the children with autism use their brains might help strong skills develop, like problem-solving, "even though there are things that they may not be good at," Iuculano said.
