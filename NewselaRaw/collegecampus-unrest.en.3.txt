Recent events at the University of Missouri are inspiring a movement across the country. 

On Nov. 10, the president and chancellor of the university quit. Since then, protests have happened at more than 100 colleges and universities across the county. Social media sites, like Twitter and Facebook, have been buzzing. 

Students are questioning the colleges and universities they once trusted. Their protests are inspired by the marches in Ferguson, Missouri. The protests there happened after a black teenager was shot in 2014. Black Lives Matter, a campaign to stop violence against blacks, is also inspiring college students.

The students are calling for change. They say that racism takes place at their schools. They are using protests from the past to inspire them. They are holding hunger strikes and sit-ins, and they are writing lists of demands.

## College Officials Are Listening

Their actions are being noticed. 

Last week, an administrator from Claremont McKenna College in California stepped down. Protesters said she did not support minority students. 

Occidental College in California is dealing with unrest as well. On Tuesday, college President Jonathan Vetch said officials are considering ways to make the campus more open and accepting of black students. They are thinking about creating a black studies major. They also might offer more diversity training.

Students at the University of Southern California are joining the movement, too. They have written a list of demands for school administrators. They are asking for the school to hire a leader to create more diversity. They also want all students to have more of a say at the school.

Nationwide, complaints are spreading online. Students are taking a stand against racism. Universities are wondering how to react.

## Protests Play A Role In History

It's nothing new that these protests are happening at colleges. For decades, students have helped spark social change. University of California President Janet Napolitano says colleges play an important role. She said campuses are where problems are raised and where many voices are heard.

Tyrone Howard, an administrator at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that social media plays a big role in today's campaigns. "A protest goes viral in no time flat. With Instagram and Twitter, you're in an immediate news cycle. This was not how it was 20 or 30 years ago," he said.

Howard thinks the president stepping down in Missouri sent an important signal. Students are now wondering if the same thing could happen at their own school. 

In some ways, protests of today reflect those that took place in the 1960s, said Robert Cohen. He is a professor at New York University and wrote a book about the Free Speech Movement in the 1960s.

Cohen said that today's protests have something important in common with protests from the past. They are pushing for change and starting a national conversation.

## Taking A Stand Against Racism

Protests today are focused on a few different things. Students are taking a stand against racism. 

"As a black person, I think black people are just fed up. It's time out for ignoring these issues," said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.  

Colleges and universities often lead the nation in valuing free speech. Now with these protests, they are struggling with something significant. They are reacting to protests and angry students. The schools must react in a way that respects students' right to free speech. 

Occidental student Raihana Haynes-Venerable has heard people complaining about how sensitive some students are. She thinks it's important to address when things are unfair for certain groups. She thinks there is discrimination today, such as when women get paid less than men for the same job. 

"This is the new form of racism," she said.
