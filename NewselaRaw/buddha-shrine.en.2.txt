New evidence found in Nepal may provide a better answer for the question of when the Buddha was born, according to archaeologists. Ancient bricks, tile roofing and wood charcoal discovered beneath a site where religious people visit may point to the answer.

In research published this week,  archaeologists wrote that the evidence supports a 6th century B.C. birth for the Buddha, or "enlightened one."

The exact date that Buddha was born remains unknown. Historians have wavered over dates ranging between 623 B.C. and 340 B.C. Much of the confusion has to do with the lack of written records. Inscriptions on monuments that were built by the Indian emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century B.C. provide some clues. But, earlier evidence is harder to come by, researchers say.

The new evidence points to the 6th century B.C.

## Wooden Temple Beneath Brick Ones

The archaeologists dug at the Maya Devi Temple at Lumbini, which is said to be the site of Buddha's birth. The dig was done within the shrine.

Archaeology professor Robin Coningham led the team. He said the dig revealed a previously undiscovered temple built of wood. It was found beneath several brick temples that were later built on top of it.

The original timber structure appears to have been built around an open space. In that space was a tree, the team thinks.

"This central portion of the temple had always been open to the elements. It had never been covered by a roof," Coningham said. "Also, the team found fragments of mineralized tree roots."

According to Buddhist tradition, Buddha was born in a garden, beneath a tree. His mother, Queen Maya Devi, held a tree branch for support as she gave birth. Immediately after his delivery, Buddha is said to have stood and walked.

## Shrine Built Around A Tree

Coningham said that because of this tradition, it was not surprising that a tree would be an important part of the shrine.

"This is one of those rare occasions when belief, tradition, archaeology and science actually come together, because here we have a very early shrine built around a tree," Coningham said.

The Lumbini temple is one of four important temples associated with the life of Buddha. The others are Bodh Gaya, where he attained enlightenment; Sarnath, where he first preached; and Kusingara, where he died at age 80.

The Buddha's original name was Siddhartha Gautama. He got the name of Buddha when he reached a great level of knowledge and wisdom, which was known as his enlightenment.

The first Lumbini shrine was likely built by wealthy followers of Buddhism. At the time, the religion was considered a cult. New religions with very few followers are sometimes called cults.

Later shrines were constructed with large open areas as well, researchers said.

## Dating The Ancient Structure

At some point, the temple was forgotten and overgrown by jungle. It was rediscovered in 1869. And it was found to have a large sandstone column with an inscription that called the site Lumbini and said the emperor Ashoka had visited there.

Researchers said most of those earlier shrines at the site were covered by more recent construction. That's why an examination of the buried materials was not possible until now.

Researchers used fragments of charcoal from the early wooden temple and grains of sand to date the structure. The tests involved a combination of carbon dating and optical dating.

Carbon dating can tell how old something is by measuring how much the carbon has decayed. Carbon is found in nearly everything, including the bodies of humans. In optical dating, scientists shine a light on minerals that had been buried. This will tell when was the last time the object saw daylight.

Hundreds of thousands of nuns, monks and other pilgrims visit Lumbini each year to pay respect to the Buddha. And the temple remained open as archaeologists did their work.

"All of this work occurred within a living temple," Coningham said.
