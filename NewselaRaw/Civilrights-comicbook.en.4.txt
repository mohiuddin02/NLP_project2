When Lewis was young, in the early 1960s, he was not allowed to vote. African-Americans in the South were not treated fairly. They could not vote. Black children could not go to school with white children.

## Struggling For Rights

Now, Lewis has written comic books about those years. His latest book is called "March: Book Two." It shows the struggle to win equal rights for black people.

Sometimes, pictures explain more than words alone.

In the 1960s, Lewis was in his 20s. He was a civil rights leader. He led peaceful protests. The protesters said black people should be treated fairly. Many white people in the South reacted to this with anger and violence.

"For me to look at some of the drawings, it almost makes me cry," Lewis said.

Lewis' first book was called "March: Book One." It begins when Lewis was a boy on his parents' farm in Alabama.

## Students Need To Know

Lewis' second book begins in 1960. It ends with the 1963 March on Washington. More than 200,000 people gathered in Washington. They told the government that black people should be treated fairly. The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. gave a famous speech called "I Have a Dream."

Lewis was one of six people who planned that march. He is the only one still living.

Schools in 40 states have used Lewis' first book. Not enough schools teach students about the civil rights movement, he said.

Lewis wrote the book with Andrew Aydin. Artist Nate Powell drew the pictures.

## Writing A Comic Book

Aydin came up with the idea for the comic book. He works for Lewis. In 2008, Aydin had some days off. He said he planned to go to a comic book convention. People laughed.

"Don't laugh," Lewis told them. A comic book inspired Lewis when he was 17. The comic was about Martin Luther King.

Aydin told Lewis he should write a comic book.

Kids need to learn more about civil rights, Aydin thought. A comic book might be the way to do it.
