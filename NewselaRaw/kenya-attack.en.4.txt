JOHANNESBURG — The Westgate Mall is a fancy shopping center in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. On Saturyday, cafes were busy with a weekend lunch crowd. Visitors were waiting for a children's cooking contest to start. Suddenly, gunfire and explosions erupted. People went scurrying for safety, blocking themselves in storerooms and kitchens. Some played dead.

At least 68 people were killed and 175 wounded Saturday at the mall shooting. It was Kenya's worst terror attack in 15 years, said President Uhuru Kenyatta. A group from Somalia took responsibility for the attack. It is called the Shabab. The group is made up of Islamic fighters. They have links with al-Qaida. The Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States were committed by al-Qaida.

The Shabab said the mall attack was payback. It was angry that Kenya sent troops to Somalia two years ago to try to control the Shabab.

By Sunday, attackers were still holding an unknown number of innocent people in the mall. Kenyan soldiers were surrounding them. The Shabab said it was in touch with fighters in the mall. It refused to free the people being held.

## President's Nephew And Foreigners Killed

"There will be no negotiations whatsoever at Westgate," the Shabab wrote on Twitter. The Twitter account was suspended shortly afterwards.

Witnesses who escaped the attack said gunmen fired at people from an upper floor. Terrified shoppers scrambled out of the building. Some got out by crawling on their hands and knees.

Two Canadians and two French citizens were killed, officials of those countries said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said there were no reports of Americans being killed. Four Americans were reported injured.

Kenyatta's own nephew was killed. So was his nephew's fiancee.

Military and police helicopters flew over the shopping mall. Meanwhile, ambulances rushed victims to nearby hospitals. The Kenyan soldiers were called in. Kenya's Citizen TV showed victims arriving by ambulance at hospitals, including some who had been shot in the head and others covered in blood but walking.

## One Escaped By Playing Dead

It was unclear how many attackers there were. Kenyan media reported that two suspects had been killed.

The masked gunmen were said to have entered the mall through a cafe on a veranda. It was reported that they let Muslims go and targeted non-Muslims. The Shabab believes in a very strict form of the Muslim religion.

Umar Ahmed, 18, told Kenyan television he was in the rooftop parking area when he heard shooting and screams. He tried to flee. A gunman saw him and threw a grenade toward him.

"I tried to run down the stairs and saw someone running towards the top,"  Umar said.  "I ran back and hid behind one of the cars."

He said he played dead. A gunman turned him over to make sure he wasn't alive, and left him lying there.

One man said he had hidden in a storeroom. Then workers from a restaurant drew him into a kitchen. They kept themselves safe by blocking the doors with giant refrigerators.

Another witness told Citizen TV that he saw a foreign gunman change clothes and mingle with people escaping the mall. He said he warned police. They took no action. Cafe employee Patricia Kuria told reporters she saw two gunmen wearing black turbans.

## "I Urge All Kenyans To Stand Together"

For many Kenyans, the attack reminded them of al-Qaida's 1998 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, which killed more than 200 people — most of them Kenyans.

The attack will probably hurt the travel business. Kenya depends on the money it makes from visitors coming to see Kenya's wildlife and nature. Past terror attacks made people unwilling to visit.

Kenya has worried about the chaos in Somalia for a long time. Somalia has not had a functioning central government for most of the last 20 years. Many Somalis have been forced to flee into Kenya because life in their home country is so bad. The lawlessness in Somalia has sparked piracy in the Indian Ocean. Some worry it may cause religious extremism to spread to Kenya.

Kenyatta said in a speech on television that the military and police operation at the mall was "delicate." Its top aim was to save the lives of the innocent people still being held. He vowed that the gunmen would be caught and punished.

"We have overcome terrorist attacks before," he said. "We have fought courageously and defeated them in and outside our borders. We will defeat them again."

He added, "I urge all Kenyans to stand together and see this dark moment through."
