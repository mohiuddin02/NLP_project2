WASHINGTON â€“ U.S. shoppers who buy Russian hardwood may be hurting an [endangered tiger's](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) last home.

This warning comes from a report by the World Wildlife Fund. It details how loggers are cutting down Mongolian oak trees and other species. The Amur tiger cannot survive without the trees. Environmental groups think that there are only about 450 Amur tigers left in the wild.

Loggers in the Russian Far East cut down oak trees illegally. Sometimes these trees are centuries old. The loggers abuse permits for cutting down sick trees. Some simply break the law. They cut down trees on protected lands.

The loggers sell the wood to factories in China. The factories use it to make furniture and flooring. These products are shipped to the United States and Europe, the WWF said.

## Breaking the Food Chain

This logging hurts the Amur tiger. The Mongolian oak trees are an important part of their food chain. The oak drops its acorns on the ground. Deer and wild boar eat the acorns. The Amur tigers then eat the other animals. So the tigers' food is disappearing with the trees.

"U.S. consumers can be part of this without knowing it," said Linda Walker. She works for the WWF. If you buy hardwood floors or furniture made with Russian wood, it could be from these forests instead of from the United States, she said.

"No expert in the world can tell (the difference) from looking at the wood said Nikolay Shmatkov. He works for the WWF in Moscow. He was in Washington, D.C., to talk about Russian logging. Illegal loggers have threatened WWF officials watching forests in Russia, he said.

The WWF and other environmental groups are mad. From 2004 to 2011, oak exports from Russia to China were too high. Shmatkov believes that in 2007, Russian loggers took 52.9 million cubic feet of wood more than they should have. This is all happening where the tigers live.

## Fight With Russia?

The issue could turn into a trade problem with Russia. The illegal logging seems to go against 2008 changes to the Lacey Act. The Lacey Act is a law from 1900. It was meant to keep natural habitats safe. It helps protect forests and tigers. The new changes affect American wood importers. Now they have to be sure that the wood they are buying was not cut down illegally.

The changes mean that U.S. companies now have to follow the laws in the countries where they do business. They are also responsible for any mistakes by their suppliers. It is not enough to know that the wood is coming from China. Importers must now know where their suppliers are getting their wood.

The U.S. government is trying to help by running programs in other countries. The programs teach others how to follow the Lacey Act's new rules.

Walker said shoppers should do one thing to stop the problem from getting worse. They should buy their hardwood from companies that are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Few Russian companies have such certification.

"Consumers can purchase certified flooring or furniture. That is the easiest way to be sure that they are not adding to the destruction of the Russian Far East's last tiger habitat," the WWF said.
