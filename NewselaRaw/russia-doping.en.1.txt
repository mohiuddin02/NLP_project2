MOSCOW, Russia — During the 2014 Sochi Olympics Russia won more medals than any other nation, as well as the largest number of gold medals. The day after the games ended, a beaming President Vladimir Putin presented his athletes with state awards. He praised them for "defending the honor" of their country by showing that its "great and glorious" sports traditions were still strong.

Now Russia's achievements at Sochi may be tarnished. On Monday a report was released that claims cheating was widespread during the games. The report accuses Russian track and field athletes of using banned performance-enhancing drugs to give themselves an edge. Furthermore, it claims this doping was widespread and state-sponsored.

International sports has long held outsized importance for Russians as a way to measure their country's standing in the world. From the 1960s to the 1980s the Soviet Union — which Russia was then part of — was a dominating force in sports, known as the "Big Red Machine."

That is why accusations of cheating drew such a harsh reaction Tuesday in Moscow. It would be a huge embarrassment for Russia if its track and field athletes were kept out of next year's summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

## Officials Claim Anti-Russian Conspiracy

Russian officials have attacked the report, which was prepared by a commission from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). They claim it failed to prove its main points and have suggested the existence of an anti-Russian conspiracy.

"As long as there is no evidence, it is difficult to consider the accusations," said Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The accusations, he added, appear rather baseless.

The acting head of the Russian athletics federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said the report's conclusions appeared to have been "made to order."

Putin has called a meeting Wednesday with the heads of Russia's sports federations to discuss preparations for the 2016 Olympics. Zelichenok said the doping allegations may be discussed at the meeting.

## Security Service Cover-up Suspected

Monday's report not only claims that Russia engaged in systematic doping of track and field athletes, including several Olympic medalists. It also claims that there were state-directed cover-ups. The report says agents from the Federal Security Service interfered with the work of a lab that was supposed to test for doping at the Sochi Games.

The WADA commission recommended that track and field's governing body, the IAAF, suspend the Russian federation from competition. IAAF President Sebastian Coe gave the federation until the end of the week to respond to the doping allegations.

The International Olympic Committee said it is prepared to strip medals from athletes found guilty of doping violations.

Russia also has been threatened with suspension from track and field competitions, including the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Zelichenok appealed to the IAAF to show "prudence" and allow Russians to compete.

Russian track and field head coach Yuri Borzakovsky will be among those meeting with Putin. Borzakovsky is a former Olympic 800-meter champion,

In response to Monday's report, WADA stripped Russia's anti-doping lab in Moscow of its official authority. Hours later, lab director Grigory Rodchenkov resigned.

## Fall Of Soviet Union Took A Toll

Russia has been a track and field power for decades but has been slipping in recent years. Its main strengths are now in race walking, women's middle-distance running and the field events, particularly the pole vault. The world record-holder, Yelena Isinbayeva, is Russian.

At the 2013 world track and field championships in Moscow, Russia took home more gold medals than the other countries. Of its 17 medals, seven were gold. This year at the Beijing World Athletics Championships, Russia won only two gold medals and four in all.

Until 1991, the Soviet Union enjoyed enormous international success, especially in sports such as hockey, figure skating and gymnastics. It had a huge pool of talent from its 15 republics and a very well-funded athletic training system.

Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, however, Russia went through a period of economic chaos. As a result, its stadiums and other sports facilities deteriorated. Low salaries and the 1998 collapse of Russia's currency, the ruble, forced many athletes and coaches to compete abroad.

The post-Soviet athletic decline hit bottom at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games. Russia left those games with only three gold medals and the daunting task of rebuilding its team in time for the Winter Games in Sochi four years later.

## Games Were Used To Boost National Pride

The Sochi Olympics were part of a broader effort by Putin to restore national pride. The total cost was a record $51 billion. The Games yielded huge successes for Russia's athletes, who won 13 golds — their highest Winter Games haul ever — and 33 total medals.

In congratulating the medalists, Putin noted it was important for Russia to showcase not only its new, modern sports facilities in Sochi but also its athletes. He said they are worthy of carrying the banner of Russia's "great and glorious traditions."

"You showed that these traditions are strong," the president said. "Our country, as before, produces brilliant, strong athletes, who are able to amaze and delight our citizens, filling them with pride in their fatherland."

Political analyst Andrei Kolesnikov said Putin plays up sports victories as a way to build support for his presidency. In turn, he said, Putin's emphasis on national achievement in sports may put pressure on sports officials.

"Maybe it was not the decision of Putin to use these medical means, but the very atmosphere in Russia, it leads to these solutions made by some sports officials. They are trying to be victorious, they must win everywhere," Kolesnikov said.

Kolesnikov predicted Putin would use the doping scandal to his political advantage, by standing up to what he would portray as a hostile West. At the same time, he said, Putin will probably punish someone at home to show that he is taking action.
