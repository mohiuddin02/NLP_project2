HACKENSACK, N.J. â€” Little brown bats in New Jersey are sick. They are sick with "white nose."

White nose comes from white powder. The powder grows on their noses. It is also on the ears and wings of the bats.

White nose comes from a fungus. Fungus grows in bat caves.

## When They Sleep

Little brown bats get sick when they sleep. The bats sleep in the winter when it gets cold. Bats sleep all winter long. They wake up in the spring.

When bats are sleeping, they cannot eat. So bats eat a lot before they sleep. It helps them stay full of food for the winter.

White nose makes little brown bats move around the cave. The bats move when they sleep. It makes them hungry. When bats are hungry, they want food. But they cannot eat because they are sleeping. They are using up their food.

Many bats die from white nose. They die of hunger when they sleep. They are dying very fast.

## Baby Bats

Little brown bat mothers do not have many babies. They give birth to one baby bat a year. Many more die every year. They die faster than they are being born.

In 2008, there were many little brown bats. About 30,000 lived in New Jersey. Now, there are about 300. There are not many left.

Scientists say all the little brown bats could die soon.

## Bats Help Us

People are sad that the little brown bats are dying. Bats help people.

Bats eat insects, or bugs. Insects eat food that people grow. Farmers grow food. They like it when bats eat bugs. If all the little brown bats die, farmers will grow less food.

Scientists are looking for a cure, or medicine. A cure will make the little brown bats better. The scientists have not found a cure yet.
