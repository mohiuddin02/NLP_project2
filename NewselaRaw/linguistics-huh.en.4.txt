LOS ANGELES — A new study examined languages from around the world. It discovered that "Huh?" could be a word everyone uses – no matter what language they speak.

Words that mean the same thing often sound very different across languages. But "Huh?" sounds the same across many languages. It seems that humans make the same sound when they don't understand something.

Scientists figured this out by traveling to cities and tiny villages on five continents. They visited speakers of 10 very different languages. They made 200 recordings of everyday conversations. Those showed that there are forms of "Huh?" in every language they studied. They even sound nearly like each other.

## Glue For Conversations

The word "Huh?" may not seem like a word. But the team discovered that it holds conversations together. The fact that it appears over and over shows that languages can develop separately, but in much the same way, they added.

"Huh?" is a not a well-respected word in English. It's seen as filler. But it plays an important part in conversations, said Herbert Clark. He teaches language studies at Stanford University.

When a person misses a bit of information, they can lose track of the conversation. There needs to be a quick way to fix it, he said.

"You can't have a conversation without the ability to make repairs," said Clark.

## "Huh?" In Other Languages

For this study, scientists from the Netherlands wanted to show that "Huh?" is a true word. They also wanted to see whether other languages had a word like it. And to see if it had the same purpose in those languages.

The scientists went to villages in Ecuador, Laos, Ghana and Australia. They spent weeks getting to know the people there. First, they felt they had to gain people's trust. Then they could record everyday conversations. They hoped to catch a few instances of "Huh?" in its natural setting.

"The kind of conversations we collected were just the kind of conversations you and I would have," Enfield said.

The scientists also visited families in Italy, Russia and Taiwan. The languages studied were Cha'palaa, Dutch, Icelandic, Italian, Lao, Mandarin Chinese, Murriny Patha, Russian, Siwu and Spanish. English wasn't included in the study.

Across these languages, they found a remarkable closeness among the "Huhs?" All the words had a single syllable. Typically, they had a sound like "ah" or "eh."

In the 10 languages, the word often started with an H. In Dutch it is "Heh?" Or it started with a glottal stop — the sound in the middle of "uh-oh."

## Same Meaning All Over The World

But, why wouldn't "Huh?" sound completely different in other languages?

The Dutch scientists think it's because the word developed in a particular place. And it fills a special need. The point is to quickly fix a broken conversation. The "Huh?" gets the speaker to fill in the listener's blank.

Saying "ah" or "eh" is very easy. This allows speakers to quickly signal that they missed information, and ask for it again. Sounds such as "ee" or "oo" need more effort. That's probably why they weren't chosen.  Scientists say "Huh?" developed because it's so useful.

"Huh?" has been invented by different languages on their own "many, many, times," said Mark Pagel. He teaches how language develops at the University of Reading in England. That's why it's used all over the world, he explained.
