BEIJING, China — Some residents took a smog holiday away from Beijing on Tuesday as the Chinese capital launched restrictions under its first red alert for pollution. Schools closed, factories stopped work and half of all vehicles were kept off the streets. 

Beijing has in recent years seen smog at much worse levels than Tuesday's. However, the latest bout of pollution was the first to trigger a red alert under a 2-year-old system. A red alert is announced when there is a weather forecast of at least 72 hours of consecutive high pollution.

The capital's hazardous smog has persisted despite the Chinese government's stated priority of cleaning up the pollution left from years of rapid economic growth. Most of the smog is blamed on coal-fired power plants. Vehicle emissions, construction and factory work are also to blame.  

"This is modern life for Beijing people. We wanted to develop, and now we pay the price," Beijing office worker Cao Yong said during a break from work.

## No Clear Skies For Miles

A gray, soupy haze surrounded Beijing's unique landmarks. Convenience stores sold air-filtering masks at brisk rates. Health-food stores promoted pear juice as a traditional Chinese tonic for the lungs.

"And air purifiers at home are a must," Beijing resident Sun Yuanyuan said at a downtown juice shop.

Under restrictions in effect Tuesday through Thursday, schools were closed. Some residents grumbled about the inconvenience, and a few international schools sought permission to reopen Wednesday.

Several residents said via social media they planned to escape the gloom. They would need to travel relatively far, however, because nearly all of China's northeast was affected. In fact, many cities — including nearby Shijiazhuang — were even worse than Beijing.

## Fine Particles Can Land In Lungs

After hearing of the school closings late Monday, Beijing resident Jiang Xia booked tickets for a 3,200-kilometer (2,000-mile) flight to the relatively clean southwestern city of Kunming. She brought along her 8-year-old daughter who she said suffers nosebleeds in the smog. She said in an interview from Kunming that they hectically packed before dawn Tuesday for their flight.

"But when we arrived in Kunming and breathed in this clean, fresh air, I was very glad I made this move," Jiang said.

Readings of PM2.5 particles climbed above 300 micrograms per cubic meter in some parts of the city Tuesday and were expected to continue rising before improving Thursday. Particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter are referred to as "fine" particles and are believed to pose the greatest health risks. Because they are so small, they can get stuck deep in the lungs. The World Health Organization (WHO) designates the safe level for the tiny, poisonous particles at 25 micrograms.  

This city of 22.5 million people is implementing several restrictions to reduce the dust and other particulate matter. Besides suspending factory operations, use of a car is restricted to every other day depending on its license plate. Officials planned to deploy extra subway trains and buses to compensate.

## This Isn't A First For Beijing

Some businesses closed and others said employees could work from home for the duration.

A Beijing resident who gave only his surname, Du, said he was taking advantage of a lack of crowds near the capital's ancient Forbidden City. He strolled the site taking unique photographs.

"I like this kind of haziness. It gives a blurry feeling and makes you feel like you're in a dream," Du said.

While the capital's air improved in the first 10 months of the year compared with the same period last year, it has suffered two recent prolonged bouts of severe smog. The condition is typically worse in the winter. During the last bout, PM2.5 levels reached as high as 976 in some locations.

## Pressures Led To Alert, Group Says

A red alert requires a forecast of 72 straight hours of pollution levels of 300 or higher on the city's air quality index. The index is closely linked to levels of PM2.5, although it also includes other pollutants. As an example, one Beijing monitoring site at midday showed an index reading of 308 and a PM2.5 reading of 258.

Previous stretches of severe smog have lasted more than three days but without any red alert. Beijing authorities said at the time that the initial forecasts were for less time so no alert was called for. However, critics maintained they were seeking to avoid the toughest restrictions for political reasons.

The environmental group Greenpeace said pressure from the central government and the public resulted in the Beijing city government releasing the red alert this time. 

## Study Links Early Deaths, Pollution

The WHO representative in China, Bernhard Schwartlaender, applauded Beijing's move. He said it's a sign that the city is taking air quality and health issues "very seriously."

China's polluted air has had severe health effects. A study conducted by Germany's Max Planck Institute and published in the journal Nature illustrates the extent of the problem. The study estimated that 1.4 million people die prematurely each year because of China's pollution.

China is the world's biggest carbon emitter. It plans to upgrade coal power plants over the next five years to tackle the problem. China says its emissions will peak by around 2030 before starting to decline. Charcoal briquette-burning ovens that were once a major contributor to pollution are now much less common in Beijing, although they are still widely used in the countryside.

Emissions standards have been tightened, and the government is investing money in solar, wind and other renewable energy. China, however, still depends on coal for more than 60 percent of its power.
