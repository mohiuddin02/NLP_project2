Bradley Manning passed along hundreds of thousands of secret papers when he was a private in the U.S. Army. When his actions were discovered, the military charged him with helping the enemy. On Tuesday a judge said he was not guilty of that crime.

Manning, 25, was still convicted of most of the other charges against him, including spying and theft. He still could spend a very long time in prison.

But the aiding the enemy charge was the most serious one. It could have sent him to prison for as long as he lived.

The case attracted a great deal of attention from the press and the public. It raised an important question: if you are in the army and promise not to tell secret information, is it OK to break the promise if you think the government is doing something wrong? Does the public have right to know the secret information?
## Gave Secrets To WikiLeaks

Manning was accused of the biggest leak of secret information in U.S. history. He admitted to giving more than 700,00 pages of documents and videos to the Web site WikiLeaks.

Manning has been in jail for three years. He already admitted to the other charges. Those charges have smaller sentences, but they could still add up to as much as about 130 years in prison, news groups said.

On Twitter, WikiLeaks called the possible sentence: "Dangerous national security extremism from the Obama administration."

The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, will decide Mannings' sentence on those crimes during a second part of the military trial, or court martial.

Lind did not explain the reasoning behind her decision. She said she would release detailed written findings, according to the Associated Press.

The sentencing hearing will begin Wednesday at Fort Meade, Maryland.
## Junior Intelligence Officer In Iraq

Military lawyers said that Manning is a "traitor" for sending the documents to the anti-secrecy Web site. Some of the information wound up in the hands of al-Qaida, prosecutors argued. Manning was a junior intelligence officer in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.

The documents included information about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The Web site also showed combat videos from an army helicopter gunship. A Reuters TV news cameraman and his driver were killed during the shooting that was shown. So were other people.

Army lawyers also said that Manning wanted to be famous. They said that he did not care about how the leaks could hurt U.S. safety. Or other soldiers.

The defense argued that Manning had the chance to get a lot more information to WikiLeaks. He only gave out some information. He wanted to get a conversation going about how the United States went about the wars, his lawyers said.

"I believed if the public was aware of the data, it would start a public debate of the wars," Manning said during his trial, according to media reports.

Some Manning supporters showed up outside Fort Meade. they carried sign. One sign read: "Stop the Wars Expose the Lies Free Bradley Manning," a Reuters video showed.
## A Closely Watched Case

One of Manning's lawyers briefly spoke to the supporters.

"We won the battle, now we need to go win the war," David Coombs said of the sentencing hearing, The Associated Press reported. "Today is a good day, but Bradley is by no means out of the fire."

Lots of people have been watching the case closely. They want to see how it could affect others who might leak state secrets in the United States.

Some people were concerned that a guilty ruling on the aiding the enemy charge could scare other people. They might be afraid to leak something, even if they thought it was really important to do so.

Even the "not guilty" decision on that charge offered only limited relief.

"Despite the lack of any evidence that he intended any harm to the United States, Manning faces decades in prison," said Elizabeth Goitein, a security expert at New York University School of Law. She called that "very scary."
## Another High-Profile Leak Case

The U.S. government is currently involved in another high-profile leak case.

National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden recently revealed efforts by the NSA to monitor cellphone and Internet traffic of American citizens. Snowden is currently stuck in a Russian airport. He is trying to get to another country to avoid U.S. criminal charges.

The Guardian newspaper is one of the main groups that received Snowden's leaks. It reported that Snowden said that one of the reasons he left the country was the way Manning was treated by the military.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange praised Manning's actions this week.

"Bradley Manning is a hero," he said to CNN.
