CAMDEN, N.J. — In Camden, New Jersey, a group of students want to use their computer skills to help their city thrive.

The students are part of Hopeworks 'N Camden, a program that offers technology and training classes to teenagers and young adults. At Hopeworks, youths learn how to design websites. At the same time, they gain life skills and experience to help them succeed.

This weekend, Hopeworks will host Camden's first ever "hackathon," an event in which computer programmers meet to work on projects together. It will be a marathon session of computer programming.

## Professionals, Meet The Next Generation

Computer professionals from around the country will come to Camden to be a part of the hackathon. Some of them work for the car company Subaru, which plans to move its North American headquarters to Camden.

Hopeworks students will work alongside these professionals. The hackathon will give them a chance to advance their programming skills and make connections to help them build their own careers in technology.

At the same time, the hackathon will benefit Camden. The city was once a major manufacturing center, but many of Camden's factories have shut down, eliminating thousands of jobs. Today, Camden is one of the country's poorest and most dangerous cities.

## Students Step Up To Help Nonprofits

The students at Hopeworks want to help change that. During the hackathon, teams will work on designing new websites for four nonprofit groups. One of them is the Mayor's Youth Council, which is dedicated to improving services for Camden's youth.

Dan Rhoten is in charge of running Hopeworks. He hopes that the hackathon will show how much the people of Camden can accomplish. "Camden can produce a lot of things," he said. He added that he hoped the hackathon would inspire young people by showing them that students of all backgrounds can build careers in technology.

Rhoten said he plans to hold hackathons every six months or so. Camden government agencies and nonprofit groups will be able to request projects in advance. For example, the city might want one of its websites to be updated. Hackathon programmers could make it happen in a single weekend.

## City's Situation Looking Up — And Hackathon Is Part Of That

This weekend's hackathon comes at a time when Camden is undergoing many changes. The state government has taken over the school district and is changing the way some schools are operated. The Camden County government has taken over policing the city and has a bigger force of officers than the city had.

Meanwhile, the state is offering tax credits for businesses that move into the city. The companies will basically get money to move there. Along with Subaru, American Water, and a company called Holtec are all setting up operations in the city. The Philadelphia 76ers basketball team is building a training facility there.

The tech students at Hopeworks see the arrival of these businesses as a good thing. The youths help Camden improve, too, Rhoten said. They can show that the people of Camden can help fix their city. They do not need to rely solely on outsiders.

## Planting Seeds To Assure City's Future Growth

One Hopeworks student is 23-year-old Gabrielle Lee. She wants to leave Camden, but she hopes to return later to teach English as a second language. She said that being at Hopeworks has made her want to share her skills.

Another Hopeworks student, 21-year-old West Lalanne, said that hackathons can bring people together.

"Right now Camden is a world where we have small communities," he said, "but we don't have a large community."
