BAKER, Nev. — It is quiet here, deep below the earth's surface. The beam from Paul Kemp's headlamp slices through the shadows. It helps him discover evidence of the explorers who have come down into this strange world.

Kemp is a 67-year-old retired rocket engineer. He uses his tiny brush to gently clear away the fluff and grit coating a clutch of stalactites hanging from the ceiling of Lehman Cave.

It is man-made dirt — clothing fibers, hair, dead skin and dust left by 28,000 visitors a year. He carefully collects his catch in a blue dustpan and puts it in a plastic bag the size of an office trash can. It's filling fast.

"Oh, my God," Kemp says. "These formations are terrible. They're simply covered with dust."

## Sign Up For Lint Camp

Kemp and his 14-year-old son, Simon, are volunteers in a National Park Service program known as Lint Camp. They perform one of America's strangest natural chores — cleaning a handful of caves popular with crowds of tourists.

The father-son team from Sandy, Utah, joined several cavers who left the warm sunlight to go down into this deep cave. Cavers are people who explore caves for fun. They entered a cave room of limestone and marble that was full of mysterious shapes and shadows. The temperature in the cave is a cool 52 degrees. Bats, scorpions — without stingers — and tiny creatures called springtails hide inside.

The pair duck beneath low ledges to reach an area known as the Wedding Chapel. There, Paul Kemp hops on top of a ledge and reaches toward a strange grouping of ancient rock formations more than 1 million years old. They are stalactites, hanging like icicles from the ceiling, and stalagmites — like icicles coming up from the floor. There are also other forms named for their color or shape: cave bacon, shields and popcorn.

## Messes Were Made Over Time

Each year, crowds of cavers gather at various caves. Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky, and this one in Nevada. Their job is to wipe away the dirt that can threaten both the formations and the creatures that live in the caves.

The cave is part of Great Basin National Park, in the desert between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. It is named after Absalom Lehman, a miner, who officially discovered it in 1885. Many, however, believe Native Americans used the cave ages before that.

The cave became a national memorial in 1922. The 2-mile-long cavern is 200 feet below ground at its lowest point. During Prohibition, when the sale of alcohol was not allowed in America, Lehman Cave served as a secret bar and even had a dance floor.

Walls were once blasted through for a new exit. Officials brought in sandbags to protect the formations and that left sand everywhere.

## Lint Everywhere

Every so often, the cave must be cleaned. During the three-day Lint Camp, two dozen volunteers from three states worked here. They took out a ton of scrap including concrete chunks from paths removed during cave repair work.

Cave visitors are not allowed to touch the formations. However, fibers, skin cells and hair build up anyway. Ben Roberts, the park's chief, calls lint a human problem that humans must clean up.

His feeling about the cave is that "it's just like any camping trip — if you pack it in, you pack it out."

The volunteers trudge deeper into the earth. They wear miner's helmets and carry large paint cans filled with brushes, gloves and tweezers.

It's a Friday morning and just eight cavers are here. Another 20 will arrive the next day. Roberts leads some cavers for the more important repair work.

## Slow, Steady Work

"Lint pickers follow me," park official Gretchen Baker says to the rest.

Park workers explain the rules: Don't touch anything without gloves. Oils from human skin can alter the growth of the delicate formations, already slow at 1-inch a century. And no food. One dropped crumb could cause an explosion of bacteria and affect the cave's formations.

Baker's group starts slowly, nervous about touching the rock. The work often requires a magnifying glass and tweezers when the lint sticks to rocks like cobwebs.

Poer, who is from California, began caving in 2001. She asked: "How clean do I need to make this?"

"Just the major stuff," Baker says.

"I just don't know where to stop," Poer says.

As she brushes off the lint, the formations seem to come alive. No longer a dull bone color, many seem to sparkle.
