On June 28, 2009, the world-famous physicist Stephen Hawking threw a party, complete with balloons, appetizers and champagne. Everyone was invited but no one showed up. Hawking had expected that, because he only sent out invitations after his party had ended. It was, he said, "a welcome reception for future time travelers." He was joking, but it was also an experiment to prove his belief that travel into the past is impossible.

Hawking may be wrong. New experiments say time travel could be possible — at least in the world of math. Proving that time travel is possible would change classical physics and allow for super-fast types of computers that use quantum physics, also called quantum mechanics.

Briefly, classical physics deals with the big things, like the Sun and Moon. Quantum mechanics tells us that the things described in classical physics are affected by things even smaller than atoms. For instance, a ray of light is actually made up of tiny packets of energy.

## CTC: Closed Timelike Curve

Some think time travel is possible because physics says it should be, based on Einstein's theory of general relativity. His famous theory describes gravity as the bending of space and time, which are one thing called "spacetime."

To understand that, imagine you and a friend stretch a blanket out between the two of you. That blanket is "spacetime." Space and time are part of the same fabric. Then someone drops a marble onto the blanket and it sinks a bit. The marble is like a planet, or anything with mass.

The mass of planets affects and bends spacetime, with big effects for time. Events that happen at the same time for one observer could happen at different times for another.

So, what does this mean for time travel? Instead of the marble bending spacetime, imagine a powerful gravitational field. One example would be a spinning black hole. It could make spacetime bend back on itself, and close off into a tube, creating a "closed timelike curve," or CTC. People could use this loop, or tube, to travel back in time.

Hawking and many other physicists don't like the idea of CTCs. Anything traveling through one would create paradoxes. Even if you can go back in time, how can you come back to the future and have it be the same?

## "The Grandfather Paradox"

Think about science fiction movies. When someone travels back in time their actions change the future, and may even prevent themselves from being born. Cause and effect fall apart.

In 1991, physicist David Deutsch said he knew how to fix paradoxes caused by CTCs. He said the answer was at the tiniest quantum level. The key was fundamental particles, like quarks which are inside protons. Physicists believe fundamental particles are the smallest parts of matter. Now, they may be made of smaller parts or not, but we can't see that far. Deutsch came up with a theory to send these particles back in time.

Recently, Ralph and his student Martin Ringbauer tested Deutsch's model of CTCs. They investigated how Deutsch deals with the "grandfather paradox." In this imaginary situation someone uses a CTC to travel back through time to murder her own grandfather. In turn, this prevents her own birth.

## What About Tiny Particles?

Here is how Deutsch fixes the grandfather paradox:

Obviously, Deutsch can't send a human back in time to kill her grandfather. Instead he imagines a particle going back in time to flip a switch on the machine that created it. If the particle flips the switch, the machine shoots a particle—the particle—back into the CTC. If the switch isn't flipped, the machine shoots out nothing.

It is not certain the particle will be shot out. It is only one probability, or chance. Deutsch thinks that tiny quantum particles are stable and fixed. If true, any particle entering one end of a CTC must come out the other end exactly the same. Imagine a particle shot out by the machine with a probability of one half. It would enter the CTC and come out the other end to flip the switch with a probability of one half.

By doing so it would give itself at birth a probability of one half of going back to flip the switch. If the particle were a person, she would be born with a one-half probability of killing her grandfather. In turn, her grandfather would have a one-half probability of not being killed by her. That's good enough in terms of probability to escape the paradox. This strange solution agrees with the laws of quantum physics.

Ralph and Ringbauer simulated Deutsch's model using pairs of light particles (photons), though they didn't actually send a photon through a CTC. "Of course, we're not really sending anything back in time," Ralph says.

## Mathematical Stunt Doubles

But they say it is mathematically the same. The second photon is meant to be a past version of the first. It is like they created a stunt double, or clone, of a person. Then they ran him through a time-loop simulator. By the end of the experiment, the second photon should end up being identical to the first photon as it was at the beginning of the experiment. Essentially the past version turns into the present one over time.

The second photon meets the first — itself from the future. At that point they are as different as a woman and her grandfather. Then the fake CTC goes on. At the end of it the second photon is identical to the first, which means it could not go back in time and meet its old self. The loop works without paradox.

Ringbauer says their test could have huge effects for computing. New quantum computers could be much faster than regular computers. Typical computing uses either 0's or 1's. Quantum computing can use either ones and zeros, or both at the same time.

CTCs would make computing even faster, says physicist Todd Brun. "But this experiment cannot test the Deutsch model itself." A real CTC would be needed for that.

## Guests From Future? Don't Hold Your Breath

Deutsch's model isn't the only one, though. In 2011 physicist Seth Lloyd tested a simpler model of CTCs. It solves the grandfather paradox using quantum teleportation and post-selection. Quantum teleportation is a bit like the teleporter in Star Trek, when Scotty beams Spock up from other planets. But that's where the similarity ends. Quantum teleportation only beams around the tiniest bits of information.

Post-selection refers to discarding experimental runs where something you wanted to happen didn't happen.

Deutsch's theory sends the time traveler back to a parallel universe. Lloyd says a time traveler coming from Deutsch's CTC "enters a universe that has nothing to do with the one she exited." Post-selection lets the time traveler return "to the same universe that she remembers."

Lloyd's model would make CTCs much less powerful for computing than Deutsch's. However, they would still be far superior to what computers can achieve now. Lloyd's model could solve problems at the level of "finding needles in haystacks," Lloyd says. "But a computer in a Deutschian CTC could solve why haystacks exist in the first place."

Lloyd, though, admits how wild the idea of CTCs is. "I have no idea which model is really right. Probably both of them are wrong," he says. Of course, he adds, the other possibility is that Hawking is correct, "that CTCs simply don't and cannot exist." Time-travel party planners should save the champagne for themselves — no guests from the future seem likely to arrive.
