Mars is mostly cold and dry now. Scientists think that long ago it was warm and full of water. A new spacecraft just arrived at Mars to study why it changed.

Earth is surrounded by air. Our air is actually a layer of gases called the atmosphere. The gasses include oxygen, which we breathe.

Earth's thick atmosphere traps heat from the sun. It keeps Earth warm and stores water vapor, which makes life possible. On Mars, the atmosphere is very thin. In fact, it is 100 times thinner than Earth's atmosphere.

However, scientists think that Mars once had a much thicker atmosphere. They believe this because Mars had rivers and lakes long ago. Water is not likely to be found on a planet with a thin atmosphere.

So where did the thick Martian atmosphere go? Solving that mystery is the goal of the spacecraft Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN).

## Taking Measurements

MAVEN was launched by NASA, which runs the U.S. space program. It went into orbit around Mars on Sept. 21.

A big question about Mars is whether there was ever life there. If Mars did once have a thick atmosphere, that would have made life more likely. Life on Mars would also have needed water. All life on Earth needs water too.

MAVEN will measure the atmosphere on Mars now. Scientists will then use those measurements to understand its past atmosphere. The goal is to figure out what was once there and how it was lost.

MAVEN took 10 months to reach Mars. Another spacecraft will soon get there. India's Mars Orbiter should arrive on Sept. 24. If all goes well, Mars Orbiter will make history. It will be the first Asian spacecraft to reach Mars.

## Sharing Information

MAVEN will only study Mars' upper atmosphere. The Indian mission will be larger. It will study the planet's surface and its atmosphere. India and NASA are very interested in sharing the information they discover, said NASA's Jim Green.

Mars' thin atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. It also contains small amounts of other gasses. Some of these are nitrogen, argon and oxygen.

Scientists have two possible explanations for how most of Mars' atmosphere escaped. The first is that it sank into the planet's crust. The other is that it floated up into space.

For clues, MAVEN will watch to see how gas is currently stripped off the top of the atmosphere. Scientists think wind blows atmospheric gas into space.

## "Our Next Big Step"

MAVEN is the latest attempt to understand Mars. NASA has two other spacecraft orbiting Mars. It also has two rovers, like small cars. They drive around Mars and record information. Europe's Mars Express orbiter is the only other spacecraft currently at the planet.

Scientists hope MAVEN will help them figure out if life could ever have existed on Mars.

Then scientists have another goal. Eventually, they want to send astronauts to Mars.

"This is our next big step on our journey to Mars," NASA's Bruce Jakosky said. MAVEN and other missions "are blazing the trail for us." Every bit of information brings us closer to the big day: when humans first walk upon the surface of the Red Planet.
