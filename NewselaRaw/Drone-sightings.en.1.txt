WASHINGTON —  More than a million small drone aircraft have been sold in the past few years. A growing number of them, though, are turning up in the skies near airports and airliners, posing a risk of collision.

Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) piloted either by onboard computers or remotely by a person on the ground.

Reports of drone sightings near other planes, helicopters and airfields are reaching the government almost daily, say federal and industry officials.

It's a sharp increase from just two years ago when reports of the unmanned aircraft were still unusual.

## Bird, Plane Or Drone?

Many of the reports are filed with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by airline pilots. But other pilots, airport officials and local authorities often file reports as well. The officials agreed to discuss the matter only on the condition that they not be named because they were not given permission to speak publicly. Michael Toscano, president of a group representing the drone industry, said FAA officials also have verified the increase to him.

Some of the pilots may have mistaken a bird or another plane in the distance for a drone. However, officials said that other reports appear to be believable.

The reports underscore the difficulty the FAA faces trying to control drones. They pose a big danger to aircraft. A drone could could cause a crash if it collided with a plane or was sucked into an engine. Small drones usually are not visible on radar to air traffic controllers, particularly if they are made of plastic or other nonmetallic materials.

The agency's near-total ban on their use has been ignored by businesspeople ranging from real estate agents to farmers who use them to monitor crops. Rules to allow broader use of drones by businesses are expected to be proposed before the end of the year.

"It should not be a matter of luck that keeps an airplane and a drone apart," said Rory Kay. He is a trainer at a major airline and a former Air Line Pilots Association safety committee chairman. "So far we've been lucky."

## Danger Zones

The FAA requires that drone and model aircraft operators must fly under 400 feet in altitude. They must keep the aircraft within sight and stay at least 5 miles away from an airport. Small drones are often indistinguishable from model aircraft.

Commercial operators and government officials from police to research scientists must obtain special FAA permission to fly drones.  Exceptions are made for some government drones. The military flies drones in huge areas of airspace in remote areas.  The federal Customs and Border Protection department flies high-altitude drones along the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada to watch for people trying to cross the borders illegally.

In March, Jim Williams, who heads the FAA drone office, caused a stir when he said that an airplane nearly collided with a drone over Tallahassee, Florida. He told a drone industry conference that the pilot of a 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet reported a camouflage-painted drone at an altitude of about 2,300 feet, 5 miles northeast of the airport. The FAA has not been able to find the drone or identify its operator.

## Some Other Recent Incidents

— The pilots of a regional airline flying at about 10,000 feet reported seeing at least one drone pass less than 500 feet above the plane. It was moving slowly to the south toward Allegheny County Airport near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The drone was described as black and gray with a thin body, about 5 feet to 6 feet long.

— Air traffic controllers in Burbank, California, received a report from a helicopter pilot. The pilot reported a camera-equipped drone flying near the giant Hollywood sign.

— Controllers in Florida received a report from the pilots of an Airbus A319 airliner that they had spotted a drone below the plane at about 11,000 feet. The drone was described as having a red vertical stabilizer and blue body. It was not detected on radar.

— Pilots reported spotting a drone 500 feet to 1,000 feet away from the plane during a landing at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina. The drone was described as the size of a large bird.

— A 5-foot-long drone with a camera crashed near Dallas Love Field in Texas. Police said they were looking for the operator.

## Safety Risks Involved

The FAA tries to follow up on some of the reports to educate operators about safety, the agency said in a statement. Some irresponsible operators have been threatened with fines.

Michael Toscano heads the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a drone industry trade group. He said that with so many drones in the sky it is unavoidable that some people will misuse them because they don't understand the safety risks or simply do not care.

"As unfortunate as it would be that we have an incident, it's not going to shut down the industry," he said.
