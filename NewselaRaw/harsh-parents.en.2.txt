PHILADELPHIA â€” All mothers and fathers may occasionally grab their child's arm or speak too roughly.

Rich parents do this as well as poor ones. But low-income parents, who struggle with the problems of hunger or joblessness or poor housing, act this way more often. And their  children suffer in ways science is just beginning to understand, researchers say.

Harsh parenting is not legally defined as child abuse. But it causes tremendous worry in children, researchers say. It changes the structure of their brains and the way their brains work. It increases the chances of bad behavior and may lead to heart disease and other health problems down the road.

"This is an incredibly important public health issue," said Joan Luby. She is a professor of psychiatry at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and has studied 145 children over 12 years. She wrote an article about the effect of poverty on children's brains in the journal JAMA Pediatrics in October.

## Effects Of Harsh Parenting

Think of harsh parenting as being as destructive as lead poisoning, said Daniel Taylor. He is a pediatrician at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in North Philadelphia.

This kind of parenting often involves "quick 'do-as-I-say' orders from Mom or Dad," Taylor said. Without the buffering effect of a loving, supportive attitude from the parent, the child's brain releases stress hormones, such as cortisol. Stress hormones are released when the body feels threatened or in danger. These hormones are toxic, or dangerous, for developing brains.

They can cause damage to a child's amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. The child may become hyperactive, get into fights, have a short attention span, and cannot calm himself down, Taylor said.

Toxic stress also can damage the hippocampus, a part of the brain that affects memory, he said. So these children may have trouble remembering things. It reduces their ability to read and do well on tests.

If toxic hormones are released constantly, children will suffer elevated blood pressure, sugar levels and heart rate. This puts them at high risk for developing heart disease, said Marcy Witherspoon. She is a social worker and expert in child welfare and brain development.

Harsh parenting crosses the boundaries of race and income. But low-income parents, who struggle with worries from hunger or joblessness or poor housing, seem to treat their children harshly more often. Taylor and others believe that poor neighborhoods hold generations of families suffering the effects of harsh parenting.

"If a child's developing brain was being damaged by high lead levels, landlords would be sued, houses repaired," Taylor said. Lead used to be an ingredient in house paint that would get in children's bodies and damage their brains. "If a child's brain was being damaged by mercury in the water, the system would be changed."

Taylor asked, "Who is going to pay, who is responsible for ensuring our children are not affected by the (poison) of child poverty in America?"

## Suffered From Toxic Stress

Dave, a man who was brought up in poverty, recently participated in a parenting workshop run by Witherspoon. Growing up, he suffered toxic stress from his mother who constantly yelled and cursed at him.

Now he is a single father who lives in Philadelphia with his two young children.

"My mother would always tell me I'd never amount to anything," Dave said. "I was depressed."

Dave said he is scared he'd pass along toxic stress to his children. "There are only two ways you come out of a situation like mine," Dave said. "You're either a victim and let the bad experiences control you, or you become better in spite of it."

He believes he has avoided passing down toxic stress to his kids.

Dave said he is proud that even if he is angry with his children, he doesn't embarrass them.

"I don't say they're bad, only that they're doing something bad. I control myself," Dave said.

## Emotional Neglect Hurts Too

Not all poor children suffer from toxic stress.

Some parents do a good job of protecting their children's brains by being involved and paying attention to them, said Maria McColgan. She is the medical director of the Child Protection Program at St. Christopher's.

On the other hand, middle-class people can cause toxic stress in their children, a 1998 California study showed.

More recently, a Philadelphia study showed that more than 33 percent of Philadelphia adults experienced emotional abuse during childhood. High levels of abuse goes along with high poverty.

But parents don't have to treat their children harshly to do damage. A poor mother distracted by lack of food can be unable to connect with her children. This emotional neglect can also cause toxic stress, said Bruce McEwen. He is a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York.

Despite the pain of toxic stress, there is some good news: "You can heal from it," said Witherspoon, the expert on brain development.

"As long as one adult in a child's life has his back, believes in him, creates hope for the future, that's a positive," she said.

In Witherspoon's parenting classes, she helps parents to understand how they create toxic stress in their children because they themselves were victims of it. That knowledge can stop the cycle.

Parents need advocacy, empathy and support, said Witherspoon. That way, they stop taking their worries out on their kids.

"To help," Witherspoon said, "I say to parents, 'Life sounds really hard. Tell me about it.'"
