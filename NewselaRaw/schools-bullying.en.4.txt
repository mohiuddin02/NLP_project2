CHICAGO — Last year, kids pushed 11-year-old Ronan Schuelke and called him names in the school lunchroom. He didn't know what to do.

Now Ronan is the star of a music video at his school. It is based on a popular Katy Perry song. His video teaches respect.

Ronan attends Stratford Middle School in Bloomingdale, Illinois.

The video is just part of the plan to stop bullying. Ronan and other student leaders will reward classmates who try to stop bullying. Kids will also get rewards if they do things for others. A student may get a small prize for telling a classmate to stop picking on someone. Eating lunch with a new kid also will earn a prize.

## "Stallion Medallions"

The awards are called "Stallion Medallions." They are named for the school's mascot. They can be traded for things like school supplies or play tickets.

"I think this is something the kids will pick up … and maybe try it," Ronan said of the idea.

Stratford and many other schools now take bullying very seriously.

In the past, schools did not know what to do about bullying. Now, many schools across Illinois are trying to stop it in its tracks. Teaching respect is an important part of this.

It works better than saying "Don't be a bully," said Brian Meyer. He works for a state center that helps schools prevent bullying.

Schools know that any child may be a bully. Also, any child may be picked on. The way the program works is that kids help point out problems at their schools. Then everyone at the school is trained in a program called "Stop, Walk and Talk." They learn exactly what they should say and do to stop bullying.

## School Anti-Bullying Programs

Many educators and researchers like the program. They say it reduces bullying. Others worry that giving prizes for being nice sends the wrong message. Being kind to others should be its own reward, they say. They also do not believe it works in the long run. As soon as the reward ends, the good behavior also could stop, they say.

More than 20 percent of children are involved in bullying. The number of children involved in bullying surprised people.

Twenty years ago, people thought bullying was rare. Few parents asked schools to protect their children. When bullying became linked to violence, parents got involved, said Dorothy Espelage. She studies bullying at the University of Illinois.

People now have a better understanding of bullying. Forty-nine states say schools have to have anti-bullying programs, Espelage said.

Schoolwide programs work best, studies show. Educators now realize that all students must learn to be kind to each other. Many schools ask the state network for help.

## Neon-Orange "Expect Respect" T-Shirt

All eight Bloomingdale schools have a plan to stop bullying. Students belong to Expect Respect Clubs. They get rewards for doing good. They also will watch the anti-bullying video, said Julie Augustyn. She works for the Bloomingdale schools.

There is no easy way to stop bullying, said Catherine Bradshaw. She teaches at John Hopkins University. But there is hope, she said. Last year, Bradshaw helped write a report on the anti-bullying program. Many Maryland schools with the program saw a big drop in bullying.

"There aren't any quick, easy solutions that are going to happen after one hour or an afternoon," she said.

Chintan Dave had a goal when he joined Stratford's Expect Respect Club. He is 13 years old. Two years ago, he took a different bus home from school after he was mocked for his Indian accent.

When school started this year, he wore his neon-orange "Expect Respect" T-shirt with high hopes. "I don't want anyone to go through what I went through," he said.
