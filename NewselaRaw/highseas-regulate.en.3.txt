For the first time in history, the countries of the world agreed to protect the high seas.

The high seas lay beyond a country's coastal waters. It represents about 58 percent of our planet's oceans. Its rich marine life is dying off.

"It's an important step forward." says Daniela Diz. She is a marine policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund.

The high seas plan has come not a moment too soon. The Census of Marine Life estimated that 90 percent of some types of large fish, such as tuna and swordfish, have disappeared from the seas. The census is a 10-year-long study of the globe's oceans.

## Threats To The Oceans

Dangerous fishing methods cause much of the threat to the high seas. Most of the deep-sea fishing is done by heavy nets, which are scraped across the seafloor. These nets destroy everything in their path, including the deepwater corals and sponges that give shelter to fish. Much of the fish and sealife caught up in the nets are thrown back dead.

The high seas faces other problems, as well. They include underwater oil and gas drilling and pollution caused by plastics.

To prevent this, the countries agreed to develop a set of rules. The rules would also make it much easier to establish marine protected areas.

The protected areas are the oceans' national parks. They can be different in size and level of protection. Twelve percent of the world's land is currently protected in national parks and wildlife preserves. But just about 1 percent of the high seas is protected. The high seas plan is to increase this number to 10 percent by 2020 and eventually to 30 percent.

## Rules For The High Seas

"The new agreement will be about what we keep in the seas," instead of what we take out, says Karen Sack. She is the director of The Pew Charitable Trusts' International Marine Program. Sack has been involved in the high seas plan's discussions since they began in 2004.

A jumble of institutions and regulations have control over the high seas. There is the International Maritime Organization for shipping. The International Seabed Authority is in charge of mining. For fishing, it is the Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. A recent report by the Global Ocean Commission found that these groups do not work together. There are too many rules and no coordination, making it almost impossible to safeguard the high seas.

The commission said the rules should begin within five years. Otherwise, the high seas should be closed to fishing.

This would actually help coastal countries, says RÃ©mi Parmentier, an official with the commission. Right now, many of them are losing money. Fish are being killed off by high-seas fishing fleets before they can get to the coasts. This is especially the case in West Africa.

Matthew Gianni is the co-founder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition. He worries that a closure may lead countries to start fishing beyond their coastal waters. Countries have special rights over the fish and other resources in their coastal waters. This coastal zone extends 200 nautical miles into the ocean. The high seas lay beyond this point, in international waters.

## Helping Coastal Countries

Yet, there seems to be scientific evidence backing up Parmentier's point of view.

Earlier in February, the University of British Columbia (UBC) released a report. It found that closing the high seas would help countries catch more fish. The fish would breed in the high seas and be caught closer to the coasts.

The high seas would become the "biggest savings account on the planet," the report said. Not every country would be helped by the plan. Major fishing nations, such as Japan and South Korea, would lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year.

However, there may be no need for closing down the high seas to fishing. An agreement would protect important parts of the high seas.

"I realize what we have lost," says Enric Sala, co-author of the UBC paper and a deep-sea diver. "I also see what the ocean of the future can be."
