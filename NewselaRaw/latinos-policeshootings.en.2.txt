LOS ANGELES — Kris Ramirez never disliked the police when he was growing up. The sight of police cars driving through his Southeast Los Angeles neighborhood did not make him nervous or angry.

"If someone is wearing a uniform," Ramirez said, "you show respect."

Then last October, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy shot and killed his brother, Oscar Jr., along railroad tracks near Paramount High School. Officers said the 28-year-old did not follow orders and moved his arm in "a threatening manner." Ramirez was not carrying a weapon.

The Ramirez family protested in front of the Paramount police station. However, they were not able to win much support for their cause.

Meanwhile, the national Black Lives Matter movement had begun taking off. Black Lives Matter is dedicated to protesting the deaths of African Americans at the hands of police. In Los Angeles, support for the movement grew after the fatal police shooting of a black man, Ezell Ford.

As he watched the protests over Ford's killing, Kris Ramirez felt frustrated: "Why can't we get that same type of coverage or help?"

## More Attention For Killings Of Blacks

Deaths of Latinos at the hands of police have not drawn nearly as much attention as the killings of African-Americans Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Yet, such deaths are common.

Of the 23 people fatally shot by police in Los Angeles County this year, 14 were Latino.

Those deaths have gone relatively unnoticed. There has been little protest within Latino communities in the Los Angeles area and little attention around the country.

## A Different History For Blacks, Latinos

There are several explanations for this lack of a strong response.

Latino and black experiences with law enforcement in the United States are very different. Throughout history, no group has experienced police mistreatment as much as African-Americans. Latinos do not have that same long history.

Latinos are also a large and visible part of law enforcement in Southern California. Within the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), 45 percent of officers are Latino. Only around 11 percent of LAPD's officers are black.

A lot of the police patrolling L.A.'s largely Latino Eastside neighborhoods are Latinos themselves, and many were raised in the area.

Overall, support for police is strong in the greater Eastside.

## Different Churches Play Different Roles

There are also important differences between black and Latino churches. Black churches have played a large part in capturing attention for the Black Lives Matter movement. In the Catholic churches many Latinos attend, priests do not talk about police killing Latinos.

What parents tell their children also differs. Many blacks counsel their children to be especially careful around police, and warn them they may run into trouble even when they have not done anything wrong. Latino parents do not usually give their children the same kinds of warnings.

Yolanda Dominguez told her son to get good grades, obey traffic laws and avoid gangs. When it came to dealing with the police, however, she had no special advice for him.

"My message has always been don't get involved in anything bad," Dominguez said. Staying out of trouble is the best way to avoid problems with the police, she said.

In any case, the police do not set out to kill people, Dominguez said. She said she thinks of U.S. police positively, especially compared to those in her native Mexico.

## A Mind-Your-Own-Business Approach

Lawyer Luis Carrillo said many Latinos have a "don't rock the boat" mentality. It comes from the fact that governments and police in many Latin American countries are very harsh. Protesting can get a person in serious trouble, so people learn to mind their own business and say nothing.

The mind-your-own business approach can leave families of people killed by police feeling alone.

It is a feeling Kris Ramirez knows well — one he said he still struggles with.

## Oscar's Memory Lives On

The shooting death of Kris's brother last October seemed to come out of nowhere. Shortly before he was killed, a 12-year-old girl told her mother that she had seen two men carrying a knife and handgun. Oscar Ramirez matched the suspects' description. Police say he fled when they tried to question him.

The family denies the official story. They say Oscar Ramirez never posed any threat to the police and that four or five bullets struck him in the back. They filed a lawsuit against the Sheriff's Department in April.

No mater what happens in court, Oscar's memory will live on in the minds of his family.

On what would have been Oscar's 29th birthday in June, his father planted a tree near the train tracks.
