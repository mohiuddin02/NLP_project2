INDIAN LAND, S.C. â€” North and South Carolina used to be places where a lot of textiles were made. Factories there produced things like cloth. They made clothes, bedding and other fabrics.

Then factories started closing in the late 1990s. Companies wanted cheaper materials and workers they could pay less. Thousands of people lost their jobs. The jobs went to places like China, Brazil and Vietnam.

Now, some jobs are coming back. Keer is a Chinese textile company. It is building factories to make yarn in Lancaster County, South Carolina. It will create more than 500 jobs.

Chinese companies are looking to make fabric in the United States. They are attracted by lower costs for energy, cotton and land. The companies are also worried about rising cost of paying workers in China.

## Happy To Have Jobs Returning

Wally Wang works for Keer America. He believes more Chinese textile companies and other manufacturers will follow Keer to the United States.

That would be welcomed in Lancaster County.

Carolyn Summers worked for Springs Industries in Lancaster for 42 years. She was laid off in 2005. Her daughter lost her job two years later. Summers said she was "in total shock" the day she heard the news.

Springs Mills in Lancaster once employed close to 20,000 people. In 2007, the last South Carolina textile factory closed.

Lancaster County lost 11,000 textile jobs from 1995 to 2007.

At least 140 employees will begin working at Keer's new site starting in spring. Most will make yarn. There will be 32 production lines.

Keer is moving part of its yarn production to Lancaster. It will spend $218 million to do this.

## Two Factories Mean More Jobs

While the first plant operates, construction workers will start building a second factory. The construction will take less than 18 months. After that, Keer plans to build two more factories.

A South Carolina program is helping Keer find and train local works. These include electricians, technicians and people to sell fabric. One-third of the people applying are former textile workers.

Textile mills came to the Carolinas 200 years ago because of cotton. And cotton is bringing them back again.

The cost to manufacture in China has risen in the past few years. Keer looked at Vietnam, India and Pakistan. It decided to come to the Carolinas.

Keer had been using American cotton for years. It simply moved closer to be able to use more.

Wang said South Carolina has many benefits. "It is a state built on manufacturing," he said. Workers are also used to working at all hours. Not many people belong to unions. Electricity is inexpensive and works.

Everything is cheaper but labor, Wang said.

## More Companies Are Visiting Here

It is still cheaper to make clothes in China, said professor Yingjiao Xu of N.C. State University. Making clothes requires a lot of labor, she said. Labor costs less in China. Manufacturing yarn and cloth, however, is done by machines. U.S. sites are cheaper for that because energy costs less.

The Chinese government started loaning companies money to spend outside China.

Now, there are 20 to 25 Chinese companies visiting South Carolina each year, one official said. They are looking spend money here.

Wang said Chinese business spending in the United States "was like water drops." Now, he said, "there's a little stream flowing."
