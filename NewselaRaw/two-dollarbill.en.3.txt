The $2 bill does not get a lot of respect. It is more likely to be found tucked inside a dresser drawer or wallet than a cash register.

Of all paper money that goes from wallet to cash register, only 3 percent is made up of $2 bills.

Now, it's about to get its time in the spotlight. John Bennardo of Florida is making a nonfiction film that will tell the story of the two and its "magic."

"I think everyone's curious about it," he said. "When you spend one, there's always a reaction."

The bill has Thomas Jefferson on the front and the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the back, but it is more than just a collector's item. It's a piece of a longtime Clemson University tradition, for example. It is also a tool used to show a group's economic influence.

## Twos Are Special To Some

Many people save $2 bills. Others make a point to spend them. They want to see what happens next.

Bennardo owns Immagine Productions and is a Lynn University professor of film and television editing. He has always saved the bills. By last summer he had 11 of them in a desk drawer. They were never to be spent. It got him thinking: What is it about the two?

And "The 2 Dollar Bill Documentary" was born.

Amy Byer Shainman also lives in Florida and cares a lot about the bill. She joined on as a producer of the film. She said she has kept a two her high school crush gave her for more than 25 years. She did not know why.

Bennardo raised about $18,000 for the project online. Then he got to work last summer.

Some of his stops were in South Florida. In Delray Beach, he talked to a man who turns $2 bills into art. He also filmed American Healthy Vending in Miami. The company explained why most machines don't take twos.

## People Like To Talk About The Two

Beyond that, he has traveled to several states. Among them were Texas, New York, Michigan and Oregon. He has interviewed about 50 people in all.

One is Heather McCabe of New York City. She requests $2 bills from her bank and spends them at local businesses in hopes of seeing it catch on. She writes about how people react on her blog, Two Buckaroo.

McCabe, 39, started spending twos about 15 years ago. She liked the added conversation with people behind the counter.

"It became something a little more special," she said. "And plus, it always felt like an experiment, like, 'What's going to happen when I spend this $2 bill?' It never gets old."

Most people smile at the sight of the unusual bill and share a story about their experiences with it, McCabe said. Some take two singles out of their own wallets so they can pocket the deuce. Others refuse it, though McCabe said that's the least common outcome.

## Lots Of Twos To Go Around

The federal government began printing $2 bills in 1862. Many people mistakenly think it was removed from the money supply. Because of that, you can find regular old $2 bills offered for up to double their value on eBay, when they can easily be picked up at the bank for, well, $2.

There was a 10-year period that the government stopped printing twos. But that ended in 1976, when they were brought back to celebrate 200 years of U.S. independence.

If they had just disappeared, Bennardo said, "we wouldn't have this great piece of Americana saved. And I wouldn't have a movie."

As of last year there were a billion $2 bills floating around in pockets, wallets and cash registers, according to the Federal Reserve. Forty-five million more were printed in October at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Texas. Bennardo was there, filming.

## Fans Support It

The two is well loved by some groups and businesses.

Several groups have used them to prove their importance. Bennardo interviewed supporters of legalizing medical marijuana in Michigan, who deliberately spent twos around the state to show their spending power.

Similar campaigns have been launched by other groups. Those include out-of-work steel company workers in Utah in 2003, and African-American civil-rights activists in the 1980s.

Clemson University students spend $2 bills stamped with tiger paws in cities that host the school for football bowl games. The tradition began in 1977, when Georgia Tech decided to stop playing football against the school. The tiger is the Clemson mascot.

Matthew Zaklad is another $2 bill lover. For him, the appeal of the bill is the way it brightens people's days and the connections it builds.

"They are one of those rare things that consistently triggers a memory of something good and often familial," said Zaklad.
