LOS ANGELES, Calif. â€” Lauren Saiki is sometimes the shortest player on the basketball court. It does not stop her. She is a great player and won many games for her team.

Saiki can thank the Japanese-American basketball league for her success.

The league taught her how to play the game. "I really fell in love with basketball," Saiki said. She is now 18.

The Japanese American Optimist Club girls' league began about 50 years ago in California. It gave children from Japanese-American families the chance to play basketball. At the time, other leagues did not let Japanese-American girls play, said Leland Lau. He runs the league. Twenty years ago, there were about 50 girls' teams. Today, there are nearly 130.

## A Solid Start On The Court

Many high school and college players have gotten their start in the Asian leagues. The Asian leagues have been especially important for young women.

Keppel has a strong basketball team. Nearly all the girls on Keppel's team last season played in a Japanese-American basketball league. Three of Saiki's teammates have played basketball with her since they were 5.

There are several thousand youth and adult players in Asian leagues in California. There are bowling, baseball and volleyball leagues. Basketball is the most popular.

A few Japanese-American churches in Los Angeles stopped Sunday school so kids can play.

## Community Bond Around Basketball

"Right now, it seems like basketball is the only thing that holds the community together," said George Imamura. He used to be the president of the South Bay F.O.R. Junior Sports Association. It is the largest Japanese-American basketball group in Southern California.

On a Sunday morning in the spring, Claire Sugiyama was in the Alhambra High School gym bleachers. She was watching her daughter, Sarah, play with the Tigerettes Pulelehua sixth-grade team.

Sarah comes from a long line of Tigers. Her grandfather helped start the Tigers Youth Club. Her father, who coaches the team, also played basketball with the Tigers.

"He just felt she needed to play with Tigers," Claire Sugiyama said. "She was born with stripes."

Kiki Yang, age 18, is a star high school basketball player. She has won a most-valuable-player award three times.

"It gave me more confidence," Yang said about youth basketball. She has made friends with players from different schools.

## She Plays Tall Even Though She Isn't

Confidence is important, said Monica Hang. She played in the leagues and is now coach of the Los Angeles Valley College women's basketball team.

"It taught me how to be 5-foot-2 and play as if I was 6-foot-2," she said.

That confidence will be important for Saiki. Next year, she will play basketball for West Virginia University, which is 2,500 miles away.

She said she was nervous because it is big-time basketball. "But I'm pretty excited because it's a great experience," she said. "I'm going to meet a lot of different people and have different experiences than what I've had growing up on the West Coast."

First she will have to finish high school and say goodbye to her teammates. Saiki said she will feel sad to leave. She and her teammates grew up together in the Japanese-American league. She promised to keep in touch.
