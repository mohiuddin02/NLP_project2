LOS ANGELES — Real estate agent Alisha Chen first got into the business 10 years ago. At the time, she didn't expect to become involved in a global housing market that is now transforming parts of California.

Then came the U.S. housing crash and a flood of Chinese money. Today she is part of a growing business specialty among real estate agents, bankers and lawyers. They all focus on helping wealthy Chinese buy a little patch of Southern California.

Chen's job requires being part shrewd property scout and part cultural tour guide. It means being able to read the different needs of buyers from Hong Kong, mainland China, and Taiwan. It means having to explain the differences between the cities of Irvine and Tustin to people who have never set foot in the United States.

Chen sets aside a few hours just to explain the home-buying process to would-be buyers. Many of Chen's customers own businesses and are successful in their native land. However, that does not mean they understand how real estate sales work in the United States.

"In Taiwan you can still buy property on a napkin — here it's a book full of paperwork and timelines," she said. "There's a lot of education I have to do."

## Moving Money Can Be Tricky

Then there is the matter of moving money from China to the United States.

China bars its citizens from transferring more than $50,000 a year out of the country. Many would-be buyers sidestep this rule by lining up friends to wire $50,000 apiece to an account in Hong Kong. From there it can then be freely moved to a U.S. bank.

Others move the cash through businesses that have operations in both countries.

For realtors, all this might mean not asking too many questions about how $1 million dollars is getting here.

For Chen, it leads to a lot of Skype calls in the middle of the night and a lot of missed sleep.

"Eleven p.m. to 2 a.m. — that's the best time to talk," she said.

## Running With An Opportunity

Chen, who now lives in Irvine, was born in Taiwan. About five years ago, she saw an opportunity. The housing market in Southern California was doing poorly, but wealthy Chinese were looking to buy overseas. She started asking her local customers — many Chinese-American immigrants themselves — if they knew anyone back home who might be interested in buying a house here, to make money from rentals or by reselling it later on.

At first, overseas Chinese buyers were a little cautious, she recalled. "They'd say, 'OK, I'll buy one property.' Six months later they were amazed at how much they were getting back — they'd call and say, 'I want to buy more.'"

Today, the trans-Pacific trade in Southern California real estate is big business. Chinese citizens bought $22 billion worth of homes in the United States in the 12 months that ended in March. The Greater Los Angeles area, with its direct flights to China and large Asian communities, is their favorite destination.

Some buyers are planning to move here and are getting homes for themselves. Others are buying homes for their children to live in while they attend college, or for rental income. Neighborhoods throughout Southern California are being transformed by all the buying.

## Walking Through The Process

It all begins with a process that's a little more complicated than your typical home sale.

U.S. home buyers are usually familiar with local neighborhoods and can explore the streets around a property to get a feel for a place. A buyer from Shanghai or Shenzhen is limited to Internet searches and maybe a quick shopping trip. Many of Chen's overseas customers buy U.S. homes sight unseen. As a result, she spends a lot of time talking buyers through the ins and outs of neighborhoods.

"They know Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Irvine," she said. "They say, 'Where's Tustin? Where's Lake Forest?' I tell them they're right next to Irvine."

Chen now has offices in Irvine, Chino and Taiwan. When she hears grumbling about Chinese money pricing out American home buyers, she notes that it helped revive the housing market. Also, she says, all those home sales generate a lot of work for bankers, lawyers, and those in construction.

"This has created a lot of jobs," she said.

## The Cash Bubble Could Burst

However, even she is starting to wonder how much longer the flow of cash from across the Pacific will last. The Chinese government keeps making noise about clamping down on money leaving the country. The U.S. government is talking about imposing taxes on foreign home purchases, which could make buying here a little less attractive. Buyers are starting to get a bit spooked.

All that has Chen wondering if home prices will soon begin to drop as demand slows.

"I think I'm not going to be putting as much energy into this," she said. If home prices do begin to drop, her sales commissions will shrink.

Of course, there could be an upside for those with less cash who are hoping to buy a home for themselves.

"I think the next few years are going to be a good time for first-time buyers," she said.
