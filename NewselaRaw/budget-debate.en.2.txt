WASHINGTON  â€” The United States braced for a partial government shutdown on Tuesday. No one in Washington seems to want it and each political party blames the other side for the fact that it could happen.

The deadline for a deal to keep funding the government is midnight Monday. If a deal isn't reached, a shutdown would affect a wide range of programs, from national parks to the Pentagon.

President Barack Obama and the leader of the Democratic-controlled Senate dismissed a plan approved early Sunday by the Republican-run House. The plan would delay by a year a key part of the new health care law and repeal a tax on medical devices, in exchange for avoiding a shutdown.

The White House promised a veto and said Republicans were pursuing "a narrow ideological agenda ... and pushing the government toward shutdown."

## Some Services Would Continue

Lawmakers from each side spoke on the Sunday talk shows. But they often repeated the fights about the health care overhaul that the Supreme Court has upheld. Meanwhile, the nation edged toward the first government shutdown in 17 years.

"I agree we should have this debate, but we shouldn't connect it to a government shutdown. That's the fundamental disagreement between the two sides here," said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. "We're not going to pass it because it is wrong to do a shutdown of government as the lever to make a change."

The House's vote was 231-192 with almost everybody voting in-line with their party. The focus shifted to the Senate less than 48 hours before government funds would run dry.

Even if that happens, some critical services such would keep operating. Among them are border patrols, meat inspection and air traffic control. Social Security benefits would be sent and health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals.

The Senate was not scheduled to meet until midafternoon Monday, 10 hours before a shutdown would begin. Even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage as the deadline approached.

## House Won't Relent On Obamacare

If so, the House Republican rank and file would have a choice to make: Do they trigger a shutdown or come away empty-handed from their latest confrontation with Obama? Keep in mind that the Republicans include several allies of the anti-government tea party.

"We will not shut the government down," said the No. 3 House GOP leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California. "If we have to negotiate a little longer, we will continue to negotiate," he added without further elaboration.

He suggested the House would "get back together in enough time, send another provision not to shut the government down, but to fund it, and it will have a few other options in there for the Senate to look at again."

McCarthy said the House would not relent on demands for "fundamental changes into Obamacare that can protect the economy."

Republicans said the law was costing jobs and driving up costs.

"The American people overwhelmingly reject Obamacare," claimed Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who fillibustered against the health care law on the Senate floor last week. "They understand it's not working. The only people who aren't listening to the argument are the career politicians in Washington. It's Harry Reid who wants to use brute political force."

## Democrats Say Republicans Obsessed

Obama has said he won't let the law, his chief domestic achievement, be gutted. Democrats say Republicans are obsessed with attacking the overhaul, which is aimed at providing health coverage for millions of uninsured Americans.

Republicans have criticized rules imposed on insurers. But the House bill did contain new wins for Democrats.

Republicans said their measure would leave in place most parts of the law that have taken effect. Those include requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions and to let families' plans cover children up to age 26.

But it would delay a requirement for people to purchase coverage or face a penalty. It would also delay the opening of marketplaces, which are supposed to start working this Tuesday, where people could shop for coverage from private insurers.

McCarthy and Kaine were on "Fox News Sunday," while Cruz appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press."
