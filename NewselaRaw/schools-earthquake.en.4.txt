YELM, Wash. — Kids at Lackamas Elementary School are jumping up and down outside. They jump together as hard as they can. 

The students are making an earthquake. It is not real. It is just a mini one. The ground moves a little when they jump.

Lackamas Elementary is in Yelm. It is a city in the state of Washington. 

Other students are looking at a computer with a scientist. His name is Recep Cakir. They are watching bumpy lines go across the screen. Recep reads the lines to tell how much the ground is shaking.   

## Testing In Case Of A Real Earthquake

Recep wants to know how much the ground will move in a real earthquake. He works with other schools too. Other scientists and engineers help him. 

Engineers use science and math to build things. They look at the schools. Everyone wants to be sure the schools can handle a big earthquake.

Washington is along the sea. There is a break in the floor of the sea. The land on both sides of the break could move. It could start an earthquake.

An earthquake might even make waves in the sea. A tsunami is a giant wave. Tsunamis could wash onto land. People could be covered in water.

## Older Schools Not Built As Safely As Newer Ones

Many schools in Washington are old. New schools are made to stand up to earthquakes. Older schools were not. 

Leaders figured out what might happen in an earthquake. They found that a big one could hurt people in schools and other places.

Other states near Washington could have the same earthquake. They are doing more than Washington to be ready. The state of California is working on its schools. The state of Oregon is too.

The country of Canada is north of Washington. Leaders there are fixing their schools too.
