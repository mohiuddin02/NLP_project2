Texas police officer Eric Casebolt has made many people very angry. He has been accused of mistreating several black teenagers.

On Friday, Casebolt showed up at a pool party in McKinney, Texas. Neighbors had complained that the party was too noisy.

A group of black teens was at the party. Casebolt treated a number of them very roughly.

Someone nearby used a cellphone to record Casebolt that night. Many around the country were shocked by what the video shows. The video has had millions of views on YouTube.

The police department decided to punish him after the video was released. He was taken off duty.

On Tuesday, Casebolt gave up his job on his own.

In the video, Casebolt can be seen drawing his gun on the unarmed teenagers. He is also seen throwing a 14-year-old girl to the ground. The girl was wearing a swimsuit. She was not carrying a knife or gun.

The video shows Casebolt shouting and cursing at the teenagers. The teens do not look like they are fighting back. Casebolt is seen wrestling some black teenagers to the ground.

## Teens Say Neighbors Gave Them A Hard Time

Some of the teenagers said they had permission to be at the pool. They said some of the neighbors had been giving them a hard time.

On Monday, protesters gathered to express their anger. Meanwhile, police have promised to look into Casebolt's actions.

Many people across the country were already upset over how police treat African Americans. Over the past few years, a number of unarmed black men have been killed by officers. The men were not carrying any weapons. The Casebolt video has added to the growing anger over police.

Fortunately, this time no one was seriously hurt.

Even so, the video was very disturbing. It reminded some of the nation's old segregation laws. Under segregation, blacks were kept from using certain whites-only spaces. In many states, blacks could not swim in pools with white Americans.

## Police Should Try To Calm People Down, Expert Says

Some McKinney police officers say what happened at the pool party had nothing to do with race. McKinney police officers are not racist, they say.

David Bradford is an expert on policing. He said the video shows that Casebolt was overreacting. It also shows that Casebolt did not try to calm things down.

There would definitely be some retraining of McKinney police if he were police chief, Bradford said. He would remind officers how they should treat people.

Still, Bradford said he would want to know more about what happened on Friday. Only then could he be completely sure that Casebolt behaved wrongly.

Bradford explained how officers should handle a large crowd of upset people. First, they should try to calm things down. Then, they should get people to leave the area. Police must be very careful not to use unnecessary force, he said.
