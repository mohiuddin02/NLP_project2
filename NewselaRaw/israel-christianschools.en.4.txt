RAMLE, Israel â€” Israel's school year has started. Yet, thousands of Arab students are still home on summer vacation. They all go to Christian schools.

This year, the government gave Christian schools less money. The schools closed in protest.

Christian and Muslim students go to the Christian schools. The schools are private. Each private school is in charge of itself. Christian school officials say Israel is trying to take the schools over. The officials do not want Christian schools to join the government school system.

## Christian Schools Want To Remain Separate

Christian school officials say this would be bad for the schools. It would hurt their Christian values. Also, they say students would not do as well in school.

The government and Christian officials are trying to solve the problem. Both sides want the kids to go back to school. About 33,000 students are on strike. They are staying home to protest.

In Ramle, the three Khoury children are waiting for school to start. Ramle is a city in the center of Israel.

"I wake up every day late," said Bashar. He is 13 years old. "I watch TV, I play, there isn't much to do."

## No Classes, No Friends, No Learning

"I miss my friends and I miss my teachers," said his sister, Loucin. She is 10 years old.

In Israel, the government gives private schools some money. Under a new plan, Christian schools get even less money now. Christian officials say they do not have enough money to run the schools. Parents have to pay. Some of them are poor.

People say this is not right. The government pays all the costs for two Jewish private schools. About 1 in 5 Israeli citizens is Arab. The rest are mostly Jewish.

## Father Says Arabs Treated Unfairly

Khader Khoury is the children's father. He said the government treats Jews and Arabs differently.

Khoury said his children are bored and sad. They are not learning anything. He wants them to go back to school. Still, the strike will end when Christian schools are treated fairly, he said.

The Christian religion began in the area. About 200,000 Christians live there now. There used to be more.

Christians have been attacked in countries close to Israel. Their communities have been destroyed. This has not happened in Israel. Still, Christians there say they are not treated fairly. Many Christians have left for better lives in other countries.
