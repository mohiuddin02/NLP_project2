A war is underway between two giants in the entertainment industry, each fighting for a share of consumers' living rooms.

Sony Corp.'s new PlayStation 4 video game system was released Nov 15.

Microsoft Corp. follows on Nov. 22 with the launch of a rival console, the Xbox One, which replaces the Xbox 360 console.

The next-generation systems will compete for the hearts and wallets of game aficionados, as well as a coveted place under the television.

But each console maker has pursued distinctly different pathways to try to get into consumers' homes.

## Both Will Be Hot Sellers

Sony's $399 PlayStation 4 is designed for the dedicated gamer. It's the kind of system that will entice devotees to stand in line for hours outside the local GameStop so that they can be among the first to buy the latest hardware.

Microsoft, meanwhile, is describing its $499 Xbox One as an entertainment hub. People can play games on it, but they can do a lot more too.

Analysts predict both devices will be hot sellers this holiday shopping season. They say as many as 5 million consoles may be purchased before the end of the year.

"This console cycle is going to get off to a great start," said Cowen &amp; Co. game industry analyst Doug Creutz. "There's clearly pent-up demand for the new boxes."

Video games were once considered the domain of socially awkward teenage boys. But now they are seen as mainstream entertainment. Globally, researcher DFC Intelligence estimates the market for video games approaches $63 billion. Almost half of those who play games, 45 percent, are women and roughly one-third are older than 36.

In the United States, more than half of the households own a game console, and consumers spent nearly $20.8 billion on video games, hardware and accessories last year, according to the Entertainment Software Association.

## Much Ado About The Gamer

Some experts thought "casual" games like "Candy Crush Saga" would mean fewer people would buy traditional consoles. After all, people could play the games in their spare moments on social networks such as Facebook. They could play them on apps run on smartphones and tablets. But the new ways to play did not end up making people stop playing the traditional video game systems.

"The overall market has expanded because the demographic of who a 'gamer' is has greatly expanded," said P.J. McNealy, chief executive and founder of Digital World Research. "It's no longer just the 14- to 30-year-old male. It's anyone who has played 'Angry Birds,' 'Temple Run,' 'Bejeweled' or (any game) on a console."

The initial buyers of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are expected to be the most dedicated players.

Sony is trying to appeal to this group of buyers. In a demonstration of the new system at the St. Regis San Francisco hotel, executives emphasized how it is 10 times more powerful than the PlayStation 3. They also pointed out that it had exclusive new games like "Killzone Shadow Fall." They also said social-networking features let gamers share video from within the game.

"We've always said the PlayStation is about the gamer," said Jack Tretton, president and chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment America. He said it's the best gaming machine ever made.

Microsoft did a test drive of Xbox One last week in Venice, Calif. The company talked about it as an all-in-one entertainment system. Its Kinect controller recognizes the user when he or she enters the room. It automatically loads favorite games, TV channels, movies, albums and Skype contacts on the TV screen. Its voice control also lets users seamlessly switch from playing a game to watching a TV show or streaming music or a movie.

## More Than First-Person Shooters

Game analysts note that the systems have a lot of things in common. PlayStation 4, like the Xbox One, offers access to online movie and TV services such as Netflix and Hulu Plus. Xbox One, like the PS4, enables players to record, upload and share game play highlights.

Colin Sebastian, a technology analyst with Baird Research, said a lot of people who play games might not think there's a lot of difference between the two systems, other than which games they can play on each one. "It may come down to things like price, where Sony has an advantage," he said.

Tretton said Sony is working hard to avoid the difficulties that marred the November 2006 introduction of the PlayStation 3. The game came to market a year after the competing Xbox 360 console. The PlayStation 3 cost $599 which was $200 more than the top Xbox 360 console. Sony's game was hampered by the shortage of a key part used in its Blu-ray disc player.

"I feel more confident going into this generation of hardware than ever before," Tretton said.

Microsoft, which rushed its Xbox 360 to market in late 2005 to get a jump on rival Sony, had its own problems too. It had a problem at first that people who played the game dubbed the "red ring of death." The malfunction cost the company $1 billion, according to published accounts.

Both game systems overcame those hurdles. McNealy said 80 million units of each were sold worldwide.
