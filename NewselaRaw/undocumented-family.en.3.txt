PHILADELPHIA — When Sara Navarro was 11, she crossed the border into the United States illegally. She knew that at anytime she could be sent back home.

Now, she doesn't live in fear anymore. That changed in 2012 with a new government program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The program lets some immigrants who came to the United States illegally before age 16 stay here. Navarro still cannot begin the process to become a citizen. But she can't be sent back to Honduras.

"It definitely feels different," said Navarro, of North Philadelphia. "Now, we don't have to watch our backs. We can live with our parents, and (the government) can't deport us."

## Not Everyone Is So Lucky

Navarro, now 23, and her younger sister, Raquel, were lucky, but their four older brothers and sisters were not. They all came after their 16th birthdays and missed the DACA deadline, one by less than a year.

Navarro's family is a big, messy tangle of the lucky and the unlucky. The lucky ones can stay here legally. They are U.S. citizens or have what is called temporary protected status. That protects them from being deported, which means being sent back to Honduras. Other relatives are undocumented, and don't have the papers –or documents – to stay here legally. Other family members live in hiding, because the government has ordered them to be sent back.

Anyone who wants to come to the United States needs permission from the U.S. government to stay. Undocumented immigrants came to the United States without proper permission.

It's estimated that there are more than 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States from all over the world. Federal lawmakers have been working on new laws to increase legal immigration and decrease illegal immigration. The laws would also let many of the illegal immigrants who are already here stay and begin the path to citizenship. This is called immigration reform.

But that is in the future. Navarro's family is a picture of the system as it exists right now.

## Better Life Across The Border

Their story began in the Honduran countryside. Her family were farmers and shopkeepers. Her parents didn't have the money to send their children to school. In 1994, they left their six children, ages 2 to 14, with family members and paid $3,000 to be led illegally across the Mexican border into the United States.

"(My husband and I) were going to come to the U.S. for just two years, save some money, and go home," said Navarro's mother, Maria Turcios, 52. But she earned just $3.50 per hour sewing. She could not pay back the $3,000 they owed, so they stayed.

In 1998, Hurricane Mitch hit Honduras, leaving millions of people homeless. For Turcios and her husband, a machine operator, it was a chance to stay in the United States legally. The U.S. let immigrants stay temporarily during disasters like that.

"Returning seemed impossible," Turcios said, and in 2002, she and her husband decided to send for their children.

## Trying Not To Get Caught

Daughter Navarro remembers long bus rides, then a long walk through the cold desert. Most of her brothers and sisters entered, but one of her sisters was stopped at the border.

Several other relatives were deported. "That's when my parents told us we couldn't tell anybody we were undocumented, because we would get in trouble," she said.

For about eight years after that, Navarro lived in fear.

Her family moved, and then moved again, trying to stay ahead of the immigration police.

Navarro said she felt hopeless, because she had no way of staying here legally. She even thought of dropping out of school.

"I didn't decide to come here. And many times I wished I hadn't come, because of all the pressure and the feeling of having no freedom at all," she said. She felt that she didn't have the same possibilities as her other friends.

## New Program Brings Hope

Then came DACA — and possibilities. Now, Navarro is attending Community College of Philadelphia, and she is determined that whatever happens with DACA — which is only a temporary program — she won't go back to living in fear.

Turcios says she is grateful to be here, but wants more for her family.

"In the years I've been here, I've come to love the United States," she said. "I've worked here and survived here. It seems that the politicians don't love the United States. They've created such a divided country."
