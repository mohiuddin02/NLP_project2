_In an old house in Paris  
that was covered with vines_

So begins "Madeline," the well-loved children's book by Ludwig Bemelmans. "Madeline" follows the adventures of 12 little girls who walk in two straight lines. Madeline, the smallest and bravest, is the storybook's heroine.

This fall, the Chicago Public Library is celebrating with "Madeline" birthday parties at six libraries. A costumed "Madeline" character will be at the Bookamania children's book fair. The book fair will take place Nov. 22 at the Harold Washington Library.

Some people have been celebrating "Madeline," and other special books from childhood, all along. We have passed our love of them on to our own children.

## The Magical Time Before Bed

Books like "Madeline" pack serious power. You don't just read them. You reread them, again and again. The words drum into your memory so strongly that after 50 years, they are still there.

Or your parents read them to you in the magical time before bed. I can still hear my mother's voice whisper those last lines of "Madeline."

_And she turned out the light —  
and closed the door —  
and that's all there is —  
there isn't any more._

Childhood books feel utterly real. They feel real even if they are filled with talking animals. For years I was sure I had actually seen Margaret Wise Brown's "Wait Till the Moon Is Full." I had watched the raccoon child playing ball with his animal friends. I could picture their raccoon and rabbit mothers knitting and chatting under the full moon.

I wanted my daughters to see them too. When they were young I started reading my own favorite books to them.

It turned out that I still loved them. Other parents love them, too.  A friend of mine remembers watching her husband reading "Little House on the Prairie" to their 7-year-old son. The boy was asleep, but her husband was still reading to him.

## Taking Them On Travels With Milo

Your children don't always love what you loved as a child. Mothers of sons may face a special challenge. Their boys may not like books about, say, horses or princesses.

Some books may be too old-fashioned. A friend of mine tried three times to introduce her sons to "Winnie the Pooh." It didn't work, she said.

My daughters were an eager audience for my childhood favorites.

We read the books "Madeline," "Wait Till the Moon Is Full" and "The Story of Babar." My children happily listened to them all. They snuggled up to me as I once snuggled up to my own mother.

We then read some of my favorite chapter books. These included "Chancy and the Grand Rascal" and "Knight's Castle." Of course, we read "The Phantom Tollbooth."

Night after night my husband or I read "The Phantom Tollbooth" to the girls. We took them on travels with Milo. In the book, the bored boy receives a mysterious gift of a tollbooth. A tollbooth is a small building where drivers pay to use the roads. The tollbooth leads Milo into adventures with characters like Tock the watchdog.

## The Bond Is Sweet

The girls loved all of them. My older daughter even had pictures from couple of them tattooed onto her skin.

The little raccoon from "Wait Till the Moon Is Full" is on her right foot. The watchdog Tock from "The Phantom Tollbooth" is on her left shoulder.

An Internet site posted tattoos based on children's books. It included tattoos from "Goodnight Moon" and "Corduroy." There were also tattoos from "Winnie the Pooh," "The Phantom Tollbooth" — and "Madeline."

New and wonderful children's literature is written all the time. Kids don't have to read their parents' old books.

But when they do, magic happens.

The bond is sweet. Parents and children love the same children's book.
