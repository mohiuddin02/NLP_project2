The nation recently focused its attention on the 10-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. It was the most destructive hurricane in U.S. history, but as bad as the storm was, it wasn't the worst storm that could have possibly hit New Orleans, Louisiana.

That's true of many, many other places, too. Now, in a new study in the journal Nature Climate Change, Princeton University's Ning Lin and Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Kerry Emanuel demonstrate that when it comes to three global cities in particular — Tampa, Florida; Cairns, Australia; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates — there could come a storm that is much worse than anything in memory.

Granted, these theoretical storms are also highly unlikely to occur. In some cases, they are 1-in-10,000-year events, or even rarer. The researchers refer to these possible storms as "gray swans," a variation of the idea of a "black swan" event, which is an unpredictable catastrophe. A "gray swan," by contrast, can indeed be predicted, even if it is extremely rare.

## Raising Awareness Of Storms' Possibility

The purpose of the study is "to raise awareness of what a very low probability, very high impact hurricane event might look like," said Emanuel. The gray swan storms were generated by a computer model that "coupled" together a hurricane model with a global climate model. That allowed the researchers to put oodles of different storms in the simulated world.

"When you do hundreds and hundreds of thousands of events, you're going to see hurricanes that are unlike anything you've seen in history," said Emanuel. He is an important theoretician behind the equations determining the "maximum potential intensity" of a hurricane in a given climate, or how strong that hurricane can be. Emanuel has said in the past that a theoretical hurricane with winds approaching 500 mph is possible in scenarios where an asteroid hits the Earth. Hurricanes gather their energy from water evaporating over warm ocean surfaces, and an asteroid strike could heat up ocean waters far beyond their normal temperature. Emanuel called this possible event a "hypercane."

So what did the researchers see in their computer models? Let's take Tampa Bay. It hasn't been hit by a major hurricane since 1921 — but that storm drove a 3- to 3.5-meter storm surge, or a 10- to 11-foot flood on the coast, and caused dramatic damage. Earlier, in 1848, another storm produced a surge of 4.6 meters, or about 15 feet.

## Shallow Waters Endander Florida Bay

Why is Tampa Bay in such danger? Check out any good map that shows the water depth around the Florida peninsula. It's deep off the east coast, but there's an extraordinarily broad continental shelf off the west coast, so the water there is more shallow. The city of Tampa may be well removed from the barrier islands that get battered by the waves from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is in a more exposed spot than you would think.

"One can get much larger surges where the offshore waters are shallow, as is true along the west, but not the east coast of Florida. Also, surges can get bigger by being funneled into bays," Emanuel said.

## Global Warming, Rising Seas Compound Severity

The new computer model allows the researchers to show that a worse storm than these historical examples is possible. This is especially true with sea levels rising and global warming. The researchers simulated 2,100 possible Tampa Bay hurricanes in the current climate. Then they simulated 3,100 each for three time periods (2006 through 2036, 2037 through 2067, and 2068 through 2098). They assumed global warming would continue unstopped.

In the current climate, the study found that a 5.9-meter, or 19-foot, storm surge is possible in a strong hurricane following a similar track to Tampa's 1921 and 1848 storms. Moreover, in a late 21st century climate with bad global warming, the worst-case scenario included a very different storm track. The storm would move north along Florida's Gulf Coast and then turn inland at Tampa. That storm would cause a surge of nearly 11.1 meters, or nearly 37 feet.

Granted, the study said that these "gray swans" are exceedingly unlikely — less than 1 in 10,000 years for the 19-foot surge in the current climate. However, it also said that global warming makes the worst possible surges more likely.

## Super Storms Have Very Small Chance Of Developing

The study also shows that for Cairns, Australia, an 5.7-meter, or 18-foot, storm surge is possible in the current climate, but that would happen less than once in 10,000 years. Perhaps most strikingly, it also suggests that an extremely powerful hurricane is theoretically possible where we've never yet seen them occur: the Persian Gulf.

The waters in the Persian Gulf are very hot and so contain considerable potential hurricane energy, but the atmosphere is normally too dry for hurricanes, Emanuel explained. Nonetheless, "physics says that you can have one," he said. "It's not likely, but it's not impossible."

The study found that with 3,100 simulated events in today's climate, it is theoretically possible to get a hurricane with winds of more than 250 mph, which would be stronger than anything we've seen on Earth. It could cause a storm surge of 24 feet affecting Dubai.

So, is all of this just a mathematical exercise — or something more? In the end it's up to us to decide how much to worry, if at all, about an extraordinarily rare event. Still, you could make the case that a study like this helps us think a lot better about what risk is all about.
