CLAYTON, Mo. â€” A grand jury is meeting in Missouri in the case of the shooting death of Michael Brown. The jury is a group of regular citizens. It will decide if a Ferguson police officer should be indicted for the shooting. An indictment means the police officer will be put on trial.

Brown's death was followed by violence in the streets of Ferguson. Some argue that the police overreacted to protesters.

Now, there is some worry about how people will behave when the grand jury makes its decision.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has asked people to remain calm when the decision is announced.

Lawyers for Michael Brown's family spoke with reporters on Thursday. They said the family supports the governor asking for calm. They also said Nixon should have asked police to remain calm as well.

## Equal Blame For All

Anthony D. Gray is a lawyer for Brown's family. He repeated the governor's call against violence.

Gray added that police also should have been blamed for violence after Brown's shooting. He said that everybody should have been given the same message. No violence should be accepted by anyone, he said.

The 18-year-old Brown was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. His death was followed by both peaceful protests as well as stealing and violence. Many fear that it will be worse if the grand jury decides not to indict Wilson. A grand jury meets in secret. The lawyers said they do not trust the secrecy of the grand jury. The grand jury's decision is expected by the end of November.

## The Right To Protest

Another lawyer for the Brown family, Benjamin Crump, said Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch had too much control over the grand jury. McCulloch is the lawyer for the county of St. Louis. He decides what evidence to show the grand jury and how to present it, Crump said.

"The grand jury will do whatever the prosecutor wants them to do," he said.

Crump told reporters that police sometimes went too far in August. They violated the rights of peaceful protesters and reporters, he said.

Crump said Nixon's job as governor is to make sure everyone is treated the same under the law. Gray said police need to use "reasonable" actions when dealing with protesters.

"History is clear," Gray said. Protesters were "simply exercising their First Amendment rights" in August. The protesters had rifles pointed in their face, he said. They were tear-gassed and hit by rubber bullets. Some were arrested for no reason. These actions came before the protesters acted "uncivilized," he said.

## Everybody Wants The Same Thing: Calm

Crump criticized the grand jury's secrecy. He insisted that Wilson should have been charged with a crime long ago.

Brown's parents were in Switzerland early in the week to talk to the United Nations. They did not attend Thursday's meeting with reporters.

Gray said that the parents had a request. They wanted "all of those that support justice for Mike Brown to remain" on guard, "yet peaceful, calm and dignified."

But soon, Gray and Crump spoke about Governor Nixon.

On Tuesday, Nixon talked about how police are preparing for what might happen after the grand jury makes its announcement. Nixon wants to keep people and businesses safe after the decision is made known. At the same time, people would be allowed to protest.

Jon Belmar is the St. Louis County police chief.

Belmar said he was kept up at night by the idea that people could be killed during protests. It was remarkable, he said, that no one died, or was seriously injured, during protests over Brown's death in August.
