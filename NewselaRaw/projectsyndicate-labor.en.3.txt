DAVOS, Switzerland â€” Weavers used to spend years learning to make cloth by hand. In the 1800s, factory owners introduced new machines. The new technology wove cloth faster and cheaper than people. The weavers, who were called Luddites, were worried. They believed they would lose their jobs. The Luddites protested by smashing the new machines.

Today, people are still scared about new technologies. They are especially worried about computers and robots, which are replacing workers in offices and factories. These modern machines can do many of the same things people can do. They can also perform tasks that people cannot. The robots make fewer mistakes.

Every year, 200,000 more robots begin working in factories. Right now, the total number is about 1.5 million. One of the main challenges of our time will be to keep people working.

## Figuring Out The Skills

No country can ignore this problem. Around the world, about 200 million people do not have jobs. That number has been rising. In 2008, just 173 million people were unemployed. There is a big need to figure out what kind of skills workers will need in the future and train them, so they can find good jobs.

Around the world, businesses were asked what kind of workers they need. One out of 3 complained that there are not enough workers with the right skills. Workers must be trained and educated for the jobs of the future. Governments must figure out what skills will be needed. Then they must train people in them. Companies also must do this.

This is important for both rich and poor countries. Spending money on education and training will help workers invent and use new technologies. If countries prepare workers for these new jobs, everyone will thrive. If they do not deal with this problem, more people will become poor.

## More Ways Workers Can Be Helped

Workers must be protected in good times and bad. Work itself is changing. Most people used to work full time. Now more and more people are finding only short-term work. They might work just for a month or two, for instance, or only on a project. Many workers are forced to take extra jobs to earn enough to live. Others have to leave their country to find work. This problem is making the gap between rich and poor even larger. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.

People who lose their jobs need to be helped. One way is through unemployment pay. In other words, people who lose their job still receive some money to live on. Another way to help workers is with health care.

When people stop working, they retire. Then pensions or social-security programs give them money to live on. It is very helpful as they get older.

Yet only 1 out of 5 people in the world get enough social security from their government. More than half the people around the world get no social security at all.

## "One Simple Truth"

Our world has changed very much in one century. By 2050, there will be more than 9 billion people on Earth. Also, the number of people who are 60 and older will triple. Three-quarters of the elderly will be living in poor countries. Most of them will be women. These facts will affect jobs, social security and how people make and spend money.

We have made much progress since the Luddites. Yet one simple truth is the same. Machines must help, not hurt, people. We must make sure that everyone lives in dignity and has the opportunity to find a good job.
