WELLINGTON, New Zealand â€” About 77 years ago, American pilot Amelia Earhart's plane disappeared.

Now another plane is missing. People say it must be somewhere. But then again, the same thing was said about Earhart's aircraft.

More than 10 days after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared, an international search has produced no sign of the plane. This raises a difficult question: What if the airplane is never found?

Although unlikely, not finding the plane would certainly be horrible for the families of those missing. It would also be a problem for the airlines. How can they fix the problem, if they don't know what happened?

## The Earhart Mystery

History is not short of such mysteries. The most famous mystery of all is what happened to Earhart.

"When something like this happens that (shocks) us. We're offended by it, and we're scared by it," said Ric Gillespie. He used to investigate place accidents. He started The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, or TIGHAR for short. Gillespie has led expeditions to an island in the Pacific Ocean, where Earhart may have crash landed in 1937. He wrote a book about her disappearance.

We think we have control over our lives, Gillespie said, "and it's just been shown to us that oh, folks, you know what? A really big airliner can just vanish. And nobody wants to hear that."

Earhart, the first female pilot to cross the Atlantic Ocean, vanished over the Pacific with her navigator, Fred Noonan. They were attempting to fly around the globe. Nearly 80 years later, people are still fascinated by their disappearance.

There have been many theories about what happened. They range from her simply running out of fuel and crashing, to staging her own disappearance. According to that theory, she secretly returned to the U.S. to live under a different name.

One of the best guesses has her crash-landing on a reef near Gardner Island, now called Nikumaroro. Expeditions to the Pacific island have found artifacts possibly from her plane. They include tools and the bones of what was possibly a tall white woman of European ancestry. The bones have since been lost.

## The Bermuda Triangle

People are also obsessed with the Bermuda Triangle in the Atlantic Ocean. Five bombers planes disappeared there in 1945. Studies show, though, that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other part of the ocean.

Andrew Thomas is the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Transportation Security. Planes are not as advanced as many people might think, he said. Airports and airplanes around the world use old radar technology, instead of modern GPS satellite navigation systems. Radar is more than 60 years old. Many people have GPS systems in their cars to help them find their way.

A GPS system might not have solved the mystery. The plane disappeared March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to China's capital Beijing. But it would probably have given searchers a better idea of the plane's last known location, Thomas said.

Experts say the disappearance will likely pressure airlines and governments to better track planes. Flight 370 vanished after it signed off with Malaysian air-traffic controllers. It never made contact with Vietnam's air-traffic controllers as it should have.

A failed search would be the worst, of course, for the families of the missing.

"In any kind of death, the most important matter for relatives and loved ones is knowing" what happened and how it happened, said Kevin Tso. He is in charge of Victim Support that has been counseling family and friends of New Zealand passengers aboard the flight. "When there's very little information, it's very difficult."

## Searching A Vast Area

All the guessing about what happened to the plane in the media and elsewhere is not helpful, Tso said. Families still hold the unlikely hope that their loved ones are still alive.

More than two dozen countries are looking for the missing plane. Dozens of planes and boats are searching along a vast area where investigators believe it ended up.

Gillespie expects the plane will eventually be found. Investigators, though, may have to wait until pieces of the airplane wash up on the shore.

"We all expect we're going to find this plane and the chances are probably pretty good that we'll find something. But you know, I think everyone thought that about Amelia Earhart as well," said Phaedra Hise. She is a pilot and author of "Pilot Error: The Anatomy of a Plane Crash."

''We know there's a chance that we may never find out what happened," she said. "Which is a little scary, isn't it?"
