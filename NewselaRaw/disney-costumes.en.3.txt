ORLANDO, Fla. â€” There is a special magic at Disney theme parks. One reason is the characters. The park's workers dress up as popular Disney characters and walk around. The characters are friendly and spend time with guests. But there is a secret. No one can know who is behind the costumes. Workers who dress as characters in the theme parks are not allowed to speak about which Disney character they play. Now a group is challenging this rule.

The group is called the Teamsters and it is a union for many working people. Unions are groups that protect the rights of workers at some companies. Teamsters help Disney workers talk with their bosses to get better pay and keep things fair.

## What Is Top Secret About A Character?

Donna-Lynne Dalton is a member of the Teamsters. She says that Disney's rules are not fair. Disney tries to control what performers can and cannot say about their work as characters. Right now, performers cannot share with the public what characters they play. This means the performers cannot write online or on social media like Facebook. They also cannot talk to news reporters.

The Teamsters do not think these rules are fair. The union says Disney should not be able to make workers keep quiet about their jobs. Dalton says the rules interfere with worker's lives.

"They don't work for the CIA," Dalton says. She means that they are not spies. Dalton says that working as a Disney character is not a top-secret job.

The Teamsters are beginning to take action. They want the rules to be changed. The group sent a complaint to the company's headquarters last week. In the coming week, the union plans to bring the problem to the National Labor Relations Board. The board is part of the government. It reviews companies that might be treating workers unfairly.

## Character Rules Must Be Followed

However, Disney says the rules are important. If a worker agrees to keep the character secret when they are hired, Disney expects them to follow the rules. Disney wants all guests to have a good experience in the park. The company says an important part of the experience is the secret identity of the characters. If some workers break the rules, it could change how guests visiting the theme park feel about Disney.

There are more than 1,200 workers at Disney who dress as characters. The performers greet guests in the park. There are "fur characters" such as Winnie the Pooh. Fur characters wear outfits that cover the performers completely. There are also "face characters" such as Snow White or Cinderella. Face character costumes allow the person's face to show.

Disney wants the characters to look like they stepped right out of the movies. They want guests to feel like the characters are real. The performers have to follow many rules. There are rules around how to act and dress. Workers must be very careful while getting dressed. They cannot allow guests to see them wearing only half of a costume, for example. The characters also cannot tell children at the park that they are really actors.

## The Kids Believe

"From Disney's point of view, fantasy's real," Lee Cockerell said. He used to help run Disney World. "You don't want to start disappointing kids and having this out there."

Dalton admits that keeping the Disney magic is important. She said the Teamsters agree. Yet she feels the current rules go too far. She does not think Disney should able to control what workers post online about their jobs.
