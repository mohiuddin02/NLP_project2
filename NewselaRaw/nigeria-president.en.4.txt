KADUNA, Nigeria â€” It is a historic moment for Nigeria. Muhammadu Buhari has been elected the country's new president.

Buhari belongs to a political group that is very unhappy with the government of current President Goodluck Jonathan. Many expect there will now be big changes.

Buhari is now 72 years old. It will not be his first time as leader of Nigeria. He was once the country's dictator. This means he was a ruler with complete power. His government was brought down in 1985.

Nigeria is Africa's richest nation. Still, it has many problems. A group of fighters known as Boko Haram has been trying to take over the country. The rebels have seized towns and cities in the northeast.

## Promises To Defeat Rebels

Another problem is that many who work for the government are not honest. They might be corrupt and take money in return for favors. Also, many Nigerians are still very poor.

President Goodluck Jonathan called Buhari to congratulate him Tuesday night. His friendly call could help stop the fighting that sometimes follows elections here. About 1,000 people were killed during fights over the 2011 presidential election.

Electing someone who was once a dictator might not seem like good idea. However, Buhari offers what many Nigerians want. He is a retired general who has promised to defeat the Boko Haram group. He also has a plan to end widespread corruption.

Buhari has run for president four times in the past 12 years. Before now he never come close to winning.

## "A Man Of The People"

Buhari is from the northern state of Kaduna. In Kaduna, people celebrated his victory in the streets. They danced and performed tricks on their motorcycles. Many shouted, "We need change."

People in Kaduna have many hopes now that their political group has finally won.

"Boko Haram will be defeated," said Bello Mohammed.

"Buhari will take care of unemployment," said Nurudeen Mukhtar.

Buhari has lived in Kaduna for around 30 years. His simple two-story home was dark Tuesday night. A guard stood outside.

"Look at that old car. That's his only car," the guard said. "He is a man of the people, not like the corrupt guys."

It probably will be very difficult for Buhari to bring about quick change.

"Nigerians expect to see immediate change. They expect to see corruption end right away," said political expert Idayat Hassan. However, "corruption is a way of life" in Nigeria, Hassan said. Change will probably be slow.

## Believes In Democracy

Buhari was Nigeria's dictator from 1984 to 1985. During that time he tried to stop corruption. He set up courts that sent hundreds of people to prison. Some thought his actions were necessary. Many others thought he was too strict. He also heavily controlled newspaper, radio and television news.

Buhari says he has changed in the years since he was dictator. He says he now believes in democracy. He will follow the rules of democracy, he said.

Buhari has strongly blamed Jonathan for failing to defeat Boko Haram. The group has grown bigger since 2009. It has killed at least 10,000 people. Buhari says that as a one-time general he knows what to do.

Before the election, some were worried that Jonathan would cheat to remain president. They predicted that the election would not be fair.

In the end, there was little or no cheating. Jonathan declared that all Nigerians should "graciously accept" the winner.
