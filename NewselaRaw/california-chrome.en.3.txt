BALTIMORE — California Chrome has won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. Those are the first two "jewels" — or races — in horse racing's Triple Crown. Now he just has the June 7 Belmont Stakes ahead of him in his bid to become horse racing's 12th Triple Crown winner.

No horse has won the Triple Crown in 36 years.

A horse named Affirmed won the Triple Crown in 1978. Since then, 12 horses have completed the Derby-Preakness double without adding the third jewel. That's more than have won all three in the series' 139-year history (11).

Twelve times, the horse that's won the first two races has fallen short at Belmont Park. Each time, the racing community was left to wonder whether the three-race sweep will ever be achieved again.

## Time To Break The Streak

"I honestly believe that if the Triple Crown is not won this year by California Chrome, I will never see it in my entire lifetime," said Steve Coburn. He is one of California Chrome's owners.

The 36 years since a Triple Crown winner is the longest wait ever. The last time there was such a huge space between Triple Crown winners, it was 25 years. Citation won all three races in 1948 and then Secretariat won in 1973. California Chrome's owners and trainer hope their colt will break that streak.

Spectacular Bid won the series' first two races in 1979. He lost at Belmont, starting a trend of horses nearly getting the Triple Crown, then losing at Belmont.

California Chrome jockey Victor Espinoza has been here before. He rode War Emblem to victory in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 2002. He said he'll likely enjoy himself more this time around.

## Expect A Big Run

The horse's owners and trainers are almost folksy by the standards of big-money thoroughbred racing. They already have experienced the pressure of being the Derby winner at Pimlico Race Course. Trainer Art Sherman said all the attention made him feel like singer Willie Nelson.

But all their attention will be on California Chrome.

"I wouldn't want to be in anybody else's shoes right now," Sherman said. "I think when we get to Belmont, this horse is going to run big."

Other trainers with Triple Crown dreams likely have felt the same. But Steven Brandt said horses have changed since Affirmed was able to do it. Brandt owns Kid Cruz, who raced at the Preakness.

The races still matter, he said. "I just think that the breeding has changed the horse significantly, and it just makes it more difficult to come back as rapidly as 15, 20 years ago. So I think it makes it tougher. If you can do it today, you really have an excellent horse — not to take away from other Triple Crown winners. But racing and medication and everything was different back then."

## How's The Competition?

Owners and trainers like to have more rest for their horses between races. So horses who run at Churchill Downs and Pimlico also face tougher competition at the Belmont. Several Derby horses skip the Preakness. They wait for the Belmont race to give them a better chance. Those horses have five weeks of rest between races.

Coburn argued against that practice after the Preakness. He said "there are trainers out there that train horses just to upset the apple cart."

He added, "They don't want a Triple Crown winner. They want a paycheck."

He said only horses who ran the Kentucky Derby should be allowed in the Preakness and the Belmont. Horses should have to run the Preakness to be in the Belmont, he said.

Others believe the sport needs a Triple Crown winner as well. Trainer Bob Baffert said Chrome is a "cool customer."

"He does everything right," Baffert said. "He's fast enough to stay out of trouble. Victor rides him with so much confidence."

Linda Rice trains Kid Cruz. She also said California Chrome has a chance to win the Triple Crown. Not having one since Affirmed proves just how hard it is.

"I think, sooner or later, it'd be good if we had one," Rice said. "We're due."
