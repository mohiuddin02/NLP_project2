The Abdulkerimovs are a Tatar family with deep roots in the Crimea. The Crimea is located in Ukraine, next to Russia. For the Tatar people, the invasion by the Russian army last week has stirred up dark memories of war, hunger and death.

It reminded many of them of the Nazi occupation of Crimea during World War II. It also reminded them of the 1944 deportation of the entire Tatar people. In 1944, Josef Stalin, the head of the Soviet Union, accused the Tatars of being traitors. He forced them to leave their country and live in frozen Siberia.

Tatars are an ethnic group. They ruled the Crimea until it was conquered by the Russian Empire in 1783.

## Russia Marches In

"If somebody tells me today that another deportation is possible, I would tell him that he is an idiot," said Jafer Abdulkerimov. He is a frail 81-year-old man. He has bright eyes, a steady voice, and an excellent memory.

"But then again, if somebody had told me ... that another occupation of our land by a foreign army is possible, I would have told him he was an idiot too," Abdulkerimov added.

In February, the Russian army invaded the Crimean. This came after Ukraine's president, who is close to Russia, was overthrown. A new government, which favors Western countries, took over in Kiev, the capital.

Few seriously suggest that the Tatars will be deported again. So far, the occupation has not been violent. But Tatars fear many of the Russians in the region. The Crimea has a large ethnic Russian population, who want Russia to rule the Crimea. The Tatars are mostly Muslim, while the Russians are of the Russian Orthodox faith, a type of Christianity.

Again, "the Tatars become the most (powerless) people in Crimea," said Mustafa Dzhemilev. He is a Crimean Tatar activist and member of the Ukrainian parliament.

As with many groups in this part of the world, the history of the Crimean Tatars is filled with sadness.

In 1783, Russia took over the Crimean Tatars' kingdom. Over the next half century, more than 600,000 Tatars were forced to leave, said Gulnara Abdulayeva. She is a Crimean Tatar historian and television reporter.

## Exiled To Siberia

Abdulkerimov remembers every detail of his family's nightmare during World War II. On May 18, 1944, Jafer, his two brothers and his mother were awakened at 5 a.m. Along with hundreds of other Tatar families, they were put into trucks and then loaded onto a river barge.

The Tatars were forced to stay below deck during the entire week-long trip.

"Women and children were crying and wailing while old men were praying," Abdulkerimov said. "We all thought they would sink the barge with us in it."

More than 600 Tatars died during the first two years of exile in Siberia. Adults were forced to chop wood, while children tried to survive on a tiny bit of old bread each day.

About 200,000 Crimean Tatars were forced to leave in 1944. Up to 40 percent of them died within two years.

Abdulkerimov returned to the Crimea with tens of thousands of other Tatars in 1990. He built a home outside of Simferol, a major city in Crimea. He fears that Russian troops and local Russians will attack the Crimean Tatars. There are 260,000 Tatars out of a total population of almost 2 million. Again, there will be deportations, he said.

"Who will prevent them from doing something totally absurd like voting to expel us ... once again?" the activist Dzhemilev asked.

## Pro-Russian Leader

Last week, the Crimean parliament appointed a pro-Russia politican, Sergei Aksenov, to head the government.

In December, Aksenov reportedly led a group of Russians who rioted in neighborhoods where Tatars were building homes. They destroyed many of the buildings with sledgehammers.

Russian nationalists claim that Tatars want to create a separate Tatar nation within Ukraine.

"The Tatars should watch their step now," said Alexander Zhilkin. He carried a Russian flag. "Now that our people are in power here we won't allow any separatism inside our republic."

A pro-Russian Crimean lawmaker said the Tatars are not in danger. He promised the Tatar community power that "they had never enjoyed before."

But the residents of Abdulkerimov's community don't believe him. They fear attacks by Russians and so patrol the streets at night.

"When they deported my father's and mother's families in 1944, all our grown men were at (war) and couldn't protect them," said Emir Shevkiev. He belongs to the local Tatar community. "We are here and we will fight back."
