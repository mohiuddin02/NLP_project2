CHICAGO – On their first day of training, one mother after another paused in the classroom doorway. They were unsure where to sit or whether signing up for this highly regarded parent program was a good idea.

Trainer Monica Soto-Espinoza knew they were wondering what they could offer the school. She was once just like many of them, a mother with limited English skills who had come to the United States as a teenager and never finished high school.

Now 35 years old and fluent in English, Soto-Espinoza told them she had figured out how she could help. They would too, just like others through a program created by a Chicago community group, the Logan Square Neighborhood Association.

A lot of research backs the notion that parents play an important part in the success of their children and their children's schools. Certainly, too much parent involvement can cause problems, as happens in some high-income schools. But many other schools struggle to create ties with the parents of their students. That is especially true in the growing numbers of neighborhoods where teachers and students do not share the same language.

## Great Joy In Teaching

Many schools end up in what University of Washington professor Ann Ishimaru calls a toxic cycle. Teachers organize events and if parents don't show, the teachers assume they just don't care.

In the program's 18-year history, 1,800 parents have spent two hours a day, five days a week in their children's schools. The program operates in 65 Illinois schools.

Principals and teachers in Logan Square schools credit the parents with helping many students improve in math and reading. They also believe parents help motivate students.

Soo Hong, a professor at Wellesley College, said students "are quite moved and inspired by having their parents being involved in the school." And, she said it makes them more responsible. "Students know if they start messing up in the classroom ... sure, maybe it's not their mother who's there, but it's their aunt's neighbor or somebody they know," she said.

The neighborhood association has helped start a teacher-training program, too. Thus far, 23 people have graduated. One of them, Ebelia Mucino, started working for the Logan Square program in schools about 15 years ago. She now finds great joy in teaching kindergartners to read.

Mucino came to the United States from Mexico as a teenager. She saw herself as "just" a stay-at-home mom, who had nothing to offer teachers. But she found that she had a knack for helping students, and when the teacher had to leave the class briefly, he would encourage her, "You know what to do." Mucino realized she could go into education, saying she saw windows opening for her — "a million windows."

The parent education program began in 1995 at Funston Elementary in an immigrant neighborhood. Most students in the area where Funston is located are from poorer Latino families.

Before the program started, a few Funston parents would show up to help each day. But, the principal wanted to reach those adults who dropped off their kids each morning, and never ventured inside.

## Working Together In The Classroom

The principal turned to the neighborhood association. From the beginning, the program was designed as a partnership, with the hope that teachers would learn as much from parents as parents would gain from watching and talking with teachers. The neighborhood association strives to work together with principals, knowing the program will not work unless they support it.

Teachers at first worried that parents would cause trouble or add a lot of work. But many soon saw how much parents could help — giving more time and encouragement to students than teachers could do on their own.

One morning at school, Pete Rodriguez, a dad with a deep but gentle voice, sat at the back of a first-grade classroom helping four boys, who jumped up at nearly every distraction.

Other students worked independently and teacher Jessica Dye sat with another small group. Meanwhile, Rodriguez patiently worked to keep the four focused on the task: a sentence about a grandma, her grandson and a teddy bear.

A new study this fall will look at how the parent program is doing. In two schools, researchers plan to look at students assigned to parents, including their test scores and how they behave in class.

Some people question whether the parents should be paid to help out. Parents get paid $500 for a semester. The neighborhood association says the pay is small given the time parents put in. And it sends an important message to parents about their value.

Experts who study education believe programs like Logan Square's will prove to be successful. That's because parents are often overlooked in efforts to improve the nation's schools.

Ishimaru said the conversation about how to fix schools often neglects the parents.  They are "the folks who have the most at stake and sometimes the most expertise on their own children," she said.
