BALTIMORE, Md. — "No Art for Art's Sake" is a slogan that Under Armour takes to heart. The sporting goods company is linking personal stories about famous athletes to its products. It wants to give its products meaning.

The Baltimore, Maryland, company hopes an emotional connection will inspire customers to buy its athletic apparel.

"We always strive to tell a story," said Adam Clement, the company's senior creative director for team sports.

For example, basketball player Stephen Curry loves sour candy. Baseball's Bryce Harper drives a black Camaro. Football star Cam Newton took part in a famous college sports rivalry. Under Armour has designed shoes and uniforms to reflect all three athletes and some of their favorite things.

Curry was the Most Valuable Player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2015. He is also very religious. Two different shoes designed for him make a reference to Bible verses. Another shoe is bright yellow, green and red - like the colors of the Sour Patch Kids candy that Curry loves so much. That shoe is called "Candy Reign."

The basketball star's popularity has been good for Under Armour, which markets him as an underdog. Curry was passed over by many college basketball recruiters because he is small.

Curry recently extended his sponsorship deal with the company through 2024. He says he looks forward to continue being part of the brand's story.

## A Baseball Star Strikes Gold

Harper plays Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals. Next season, Under Armour says the star will introduce a black baseball shoe. It will be a sign of Harper's devotion to his car, a custom-built black Chevrolet Camaro. 

Harper is from Nevada. The gold shoes that he wore during the 2013 Home Run Derby represented the glittering Las Vegas, Nevada, skyline. The Home Run Derby is an MLB hitting contest. 

Josh Rattet, Under Armour's vice president for footwear, said that Harper's gold shoes turned out to be a home run with customers.

"We did a quick flash sale and it sold out within minutes," Rattet said.

## A Football Star's Heart On His Shoes

Newton is a quarterback for a National Football League (NFL) team called the Carolina Panthers. He wears football cleats in practice that support causes that he cares about. He puts on pink to support breast cancer research and camouflage to support the military. Newton also played college ball for Auburn University in Alabama. He wore a shoe in November to support Auburn in the Iron Bowl, a rivalry game against the University of Alabama. 

Under Armour says it has also designed cleats for Newton in Christmas colors for the holiday season. For his NFL games, he has to wear shoe colors tied to his NFL team.

## An Underdog Versus A Big Rival

Under Armour often markets itself as an underdog like Curry. Its closest competitor is Nike, a big company based in Oregon. Nike sells more clothing and footwear, but Under Armour is growing fast.

Under Armour has a goal of earning $7.5 billion in the year 2018. Footwear and international sales as well as sales to women and online fitness programs are all driving Under Armour's growth, adding up to $3 billion in sales last year.

Nike also sells its products and sportswear using athletes' stories. Observers said the two companies are competing with each other. They are both trying to sell clothing and shoes, sign famous athletes and use sports star's inspiring stories to entice consumers to buy their athletic apparel and footwear.

George Kiel runs a blog about sneakers called NiceKicks.com. A blog is an online column on a website where a writer can share personal experiences, observations and opinions. Kiel said Under Armour goes deeper into the story than other brands.

"Now athletes express themselves through their footwear," Kiel said. "It's kind of a competition to see who brings the best footwear out." 

Nike did not respond to requests for comment.

## Not Everyone Loves Under Armour

Under Armour's designs do not always get good reviews. Earlier this year, one sports news outlet said, "Under Armour is trying way too hard to be cool," and went on to say that the company has ugly shoes and dumb slogans.

Under Armour designed new uniforms based on the colors of the Maryland state flag for the Maryland Terrapins. When the college football team showed off their new uniforms in 2011, NBA superstar LeBron James tweeted, "Ewwwww." 

Shortly afterward, Clement said he was asked if he worked for Under Armour. When he said he did, the person asking the question replied that the guy who designed the Maryland uniforms must be on drugs. Clement recalled his response: "Well, you're looking at him, and I'm not."

Under Armour executives said the key is to find themes that provide an emotional connection for athletes, teams and their fans.

## Fast Feet And A Flag

In 2013, Under Armour developed attire for Natasha Hastings, an American track star.

"The cheetah is her favorite animal since it's the fastest animal," Clement said. "We placed the cheetah on the back so all those behind her would know the race leader couldn't be caught."

Under Armour went with a snake for the U.S. Naval Academy men's basketball team's apparel, creating the custom uniforms with a logo that says, "Don't Tread on Me," showing a snake above red and white stripes. The design was inspired by the United States Navy flag. It symbolized the American fight for freedom.

Clements said that trendy designs do not always stand the test of time, but ideas are enduring.
