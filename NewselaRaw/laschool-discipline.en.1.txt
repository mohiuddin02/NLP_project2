LOS ANGELES — Students who break the rules in Los Angeles schools will be less likely to be arrested or given a ticket under new reforms announced last week.

In the past, a student who had alcohol or marijuana on school grounds could be arrested or given a ticket. Under these reforms, the student might be referred to a counseling center or sent to the principal's office.

Activists, educators and justice officials hope the new system of discipline will prevent students, especially minorities, from becoming mired, or stuck, in the criminal justice system.

"Zero tolerance" discipline policies were first instituted in the 1970s and 1980s and they intensified after the 1999 Columbine school shooting. These policies generally require a serious punishment for students who break the rules.

## More Resolution, Fewer Arrests

From Oakland, California, to Broward County, Florida, the trend has been away from strict punishments. In January, the Obama administration advised schools to emphasize conflict resolution and classroom management over arrests and citations.

With more than 640,000 students at more than 1,000 schools, the Los Angeles school district is the second largest in the nation. It's one of the largest districts that has adopted a policy of less punishing discipline.

"This is a huge breakthrough," said Zoe Rawson of the Community Rights Campaign, a grass-roots organization that lobbied for the reforms.

Under the new system, Rawson said, "a guidance counselor will be there to sit down and be there with a young person and their family." This will keep young students out of the "permanent hole" of the criminal justice system, she added.

Still, students who break more serious rules will be subject to arrest. Displaying a weapon or selling drugs, for example, do not fall under the policy changes, according to school board member Mónica García. The new discipline policy is about being "appropriate," she said.

## It's About "Changing Behavior"

This year, if a student is caught fighting, vandalizing school property or carrying alcohol, a school police officer must follow a step-by-step formula to send the student to on- or off-campus interventions. Previously, such offenses would send a student to court or probation.

Students possessing less than an ounce of marijuana will be sent to an off-site resource center. The policy doesn't specify how to deal with students who repeatedly break the rules. This gives officers and school officials more latitude, or flexibility.

"It's not like three times, then you go to the court," Rawson said, adding that the new policy would allow school officials to help students on a deeper level.

"There's plenty of evidence we are tough. This is about changing behavior," García said. "We're acknowledging we have young people who need guidance and an opportunity to learn from their mistakes."

Zero tolerance in school discipline created racial disparities, where minorities were more likely to be arrested or ticketed, activists and educators said.

"It really is in low-income communities of color that we've seen this increase in law enforcement presence," said Ruth Cusick, an attorney who helped negotiate the policy changes with the district's police force.

There were 9,000 arrests and tickets in the 2011-2012 school year and 93 percent involved black or Latino students, according to data from the Labor/Community Strategy Center.

## Groups Praise New System

During the 2013-2014 school year, black students were 11 percent of the district's student population, but they made up about one-third of those suspended. A Department of Education investigation in 2011 found that the Los Angeles district's punishments were "inequitable and disproportionate." The district agreed to address the issue.

In recent years, the LA school district has scaled back harsh punishments. In 2013, it stopped suspensions of defiant students — those students who didn't follow the orders of school officials. In 2012, the district changed the way it punished the students caught skipping class. These kids would no longer get tickets, but be sent to off-site resource centers.

Jim Eichner, of the Washington, D.C.-based civil rights group Advancement Project, praised the end of "excessively harsh discipline" for low-level misconduct.

"Disruptive behavior is sometimes par for the course for students who are learning to behave properly," Eichner said.

Eichner responded to the criticism that educators are going soft on misbehaving students. He said the treatments students undergo under the new system are effective and challenging.

"More restorative practices — that's actually really being tough on kids because it makes kids face up to their behavior," Eichner said.

Eichner was referring to the idea of "restorative justice." Restorative justice focuses less on punishing people who break the rules, and more on healing the damage caused by rule-breaking.
