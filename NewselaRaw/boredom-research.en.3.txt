No one likes being bored. But maybe boredom itself isn't that boring. It turns out there's a lot more to it than scientists thought.

A new study of students in Germany reveals that there are five different types of boredom. That's one more than researchers had expected.

The newly discovered type is called "apathetic boredom." Apparently, it's quite common among high school students.

And boredom isn't just boring. It can be dangerous too â€” either for the person who is bored, or for the people around him or her. For instance, people who are bored are more likely to smoke, drink or use drugs. Kids who are bored are more likely to drop out of school and get into trouble with the police. Boredom can also lead to health problems.

## From Daydreaming To Leaving

But boredom hadn't been studied very much before.

Thomas Goetz set out to correct that. Goetz is an education researcher. He and his team found two sets of test subjects: 63 college students and 80 high school students.

The researchers gave the students personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, which are a bit like smartphones. These beeped six times during the day. When the PDAs beeped, students were asked to complete a survey. This asked what they were doing and how they felt about it.

Goetz's team didn't set out to find a new kind of boredom. Scientists then believed there were only four types of boredom.

The least serious form is a relaxing and slightly pleasant type of boredom that leads to daydreaming.

Next is a slightly unpleasant state of having wandering thoughts. At this level of boredom, people start to think about changing their situation.

More serious is what researchers call "searching boredom." It's a type of boredom that makes people feel restless. It leads them to actively try to do something to limit feelings of boredom.

The worst type is called reactant boredom. This is so bad it makes sufferers leave situations they find boring. It also makes them avoid those responsible for the situation, such as teachers.

## The Boring Life Of A Student

The short PDA surveys first asked student volunteers what they were doing. Were they in the middle of a serious activity such as attending a class or studying for a test? Or were they doing something easier, like eating or napping?

Students were then asked how they felt about what they were doing. If they felt bored, they were asked to rate their feelings of boredom. They could be feeling anything from "calm" to "fidgety."

What researchers found is that the life of a student can be very boring indeed.

During the two-week period of the study, the college students were bored more than a quarter of the time. Life was even more dull for the high school students. They were bored almost 40 percent of the time.

College students reported that slightly more than half of their boring experiences occurred during a serious activity. For high school students, this number was higher: two-thirds of their boring experiences occurred while they were in class or studying. Unlike college students, high schoolers can't easily walk away from a boring situation.

## A Big Boring Surprise

The big surprise for researchers was finding a fifth type of boredom: apathetic boredom. One-tenth of all boredom reported by the college students was apathetic boredom. Among high-schoolers, more than a third of all boredom was apathetic boredom.

This was a troubling discovery. Students found apathetic boredom even more unpleasant than reactant boredom, but they were far less likely to do anything about it. Apathetic boredom, the researchers say, is related to two serious mental health problems: learned helplessness and depression. In other words, apathetic boredom can lead to or add to feelings of sadness and hopelessness.

"Apathetic boredom seems to be as bad as reactant boredom," Goetz explained. Reactant boredom can be dangerous for other people. Apathetic boredom, he said, might be dangerous for the people experiencing it.

The researchers hope to continue their studies of boredom. They plan to study younger students, as well as adults in the workplace. But Goetz said he didn't expect any more boring surprises.

"I don't think that there are more than the five types of boredom," he said.
