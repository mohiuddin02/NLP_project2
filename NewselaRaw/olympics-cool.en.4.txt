SOCHI, Russia â€” The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is known for being old-fashioned. But it has finally embraced some new, and extreme, winter sports that young people like.

The change has been good for sports like slopestyle snowboarding and skiing. It has also helped the Olympics.

The mix of old and new sports could be seen at a media event last week.

Sage Kotsenburg was on the podium. The gold-medal-winning American snowboard dude was wearing a sweatsuit and knit cap. Christophe Dubi was up there, too. The neatly dressed man from Switzerland is the IOC's director of sports.

Snowboarders and freestyle skiers get to show off their skills in front of the whole world at the Olympics. Meanwhile, the new sports have added youthful energy to the Games. Millions of new TV viewers have tuned in.

## Young And Cool 'Tudes

"The Olympics are the highest level of competition you can get," said Gus Kenworthy. He is the silver medalist in slopestyle skiing. "Our sport is young and cool and has a following all its own. It's breathing new life into the Olympics."

More people watched Shaun White win the half-pipe than anything else NBC showed in the 2010 Games in Vancouver, Canada.

The same is true at the Sochi Games in Russia. Twenty-four million Americans watched White finish fourth Wednesday.

The youth movement couldn't have arrived at a better time. Figure skating has long been the Winter Olympics' biggest event. The sport drove TV ratings. But now, not as many people watch figure skating. The reasons include the sport's scoring system. The sport also seems very formal.

 The IOC resisted any major changes for many years. It paid no attention to sports like  snowboarding.

"Snowboarding was looked at as the rebel sport," said White. "It wasn't fit to be on the mountain."

## A New Direction

But things changed between 1992 and 2010. The IOC added short-track speedskating. Freestyle skiing and snowboarding also were let in.

There will be 15 days with either freestyle skiing or snowboarding at Sochi. Figure skating will only have 11 days.

Luke Bodensteiner is with the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association and was an early supporter of the new sports. He says Dubi should get a lot of credit for the change. Dubi pushed the IOC in a new direction.

Dubi said he wasn't trying to hurt the existing sports.

"We need to preserve our history. It's very important," he said. But the Olympics also needs to bring in a new audience, he added.

No sport better shows off the new Games than slopestyle. It has by far been the most discussed of the 12 first-time sports here.

"I think the world needed to see slopestyle," said Kotsenburg, who won the snowboarding event. "Snowboarding is different from figure skating or gymnastics. This is what the kids are doing nowadays."

## "We Really Had Goose Bumps"

The international skiing community finally noticed that a little over five years ago. It saw slopestyle's growth and potential.

Skaters have to perform a fixed set of moves, but slopestylers are free to experiment.

Figure skating's atmosphere often resembles that of classical music's. But a slopestyle event includes blaring music and lots of video screens.

When Kotsenburg won his gold medal, the audience at the 10 a.m. event overflowed Rosa Khutor Extreme Park. Dubi and several other IOC officials were in the crowd.

"We really had goose bumps," Dubi said of watching Kotsenburg soar.
