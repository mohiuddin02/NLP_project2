RAMALLAH, West Bank â€” When Sari Sakakini opened his Orjuwan deli, he hoped it would be the start of a global chain of Palestinian restaurants. A year later, his hope has faded.

The shop's wooden shelves hold a few homemade sauces, olives and soups.

"I want to put Palestinian food all over the world," Sakakini said. "But over here, it's just putting food on the table."

## Palestinians' Poverty And Plain Tastes

Ramallah is the cultural and political center of West Bank Palestinian life. In recent years, it has seen many new restaurants. Unlike other cities in the Middle East, like Beirut, Lebanon, or Amman, Jordan, Ramallah's food scene is barely simmering. People there have little money for eating out and they prefer old-fashioned food. Restaurants also suffer under Israeli restrictions. The West Bank is under neighboring Israel's control.

It is frustrating for Palestinian food professionals. Their distress is made worse by living so close to an Israeli food boom.

Skilled kitchen workers are rare in the West Bank, which has few cooking schools. Sakakini's head chef is a full-time schoolteacher. There are no full-time Palestinian food critics or food magazines to encourage change. Peter Nasir, who had hoped his Azure restaurant would take off, recently complained that chicken chow mein was about the most adventurous dish that his customers would accept.

And none of the restaurants make much money. They have to pay taxes to both the Israeli and Palestinian governments, and the few customers are shared by dozens of restaurants.

"Palestine is literally a forgotten corner," Sakakini said.

## Crazy About Cuisine In Israel

The scene is much different in Israel.

Food lovers flock to Tel Aviv, named by Saveur magazine as an outstanding destination for food in 2014. The Sabra brand of hummus, a spread of mashed chickpeas, is the official dip of the U.S. National Football League.

"It's very emotional for me," Sakakini said of the global love affair with Israeli food. "It's the same kitchen."

Israeli cuisine combines Palestinian flavors with Jewish cooking from around the world. Palestinian cooks trace their roots to countries around the Mediterranean Sea.

A glance at Palestinian cooks inside Israel shows the popularity of Palestinian cuisine.

Celebrity chef Nof Atamna-Ismaeel is an Israeli-Palestinian cook who recently led a cooking workshop in Israel. A scientist who won Israel's "MasterChef" contest in 2014, she is famous around Israel. Today she is a guest chef at many good restaurants and often writes for Israeli food magazines.

This is all a distant dream for West Bank Palestinians.

## Back To Hummus And Hamburgers

Nasir studied computer science in Atlanta. He discovered his love of food while cooking for his roommates.

He returned to Ramallah, and in 2007 converted his family's stone home and shaded courtyard into Azure. When he opened its doors, Nasir planned a short menu highlighting local specialties, fresh ingredients and foreign flavors. He was enthusiastic. His customers were not. His restaurant was not a success.

To stay in business, he began serving Palestinian favorites like hummus and grilled meat, along with hamburgers.

When people do not have enough money, "they don't want to spend their money experimenting," he said.

Nasir's experience shows the problems of life in Ramallah. The average Israeli's annual salary is 10 times the average Palestinian's income of about $3,000.

Beyond money, Nasir's customers travel far less than Israelis and they are not as used to new things. Because of conflict between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza, most West Bank and Gazan Palestinians are not allowed to enter Israel or use the Tel Aviv airport.

Nasir, who can travel freely in Israel, said his favorite restaurant is in Israel.

He said it costs the same as a restaurant in Ramallah, but "is actually creative and doing different things, not the same typical food," Nasir said.

On his way back to Ramallah, Nasir buys Heinz ketchup and mayonnaise outside Tel Aviv. This is to avoid paying both Israeli and Palestinian taxes on imported goods.

## Beyond "The Gaza Kitchen"

Despite the limitations, Palestinian cooking has its fans. "The Gaza Kitchen" cookbook, published in 2013, won international praise for its spicy seaside recipes.

Palestinian chef Johnny Goric plans to open a $500,000 cooking school in Ramallah in September. It will train students in local recipes and international methods.

At Orjuwan, co-owner Sakakini said Goric's school would be a lifeline. He said managing and training his staff to use new equipment has taken all his time.

"Our cuisine is rich, but it has to be better presented and upgraded," Sakakini said. "We're not missing anything."
