MILWAUKEE — For decades, fans of the great American architect Frank Lloyd Wright have been flocking to the S.C. Johnson corporate headquarters in Racine, Wis. They came to ogle the beautifully designed and innovative buildings, which inspired employees to invent consumer products found in kitchen cabinets throughout the world.

Tourists trooped through the great workroom inside the administration building and craned their heads to look up at the giant lily pad-like structures supporting the roof — the famous Wisconsin architect compared them to a glade of trees. Then they stopped to take pictures of the glass tube–enclosed research tower, glowing like a candle at the headquarters' center. And they asked: Can we go inside the tower?

Always the answer was: Sorry, no.

But last Friday, the S.C. Johnson research tower opened to the public for the first time. The opportunity to see one of the few surviving Wright-designed corporate offices from inside has prompted intense interest, with most of the free tours already reserved throughout May and into June.

## Uniquely Constructed

Rising 153 feet from the ground, the research tower is one of the tallest structures built on the cantilever principle. In that type of construction, only one end of a beam is anchored, allowing the other end to jut out without supports.

The tower's 15 floors are supported by the central core, which houses a narrow stairway, a tiny elevator and utility lines. Glass tubes encircle the tower, providing natural light and quickly warming the building on hot days. Many employees soon learned to wear sunglasses inside.

Wright rebelled against the notion that workplaces should be boxy and boring. Why, he asked, couldn't employees work in aesthetically pleasing offices and factories? Such surroundings, he argued, would actually serve to encourage workplace creativity.

## Inviting Bold Creativity

As if to confirm Wright's bold idea, within eight years of the research tower opening in 1950, Johnson's Wax employees had created numerous products that are still well- known today. Among them were Glade air freshener, Pledge furniture polish and the insecticides Off! and Raid.

"Products that are still staples 65 years later and core products of our company came out of this tower," said Greg Anderegg, director of global community affairs. Something about the facility, he said, really encouraged bold new ideas.

The tower was used by researchers for 32 years before closing in 1982. In recent years, the company has spent millions of dollars to restore the research facility and administration building. At some point, the company decided to open two floors of the research tower to the public.

The opening is creating quite a stir, partly because it's such a pivotal piece of architecture and partly because the tower has never been open for tours.

"People have been waiting for decades. It's this masterwork they've never been able to experience," said Sean Malone, CEO and president of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. "They've seen photos and can see it from outside, but they've never been able to come inside. Frank Lloyd Wright buildings are visceral and meant to be experienced."

## A Return To Glory Days

The two floors opening for tours have been returned to the glory of their product-development days. Cabinets have been restored to the original Cherokee Red color, while beakers, flasks, centrifuges, balances, test tubes and graduated cylinders are set out on countertops as if the folks who invented Off! had just stepped out for a coffee break.

S.C. Johnson's company historian Terri Boesel found much of the equipment in company storerooms and closets. Other items were bought on eBay or acquired through retired employees who collected old company products, such as original 1956 cans of Glade air freshener.

Boesel even set up a coat tree adorned with several lab coats that were embroidered with the names of retired researchers.

"It's my shout-out to all these people whose names I've seen" in company records, Boesel said.

## Boss Says OK To Wear Shades

Copies of original notes and letters are displayed on the two floors of the tower. Among them are a memo recommending that employees wear sunglasses to counter the glare of sunlight pouring through the glass tubing.

The original round recessed light fixtures in the ceiling had not aged well and were replaced with copies. More than 7,000 8- and 12-foot-long glass tubes have been cleaned — with S.C. Johnson product Windex, of course — and bricks have been replaced in the building.

Visitors start their guided tours at the Norman Foster–designed Fortaleza Hall. This features exhibits on Wright's Prairie-Style designs and on Usonia, his architectural vision for American homes. A third exhibit opening Friday will focus on his two personal residences, Taliesin in Spring Green, Wis., and Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Ariz. These classic buildings illustrate how Wright used the natural environment in his designs, to make homes look as if they had sprung up from the soil.

The exhibits were curated by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, who helps run Taliesin West, and Brady Roberts of the Milwaukee Art Museum.

The Taliesin exhibit will feature furniture from both homes, photos, designs and Wright's home movies.

## Stuff We Still Use

Roberts has visited the research tower, which he called "mind-blowing."

"It's like one of the purest examples of utopian architecture you'll actually see built," Roberts said. "It's such an enlightened idea to think the purpose was to inspire scientists, and what the scientists built there are still staples for S.C. Johnson in the 21st century. That's sort of incredible."

Anderegg said S.C. Johnson plans to keep the tours free, because the company feels a strong commitment to the Racine community.

"We feel like we're caretakers of great art and we want to share it," Anderegg said.
