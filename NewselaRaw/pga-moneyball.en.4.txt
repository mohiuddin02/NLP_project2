BETHESDA, Md. â€” For today's champion golfer, there's something just as important as having the right club. That something is statistical analysis.

Statistics is a type of math. It involves looking at information, often in the form of numbers, and finding out what the information means. It has become popular to use for advertisements, for computers and now for sports.

In golf, every move on the golf course is recorded, measured, and studied by experts. The experts can use the information to improve a player's game.

Information about a golfer's movements is stored in a computer-based system called ShotLink. Volunteers gather that information during tournaments. Since 1999, they have been measuring all sorts of shots. Sometimes the shots are drives that hit the ball far away. Sometimes they simply measure golfers tapping the ball a few inches toward the hole. For most events, about 350 volunteers are needed.

## An Added Advantage

Now, some players have begun relying on a person close to them to look at that information. The information is mostly in numbers. The experts will need to look for patterns and useful information. Players who use experts to track them include Jason Day, Zach Johnson and Brandt Snedeker

Colin Swatton is Jason Day's coach. He has been helping Day use statistics to help his golf swing since 2007. Swatton doesn't rely on ShotLink because as hardworking as the volunteers are, he said they do make mistakes. So Swatton himself notes the details and distances of all Day's shots.

"Every round we analyze it," Swatton said. "Then we break it down per hole, per course."

Day said that before every tournament, Swatton hands him a piece of paper. On it is a rundown of what he has to do to win the event.

Day said "that extra step" gives him an advantage. "Whatever I can do to help me win," he added, "I'll do."

## Needed A Better Club

Snedeker has been using the math involved with analyzing his swings for five years. He says he is sure that's why he had his top two years in 2012 and 2013.

Snedeker gave an example of how the numbers helped him.

Previously, he wasn't getting at all close to the hole when shooting from 125 to 150 yards, Snedeker said. After studying what the experts saw in his numbers, he realized his problem. He needed a better club. A club is the stick with a metal head that golfers use to hit the ball.

Tim Clark also said the math has improved his game.

He looked at his numbers a few weeks ago to see where his game was sort of wrong. "I knew I was struggling," he said. Still, "it was interesting to suddenly see it in writing."

He added, "It was something I started to work on."

## Practicing The Right Things

Sweden's Peter Hanson is also a fan of statistical analysis. He has "a professor in putting" to crunch his numbers for him.

Hanson uses the information to make his practice time more useful.

In the past, he said, he spent "way too many hours" practicing the wrong things. What he was focusing on "didn't have as much of an effect on the game as I thought."

For his part, Swatton is convinced of one thing. More and more players will be using statistical analysis.

"I think people will get more into it," Swatton said.
