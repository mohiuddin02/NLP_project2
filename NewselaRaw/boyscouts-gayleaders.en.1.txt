The president of the Boy Scouts of America urged the organization Thursday to accept gay Scout leaders.

Robert Gates said Scouting must keep up with the times on gay rights or face "the end of us as a national movement."

## "The World As It Is"

Gates is the former U.S. defense secretary who was elected president of the Scouts last year. On Thursday, he warned the participants of a national meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, that the long-standing ban on gay Scout leaders would inevitably provoke lawsuits unless it were changed. He suggested steps to avert what could be a threat to the existence of the century-old organization.

"We must deal with the world as it is, not as we might wish it would be," said Gates. When he was the head of the U.S. Department of Defense, he oversaw the end of the military's ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly as soldiers. At the time, the law did not allow gay and lesbian people to serve in the military.

Gates' remarks come at an important time for the Scouts. The organization did away with its ban on membership for openly gay youths two years ago and has come under increasing pressure to change its policy toward gay adults. Gay rights advocates said they viewed Gates' comments as a strong signal that the Boy Scouts would permit gay leaders soon, perhaps within the year.

## Religious Pressure

The Scouts have held fast to the ban over the years, even as homosexuality and same-sex marriage have increasingly come to be accepted by the American public. The policy has remained in place in part because of the strong influence on Scouting of religious communities. Some of these groups believe homosexuality is forbidden by the Bible. About 70 percent of Boy Scouts belong to troops sponsored by Mormon, Catholic or other churches.

Still, Gates' statement acknowledges that even powerful institutions such as the Boy Scouts can no longer isolate themselves from gay rights.

In a sign of those changing times, a federal judge on Thursday ordered local officials in Alabama to start issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Gay weddings were to have begun there earlier this year, but were halted by the state's conservative Supreme Court. Next month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide whether the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry.

## Seeking A Compromise

Religious groups reacted cautiously to Gates' remarks. Officials at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon Church, said in a statement on their website that they will carefully watch discussion of the Boy Scouts' policy. The statement said they will "examine any such changes very carefully to assess how they might impact our own century-long association with" the Scouts.

Officials with the National Catholic Committee on Scouting said Thursday they were not yet ready to make a statement.

In his speech, Gates suggested a change in policy aimed at satisfying those within the Scouts that would like to see the gay ban lifted. At the same time, it would let religious groups reject gay leaders. His compromise would allow individual organizations sponsoring troops to decide whether to allow gay leaders or not.

## Legal Challenges

The Boy Scouts had been facing the possibility of multiple legal challenges around the country involving gay leaders. The challenges would come from people who had been fired or denied a job because of their sexual orientation.

In New York, Pascal Tessier is an openly gay Eagle Scout who had been hired in open defiance of the national policy. He has hired the law firm Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner  to represent him if he is dismissed. The powerful New York law firm had helped overturn California's same-sex marriage ban.

The firm has also filed a complaint against the Denver Boy Scouts. They are representing a woman whose job offer with the Scouts was withdrawn last year after she disclosed she was gay. Attorneys have been in touch with others like her in Ohio, Oklahoma and elsewhere, said Josh Schiller, a partner in the firm.

In the past, the Scouts kept its policy on gay leaders despite legal challenges. But the many recent state and local laws explicitly banning discrimination against gays would strengthen legal cases against the Scouts now, Schiller said.

"We're very hopeful that the result of Robert Gates' statement today means that the Boy Scouts are truly looking forward and not backward," Schiller said.

## Scouts For Equality

Objections to the policy have come not only from outside the Scouts but from within it as well. Nationally, 20 regional councils have adopted nondiscrimination policies aimed at protecting gays in scouting, said Zach Wahls. He is an Eagle Scout and executive director of Scouts for Equality, a group founded to promote gay rights within the Boy Scouts.

The fact that the Boy Scouts appear to be moving forward on lifting the ban suggests that they are worried about "a full-scale rebellion" if they don't act, Wahls said. "They've realized this isn't a fight they want to have in 2015."

In his remarks Thursday, Gates said for the first time that the Scouts would not take action against local councils that have hired gay leaders. He warned "plainly and bluntly" about the serious challenges he saw ahead if the organization did not change.

"The one thing we cannot do is put our heads in the sand and pretend this challenge will go away or abate," Gates said. "Quite the opposite is happening."
