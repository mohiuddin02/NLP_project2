As soon as she heard the word "go," Ashley Jackson grabbed her orange dumbbells. She lifted the weights above her head and then lowered them to her sides.

To the sound of pulsating music, she continued until she heard her teacher say "switch."

She put them down immediately and began doing jumping jacks.

Ashley, who is only 10, is part of Kids' Boot Camp at Memorial Hospital West in Miami. The program is aimed at getting kids in shape at an early age.

For Ashley, the 45-minute high-impact class helps her achieve her goal of being able to wear her clothes comfortably.

"I have some clothes I stretch out," she said. "It's tiring, but it's fun."

## Healthy Eating And Exercise Are Encouraged

Memorial West's class is one of several programs offered through local hospitals to help children stay healthy through exercise and proper eating. The Memorial West program is geared toward keeping children active. Other programs are more extensive and for children who are extremely overweight or at-risk of becoming overweight.

The idea is to encourage healthy eating and exercise as early as possible to prevent health problems later on. Program organizers say parents need to introduce fruits and vegetables. They should also limit television and computer time so healthy habits become part of a child's routine.

"It's a serious problem and can only get worse," said Dr. William Muinos, who heads the Weight Management Program at Miami Children's Hospital. "It's all about health."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one out of every three children is obese. The number has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, the CDC reports.

## Kids Get Lots Of Support

Muinos sees about 30 children every Friday as part of the Weight Management Program. He works to create plans for each child based on age, height and body mass index, which measures body fat based on a person's height and weight.

Muinos said he has worked with children who have had to lose more than 100 pounds. While he works to get the children to understand the importance of losing weigh, he knows he also has to make sure the family is on board.

"A child cannot do it by themselves," he said. "The parent has to make the commitment."

He starts by encouraging kids to eat more vegetables and fewer starchy foods, like potatoes and bread. He also develops a "doable" exercise plan that can be anything from walking to going to the gym.

"We have to make sure it's something a child will stick with," he said.

Muinos said most of the time the kid has to change his or her behavior completely. He said today's world of fast food, television and video games contributes to the "epidemic" of too much body fat.

"This is a societal issue," he said.

## Changes Lead To Motivation

For Jose Carlos Sanchez, 14, the past two months have been a complete lifestyle change. When he met Muinos, he weighed nearly 250 pounds. Since then, Sanchez has lost 20 pounds and is motivated to lose more.

"I feel much better about myself," said Sanchez, who is going into eighth grade. "I have a lot more energy."

His mom, Mayelin Govea, said she is very happy her son's weight is under control.

"He didn't like fruit or salad," she said. "He didn't want to exercise."

Now she takes him to the gym several times a week and he plays basketball with his friends.

"I see a big change in him," she said.

Miami Children's Hospital also has a 10-week program for overweight Latina teen girls called Healthy Chicas. The sessions include exercise, healthy eating and cooking lessons.

At the University of Miami's Batchelor Children's Research Institute, overweight children are put on a plan that includes healthy eating and exercise. Dr. Tracie Miller explains to them how excess weight can affect each organ.

"It's very important that we understand what is going on in the inside," she said.

The first three months are the strictest.

"The idea is to go hard and fast in the beginning," Miller said. "Really, the hardest part is just getting started."

But, at the end of the day, fun is key, she said.

## They Are Rock Stars!

At the exercise class at Memorial West, many of the children didn't even realize how hard they were working.

Rickey Dickenson, who teaches the class, tries to make it like a club with popular music and games. He creates a high-endurance and high-cardio class by using hula hoops, sliders, weights and balls.

"I make it a rock star-type atmosphere and the kids get into it," he said. "By the end of the class they are all sweating."

Viana Espinal, 7, said she "feels good" about herself.

"I worked hard," she said, her face red from the workout.

For Linnea Martinez, the class is a great way for her sons to get used to physical activity. Martinez is a former ballerina and often goes to the gym.

"I want them to be strong and confident," she said of her three boys, who are 7, 9 and 10. "And they are boys, they need to run off some of that energy."
