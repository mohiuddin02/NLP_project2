ST. LOUIS — Honeybees are in trouble. They are dying in great numbers, and no one is really sure why.

One-third of the food we eat depends on pollination by honeybees. Bees carry the pollen from one part of a plant to another. Plants then grow and make the fruit, grains and vegetables we eat. Our food system would not work without the honeybees.

Beekeeping groups have held meetings. Scientists have studied the problem.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) makes sure the food system is working correctly. A USDA report says there may be many causes for the mysterious deaths.

Companies that make seeds and grow food are also worried. Missouri-based Monsanto Co. bought an Israeli bee research company two years ago. Bayer CropScience is building a huge "bee health center." Syngenta and Bayer are developing what they call an action plan for bee health.

These businesses are interested in solving the mystery. American crops are worth $20 billion.

## A Drop In The Bee Population

But some scientists argue it might be the companies' fault. They use a lot of chemicals to protect crops from plant-eating pests.

In 2006, beekeepers started noticing that bees were leaving their hives. The number of American bees has gone down by one-third every year since then.  Scientists, beekeepers and farmers are trying to figure out why.

Scientists believe there are two main causes. The first is the use of chemicals that kill insects. These chemicals are called insecticides or pesticides.

The second is a farming system that plants only one kind of crop over a large area. Corn or soybeans are planted this way in the Midwest. This system doesn't leave room for other plants and flowers to grow. Bees lose variety in their diet when there's only one kind of crop around. A limited diet makes the bees less resistant to sickness.

Marla Spivak of the University of Minnesota thinks the chemicals that kill crop pests are also killing bees.

## A Widely Used Pesticide

Some say the worst pesticides for bees are neonicotinoids. They are safer for humans and animals than some other insecticides. For that reason, they are widely used. Neonicotinoids are sprayed on the corn and soybeans planted in the U.S.

Huge numbers of bees died in the spring. Farmers were spraying their corn crops at that time. Scientist Christian Krupke found high levels of neonicotinoid in the dead bees.

Krupke is sure the chemical caused the bees to die. He said it lands on dandelions and even on the bees themselves.

Neonicotinoids are made by Bayer and Syngenta. Their scientists disagree with Krupke.

David Fischer works for Bayer CropScience. He said there was no proof that neonics hurt bees. He explained that Bayer depends on bees for pollination. He thought it would be a "poor business model" if they were poisoning the bees.

## Too Much Spraying?

Some scientists think neonicotinoids aren't even necessary. The companies claim the pesticide raises the amount of crops they get.

Krupke has done studies to see if that's true. "We have not found any difference in yield or root damage — nothing," he said. "It doesn't mean it never works," he added. He thinks farmers should not spray every kernel of corn.

Union of Concerned Scientists president Doug Gurian-Sherman calls the problem very serious. He would like to see insecticide use stopped now. Missouri beekeepers would seem to agree.

Neal Bergman is the state's largest beekeeper. He remembers a time when crop planes sprayed fields with the insecticide malathion.

"They sprayed 400,000 acres of cotton every week," he said. "It didn't matter how the wind was blowing or what time of day it was. They sprayed over people, over animals, over beehives — everything."

Bergman says his bee population dropped, costing him $1 million. He almost went out of business. Since then, he doesn't trust insecticides. He would like farmers not to spray when the bees are around. He's also giving his bees medicine and extra protein.

But some say time is running short to solve the mystery.
