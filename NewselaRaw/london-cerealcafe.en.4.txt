LONDON, England â€” The East End is a neighborhood in London, England. It has changed quickly in the past few years. Some people in the East End are not happy about a new restaurant. The restaurant serves 120 types of breakfast cereal. Some people think a restaurant selling expensive cereal is wrong. They say it is a sign that the neighborhood is only for rich people.

## Divide Between Rich And Poor

The fight is part of a larger problem in London. The divide between rich and poor people is growing.

The restaurant is called the Cereal Killer Cafe. Cereal there costs about 3 pounds a bowl. Pounds are what  British money is called. Three pounds equals about $4.50.

The restaurant is 9 months old. One weekend it was surrounded by angry protesters. The protesters are not happy about changes that make the neighborhood appealing to richer people. The changes can make a neighborhood too expensive for the people who have lived there for a long time. Some move away.

The protestors held flaming torches. Customers had to go to the basement to be safe.

## Lots Of People Like Cereal Cafe

"It is a bit weird," said Gary Keery. He runs the cafe with his brother, Alan.

The Keery brothers are 33-year-old twins from Northern Ireland. They are part of the latest migrants to move to the area from other countries. Over the years European Jews have moved in. So have Bangladeshi Muslims and other migrants. They brought businesses like bagel shops and Indian restaurants to the area.

The Keery brothers choose the area because of the mix of people.

It seems like the brothers were right. Crowds line up for a bowl of cereal.

Not everyone is a fan. On Saturday, the protesters came to the cafe. They say the cafe shows what is wrong with how London is changing.

## Protest Is About Housing, Not Cereal

A group called Class War organized the protest.

Tony Travers is an expert on London. He says the cereal fight is about something more. There is not enough space to live in the city. There are already 8.6 million people in London. Another 120,000 people are added each year. There are not enough apartments and houses for everyone.

Rent prices keep going up. So do home prices. People who make less money are being pushed out.

Class War says it is delighted with the attention from the protest. It plans more.

The Keery brothers are not worried. They are opening a second restaurant. They also have a cereal cookbook coming out next month.
