In November 2014, two white Cleveland officers killed a 12-year-old black boy. Last month, a grand jury decided not to charge them with a crime. A grand jury is a group of citizens chosen to look at all the facts and decide if a person should be charged with a crime.

Activists are upset about the grand jury's decision. They believe they have come up with another way to punish the officers.

They have turned to the closest thing Ohio has to a superhero. They have asked Cleveland Cavaliers basketball star LeBron James to sit out the NBA season.

## Turning To Twitter

The activists have started a Twitter campaign. They hope this will pressure the government's Department of Justice to make sure the two police officers go to jail. The department is also looking into the shooting.

The boy who was killed is named Tamir Rice. Last year, James said Rice's death showed "how much further we still have to go," in race relations, according to the website Cleveland.com. Many in the black community distrust police and feel that they treat black people unfairly.

## Recalling Athletes Past And Present

James used to play for the Miami Heat. In 2012, James and his Miami Heat teammates put on hoodie sweatshirts in honor of another black teen who had been killed. Trayvon Martin was killed in Florida by a Latino man who claimed he was shooting in self-defense. Martin was wearing a hoodie when he died.

The activists hope that James will agree to not play this season. Last year, there were racial problems at the University of Missouri. Some people thought that Tim Wolfe, the head of the university system, handled the problems badly. Football players refused to play and Wolfe quit. The activists are calling it an example of the power of athletes.

Others activists have posted videos of famous boxer Muhammad Ali. During the Vietnam War, Ali, who is black, refused to serve in the U.S. Army. Ali is a Muslim and said it was against his religion.

At the time, Ali asked, why should he serve? He said black people in America are "treated like dogs and denied simple human rights." In 1967, a judge ordered Ali to pay a fine of $10,000. His heavyweight boxing title was taken away from him and he was not allowed to box for three years.

## Is It Really Fair?

James has not responded to the request to not play.

On social media, Tamir Rice supporters have different feelings about it. Some have asked whether it is fair to ask James to stop playing.

It also would have no influence on the Justice Department investigation.

The University of Missouri example is a problem as well. Wolfe decided to quit because of the pressure from football players and other students. He is just one man. It would not be as easy to influence a government investigation in the Rice case.
