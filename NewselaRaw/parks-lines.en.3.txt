ORLANDO, Fla. â€” Walt Disney World visitors wait in long lines. At the Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride they once had to stand in the sun.

Now, the riders are ushered into an air-conditioned tent. Kids can play on slides, a climbing tower, and a toy fire engine. Parents wait for the buzz of a pager telling them it's time to board the ride.

"It's so much better this way," Russ Spence of Richmond, Va., said as he relaxed in the tent. He was waiting to take his 3-year-old grandson on the ride.

Theme park lines keep getting longer. That's why parks like Disney World in Florida are investing a lot of money to make waiting times fly by. It makes good business sense. Long lines are one of the biggest gripes of theme park goers.
## Lot Of Time Spent On Line

Cutting the wait time is necessary, according to Jim MacPhee. He is the senior vice president at Walt Disney World Parks. The company is trying to make ride lines more fun.

The idea has caught on. New interactive lines have opened at Florida and Southern California theme parks. The lines offer videos, games, and animatronic characters to entertain waiting riders.

At some parks, jugglers and other entertainers are sent to extra-long lines.

Attendance for the top 20 theme parks in North America has grown 7 percent from 2007 to 2012, according to a company called Aecom which keeps track of such things.

Because of the growing crowds, the average visitor has time for only nine or 10 rides each day. That means a lot of time spent standing in lines.

One of the first efforts to address long lines came in 1999. Disney parks introduced the Fastpass. It let visitors return to a ride at a scheduled time to get on a shorter line. Other parks copied the idea. Six Flags offers its guests the Flash Pass. These passes are free.
## A Watery Grave(stone)

At most theme parks, visitors can pay extra money for passes to shorter lines.

For everyone else, the lines are still long. But in some cases, they are more entertaining.

Disney World in Orlando has been adding games and other distractions to the lines for several years. Some of the more elaborate entertainment has been added in the last two years as new rides get built and old ones get redone.

"When the opportunity presents itself, we will add an interactive queue (line)," MacPhee said.

Visitors in line for the Haunted Mansion have fun and stay cool. They can touch gravestones that play music or squirt water at them.

There's plenty to do while waiting in line for the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Visitors use their hands to write on a wall of simulated dripping honey. They can also play music on plastic pumpkins and watermelons.

The distractions were needed on a recent summer day. The waiting time for the Winnie the Pooh ride was more than an hour.
## Protecting The "AllSpark"

Kelly Ferreri travels from Pennsylvania to Disney World every year with her family. As she waited at Winnie the Pooh, she watched her children, ages 1, 3 and 6, play with the pumpkins and honey wall.

She thought the games helped. "It keeps kids entertained for all the time that they would be standing in line," she said. "It's beautiful."

At Universal Studios Hollywood, riders of the new Transformers: The Ride-3D line up in an area resembling a military fort. They watch videos that explain their mission. They must keep the powerful "AllSpark" from falling into the hands of the evil Decepticons.

Larry Kurzweil is the president of Universal Studios Hollywood. "Guest satisfaction is very important to us," he said. "We want to entertain our guests from the moment they enter the ride queue."

Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia recently installed a 16-by-9-foot screen near the newest ride, Full Throttle. Visitors waiting in line can see a 25-minute video of extreme sports, such as bungee jumping and mountain biking.
## Mr. Potato Head's "Weight" Joke

This summer, Six Flags Entertainment Corp. also launched an interactive game similar to Whac-A-Mole. Visitors play it on television screens, using their cellphones as controllers. The game is available at all 16 Six Flags parks.

David McKillips is a senior vice president at Six Flags. He says the games make for a better overall experience.

Visitors to the Toy Story Midway Mania ride at Disney's California Adventure Park are entertained by an animatronic Mr. Potato Head. He sings and tells jokes to the crowd. The voice was recorded by comedian Don Rickles.

"I'm going to guess your weight," Mr. Potato Head tells guests. "I'd say you wait about 15, 20, 25 minutes, tops!"
