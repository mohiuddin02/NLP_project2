After finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on every possible count for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing two years ago, a jury was told to answer another question. What should happen to him?

Before the jurors began deliberating last week, federal District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. reminded them that they had two choices. They must decide if Tsarnaev would spend the rest of his life in prison or if he should be executed by the federal government.

"The choice between these very serious alternatives is yours, and yours alone, to make," O'Toole said.

On Friday, the jury sentenced Tsarnaev to death.

## Aggravating Versus Mitigating Factors

On April 15, 2013, Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, exploded two bombs at the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 250 others.

In April, the jury found Tsarnaev guilty on 30 charges, 17 of which carried the death penalty. A death sentence on any of these counts had to be the unanimous decision of the jury. If even one juror chose life imprisonment over death, the sentence would automatically be life in prison.

The jurors were told to consider two sets of factors when considering the sentence. Aggravating factors were anything that could support a death sentence, while mitigating factors would argue for life imprisonment instead. One bombing victim in particular — 8-year-old Martin Richard — was cited repeatedly as an aggravating factor.

The federal death penalty law notes that a victim who is very young or old can be considered particularly vulnerable. In its decision to seek the death penalty and again during the trial, prosecutors emphasized how young Martin was at the time of his death. In court last week, prosecutors again pointed to the terrible scene he witnessed before he died.

However, after Tsarnaev was found guilty, Martin's parents wrote a letter asking the federal government to stop seeking the death penalty. They argued that the stream of appeals to follow would keep Tsarnaev in the news and his case in their lives, while life in prison would remove that burden. Even though Tsarnaev received the death penalty, he can still appeal it to higher courts.

It is unclear if the jurors ever learned of this letter's existence, however. On the day they began deliberating on how to sentence Tsarnaev, they told the judge that they had tried to stay away as much as possible from any media coverage of the case.

## "He Killed Indiscriminately," Prosecutor Says

Prosecutors last week used their last chance in front of the jury to retell details about the bombings and what happened after. They outlined to the jurors the death and destruction that occurred at the marathon and beyond.

"He killed indiscriminately to make a political statement, and he placed no value on the lives and didn't care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends," said U.S. Attorney Steven Mellin, during the government's closing arguments. Prosecutors said the Tsarnaev brothers carried out the attack in retaliation for U.S. wars in Muslim lands.

"His actions have earned him a sentence of death," Mellin said.

Tsarnaev's lawyers, meanwhile, based their case on what they considered mitigating factors, such as Tsarnaev's youth. He was 19 when the bombing occurred. Crucially, they said, he was under the sway of his older brother, Tamerlan, who died several days after the bombing in a shootout with police.

Judy Clarke, his defense lawyer, used her closing argument to paint a picture of the older brother as Tsarnaev's "sole source of family, of support, of strength." She described the older brother as bigger and possessing more personality, giving examples of how Dzhokhar was influenced by Tamerlan.

"The horrific events of the Boston Marathon bombing cannot be told or understood in any degree of reality without talking about Tamerlan," she said.

Clarke also described Tsarnaev's potential for change. She pointed to the testimony earlier last week of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and death-penalty opponent, who said Tsarnaev was truly sorry.

"The law values life, and you have no obligation to vote for death," Clarke said to the jurors.

## 14 Hours Of Deliberations

Before agreeing on a sentence, the jurors had to first agree that Tsarnaev was 18 years old. The federal death penalty law prevents a death sentence for anyone younger than 18 when they committed a crime. Jurors were told to consider only the evidence presented in the trial. They are not supposed to consider anything they may have read in the media or other information that was not presented in the trial.

O'Toole also told the jurors that they had to decide if the government proved "beyond a reasonable doubt and to your unanimous satisfaction" that aggravating factors were at work in this case. Only if they agreed on this should they sentence him to death, the judge said.

Ultimately, as O'Toole outlined last week, each juror had to decide what he or she believed. It took about 14 hours of deliberations before the jury agreed on the verdict. Tsarnaev is now the 62nd person on federal death row waiting to be executed.
