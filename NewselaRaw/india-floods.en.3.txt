NEW DELHI â€“ Flooding in northwest India has killed 550 people so far, state disaster officials said. Rescue teams scrambled over the weekend to find survivors.

The flooding has centered in the state of Uttarakhand, which borders China and Nepal. Many tourists visit the state to see the Himalayan mountains and a number of holy landmarks. Uttarakhand is home to the source of the Ganges river, which is holy for followers of the Hindu religion.

The two rivers that form the Ganges have swollen from heavy rains. Entire families have been washed away by the gushing waters.

More than 13,800 people were missing. Another 32,000 people were believed to be trapped. The flooding was a result of the monsoon, seasonal rains that soak the region.

## Finding People, Dropping Food Supplies

Google has set up a "person finder" app to help people track down their missing relatives. They can also use the app to get up-to-date information about the flooded areas.

Jaspal Arya is the disaster minister for the state. He said the rescue operations were being carried out as if it were a "war."

"Forty-five helicopters are combing areas to find people and drop food supplies," Arya said. The roads that would be used to bring relief have been destroyed, he explained.

Television footage showed stranded people climbing down cliffs, aided by soldiers. Around 73,000 people have been evacuated so far.

Police spokesman Deepak Pandey said there were about 8,000 people still trapped in the worst-hit district.

"Women, children and the elderly are being airlifted by helicopters while able-bodied men are being helped to move out using a ropeway," Pandey said.

June is the peak season for tourism in Uttarakhand. Many of the visitors are pilgrims, who come to worship at the state's many Hindu temples. But this year the monsoon arrived two weeks ahead of schedule. Many pilgrims have been stranded amid the destruction.

## More Rains Coming

Indian meteorologists said heavy rains are expected in the region from Monday. The foul weather will make the rescue effort more difficult.

"The next 24 hours will be crucial for rescue operations," Pandey said.

Officials said it may take another 15 days to get everyone in the region to safety.

"Our priority remains evacuation and emergency supplies to those who are stuck," said Anil Chait, an army general who is in charge of the rescue. The army was trying to repair roads and make temporary bridges to restore land-links to the cut-off areas.

A private helicopter being used to rescue stranded people crashed late Friday. There were no deaths.

Kedarnath is a beloved Hindu temple in the region. The flooding had turned it into a graveyard. Bodies are buried in the rubble surrounding the shrine.

"The center of faith has turned into a burial ground. Bodies are scattered in the area," state agriculture minister Harak Singh Rawat told reporters.

## Entire Families Killed

Radhey Shyam was on a pilgrimage to Kedarnath. He was the sole survivor in his family, with 13 relatives killed.

"My wife, my daughter and relatives were all swept away by the floods. Nobody is alive," he told television reporters. "Scores of people have climbed hill-slopes and are in forests, who need to be helped and rescued as soon as possible."

KB Rana's three-story business complex was swept away by the raging Mandakini river: "I have lost all that I had. It was washed away by the floods in a matter of minutes."

Other survivors complained that locals refused them shelter. There were reports of shopkeepers taking advantage of the disaster by overcharging for bottled water and biscuits.

"We were scared of dying and just kept running for our lives. We don't know how many kilometers we ran. People kept telling us to run to save our lives," another survivor said.

Angry relatives blocked roads outside the airport in the state capital. They protested at the lack of help and information from officials.

"I have been here for the past three days to get some information about my missing father and mother. But there is no official here to help us. It's an endless wait," Brajesh Singh said.

The floods are the worst the area has seen in 60 years. Indian press blamed construction, mining and huge power projects in the region for making the situation worse.

The disaster was "man-made" because environmental laws had been openly broken in the region, broadcaster NDTV said.

Dams, putting buildings near riverbeds and blasting mountains to build roads are putting India's mountainous states at risk, the _Times of India_ wrote.
