WASHINGTON — The United States ended all contact with Cuba in 1961. This week, President Barack Obama cleared the way for rebuilding normal relations between the two countries.

In a message to Congress, Obama said he plans to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The list is made up of counties that provide support for terrorism. The decision also recognizes that Cuba no longer is promoting revolution in Latin America or trying to overthrow governments in other countries.

## Promises Were Made

Last December, Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro promised to move toward normal relations.

Congress has 45 days to consider Cuba's removal from the list. Lawmakers would need to take a vote if they want to keep Cuba on the list. The Obama government thinks that is not likely.

Obama said many Americans approve of his plan to fix the relationship with Cuba.

Diplomatic ties with Cuba were broken after the communist revolution. The government overthrow brought Fidel Castro, Raul Castro's brother, to power. Under communism, the government owns all property and people have few freedoms. Cuba was first put on the state terrorism list in 1982. At the time, Cuba tried to spread communism and stir up revolutions in other countries, particularly in Latin America.

"Our hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago," Secretary of State John Kerry said. He is the leader of the State Department, which manages the United States' relations with other countries.

## There Are Still Policy Disagreements

There are still many problems in Latin America, including corruption, violence and drugs. However, Cuba is the only country in Latin America that does not have a democratic government elected by its citizens. Also, most of the violent revolutions in the area ended long ago.

If Cuba is taken off the terror list, only three countries remain. They are Iran, Sudan and Syria.

Josefina Vidal is the director of U.S. relations at Cuba's Foreign Ministry. She said the decision to take Cuba off the list is fair. She added that Cuba never deserved to be on it in the first place.

She said Cuba rejects terrorism. Cuba also is against anything that encourages, supports, pays for, or helps terrorists.

Obama told Congress that Cuba is not currently supporting international terrorism. Cuba also has promised not to support it in the future.

Kerry said that the United States disagrees with many of Cuba's policies and actions. But these are not considered terrorism under American law.

## Ambassadors Would Move In Again

U.S. officials said that full normalization of relations with Cuba could take years.

The two countries would open embassies and exchange ambassadors, who serve as official representatives. Currently, trade and travel to Cuba is limited.

Congress passed the trade and travel rules to pressure Cuba to end communism. Only Congress can lift the rules, but the president has the power to establish diplomatic relations.

Before the announcement, high-level Cuban and U.S. officials held three rounds of talks. Cuba had demanded that the United States take it off the terror list. For Cuba's part, the United States said that U.S. officials must be able to freely move around the island. Also, Cuban citizens could not be kept from entering the U.S. Embassy.

A country on the terrorism list cannot buy weapons from the United States or receive economic help.

## American Ideas And Trade Could Help

Democratic Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois helped reach the agreement with Cuba. He said that he is not a fan of Castro's government. But opening up Cuba to American ideas and trade is the best way "to see a more open and tolerant Cuba," he said.

Not everyone agrees with Obama's decision. Opponents in Congress were led by Cuban-American Senators Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida. Rubio is a candidate for president. They are against having a normal relationship with Cuba.

In the past, several Americans fled to Cuba to escape criminal charges in the United States. The senators argue that Cuba should not be taken off the list until it sends them back.

Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona agrees that Cuba should return the fugitives. "It might be a nice gesture," he said. "but it's not going to happen."
