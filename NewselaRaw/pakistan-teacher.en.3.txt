ISLAMABAD â€” Mohammed Ayub teaches young people in Pakistan. He holds his classes outside in an open field. Ayub uses blackboards that are attached to metal pipes. Anyone can come to his school.

Ayub worked for years on the school. It started with a promise to his dying father that he would make sure his brothers and sisters got an education. The promise eventually led to Ayub spending his life teaching poor people in the city. Ayub has taught for 30 years. Without him, many of the children he taught might not have been educated.

Ayub said thousands of people have gone to his school. Now he is getting an award. He also said he will continue trying to educate people until he dies.

## All About His Brothers And His Sisters

Ayub is 57. He came to Islamabad in 1976 from his hometown. That town was about 105 miles from the capital. Ayub's father had died. He wanted to find a job so he could take care of his seven brothers and sisters. Back home, he had struggled through many unskilled jobs. In Islamabad, he eventually found a low-level position. He worked hard to learn new skills such as first aid and firefighting. After some time, Ayub became a regular firefighter.

He always sent money home to his brothers and sisters.

## An Idea Began With Just One Boy

One day in 1985, he saw a boy about 12 years old. The boy was cleaning tables in a restaurant. It gave Ayub an idea.

Ayub said the boy reminded him of his younger brother, so he decided to teach the boy. That was the start of his plan to have a school that anybody could come to, Ayub said.

Ayub convinced other boys working in shops and restaurants in the neighborhood to study with him. They studied in the middle of the market for an hour or two, but the shopkeepers did not like it. They thought he was taking up too much space, so they made him leave.

Ayub moved the school many times. Then he found an open field near the city's Kohsar market.

## Learning The Basics For Life

Ayub was not trained to be a teacher, but he taught students math. Ayub also taught the language Urdu and some beginning English.

When he started, most of the students were children who lived in the streets or worked during the day. They did not go to regular school. Now there are about 170 students. About three-quarters of them go schools run by the government. They come to Ayub's classes afterward for extra tutoring. Ayub's other students aren't in school at all.

The education system in Pakistan is not good. Many students are not in school. Schools often don't have running water, electricity or bathrooms that work. Students are taught to memorize, observers said. Learning like that does little to prepare students.

Over the years, a small group of volunteers have joined Ayub. They include a retired school principal, a doctor and a fireman. Several older students also teach the younger ones.

## The Gift Of Literacy

Irfan Siddiqi works for Pakistan's prime minister. He was impressed by how much the students cared about Ayub. He suggested that Ayub receive a special award. It is called the "Pride of Performance" award. The honor is given to Pakistanis for contributions to society. Siddiqi said he had read stories about Ayub and went to see the school himself without telling anybody he was coming.

Ayub is giving "a great service to this society," Siddiqi said.

Farhat Abbas was a student of Ayub's. He has come back to tutor others. Abbas still remembers when Ayub found him cutting down wood in a neighborhood forest to make money for his family and persuaded him to come and study.

"I want to become a teacher like him and do the same," Abbas said. He added that he would not have been able to read or write if he had not met Ayub.
