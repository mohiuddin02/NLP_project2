To save the day, players must do all of the usual video game stunts, like travel through time or talk to animals.

"Citizen Science" is just one of many video games developed by Games + Learning + Society (GLS). GLS is a company that calls itself one of the longest standing games-for-learning research centers in the world.

It is a key player in a growing field that brings scientists, educators and game designers together. The goal of GLS is to change traditional science education methods using video games. Their games promote learning about biological systems, civic activism, empathy and even literacy.

The creators of these video games do not want to replace teachers and traditional education methods. However, their hope is that these games can be used by teachers to work alongside their lesson plans.

## "Citizen Science" To The Rescue

Kurt Squire grew up playing and learning from video games. As co-director of GLS, Squire tries to create games that make learning science a more active process.

"I was personally struck by the fact that we have these lakes right in downtown Madison that you can't really swim in," he said. That curiosity caused him to make "Citizen Science."

In the game, players look for the causes of pollution at Lake Mendota. They must travel through time, collect evidence and eventually clean up the lake. Students can learn how interconnected ecosystems are and witness the long-term effects of pollution. These are lessons that can be difficult to observe and measure during a single semester, which makes the video game a very helpful format for teaching.

Robert Bohanan truly believes that videos games are an effective tool for teaching science. He worked closely with GLS on "Citizen Science." Bohanan also works with high school students as an outreach program manager. "Citizen Science" allows him to imitate lake ecosystems and to reach more students than he can with typical teaching materials.

## Changing Viewpoints In Education

Several years ago, teachers were unsure about the role video games could play in education. Now, however, it seems that teachers are starting to embrace the idea. The question is no longer whether video games should be used, but, rather, how they should be used.

Mike Lawton is a science teacher at Milwaukee's Rufus King International School-High School Campus. He gave feedback to GLS on "Citizen Science" and uses the game in his lessons.

Part of the shift toward educational games is due to the increasing familiarity of gaming in society. The rise in smartphone and tablet use is making gaming more available to everyone.

## Gathering Proof For Support

This new field remains young. Experts are still gathering proof about how effective educational video games can be. There are several studies that hint at the potential for these games being able to help students actually learn scientific concepts and not just memorize facts.

Everyone in the field seems to agree: This new wave of scientific video games depends on effective teachers and lesson plans to bring out the best in them.

"I really see them as being a complementary piece to what's already going on in classrooms," Lawton said.
