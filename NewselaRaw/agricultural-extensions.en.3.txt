When people in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, have questions about farming they call Seth Wilner. For 15 years he has been a farming expert in the community.

"Used to be, someone in my county called up and said, 'I have a llama and two goats, can you come out and look at my pasture?'" Wilner said.

Wilner was a teacher at the University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension. Every state runs extension programs at universities to share agricultural knowledge with farmers.

The Cooperative Extension Service was created by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914. Back then, more than half the U.S. population lived outside cities and towns. Three out of 10 people farmed for a living. Today fewer than one in 50 Americans makes their living from farming. Only about one-fifth of Americans lives outside a town or city.

## Extension Service Shares Science And Advice

New Hampshire gave less money to the extension program in 2011. As a result, the University of New Hampshire had to reorganize it.

Today, Wilner works in an office in Sullivan County. He and other trainers still travel all around the state to meet farmers and give them advice. Yet, now he also relies on technology like Google Chat and Skype and offers online tutorials and webinars.

The extension service still operates across the country. However, it has made big changes in how it does business.

Extension still shares science aimed at helping farms and ranches make money. Now, it also works on a wide range of other issues, like teaching job skills, the environment and making people healthier.

## New Kinds Of Training Programs

For many states, agriculture is still the main work of extension. Oregon's brings together grape growers, winemakers and students interested in making wine. Virginia's trains farmers on food safety laws.

In many states, extension is expanding its mission. In southwestern Kansas, extension works with the large number of immigrant farmers.

Kansas extension planned to start 4-H clubs that use Spanish and English. They filled four clubs with 90 youths. Hundreds more are on a waiting list.

Last year, the Delaware and Maryland extensions developed a training program to help people buy health care. The program has spread to 30 states, said Michelle Rodgers, head of the University of Delaware Extension.

Future efforts will help the community to make healthier school lunches and restaurant menus, Rodgers said.

## Help With Paying The Bills

Extension is turning to charities and businesses to help pay the bills. The Spanish-language 4-H clubs were offered nearly free after a dairy owner donated $30,000 to pay for them.

Back in the day, extension was funded equally by national, state and county governments, said Sonny Ramaswamy, head of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. He says that has now changed.

U.S. government money for extension goes to states based partly on the number of farmers each state has.

Now, there is much less national money. Much more extension money must come from states, counties and cities, said Jimmy Henning, who is with extension's national governing board.

Extension needs to find other funds in the future, said Douglas Steele, head of the Texas A&amp;M program.

After the state of Texas cut money, Texas' extension had to do just that. The extension was able to hire a worker with money given to it by a health care company.

## "Programs Are More Focused"

As this becomes more common, some worry that those giving money to extensions may have different views on how it should be spent.

In New Hampshire, people were unsure about the changes to extension, but eventually they changed their minds.

Lisa Townson, who works with the New Hampshire Cooperative Extension, said she has not heard of any major problems. "People say programs are more focused and better quality."
