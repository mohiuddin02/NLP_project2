CHICAGO — In 2014, Mary Barra became the first female leader of a major automotive company. As chief executive officer (CEO) of General Motors, Barra is one of a growing number of women in leadership positions in the auto industry.

Women influence 80 percent of the car buying decisions in the United States. They also have more driver's licenses than men.

Yet, just about 25 percent of auto industry workers are women, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And fewer than 20 percent of engineers are women, according to Lindsay Brooke. She is the author of the report "Women in Vehicle Engineering."

## Engineering Role Models

The lack of women actually designing cars may be why more than half of the women around the world are unhappy with the vehicles on the market, says Brandy Schaffels. She is the chief editor of AskPatty.com, an automotive advice website geared to women. Women want better storage, nicer lighting and materials, and cars designed for their smaller body size, she said.

"This is the time when the demand for product developers and technical expertise is acute," Brooke says. "Female engineers in key positions including design, lighting, technology and product development add a lot to the mix."

There are three women car engineers who are making a difference in the car world. They are also serving as role models for the next generation of young women interested in automotive science and technology.

## "Automotive Field Is Huge"

The first is Dawn Piechocki, an engineering manager at Ford Motor Company.

Piechocki is in charge of engineering for Ford's full-size sport utility vehicles, Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. Her job includes overseeing the development of the chassis — the internal framework of the car — powertrain, body and electrical parts.

She travels between two offices — one in Dearborn, Michigan, the other in Mexico City. In Mexico, as the only woman in engineering management, she has 55 people reporting to her. "When I came here I was unsure about how I would be viewed," she said. "My concern was whether or not culturally I would be accepted as a female in a technical management position. The engineering team asked for me specifically and I've been accepted very well."

Piechocki also tests out vehicles in different environments around the world. She has tested cars in the deserts of Borrego, California, and Dubai in the Middle East. She has also driven from Mexico City at 7,500 feet to Acapulco at sea level.

Piechocki began her career at Ford 23 years ago in car chassis engineering.

She helps the engineering team in Mexico plan their careers and speaks to younger women who are interested in science and math. "And I have found a lot of women, especially younger women, are just intimidated by vehicles," she said. "But I explain that the automotive field is huge." Even if they are not working on a vehicle, there are many areas where they can make an impact.

## Engineers Are Decision-Makers

The second car engineer is Elizabeth Krear. As chief engineer of the Ram 1500 truck for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles she oversees all budgets, planning, engineering, development and quality of the truck.

"As an engineer, I can be a decision-maker," said Krear, who has a husband and two children.

Krear says when she was graduating from high school and was not quite sure what to study, her dad asked her what she wanted to be. A businesswoman, she told him. "He told me to go get an engineering degree. It was great advice," she says.

"Engineering training is basically problem solving," Krear said. "It has so many business elements as well." She tells girls "that if you are good at math and interested in how things work, then engineering is a great field."

## Respect For The Field

The third female engineer is Elizabeth Baron. She specializes in using virtual reality to design cars at Ford.

Baron invented a new technology that uses 3-D imaging. It lets a person feel like he or she is in a full-size, realistic version of the vehicle. It lets engineers analyze the engineering, design and manufacturing, all before the car is even built.

"The biggest challenge is representing the physical world — the workings of a vehicle — and have it make sense using 3-D technology," Baron said. Last fall, she was presented with Ford's highest technical award.

Baron helps advise women students at the University of Michigan for Women in Science and Engineering. She also exchanges ideas with a lot of outside sources, including NASA, the U.S. space agency, Disney and DreamWorks Animation. With Disney, she might share ideas that result in better cars for Ford and better theme parks for Disney. With NASA, they might discuss motion tracking and capture.

"I am the only woman on my team. And I am immersed in two male-dominated fields, both engineering and computer graphics programming," Baron said. But, she added, "Thankfully we respect each other, and that's what is important."
