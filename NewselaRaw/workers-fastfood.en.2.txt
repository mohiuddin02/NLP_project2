Workers at fast-food restaurants are accusing some employers of wage theft. They say the restaurants failed to pay them what they're legally owed for the hours they worked.

Lawsuits charging fast-food restaurants with wage theft abuses have been filed in three states. States have also gotten employers to pay big money to settle such cases.

The issue came to the forefront Thursday in front of three McDonald's and Burger King restaurants in Kansas City, Mo. Signs there proclaiming "wage theft" and "stolen wages" were seen at a daytime rally. The protest was organized by the StandUpKC coalition. It was attended by about 250 members of the fast-food workforce, labor unions, and religious leaders.

Spokesmen for McDonald's and Burger King say wage theft is against company policy. They say that complaints of wage abuses are investigated.

## Protests In Mid-March

Burger King said Thursday that the company "respects the rights of all workers." The company said most of its restaurants are owned by independent "franchisees." These franchisees do not work for the Burger King company. They own their own Burger King restaurants. They pay the Burger King company for the right to open their own Burger King restaurant, called a franchise. Burger King said it does not make scheduling, wage or other employment-related decisions for the franchisees.

McDonald's has responded to previous protests by saying that it takes all complaints seriously. It said that the company and the owners of its restaurants are committed to comprehensive investigations.

Wage theft protests occurred in numerous cities in mid-March. The protests come on the heels of a national push by President Barack Obama, members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Labor to raise the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage). The minimum wage is the lowest amount an employer is allowed to pay a worker. Supporters of raising the minimum wage point to tough times caused by the lack of jobs.

The activist groups say wage theft occurs if an employer:

— Alters time records to reduce paid work time. This is often done to avoid paying overtime hours. When employers ask employees to work longer hours than usual they often have to pay workers more per hour.

— Violates minimum wage law by charging workers for uniforms or other costs.  This is a violation if it cuts pay below the minimum wage.

— Incorrectly lists workers as not being allowed to get overtime.

— Demands off-clock work, where workers aren't paid at all for extra hours of work.

## Wage Theft Settlements

Hart Research Associates conducted a poll of more than 1,000 fast-food workers nationally. Nine in 10 said they had experienced some form of wage theft, such as being told to work off the clock. That means employees were working, but not logging hours to get paid.

Michael Saltsman is a spokesman for the Employment Policies Institute, a group that generally supports employers' interests in the restaurant industry. He said his organization doesn't take such polls very seriously.

"The idea of individual instances of wage theft are sure to exist, but the widespread idea is driven by those sympathetic to SEIU and their efforts to unionize," Saltsman said. SEIU is the Service Employees International Union, which represents workers in fighting for better pay and rights.

But labor supporters said the problems are widespread. Lawsuits against McDonald's and some of its franchisees have been filed in California, Michigan and New York. In general, they say workers were forced to clock out as if they were done for the day, but keep working. They also say that overtime wasn't paid, and that too much money was taken out of their wages to pay for company uniforms.

Separately, one McDonald's franchisee in New York paid a $500,000 wage theft settlement. The restaurant owner allegedly made workers pay for the costs of laundering their uniforms.

In another case, owners of 23 Domino's pizza outlets in New York agreed to pay $448,000 to workers who claimed they were paid less than minimum wage. A Domino's spokesman told a New York newspaper the case involved franchisees. Those franchisees are "independent business owners," the spokesman said. They are responsible for how they treat their workers.

## "Wage Theft Hurts Businesses"

Labor supporters say wage abuses are hard to stop because the U.S. Department of Labor lacks the money or staff to be tough investigators.

"There just aren't enough people to enforce the laws," said Catherine Ruckelshaus. She is a lawyer at the National Employment Law Project. "Low-wage workers have it hard finding an attorney willing to take a wage case. And our enforcement system is based on workers willing to come forward and tell their stories — and that's really hard."

That's why labor activists are pushing group rallies. These rallies get attention and provide some safety in numbers. Labor activists also say that bad companies harm ones that treat their workers well.

"Wage theft hurts businesses that are trying to compete with cheaters," she said.
