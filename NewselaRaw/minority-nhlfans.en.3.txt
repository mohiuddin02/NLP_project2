CHICAGO — Michelle Secor is big Chicago Blackhawks fan. She wears team clothing and watches every play when the team takes the ice.

"I have to cheer for our home teams," Secor said as she watched the Stanley Cup finals. "Bulls. Sox. Bears. Hawks. I was born into this."

Secor is of Mexican descent. She is one of a small but growing number of minorities who have become hooked on hockey.

"It makes us all feel good to see a Chicago team out there winning—race doesn't matter," she said.

## More Fans Of Different Backgrounds

Hockey for years has been watched and played primarily by whites, experts said. That is partly because it was developed in Canada. But the National Hockey League said that is slowly changing. There are more minorities on NHL rosters in recent years than in the decades before. The percentage of fans who are minorities is up a bit, too, the league said.

The Blackhawks have three black players, the most of any NHL team.

The NHL says it has 58 million U.S. fans. Of that, 9.4 percent are Latino, and about 8.3 percent are African-American.

"We are gaining more fans of different backgrounds," a spokeswoman said.

The NHL does not target specific groups, said Ken Martin. He is in charge of NHL fan development. But the league has tried to reach out to youth in cities.

The league is getting exposure in new Chicago neighborhoods by other means, too. "One way is by the Blackhawks winning," said Martin."The Blackhawks have been a leader in making our game accessible."

## Getting Hockey Programs In Cities

But the sport remains out of reach for many minorities. There are few opportunities to learn the rules and not a lot of places for minorities to play, said Richard Lapchick of the University of Central Florida. "The NHL now has programs in cities, but it's a slow building process."

Plus, there have not been a lot of big stars who are minorities, Lapchick said.

According to the NHL, there are 44 minority players in the league. Half of them are black and four are Hispanic.

"Once there are some African-American star players in the game that will help," Lapchick said. "The value of diversity for the NHL is that it would greatly expand their fan base."

The cost of the sport is another problem, experts said.

"It's not a sport you can go in your backyard and play," said Jimmy Terracino, of the Bobby Hull Ice Rink in Cicero. "You've got to have an ice rink. You need skates, you need sticks, helmets, gloves, elbow pads, shin guards. That limits many people from playing or learning it."

Still, there are efforts to develop interest in the sport among minorities. For example, there are youth hockey leagues based at Johnny's IceHouse in Chicago. Those reach out to local minority children so they can learn and play.

## Winning Generates Excitement

Cicero is a Chicago suburb where 78 percent of the town's population is of Mexican descent. It has a $3.5 million ice rink. The rink has become popular among the town's Latino children, Terracino said.

The Blackhawks' winning record "gets even more kids interested in hockey," Terracino said.

Vic Ortiz is Mexican-American and lives on Chicago's South Side. He says he is a big Chicago sports fan. But for years, he took little interest in the Blackhawks because the games were too expensive and most of the home games were not televised.

"We couldn't afford to go to the games. The Hawks games weren't on TV like the Bulls. How could you learn about them?" he said.

But now, Ortiz tunes in, even when the Blackhawks aren't in the playoffs, he said.

Gertrude Johnson, who is African-American and lives on the Near North Side, grew up watching the Bears and Bulls, she said. About five years ago, her mother persuaded her to start watching hockey.

At first, she liked the fights. Then she learned the rules of the game, admiring the speed of the players and the way they stick up for and protect each other.

"Anybody who is making a name for Chicago, we're riding with them," Johnson said.
