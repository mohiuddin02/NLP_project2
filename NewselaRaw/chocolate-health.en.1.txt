For years, chocolate lovers have been comforted by the fact that bittersweet dark chocolate seems to improve cardiovascular health. Somehow, the tasty treat is good for the heart and blood vessels.

Scientists, however, have always been unsure just why this is so — until now, that is.

On Tuesday, researchers announced that they had solved the chocolate mystery: Specific chocolate-loving microbes in the gut convert an otherwise indigestible portion of the candy into anti-inflammatory compounds — that is, into mixtures of substances that reduce pain and swelling.

Researchers set up a series of modified test tubes to mimic humans' gurgling guts. The gut — formally known as the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract — is essentially a long tube that starts at the mouth, feeds into the stomach, and ends at the anus.

## Using Their "Gut"

Within their test-tube "gut," researchers exposed cocoa powder to digestive juices and enzymes the body uses to break down food. They then exposed the powder to bacteria found in human feces.

What they found was that after cocoa was "digested," long molecules called polyphenolic polymers remained within the gut.

The polyphenolic polymers are too large to cross the walls of the gut, according to researcher John Finley. Thus they can't be absorbed into the rest of the body as nutrients. Nutrients provide food and nourishment to keep our body's motor running.

Polyphenolic polymers molecules "do nothing for us except travel down the GI tract after we consume them," Finley said.

That is until they encounter some of the many microbes that inhabit the human colon, particularly Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria, researchers said. The colon is the main part of the intestine, which in turn is part of the GI tract. The intestine runs from the bottom end of the stomach to the anus.

## Widening Blood Vessels

"These little guys say, 'Hey — there's something in there that I can use,' and they start to break it down," Finley said.

The smaller molecules that result from this fermentation — or breaking down — can travel through the gut wall and be used by the body.

"These materials are anti-inflammatory," Finley said. "They serve to prevent or delay the onset of some forms of cardiovascular disease that are associated with inflammation."

A number of short-term studies conducted in recent years have suggested that dark chocolate can cause blood vessels to widen. That in turn lowers blood pressure, as blood is able to flow more easily. High blood pressure, of course, can be dangerous: It leads to heart attacks and other serious health problems like strokes. White chocolate and milk chocolate do not provide any benefit in this regard, only dark chocolate, which contains higher levels of cocoa.

It has been unclear exactly why this blood-vessel widening happens. Researchers, however, have focused on flavanols, which are found in plants and are considered healthy. In particular they looked at two flavanols called catechin and epicatechin.

## A Cocoa Powder Pill?

Finley said these were among the compounds that were at first poorly digested. Like the polyphenolic polymers, they were eventually broken down by gut microbes. The other main part of the cocoa that was broken down was dietary fiber. This makes up about 30 percent of cocoa powder.

He said that the amount of cocoa powder that appeared to produce beneficial effects was about two tablespoons a day.

One of the issues involving dark chocolate, Finley said, was the amount of sugar and fat that chocolate candy contains. He said you could avoid those substances by putting cocoa powder on oatmeal, as he does.

Finley said it was possible that the beneficial compounds contained within cocoa powder might one day be processed into pill form. He noted that Mars Inc., the maker of M&amp;M candy, was funding research into that possibility.

But he said he wasn't very excited by this prospect.

"I would rather eat a big old chocolate cookie or a cup of cocoa than . . . take a pill," he said.
