For many kids, middle school is not easy.

Lunchtime can be especially hard. Some kids have no one to sit with. They feel like they have no friends.

A new program helps them feel included. It is called "No One Eats Alone Day." On one day, everyone has someone to eat with.

## Be A Friend, Not A Bully

More than 300,000 students are taking part in the program. Last year, it was in 35 schools. This year it grew to more than 700.

Bullying has become a big problem. The program wants to stop bullying. It gives students fun ways to include others during lunchtime. It makes sure no one eats alone, said Laura Talmus. She began Beyond Differences. The group is in charge of the program.

Talmus' daughter was named Lili Smith. She had a hard time in middle school. The bones of her face did not grow normally. She did not look like other kids.

## "Nobody To Eat With"

Lili would say, "Mom, I have nobody to eat with," Talmus said. "The girls don't want me to sit with them." Lili was never teased or bullied. Still, she felt very alone, her mother said. She would cry.

A group of teens came together to change things.

Rogers Middle School took part in the program. The school is in Missouri.

Reece Black is an eighth-grader at the school. He helped plan the program at his school. Kids do not have to be best friends, he said. But they should be more aware of other people's feelings.

## Being Friendly Is Pretty Cool

Jenna Walden and Avarry Wilkerson are in sixth grade. They noticed a boy was sitting alone. He was new in school. They moved over to sit with him.

"By the way, I'm Avarry," the girl said to him.

Other kids tried to be friendly also.

"So that was pretty cool," Reece said.
