LOS ANGELES â€” On Thursday, workers measured the amount of snow in the meadows of the Sierra Nevada mountains. They did not find much.

The snowpack was just one-quarter of what it usually is for this time of year. The snowpack is layers of snow built up over time. A dry January was partly to blame for the shrinking snowpack. Also, heavy storms in December dumped rain on the state, not snow.

And that is the problem, scientists say. The world is becoming warmer. Many scientists blame humans. When we burn gas, oil or coal it releases gasses. The gasses get trapped in the atmosphere and heat up the Earth.

In the future, it could mean that California may get too much rain and too little snow during the winter.

## Slow Snow, Fast Rain

Scientists think that by the year 2100, more than half of the snowpack could disappear.

Still, California is expected to get as much water as ever. The amount may even increase. The water will be from rain, not snow. The extra rain will force the state to change the way it manages its water.

Melted snow gives California much of the water it uses. At its peak, California snowpack is enough water to fill Shasta Lake more than three times. Shasta Lake is California's largest reservoir. A lake or pool that holds water is called a reservoir.

Normally, the snow melts slowly over several months. It trickles down mountains into rivers and lakes in the spring and early summer. The snow melts exactly when the need for drinking water and water for farming goes up.

Rain, on the other hand, comes down all at once. It "has to be dealt with immediately. You can't wait," said Kelly Redmond. He is with the Western Regional Climate Center in Nevada.

California has suffered three years of severe drought. Reservoirs have been low. During the December storms, the big reservoirs had plenty of room for all the rainwater. The water level of the Shasta Lake reservoir rose by nearly 60 feet.

## Seeking Solutions

In the future, there could be too much rain during winter for California's water system to handle, said Dan Cayan. He is a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

California may ask lawmakers in Washington to change the reservoir rules. Reservoirs are run by rules developed by the government. Congress has to allow any changes.

California may also use weather forecasts to plan. If heavy rains were headed for the Sierra, water could be released from reservoirs to make room for the rainwater.

None of this is simple. California cannot just release water from the reservoirs. If the rain does not come, it would mean less water for the state. Also, filling up reservoirs with winter rain may lead to flooding during spring storms.

One solution to the problem would be to build more water storage.

But what kind of storage? Scientists say California could build more reservoirs. Or the state could store more water underground. Or it could do both. In any case, it will cost a lot of money. Who will pay for it?

The loss of snowpack is "definitely going to be a problem," said Jay Lund. He is a professor at the University of California, Davis. But if it's managed well, Lund said it should not be a disaster.
