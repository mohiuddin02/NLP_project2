TRACY, Calif. — The world's newest technology industries will be meeting the world's oldest: farming. Businesspeople are putting their money and technology talents into farming. They have a bold agenda: to make sure there is enough food for the 10 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by 2100, do it without destroying the world and make a load of money along the way.

Silicon Valley is a region in California known for its technology. Investors and entrepreneurs there are pushing their way into every stage of the food-growing process. Entrepreneurs start new companies called "startups." There are tech millionaires buying up farmland, startups selling robots that work the fields, and hackathon competitions where people try to design the next farming app.

## Ag-Tech Is Booming

The food industry "is wasteful and inefficient," said Ali Partovi, a San Francisco Bay Area investor. Partovi has put a lot of money into agriculture startups. He says Silicon Valley has a boldness that says, "That's stupid. Let's change it."

The so-called "ag-tech" industry has seen booming activity. The industry's growth is measured in the number of new startups and venture capital investments. Venture capital companies have large amounts of money to invest in new startups. They get their money back if the startup becomes successful.

Experts predict that ag-tech's growth will be very quick. It may outpace today's hottest technologies in another five years or so.

It's going to be big "because everybody eats," said Paul Matteucci. He founded Feeding 10 Billion, a nonprofit center to help ag-tech entrepreneurs.

Dozens of companies are creating technology to make farmland more productive and farming more efficient. They have designed robots to trim lettuce or software to calculate grass production for cattle grazing. Others are tapping technology to find substitutes for meat, cheese and eggs. These fake animal products will mean less land is used to raise livestock, fewer trucks burning gas, and fewer animals subject to inhumane slaughter. Startups such as Hampton Creek sell mayonnaise and cookies that use plant products instead of eggs. Another company, Impossible Foods, makes hamburgers and cheese without meat or dairy products.

Silicon Valley isn't just making technology for farms. Some of its highest-profile investors are buying farmland. They want to affect how farmers work their fields and influence the type of food that's available for future generations. San Francisco-based Farmland LP buys farms and converts them into organic pastures that farmers and cattle and sheep ranchers can share. The company has attracted some of the Silicon Valley's wealthiest investors. But the draw is more than a happy vision of free-roaming cows — many investors see farmland as a safe investment. They hope it will balance out their other, risky investments in tech companies.

## "An Exciting Time To Be A Farmer"

Farmers, for the most part, have welcomed Silicon Valley techies into their world of planting seasons and water woes. California farmers are increasingly tech-minded. They are running their fields from iPads and tracking soil moisture and nitrogen levels with cloud software programs. Farmers are hungry for more tech solutions that will increase their land's productivity and the money in their bank accounts.

"There is a kind of renaissance in technology in agriculture right now," said Ryan Jacobsen, a farmer and executive director of the Fresno County Farm Bureau. "It's an exciting time to be a farmer right now."

In many ways, agriculture is an industry ripe for Silicon Valley investment. Farms were historically on the forefront of manufacturing invention, and farmers have long embraced new technology. But farmers and tech startups had lived in separate worlds. They came together through a number of recent factors.

During the slow economy of the past five years, investors noticed that agriculture was performing well compared to other industries. The prices of farmland increased while housing prices fell. Additionally, the possibility of food shortages became a worry. California has suffered through a three-year drought, the climate is changing, and the world's population is growing. These challenges attracted businesspeople who wanted to solve a meaningful problem rather than build another social media app. Meanwhile, technology got cheaper so more small- and medium-size farms could buy it.

It became clear that farmers and tech startups could help each other. For example, the company Blue River Technology has created a machine for farmers. It uses digital imaging and powerful software to trim lettuce 100 times faster than people, said Jorge Heraud, the CEO and co-founder of the company.

## The Pitfalls Of Technology

Because these machines have replaced human labor, some migrant workers will have to find new jobs. It's a pitfall — as more technology is introduced to farming, jobs will be cut. That could cause immigrants to avoid places like the Central Valley. The valley makes much of the nation's food on the backs of migrant workers and has already seen a labor shortage due to U.S. economic problems and the crackdown on undocumented workers.

"There will be jobs cost (but) society generally benefits when productivity is increased," Heraud said.
