WASHINGTON â€” Free lunches are coming to thousands of students all around the country this fall. The 4-year-old government program is finally expanding to all 50 states.

The [free lunch program](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch) is part of the Community Eligibility Provision. This was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010.

It was part of a larger set of school nutrition laws. It let districts with free or reduced-price lunches offer the meals to every student at the school. There is no cost to them. No paperwork has to be filled out, and it doesn't matter how much money their parents make.

Originally, districts had until the end of June to decide to join. The government moved the deadline into August. It wanted to give school districts more time to decide. There were delays in publishing the list of schools or districts able to join.

Nobody knows for sure how many new districts will join this year. But many education officials are making their decisions now. In most states, hundreds of schools are newly able to join.

## Doing The Math

In areas where the program has been put into place, people have liked it. People say it is a help to the low-income school lunch program. The program provided 21.5 million free or reduced-price meals in schools last year. That's more than 70 percent of all meals served through the National School Lunch Program.

"Everyone's got a great meal that they can get at no charge," said Madeleine Levin of the Food Research and Action Center. It just becomes normal and unites the schools, she said.

Under the new program, the government pays for only a fraction of the new schools getting the meals. The states are left pay the rest. As a result, not all school districts are expected to join.

Some schools have four out of 10 students who can get a free lunch. These schools can now use the new program. There are more than 28,000 schools like this nationwide.

Some schools have nearly all students already receiving free lunch. For them, there will be little change in money coming from the government. That's because the school is already being paid back for nearly all lunches served.

It's different if only 40 percent of students can join. Then, the school will have to make up the balance for a portion of the meals.

## High Schools Might Sit Out

In Fort Wayne, Indiana, all elementary and middle schools will get free lunches starting this fall. But high schools there will have to wait. Lunch program participation at the high school level is often lower. Officials there weren't sure including them would make sense for their budget.

The district had some schools where everyone was getting free meals. Some had 95 percent or more of their students in the free-lunch program. At that point, "it really becomes easier to give everyone the free meals," said a spokeswoman for the district.

High schools have always been more difficult when it comes to the free and reduced-price lunch program. High school students are more embarrassed about getting a free lunch, officials and experts say. In some cases, families' situations might improve as children grow. Parents are freer to work and don't have to pay the high cost of child care. That can lower the number of students who can join the program.

## Taking Their Time

In Chicago, officials have moved slowly: They started with 215 schools, expanded to 465, and will cover all 658 schools starting next school year.

Leslie Fowler is in charge of food for all of Chicago's schools. She said they had to be sure enough students would be able to join under existing rules. They reached their set level under older free lunch rules, 62.5 percent of all students in the district. "It doesn't make sense to do district-wide if you don't get to that threshold. At that point you're probably losing revenue," she said.

St. Paul, Minnesota, is another district that is moving slowly. Jean Ronnei is in charge of schools there. She said the district is doing a "test drive." They are starting the program at one high school, one middle school and a few elementary schools.

Starting with just a few schools helps them, she said. It gives them "a chance to see more about what the impact will be," she said.
