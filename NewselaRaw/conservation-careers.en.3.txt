SEATTLE, Wash. â€” Jesse Okwu grew up in Chicago. His closest link to the outdoors was nature programs on television. When he came to Washington state for a program on protecting nature, its national parks became his first real experience with the wilderness.

Okwu is black. He is one of 26 students from different backgrounds who took part in a special program at the University of Washington. The program is called Conservation Scholars. It hopes to increase the variety of students who work in conservation.

Conservationists protect nature. They work to save waterways, forests and wildlife. Conservationists work at the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service. They also work for private groups to protect whales or sea turtles, for example.

The concern is that most of the people in conservation are too much alike. Most of them are white and middle class.

## Loving Nature, Relating To People

Students who decide to work in conservation love nature. They also have a mind for science, said Sean Watts. He is in charge of the Conservation Scholars. However, it is important for conservationists to come from different backgrounds, he said. They need to think about a problem from different points of view.

They also need to understand how nonwhite communities are affected.

Nearly 400 people applied to the program. Watts said the students were carefully chosen from different races and cultures. They were white, black, Asian-American, Native American, and Spanish-speaking. Some had parents who never graduated from high school. Others came from families where both parents went to college and then to graduate school.

Most of students were planning to study the environmental sciences. The group also included students studying film, engineering, math and business.

Watts called the students wonderful, thoughtful folks.

## From The Mountains To The Coast

During the program, the students traveled through Washington state. They visited the slopes of Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens. They saw the Duwamish River and the Pacific Coast. They also talked with members of three Native American tribes about their understanding of nature.

Watts wants to interest students from all backgrounds in conservation early on. He hopes that more of them will choose conservation work as their career.

The students seemed to agree.

"Business has been one of the biggest polluters of the environment; I really want to change that," said Eric Katz. who is white. He studies business at the University of Michigan.

Steven Harris is studying earth sciences and anthropology at Syracuse University in New York. Anthropology is the study of humans and how they evolved. Harris knows there are not many black men like him who work in conservation. He is not discouraged by this. "It inspires me," he said.

Jordan Morgan is a white student from Bemidji State University in Minnesota. Morgan said it is important to listen to different viewpoints. People working in conservation, though, tend to be alike. "Most of the people working in it look like me," he said.

## More Than A Fun Program

Lisa Graumlich is with the university. She said the program has another benefit. It helps students to experience the exciting part of conservation work. Students usually spend their first two years of college taking difficult science classes.

Conservation Scholars is not just a fun program, Watts said. He said it makes students question what they know about the world.

For example, the students visited an organic apple farm. They met an older white farmer who employed immigrant workers to pick his fruit. The farmer didn't want to talk about his workers. At first, the students thought he had something to hide. They may have thought the farmer treated them badly.

Watts knew, though, that the farmer treats his farmworkers really well. He supports their education programs. He also gives them gas money. When they learned this, the students had to change everything they thought about him, Watts said.

By the end of the eight-week program, Okwu loved the outdoor field trips. Now, he is thinking about making conservation part of his job after college.
