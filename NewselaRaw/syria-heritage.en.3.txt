PHILADELPHIA — Since 2011, rebels in Syria have been fighting the Syrian government. The civil war has killed many people. Many more have left their homes because of the violence.

It's not only Syria's people that are in danger. Syria's history is also being destroyed, according to a new report.

There are six places in Syria that are so important to history and culture, the United Nations has named them World Heritage sites. Five of these sites have been damaged in the war. Parts of some of them have been destroyed completely.

Professors at the University of Pennsylvania used satellite photos to track damage to historic mosques, Roman buildings and ancient castles in Syria.

## Three Years Of War

The Syrian civil war began after the "Arab Spring" started in 2011. The Arab Spring began when people in Arab countries like Tunisia, Libya and Egypt protested in the streets. The protesters asked for more freedom and honest governments.

In Syria, President Bashar Assad violently stopped the protests, killing many people. By 2012, Syria was fighting a civil war. The war is still going on today. Many rebel groups are hoping to force Assad out.

Richard Leventhal runs the Cultural Heritage Center (CHC) at the University of Pennsylvania. His group is studying what happens to important historical objects during war. The CHC released the report on Syria along with other groups.

Leventhal explained the importance of heritage, or common history. Our heritage can tell us who we are and where we come from.

In a war, destroying important historical sites can also damage the identity of a group of people, he said.

## Protecting Museums And Books

Brian Daniels, who works with Leventhal, went to the Turkey-Syria border earlier this summer to train 20 Syrians who want to protect historic sites.

The Syrians were taught how to protect museums during emergencies and given supplies to protect important pottery and library books. Some items are now being kept safe in the homes of regular people.

Daniels said he was amazed at the bravery of the Syrians.

"They are aware their lives are at extreme risk," Daniels  said. "They feel that it is their responsibility, their duty, to try to save these things that are most precious about Syria's history."

The situation in Syria is like a home that's on fire, Daniels explained. Once you make sure that everyone is OK, you probably will try to save the family pictures, because there is no way to replace them.

"These people's jobs are to try to save the family photos for the country," he said.

## Militant Group Destroying Sites

The report does not assign blame for the damage. Both the rebel groups and the Assad government are responsible for a lot of destruction, Daniels said.

The extremist group Islamic State (ISIL) has been destroying sites constantly, said Daniels, like Christian cemeteries. It has taken over parts of Syria and Iraq. The U.S. considers the group a major threat to the Middle East.

The militant group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.

Experts are not sure how much damage was caused by Assad's government. Yet, the government is the only group fighting in the war that can use airplanes to drop bombs.

The United Nations has named more than 1,000 World Heritage sites around the world. These are places that have important cultural or natural value. There are 22 World Heritage sites in the United States. Most are national parks.

## Ancient Cities And Villages

The Heritage sites in Syria are ancient buildings or cities. They include the ancient cities of Damascus, Bosra and Aleppo, and ruins from the ancient city of Palmyra. Then there are the Ancient Villages of Northern Syria, which are also known as the Dead Cities. Two castles — the Crac des Chevaliers and Qal'at Salah El-Din — also made the list.

Damascus, the capital of Syria, has been the luckiest of the six. According to the report, the Ancient City of Damascus has avoided heavy damage.

Aleppo, an ancient city in northwestern Syria, has not been so lucky. During the war, Aleppo has seen heavy fighting. Many historic buildings have been damaged, including the Great Mosque, one of the city's most well-known sites.

The authors of the report hope it will help the U.S. government and local groups better protect historical sites in war zones.
