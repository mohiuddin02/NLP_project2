SEATTLE — Fifty years after the U.S. Surgeon General, the nation's top doctor, first warned of the ill effects of smoking, the habit remains a problem. A new study from the University of Washington (UW) shows that the number of smokers worldwide and the number of cigarettes smoked has never been higher.

Between 1980 and 2012, the number of adults who smoke rose from 721 million to nearly 1 billion, reports the study. It was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The number of cigarettes smoked globally jumped from about 5 trillion to 6.25 trillion.

The study is one of the largest ever to examining global tobacco use. It shows that there were remarkable drops in smoking rates in the United States and other wealthy countries. But they have been offset by a growing smoking population in the developing world.

"The University of Washington study demonstrated clearly how much further the world, particularly low- and middle-income countries, still has to go," said Matthew Myers. He is president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids based which is in Washington, D.C.

The rise in the number of smokers reflects population growth, particularly in nations such as China and Indonesia. It is also a result of the tobacco industry's heavy marketing in poorer nations, experts say.

## Rate Down But Numbers Up

Smoking numbers are usually reported in terms of rates, or the percentage of people who smoke. The global smoking rate dropped from 26 percent to 18.7 percent during the study period.

But the sheer number of smokers is most important when it comes to public health, said Ruth Malone. She studies global tobacco issues at the University of California, San Francisco.

"It's premature deaths ... and the total global burden of suffering — of preventable suffering — that we're talking about here," said Malone, who was not involved in the UW study.

After dropping rapidly for 10 years, global smoking rates have declined more slowly since the mid-2000s, said Marie Ng. She works at the UW's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and is the lead author of the study. Though the numbers are still uncertain, the study hints that the worldwide smoking rate for men may have started to climb in the past three years.

The surgeon general's 1964 report drew a clear link between smoking and lung cancer and other diseases. Since then, tobacco-control efforts in the U.S. have saved 8 million lives. The percentage of Americans who smoke has fallen by more than half, from 42 percent in 1964 to 18 percent in 2012.

And despite population growth, the number of smokers in the U.S. has also dropped. It fell from 52 million in 1980 to 38 million in 2012.

"Tobacco control has been described, accurately, as one of the great public-health successes of the 20th century," wrote Thomas Frieden. He is the Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He contributed an essay that was published with the study.

## Tobacco-Control Programs Work

But lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women. The World Health Organization (WHO) says tobacco-related illness kills 5 million people a year worldwide. That is more than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.

Ng and her team spent three years gathering and analyzing more than 1,000 data sets from 182 countries. An online tool allows anyone to sift the results by country, sex, age and other factors.

The tool shows that countries with effective tobacco-control programs have all seen dramatic declines in tobacco use.

Uruguay was the first nation to adopt a set of WHO-recommended policies, such as higher cigarette taxes and restrictions on advertising. It saw smoking rates fall 25 percent in just three years.

Mexico requires gory warning labels on cigarette packages. Since 1980, the smoking rate in Mexico has fallen faster than in the U.S. But countries such as Russia, Indonesia and China have slowed global progress, Myers said. There, up to 54 percent of men still smoke.

Russia recently adopted some of the world's toughest anti-smoking measures. They will kick in soon.

"This study is not a reason for a sense of hopelessness," Myers said. "It is, however, a clarion call that in those countries that have not yet implemented tobacco-control policies, the death toll from tobacco is going to be devastating."
