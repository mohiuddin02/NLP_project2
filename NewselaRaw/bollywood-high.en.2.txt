FOWLER, Calif. — Luckily, Shandeep Dhillon's cousin had recently gotten married.

That meant he alone could prepare much of Fowler High School for its first Bollywood night. His uncle's regal traditional coat went to the Central Valley school's principal, Hank Gutierrez. The outfit Shandeep,13, had worn in the past went to Gutierrez's son, Jordan. Shandheep himself wore a coat from another cousin.

The Punjabi girls at school all had traditional dresses they could lend to their classmates, whose families come from different backgrounds.

"We go to lots and lots of Indian weddings and you dress up and feel like a princess," said Manpreet Shaliwal, 16, who dressed in silky, "peacock" blue.

Even girls she had never talked to before had been coming to her over the last month. The girls were hoping to borrow one of her colorful dresses for the school's Bollywood night. Bollywood is the nickname of India's movie industry.

## Sikh Kids Face School Bullying

The cafeteria's ceiling was transformed by a parachute of tulle fabric, which had cost more than $200. But Harcoover Singh Bhatti, the president of the Punjabi Club, said the money would be worth it.

More students than he expected bought $10 tickets to the dance.

"This was three years in the making. Three years!" he shouted. "It's a first!"

Gutierrez, wearing sparkling slippers that curled up at the toes, watched all the preparations.

"This is my favorite moment of being principal," he said. "I grew up in this small town. The son of a single mother. I wanted this school to have what she gave me — a sense that we're family."

A study presented to the government last month by a group of Sikhs showed that in Central California, Sikh children are bullied more than kids in many other parts of the country. Sikhism is a religion of many people who come from the Punjab region in India.

More than half of students ages 12 to 18 reported harassment, according to the study. For young students who wear turbans the number was even higher — more than double the national average. Many Sikhs don't cut any hair, believing that everything about a person's body is important. Men and boys often wear their long hair wrapped in black cloths, or turbans.

The report was disturbing for many Sikhs because for more than 100 years, Sikhs have lived in the San Joaquin Valley. The Valley is now home to more than 30,000 Punjabi people. Their temples, called Gurdwaras, can be seen frequently amid grape fields and farm towns. The temples are always open to anyone.

## "Just Like Harry Potter"

"People saw us differently after 9/11," said Simran Kaur, a nursing student serving food at the Nanaksar Sikh temple in south Fresno, Calif. But Kaur said she has never experienced bullying or harassment. She has adapted to America, but she is proud of her husband's decision to keep traditional customs. For example, he still wears a turban.

Sometimes at the convenience store where he works, men call him "terrorist," but he just ignores it, she said.

Bhatti, who organized the Bollywood dance, was born in America. But at age 6, his parents sent him to a school in the Himalayas. He received one letter a month and a five-minute phone call every week.

"It was just like Harry Potter, but without the magic," he said.

When Bhatti came home to go to high school in Fowler, a town of 6,000 near Fresno, he had studied English grammar and passed a written test in English, but he really couldn't speak or understand it. Over the summer he taught himself English and later learned to swim. He joined the school team, which is something not many Punjabi students do.

The next year he also joined the drama club and has been accepted by many famous universities. He plans to go to school someday and study to become a physician.

At the end of his junior year, he was volunteering at a Fresno hospital when an 82-year-old Sikh man named Piara Singh was brought in. Singh had been beaten with a steel pipe outside one of the Sikh temples.

The older man told Bhatti he hadn't thought anything like that could happen in the Central Valley.

Later, when we was in his fourth year of high school, Bhatti promised to make the Bollywood party that they'd talked about for years happen at the school. In Fowler High, 51 of the 680 students are Punjabi.

## Some Sikh Students Doubted Dance

"They said it was going to be lame because they worried people would make fun of it," Bhatti said of some of his Sikh classmates who thought others would make fun of the dance.

"I kept quiet. But I knew it was going to be epic," he said.

The night of the event, after a Sikh dance group took the floor for a show, those boys and Bhatti's friends from the swim team all watched them together.

The dancers drummed their feet and swirled. Students took photos and clapped along. The boys at the back, beneath a "Go Redcats!" sign, threw their heads back and whooped. They thumped Bhatti on the shoulders.

Later, a DJ who also plays at many Indian weddings, dimmed the lights and played the songs of a popular Punjabi singer. The singer is famous for mixing several types of music.

Everybody rushed to the dance floor. Somehow the boys from the back got there first, Bhatti's black turban bopping up and down in the middle of them.

Chandler Collins, 17, waved hands covered with henna tattoos. Bhatti's best friend from the swim team, Caleb Savoia, pogoed into the group of girls dancing together in a circle. The only one dancing more lively was Harjinder (J.J.) Kalirai, a tall, quiet boy who wears a turban.

While they danced, Anika Arya, one of the teachers and also the Punjabi club's faculty adviser, sneaked off to a corner and cried.

She said she wasn't sure why. But the reason had something to do with seeing a shy Sikh boy, who usually walked with his head down, dancing with joy as his classmates cheered him on.
