Tesla Motors already claims to have the electric car that can go the longest between charges. Now it also says it has the safest car on the road.

The electric car company said that "the Model S set a new record" during  government safety testing. People inside the car were the least likely to be hurt during a crash.

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) didn't return calls to say whether Tesla was correct. But the Model S did win a five-star safety rating from the federal agency. Only vehicles that do the best on the crash tests get that rating.

The NHTSA is a government agency that sets and enforces vehicle safety standards.

## Tesla Trumpets High Safety Score

NHTSA does not release scores above 5-stars to the public, Tesla said. But car makers receive an overall score that can show a rating above five, Tesla said. "The Model S achieved a new combined record of 5.4 stars," Tesla said.

Cars fueled by gasoline typically have a big engine in front. The Model S does not. That creates a safer design, Tesla said.

The front of the Model S has "a much longer crumple" zone, Tesla said. The "crumple zone" is designed to be smashed and absorb some of the energy in a crash. A longer crumple zone helps prevent injuries to the people in the car, Tesla said.

Tesla also tucks its large, heavy battery pack below the floor of the car. That helped in another test. It kept the car from rolling over, Tesla said. During testing, "the Model S refused to turn over" with the normal testing methods, the company said. "Special means were needed" to cause a rollover, it added.

The Model S is getting good reviews from a variety of sources. Consumer Reports said it was one of the best cars the magazine has ever tested. A lot of people pay attention to what the magazine says.

## Model S Doesn't Come Cheap

Tesla is trying to become the first successful brand new U.S. automotive company in nearly a century. One of the people who started the company is technology businessman Elon Musk. He recently unveiled Hyperloop, a high-speed transit system connecting Los Angeles with San Francisco. He said it would send passengers from one city to the other in half an hour.

Hyperloop, which Musk called faster than a speeding bullet train, was designed by engineers from Tesla and SpaceX, a rocket company Musk [founded](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur). It exists only on paper right now.

Back to the roads, Tesla started selling the Model S about a year ago.

A Model S costs $63,570. But the price jumps to well above $100,000 if a customer buys a larger battery. The bigger batter lets you drive the car over 200 miles on one charge. Other electric cars make it less than half that far.

## More Money Than Expected

The automaker made money for the first time at the beginning of the year. The maker of high-end electric cars earned more money in the second three months of the year. That came as a surprise to investors and analysts on Wall Street who hadn't expected the company to do as well as it did.

Tesla gets special tax rewards every time it sells a Model S. The rewards help the company make money. It has sold about $150 million of these rewards to other automakers so far this year.

Tesla expects to sell about 20,000 Model S cars in 2013.

Tesla builds the Model S at a factory in California. It plans to also make an electric SUV there. It will be built on the same platform as the Model S and share much of its technology. Tesla aims to start building the SUV next year.
