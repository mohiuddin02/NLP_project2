WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Looking for work is stressful for many people.

For Vivian Nixon, who served time in prison, job hunting was particularly hard.

People seeking government jobs could soon avoid these frustrations. President Barack Obama is issuing an executive order. It will protect people from being asked about their criminal history at the beginning of interviews for jobs with the government. Congress is considering a possible law that would go even further.

## Intrusive And Inappropriate Questions

Nixon was released in 2001 from Albion Correctional Facility in New York. She was convicted on charges of falsifying documents and grand theft. When she got out of prison, she went on three job interviews a week for 14 months, she recalled. Finally she was hired by St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, New York.

"Some people just outright asked me about my felony conviction and never asked another question about my qualifications for the job," she said.

A felony is a serious crime.

"Of course, I never heard from them again. But I also experienced some really embarrassing moments, where I was asked inappropriate questions such as 'What was prison like? What did you do in prison? Were you in prison with dangerous people?'"

## Skills First, Crime Talk Later

Many federal agencies already do not ask questions about a job seeker's criminal history until later in the hiring process. Obama's order would have as much power as a law, so now all federal agencies would have to do the same.

A proposed law, which is called a bill, has been prepared by both Republican and Democratic members of Congress. The legislation would also apply to companies who do work for the federal government. When Congress votes "yes" on a bill, it becomes a law.

Obama said the federal government should not use criminal history to screen out applicants. Employers should look at their job qualifications, or skills. People should not be dismissed because they made a mistake in the past, the president added.

That is what happened to Nixon. Now she is a college graduate. She is also the director of College and Community Fellowship, a New York City organization that works with women with criminal pasts.

Nixon praises Obama for this "major milestone." She wants him to write a strong rule because there is no guarantee that Congress will approve a law.

## The Ban-The-Box Movement

The law would "ban the box," referring to a question on a job application. Job seekers are often required to check a box if they have a criminal record. The bill Congress is considering calls for employers with government jobs to wait until later in the hiring process to think about a person's criminal record.

It's not known when or how forcefully Congress will act. However, the congressional support for the ban-the-box idea is a good start for the Fair Chance Act, the name of the bill Congress is considering. The Fair Chance Act would prohibit, or ban, the federal government from asking applicants for criminal history information until after offering them a job. The bill was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives.

Similar legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate. Both the Senate and House would have to agree on the bill and vote "yes" for it to become law.

Special cases would be made for jobs in law enforcement and national security.

There is much activity now in Washington surrounding ban-the-box proposals.

At the same time, a movement is growing to help people lead productive lives after prison. It is part of what's called criminal justice reform. However, the federal government is lagging behind. Many state and local governments and some large companies, including Target, have already banned the box.

According to a report by the National Employment Law Project, support for a ban has grown rapidly in recent years. More than 100 cities and counties have banned the box. Nineteen states have as well.

## Race, Criminal Records And Discrimination

This is a big change in attitude. In 2010, Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, tried to pass a bill that would have prevented the Census Bureau, a federal agency that goes door-to-door collecting data, from hiring former felons. He said, "I don't want a convicted felon going to knock on grandma's door."

As many as 65 million Americans with criminal records could be affected by that kind of discrimination, said Glenn E. Martin. He is the president of JustLeadershipUSA. His organization works to cut the prison population.

People of color are more likely than white Americans to be arrested and serve jail time. Therefore, they are also more likely to be discriminated against for their criminal records, he said.

Obama made it clear that criminal records should be considered, just not at the beginning of the application process.

Folks deserve a chance to get through the door first, he added.
