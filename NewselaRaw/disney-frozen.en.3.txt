"Frozen" is the best-selling animated movie of all time.

More than a year after it came out, "Frozen" is still making Disney more money than ever, said Robert Iger. He is the head of Walt Disney Company.

Last year, people bought more than $1 billion in "Frozen" items. The faces of Elsa and Anna are on products from dolls to iPhone cases. The two princesses are the main characters. Even Sven the reindeer and Olaf the snowman appear on things like T-shirts and dental floss.

In November, Disney said it sold 3 million "Frozen" princess dresses.

## Toy Business Loves "Frozen"

The success of "Frozen" increased Disney's profits. The movie has also had a huge impact on the toy business. In 2014, toy companies earned $531 million more because of "Frozen," a business information company said. "Frozen" was the biggest and fastest-growing toy brand of the year.

Jason Moser is a business expert. He said Disney hit the jackpot with "Frozen."

"It can go on forever," Moser said. Disney is really good at making a movie like "Frozen," then creating toys and other products that make Disney a lot more money, he said.

"Frozen" was a huge hit at Toys R Us. At the beginning of 2014, the toy store only offered a few dozen "Frozen" products. By the holidays, it was selling more than 300 "Frozen" items, said Richard Barry of Toys R Us.

## Products Are Selling Like Crazy

Disney has also been good at keeping kids interested. Kids can go on "Frozen" rides at Disneyland in California and take a "Frozen" boat cruise. Disney is even coming out with a new "Frozen" movie in March, called "Frozen Fever."

The popularity of "Frozen" products caught everyone by surprise, said Mike Botterman. He is a vice president of the 99 Cents Only stores.

"Frozen" products sell really well, he said. Girl products based on characters tend to outsell boy products, he said. "With girls there are a lot more fashion items."

Disney starts thinking about products early on when they start making a movie. Disney wants to create characters that can be turned into popular toys.

Michael Giaimo is the art director for "Frozen." He said artists and writers talk with big stores and Disney's toymakers as they design the characters.

They tell the artists what girls like and do not like. Sometimes the talks change how the characters will look.

## Princesses Are Popular

In the end, Disney wants to make a good movie, not just best-selling toys, Giaimo said. For instance, artists mostly avoided the color pink in the movie.

"I wanted to stay away from a Barbie world," Giaimo said. Anna and Elsa are strong characters. He did not want them to look like every other princess in pink.

"Frozen" may become too popular, some experts said.

Disney has to keep coming up with with new characters to get shoppers to buy new products, said Gerrick Johnson. He is a business expert. The new characters is a reason that "Star Wars" toys are still so popular. However, people get tired of too many new movies and products, Johnson said.

"By 2016, we will be darn tired of 'Frozen,'" he said.

Disney thinks it can avoid that danger.

## Playing Dress-Up

Disney wants to make products that kids feel strongly about, said Josh Silverman. He works at Disney.

"When you begin to play with it or eat it or dress it up, we want to make sure that emotional connection" is there as well, Silverman said. Disney wants kids to have the same feelings they get from the movie.

This kind of planning is "one of the amazing things Walt Disney company does better than anybody else," he said.
