PYONGYANG, North Korea â€” North Korea is already isolated and not on friendly terms with its neighbors. Now, it has its own new time zone.

On Aug. 15 at midnight, celebrations were held as the nation's clocks were set back 30 minutes. The day was chosen to mark the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule.

Korea was under Japanese rule from 1910 until its liberation on Aug. 15, 1945, at the end of World War II. Just three years later, in 1948, Communist North Korea split off from South Korea. Since then, the two Koreas have been separate countries.

Before the North's changeover, both Koreas and Japan shared the same time zone. Their shared time zone was established under Japan's colonial rule. It is nine hours ahead of the standard Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/AP_462948318428.png" />

## Decision Surprises South Korea

North Korea's decision to change its time zone was announced just last week. It came as a surprise even to South Korea. Park Geun-hye, South Korea's president, criticized Pyongyang for making the change without consulting the South.

Nonetheless, the North's move will likely be viewed favorably by many South Koreans. Many older Koreans who remember the harsh rule of the Japanese are still deeply resentful toward Tokyo. They may see the North's change in time zone as a praiseworthy effort to erase a holdover of the colonial period.

"This is a great event in the history of the Korean nation," the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency declared. "It is of great significance in completely eradicating the leftovers of the Japanese imperialists in all fabrics of social life."

## "Pyongyang Time" Named For Capital

North Korea has named the new time zone "Pyongyang Time," after the nation's capital city.

The time zone has actually been used before. In 1908 it was adopted by the then-unified Korea. It was then changed to the Japanese time zone on Jan. 1, 1912, two years after the Korean peninsula was colonized. South Korea briefly revived the old time zone from 1954 to 1961, while North Korea stuck with the Japanese zone until now.

Pyongyang's decision to create a 30-minute difference in time is unusual but not unique. Countries such as India, Iran and Myanmar have half-hour differences from their neighbors, while Nepal has a 45-minute lag.

## Time Zone Didn't Match The Sun

North Korean astronomer Jong Sok said the change suits North Korea's natural conditions.

"With the time standard that we have used up until now, the time when the sun is at its highest position is not correctly noon," he said.

It is the lawful right of an independent state to make such a change, Jong added. Pyongyang Time, he said, is "the same as our ancestors used." It was "robbed from us by the Japanese."

Time zones were first proposed in the 19th century as global travel and communication became more important. They were standardized in the early 20th century around Greenwich Mean Time, named after Greenwich, England. Other time zones are either ahead of or behind Greenwich Mean Time.

## China Also Showed Control With Time Zone

In using clocks to make a political statement, North Korea may be following the lead of the Chinese Communist Party. China stretches 3,100 miles from east to west, and once had five time zones. After taking power in 1949, the Communists put the whole country under one single time zone, called Beijing Time. The change was in part a means of emphasizing their control over the huge country.

North Korea's time zone change may further isolate the country, which is already one of the most isolated places on earth. However, it gives North Koreans something to rally around as they commemorate the defeat of the Japanese.

The North has been quick to criticize South Korea for sticking with the Japanese time zone.

North Korea also has a different way of counting the years than the West does. Instead of 2015, this is Juche 104 on North Korean calendars, which begin from the birth of the country's founder and first president, Kim Il Sung. Dates before that are in the Western style.
