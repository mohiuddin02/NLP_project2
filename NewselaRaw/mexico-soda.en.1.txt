MEXICO CITY â€” Mexico's president is asking Congress to impose a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, saying sugary drinks are a public health problem.

Mexico has the highest obesity rate of the world's larger countries, according to a recent United Nations report. It found that 32.8 percent of Mexican citizens are overweight, compared to 31.8 percent of U.S. citizens. The U.S. is now ranked No. 2 in [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity).

Overweight people are at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and other diseases. Diabetes alone claims 70,000 lives a year in Mexico.

President Enrique Pena Nieto included the soda tax in an announcement of a sweeping tax overhaul. The aim is to collect more revenue and broaden programs that help the poor. Another goal is to create what the president's finance secretary called "a fairer, simpler and more transparent" tax code.

## A 10 Percent Tax On Soda

What happens if Congress passes the proposed tax? Mexicans would pay an extra peso (7.6 cents) for every liter of sugary drinks that they buy. They would also pay a tax on flavored drinks, concentrates, powders and syrups. Soft drinks sold at movie theaters would not be taxed.

Alejandro Calvillo, head of the consumer watchdog group Consumer Power A.C., praised the proposal. He said, however, the tax should be higher to have a greater impact on public health. As it stands, the tax only amounts to about 10 percent of the cost of a soda bottle.

"It's good that there would be a tax," Calvillo said. "We have to acknowledge that. But to have a significant impact on consumption of sugary drinks, assessments show that it should be a 20 percent tax."

People in Mexico drink the most Coca-Cola Co. beverages per person. The average Mexican consumed 728 8-ounce drinks a year in 2011. The average American by comparison drinks 403 similar-size beverages per year, the company says on its website.

Coca-Cola de Mexico did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

## Healthy State Or "Nanny State"?

Mexico is not alone. Many countries are calling for taxes or size limits on sugar-sweetened beverages.

France, Finland, Algeria and Hungary have all imposed taxes on sugary drinks. A California state proposal for a penny-per-ounce tax on sodas is under consideration.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made public health one of the hallmarks of his tenure. But he saw his effort to bar restaurants from selling soft drinks in cups larger than 16 ounces shot down in late July by a New York appellate court. Public health experts hailed Bloomberg's campaign against sugary drinks. Critics derided it as part of an over-reaching "nanny state."

One public health expert said studies show that a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in the United States would reduce consumption.

## A Soft Drink Link To Obesity

"A 10 percent increase in the price should result in a 10 to 12 percent decrease in consumption," said Roberta R. Friedman. He is director of public policy at the Yale University Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.

Friedman said soft drink consumption has been linked to obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dental disease and gout.

Calvillo said the Mexican government should provide details of how it would spend the 2 billion pesos (about $152 million) likely to be raised by the soda tax. He said some of the money should go toward putting drinking fountains back in schools and public places.

"High consumption of sugar drinks in the nation is highly linked to the lack of drinking water in public places," Calvillo said.
