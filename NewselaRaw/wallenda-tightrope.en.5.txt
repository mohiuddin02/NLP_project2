Nik Wallenda is a daredevil. Daredevils are people who like danger.

On Sunday, Nik Wallenda was in Chicago, Illinois. He walked on a tightrope between two tall buildings. A tightrope is a metal cable or rope that is stretched tight. Thousands of people came to watch him. Many more watched on TV.

"You guys watching think I am crazy. But this is what I am made for," Nik said.

## No Safety Net

Nik walked on a tightrope about 630 feet above the ground. If he slipped, he had only one hope: to grab the tightrope and hold on. In training, he practices slipping and then grabbing the rope.

His crew can reach him in 90 seconds anywhere on the cable. Nik said he can hang on for 20 minutes. Some people said he should have used a harness or net. These would catch him if he fell.

Nik walked across the Chicago River on a tightrope. It was a windy day. But he stayed calm.

"It is not bad, but (the cable) is definitely moving," he said.

He walked across in about 7 minutes.

During his walk, Nik talked to the crowd below.

"Listen to that roar," he said. "I love Chicago. And Chicago definitely loves me."

His tightrope went uphill. He set a world record for the steepest tightrope walk between two buildings.

## Blindfolded

Nik was going to take another walk. This time, his eyes were covered with a blindfold.

The tightrope was about 500 feet above the ground. He set another world record. This one was for the highest blindfolded tightrope walk.

The Discovery Channel showed Wallenda's walks live on TV. The producers had a plan in case he fell. They did not want to show an accident on TV. They delayed the broadcast by 10 seconds. This meant they could stop showing Nik if he fell.

## Watching Wallenda Live

Thousands of people filled the streets. The Ross family was there. Nikki and Rich Ross brought their 7-year-old. His name is Jake.

They had seen Nik cross the Grand Canyon on TV. But it was much more exciting in Chicago, Rich said.

"It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience to see this firsthand instead of on TV," Rich said. "It is incredible just to experience being down here."
