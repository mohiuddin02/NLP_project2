DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A growing number of men are quietly helping steer a campaign to end Saudi Arabia's rule that prevents women from driving. But, by doing so, they risk their jobs and maybe worse in the traditional kingdom.

Some of the men have been questioned by the government. One man was even held. That move scared activists working to put women behind the wheel.

On Saturday, more than 60 women said they drove. The police seemed to do little about it.

Men played a key part in the protest. They believe it is a right that their wives, sisters and female friends should be able to drive.

## Videos On YouTube

Since the campaign started in September, men have produced videos of women driving. They've put them on social networks, like YouTube.

They have helped protect the female drivers by surrounding their cars with two or three of their own. The action should keep people from harassing them.

And some have ridden as passengers with the women.

The common view "is that there's a problem in Arab culture and that we are against women and that the West is on the side of women. This is totally rejected," said Abdullah al-Bilassi. He's a 23-year-old student in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.

He is tired of hearing that Saudi men and Islam are against allowing women to drive. That led him to get involved in the campaign.

No laws prevent women from driving in Saudi Arabia. But, the government won't give them drivers' licenses. Many of the women who drove last weekend had licenses from other countries.

## Fathers And Uncles Disapprove

Not allowing women to drive comes from the kingdom's type of Islam. Saudis practice a traditional form of Islam known as Wahabbism. Religious leaders warn that women driving could make Saudi society fall apart.

Most of the men in the campaign are in their 20s and 30s. They say their fathers and uncles tell them that it is not yet time to allow women to drive.

Alaa Wardi of Riyadh says he is not involved in the fight. But, he has produced an online video called "No Woman, No Drive." It uses a Bob Marley song to make fun of comments by a famous sheik, or religious leader, who said driving can harm a woman's ovaries. It has had more than 8 million views so far.

Rights activist Ali al-Hattab said the king uses religion to keep women from driving.

"They don't want women driving because it opens the door to a flood of other demands," he said.

King Abdullah has gradually introduced changes in Saudi Arabia. Women are now allowed to sit on the national council and permitted to vote and run in some elections. But, women must still get permission from a male relative to travel, get married, or go to college.

In 1990 and 2011, women were arrested for driving, which led to a global outcry. Instead of arresting women, the government this time has increased pressure on their male supporters.

## Some Men Questioned, One Held

A handful of men have been questioned since Saturday, activists said. Other campaigners have had to sign pledges not to allow their female relatives to drive again.

On Sunday, school teacher Tariq al-Mubarak was held by investigators in Riyadh, said his lawyer, Abdel-Aziz al-Qassem. He has not been charged, however.

Al-Mubarak was targeted for being in the campaign, the lawyer said. A phone line used by activists was in al-Mubarak's name. He also had written articles for an Arabic newspaper supportive of women's rights to drive.

The lawyer said that he was able to see him.

"He is well and healthy," al-Qassem said.

The activists have been careful not to gather for fear of being accused of organizing a protest. Instead, they work independently in several cities. Separately, they upload the videos and help manage the campaign's website and Twitter and YouTube accounts.

## "Women Will Drive"

One female activist said some campaigners have "started to really panic" after al-Mubarak was held. She asked not to be identified for fear of being punished.

Two women said they were followed by undercover agents. Five others said they were contacted by the government and told not to drive.

A male campaigner said he is afraid he may be detained before his upcoming wedding. He said he closed his Twitter account after his worried fiancé asked him to.

But he is staying in the campaign because the women need the support of men.

"Because of the activism of men, sooner rather than later, women will drive," he said.
