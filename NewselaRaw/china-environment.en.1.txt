BEIJING — China has enormous environmental problems. Its population also has a deep distrust of government and is increasingly wired through mobile devices. Put that together and it's no surprise that large street protests are breaking out against waste incinerators, chemical plants and other industrial projects.

The latest protest was in the county of Boluo, in Guangdong province in southeastern China. Boluo saw thousands of people march through the streets Saturday, with some returning Sunday, to protest a planned garbage incinerator. Police detained 24 demonstrators, but overall the response was relatively restrained. Observers took it as a sign that Chinese authorities have resigned themselves to an occasional environmental challenge.

Judith Shapiro is a professor at American University in Washington, D.C., who specializes in China's environment. She said it remains to be seen if China's government will remain somewhat tolerant of anti-pollution protests.

"There is more political 'space' for protests around environmental issues than, for example, labor rights or the hot-button subjects of autonomy for Tibet or Xinjiang," Shapiro said in an email exchange. That said, China's Communist Party is "desperately afraid of unrest," she added. The party remembers Mao Zedong's famous quote that a "single spark can cause a prairie fire."

## Dangerously High Pollution Levels

Pollution is the dark side of China's economic juggernaut. Industrial contaminants have fouled about one-fifth of China's usable farmland. The World Health Organization says air pollution levels in Beijing are 40 times higher than deemed safe to breathe. Dangerous levels of heavy metals keep showing up in China's rice. Three-fourths of the nation's lakes and rivers are severely polluted, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

In China, there is no freedom of assembly, and many people feel helpless in confronting these larger problems. But an increasing number are taking to the streets to protest projects in their communities they feel are threatening.

In April, hundreds of residents in Maoming, another city in Guangdong province, clashed with police over a planned paraxylene factory. Paraxylene is a toxic chemical used in the production of polyester. Such production plants have become more controversial in China in recent years.

In May, a protest of a planned waste incinerator in Hangzhou, south of Shanghai, also turned into a fight. Ten demonstrators and 29 police officers were injured.

As with those previous protests, Saturday's in Boluo was organized with the help of mobile devices and social media. Two days before the protest, messages went out on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. They urged Boluo residents to gather at a city square at 9 a.m. Saturday.

The incinerator "will directly pollute the drinking water and air of the entire Boluo county," said one message. "For our families, reject cancer!"

The pitch was effective. Video from the protest — viewable outside of China on YouTube — suggests that thousands of people marched through Boluo, a county of 875,000 in south China's bustling Pearl River Delta.

## Millions Of Tons Of Garbage

Disposing of household garbage is becoming an increasing headache for local governments as China's consumer culture expands. China generates about 200 million metric tons of solid waste yearly. In 2004, it surpassed the United States as the world's largest producer of garbage. By 2030, it is expected to generate twice as much waste as the United States, according to a 2012 report by the World Bank.

Some experts say incinerators are the best way to dispose of this waste, especially in crowded parts of China where landfill space is sparse. Nie Yongfeng is a professor at the Tsinghua University School of Environment in Beijing. He said new incinerators in China operate at or above European Union standards for limiting dioxins and other pollutants. Opponents, he said, rely on old data from earlier incinerators to fan fears about such projects.

Others, however, say the government has been less than transparent and honest in monitoring emissions from big waste burners. "There has been little release of public data, so it is hard to know if the incinerators are being operated safely," said Lin Youzhu. She is the manager of the solid waste program for Friends of Nature, China's oldest environmental group.

## Not In My Backyard

By the end of 2013, according to Lin, 176 waste incinerators were operating in China. There were another 74 under construction. She said the government helps pay for incinerator construction, which is undermining China's once-impressive network of recycling and source separation of waste. The government "pays little attention to reducing waste at the source and puts all its attention into disposal," she said.

Shapiro, the American University professor, said it is encouraging to see Chinese people standing together against further degradation of their air, water and soil. She is the author of the 2012 book "China's Environmental Challenges."

But such protests tend to involve relatively well-off communities on China's eastern coast. That raises the prospect that authorities will simply relocate incinerators and other controversial projects to less wealthy areas in China's interior.

"Minority nationalities in China are particularly" at risk, Shapiro said. She directs American University's Global Environment Politics Program. Minorities' opposition to polluting enterprises, she said, can be tarred by the government and its supporters as separatism, "or even terrorism."
