WASHINGTON, D.C. — A major shift in immigration patterns over the next 50 years is coming, a new study says. Researchers say Asians will have surged past Hispanics to become the largest group of people moving to the United States.

The study looks in detail at what will happen by 2065. The year that will be a turning point is 2055.

The study was conducted by the Pew Research Center. It says an increase in Asian and Hispanic immigration also will lead to growth in the U.S. population. Foreign-born residents are expected to make up 18 percent of the country's projected 441 million people in 50 years. This will be a record. It will be higher than the nearly 15 percent during the late 19th century and early 20th century wave of immigration from Europe.

## Circle The Year 2055

Today, immigrants make up 14 percent of the population, a huge increase from 5 percent in 1965.

The turning point is expected to come in 2055. In that year, Asians will become the largest immigrant group at 36 percent, compared with Hispanics at 34 percent. White immigrants to America, 80 percent back in 1965, will hover somewhere between 18 and 20 percent. Black immigrants will be in the 8 percent to 9 percent range, the study said.

Currently, 47 percent of immigrants living in the United States are Hispanic. Yet by 2065 that number will have dropped to 31 percent. Asians currently make up 26 percent of the immigrant population. In 50 years that percentage is expected to increase to 38 percent.

## Researchers Looked To Mexico First

To come up with their predictions, Pew researchers did their own poll of Americans. They also looked at information from the Census Bureau, the government agency that surveys Americans about their lives.

Part of the reason for the shift is that the fertility rate of women in Latin America — and especially Mexico — has decreased. Mark Hugo Lopez is Pew's director of Hispanic research. He said in Mexico, women are now having an average of two children. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, they were having about seven children per woman.

"There are relatively fewer people who would choose to migrate from Mexico so demographic changes in Mexico have led to a somewhat smaller pool of potential migrants," he said. "At the same time we've seen a growing number of immigrants particularly from China or India who are coming for reasons such as pursuing a college degree or coming here to work temporarily in the high-tech sector."

## No Real Majority

Despite the increase in Asian immigrants, Hispanics will still make up a larger number inside the United States, Lopez said.

"Hispanic population growth is coming from people born here in the United States," he said. "It is really U.S. births that are now the driver of Hispanic population growth."

By 2065, no one race or ethnic group will hold a majority in the United States. Whites will make up 46 percent of the population, Hispanics 24 percent, Asians 14 percent and blacks 13 percent. Currently, the country is 62 percent white, 18 percent Hispanic, 12 percent black and 6 percent Asian.

Pew also asked Americans surveyed for one word to describe immigrants in the United States today. Twelve percent said "illegal," 5 percent said "overpopulation," and 4 percent said "legality."

"Jobs," "deportation," "Americans" and "work ethic" got 3 percent each.

Forty-nine percent offered general descriptions. Of those,12 percent were positive, 11 percent negative and 26 percent neutral, according to the report.

## What Kind Of Effect?

Americans also said immigrants are likely to make the United States better, with 45 percent agreeing with that statement. Thirty-seven percent said they make the country worse. Eighteen said they do not have much of an effect one way or the other.

The survey was conducted online from March 10 to April 6, 2015. Results from the survey could be off by plus or minus 2.4 percentage points. Survey scientists call this a margin of error. If a particular number from the study was 50 percent, for instance, it could be as high as 52.4 percent or as low as 47.6 percent.
