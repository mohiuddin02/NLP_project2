The newsmagazine said the Roman Catholic Church's new leader has changed how people see the 2,000-year-old institution in an amazing way in a short time.

The pope beat out Edward Snowden for the honor. Snowden leaked secret documents he got from working for the U.S. National Security Agency. The newsmagazine has been naming a Person of the Year each year since 1927.

The former Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected in March as the first pope from Latin America. He was also the first Jesuit to be elected pope. The Jesuits are group of Catholic priests. They often work in education and in social justice causes. Bergoglio took the name Francis when he became pope in honor of Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of the poor.

Since taking over at the Vatican, he has urged the Catholic Church not to be obsessed with "small-minded rules." He has said the church should emphasize compassion over condemnation in dealing with touchy topics including gay marriage and human reproduction.

Pope Francis has denounced the world's worship of money. He also says it is a "global scandal" that nearly 1 billion people today go hungry. Pope Francis also has charmed the masses with his simple style and wry sense of humor. Tens of thousands of people come out to see him. He also has more than 10 million followers on his @Pontifex Twitter account.

The [pope](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) "has changed the tone and the perception and the focus of one of the world's largest institutions in an extraordinary way," said Nancy Gibbs, the magazine's managing editor. That made him stand out, she said.

The Vatican said the honor wasn't surprising because of the impact that Francis has had with the general public. The Vatican is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. It also said the choice was a "positive" recognition of spiritual values in the international media.

"The Holy Father is not looking to become famous or to receive honors," said the Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi. "But if the choice of Person of Year helps spread the message of the Gospel — a message of God's love for everyone — he will certainly be happy about that."

## "This Sense Of The Church"

It was the third time a Catholic pope had been Time's selection. John Paul II was selected in 1994 and John XXIII was chosen in 1962.

In Argentina on Wednesday, Padre Toto praised Time's selection. Toto is one of the many priests who served in poor slums the pope supported for years when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires.

"He had the genius of knowing how to express this sense of the church and hopefully his way of being will catch on with other political leaders, business executives, sports figures. His leadership is inspiring," Toto said of the pope.

President Barack Obama was Time's selection for 2012.
