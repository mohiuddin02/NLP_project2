SYDNEY, Australia — For the past 17 months, the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has baffled people around the world. The plane seemed to simply vanish without a trace. Its disappearance led to all sorts of wild theories about what might have happened.

Now, at last, a piece of the mystery plane has been found. On Thursday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that a recently discovered wing flap definitely belongs to the missing plane. The piece was spotted on Reunion Island, which is a French island in the Indian Ocean.

Flight 370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, on its way from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China. There were 239 people on board.

We now know the plane ended up in the ocean — but we still do not know why. What does the discovery of the wing flap change, if anything?

## One Piece Of The Puzzle ...

Ric Gillespie is a former U.S. aviation accident investigator. He believes the discovery of the wing flap does provide valuable information. It is now clear that the plane "did go down in the ocean," he said. Most likely what happened was an accident, he added.

Before the discovery of the wing flap, most experts agreed that the Boeing 777 crashed in a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean. With no physical evidence, however, no one could say so with certainty. There was always the chance that the experts had gotten it wrong. Could the plane have flown north to Asia, rather than south into the ocean? Could those on board even be stuck on some far-flung island, like the characters on the TV show "Lost?"

Australia is leading the search for the plane in a vast, empty stretch of ocean 2,600 miles to the east of Reunion Island. The country's prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the discovery provides at least one piece of the puzzle.

"What we have found in the western Indian Ocean does seem to indicate that the plane did come down more or less where we thought it did," Abbott said. "For the first time, we might be a little bit closer to solving this baffling mystery."

## ... But Many Theories On What Happened

Investigators examining the wing flap are trying to find clues about the plane's fate based on the flap's condition. Regardless of what they decide, there will still be many unanswered questions: How, exactly, did the plane end up in the water? Was it a controlled landing? Was there an explosion? If it was not an accident, who was behind it, and why?

Officials believe the jetliner took a straight path across the ocean after it went off-course. They suspect it flew on autopilot for hours before running out of fuel and crashing into the water.

There are plenty of other theories around, however. News of the wing flap's discovery did little to put an end to them.

After Prime Minister Razak's announcement, online commenters immediately began debating new theories. Perhaps, some said, the flap was planted on Reunion by terrorists responsible for the disappearance of Flight 370.

Such theorizing is unlikely to stop, Gillespie said, unless officials find the plane's so-called "black boxes." These flight recorders would give investigators definite answers about the plane's path. They might also provide evidence of mechanical failures or of any tampering that might have occurred.

## For Families, Uncertainty Remains

The discovery of the wing flap is important, but it does little to help the families of those on board Flight 370. They are still not much closer to knowing what happened to their loved ones.

For some families, only the news that a loved one's body has been found will bring closure.

Overall, though, officials are relieved that some physical clue has at last been found.

"At least it is a piece of evidence," Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said. "I remember early on, somebody said it is not as if we are looking for a needle in a haystack — we are still trying to locate the haystack. This gives us some indication that we are in the right place."
