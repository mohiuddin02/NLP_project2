His family was not ready to give up, though. They decided to wait at least four months before admitting he could not have survived.

As the weeks passed, they kept hoping he would turn up. They were beginning to lose hope.

On Good Friday, their prayers were finally answered: Jordan walked out of a hospital and into his parents' arms. He was weather-worn and 50 pounds thinner, but smiling.

"A lot of us didn't believe we'd see this day," said Glen Davis, Jordan's stepfather.

## Left South Carolina In January

Jordan was spotted Thursday afternoon and rescued from his crippled boat. He was found about 200 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

Jordan left on a fishing trip from South Carolina in January. A couple of days later, his boat capsized when he was caught in some rough weather. The capsizing left him with a broken shoulder.

"I was flying through the air, somersaulting, and everything was upside down and backwards," he said on Friday.

His boat's mast was broken and its steering system was damaged. The boat capsized at least two more times after that.

Jordan survived on just a bit of food. He fried flour pancakes on a small stove and caught fish with a hand net. He collected rainwater whenever he could.

"For such a long time I was so thirsty," Jordan said early Friday. "And I was almost out of water, and every day I was like, 'Please God, send me some rain, send me some water.' And finally, right before I ran out of water, finally the conditions were perfect.'"

## Reading His Bible

He read the Bible all the way through repeatedly, Jordan told rescuers. A blanket protected him from cold winds and the burning sun.

Meanwhile, Jordan's parents grew more and more worried as the weeks went by with no word from him.

They grew even more concerned when his mother's birthday passed without a call from Jordan.

Family members began handing out fliers with Jordan's photo. Perhaps somebody had spotted him somewhere, they hoped.

"As time went on, it got more and more hard to think he was out there and he'd survived, especially some of those cold nights," said Davis.

On Thursday, the family got the great news they had been hoping for. Jordan's father text-messaged them that Jordan had been found alive.

Jordan was rescued by a giant cargo ship. "They saw me on the front of my boat, standing up there waving my arms," he said Friday.

## "I Thought I Lost You"

"I got down onto the deck, and he walked right up to me," said Kyle McCollum, of the U.S. Coast Guard, who lifted Jordan off the ship. "He had this nice smile on his face and I could tell he was in good spirits."

In the helicopter, Jordan pulled out two of the things that he said had kept him going: his battered and jacket-less Bible and the blanket that had shielded him from the sun.

"I haven't heard you in so long," Jordan told his father. "I was afraid that you guys were crying and sad that, you know, I was dead, and I wasn't dead," he said.

"We were," Jordan's father replied. "I thought I lost you."

By Friday, Jordan was back at home in North Carolina. He was looking forward to a good meal and to seeing family again.

"The last couple weeks really weighed heavy on us," Davis said. "Now we're going to have a great Easter."
