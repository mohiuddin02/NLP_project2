KALAPANA, Hawaii â€” Twenty-five years ago, lava from the volcano Kilauea destroyed buildings in the small Hawaiian town of Kalapana. The house where Aku Hauanio grew up was burned. Now, the volcano's lava is at work again. It is headed toward more homes.

Lava is fiery hot, liquid rock. It comes from a volcano.

One type of lava called pahoehoe can be found in Kalapana.

Hauanio said this beach town on the island of Hawaii was once "just one of the beautifulest places on the island. So beautiful it's hard to explain."

Then the volcano erupted.

## Lava Sneaks Around The Back

In 1991, Hauanio watched the lava burn the house where he was born and raised. His father still owned the home. The lava flow entered the house through the back and set the small building on fire.

The lava moved slowly though 180 homes in Kalapana.

Today, lava is heading toward Pahoa. The small town is 12 miles from Kalapana. The lava destroyed its first home in Pahoa on Nov. 10.

The lava moves for a few days, then stops for weeks before starting again.

## Safe, But Not For Long

Hauanio is 62 years old. When his father's house was burned by the lava in 1991, Hauanio remembers being amazed and shocked.

His own house was safe at first, but Hauanio knew that it would be next to burn. His children begged him to move the house to safe ground. People had already moved a church months earlier.

Hauanio hired workers with a trailer. They picked up his house. Then they rolled his house 2 miles up the road.

The lava came the next day.

The lava, he said, "flows like water, but it's not. Everything's burning. There's a lot of crackling."

## Which Lava Is It?

Kalapana was once home to a famous black sand beach and a historic Hawaiian village. It is now a perfect example of pahoehoe.

There are two main kinds of lava: pahoehoe and aa. Janet Babb studies the rocks, liquid and other things that make up the Earth. She said aa lava is sharp and broken.

The pahoehoe that covers the beach here could be shown in a museum. There are many types of lava, Babb said.

Today, Kapalana is lovely in its own way, Hauanio said.

He thinks about the lava flowing near Pahoa. If you live in Pahoa, he said, you always have to be ready to move.

"The whole island is made out of lava, yeah?" he said. "You cannot do anything. You cannot cry. When the lava comes, you just gotta take what's important to you and just move out of the way."
