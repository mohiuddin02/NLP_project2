MINEO, Sicily â€” Silla Zelia is a 23-year-old migrant. In 2013, she left her home in the African nation of Ivory Coast. She crossed the Mediterranean Sea to make a new life for herself in Europe. It was a dangerous trip on a boat packed full of other migrants, but she made it to Italy in the end.

Now Zelia is stuck in Italy's largest migrant center. The housing area is overflowing with about 3,200 migrants from 30 countries.

Zelia has asked Italy to protect her from being sent back home. She wants to be declared a refugee so she can stay. She has been turned down twice. "One can get stuck here for two years, three years," she said.

## Want To Escape Poverty

Zelia cannot get in touch with her family in Ivory Coast, but she doesn't want to go home, anyway.

"Where I come from, life is not easy," she said. "My neighborhood has big problems, my house is all in a shambles."

After making the dangerous crossing to Italy, migrants like Zelia face another big challenge. They have to convince European countries that they deserve protection as refugees.

Most countries only protect people who have escaped from their home countries because of a war. Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are running away for a different kind of reason. Many are coming to Europe to get out of poverty.

Migrants who are not accepted as refugees often stay in Italy. They wind up working in the fields, picking tomatoes and oranges.

Many migrants, who are waiting to hear whether Italy will let them stay, work on those same farms. It helps them pass the time while they wait.

## "Not To Do Anything ... Is Stressful"

Collins is a 28-year-old migrant from Nigeria. He gave only his first name. He works on a nearby farm while he waits to hear whether Italy will make him a refugee. He earns only 10 euros ($11) for a hard day's work, but he says it helps him stay happy.

"Being in one place, not to do anything, you understand, is stressful," he said. "You think, think, think."

The Mineo center resembles an American neighborhood with neat lawns and clean streets. It was originally built to house members of the U.S. Navy and their families.

Men are everywhere, riding bicycles and playing soccer on a large dusty field.

The women are harder to find. Zelia said they stay inside, going crazy because there is nothing to do.

Migrants are allowed to leave the center, but have to be back in two days. Without any money, there isn't much to do in the city anyway. Italy gives them free food and housing and phone cards to call home.

## Many Migrants Come To Italy

Italy is one of 28 partner countries in the European Union, which is also called the EU. Other countries in the EU are frustrated with Italy. They want Italy to do a better job keeping track of the migrants who land there.

They say Italy must make sure migrants don't slip through to northern Europe.

That challenge has become bigger than ever. Last year, 65,000 migrants asked Italy for refuge. That's twice as many migrants as usual.

Most of Italy's migrants come from Mali, Nigeria and Gambia. Many Syrians and Eritreans also enter the EU through Italy, but they don't usually want to stay there. They want to get to Germany or Sweden where better jobs can be found.

Migrants are supposed to ask for refuge in the first EU country they enter. Many migrants refuse to cooperate with the Italian government. They keep traveling farther north to ask other countries for protection instead.

Now other EU nations are insisting that Italy takes every migrant's fingerprints. They know it is difficult for Italy to keep up with so many migrants, but they say all of the countries in the EU have to work together.
