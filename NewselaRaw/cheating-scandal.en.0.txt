Twenty-six Atlanta public school educators and administrators pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges related to a massive cheating scandal. They stand accused of changing answers on standardized tests and of lying to cover up their wrongdoing.

Many had received bonus pay that appeared to be based on false test scores. They now face fines and jail time if they are found guilty.

Atlanta is not the only U.S. city where widespread cheating occurred, but the case there is the worst, affecting thousands of elementary and middle school students.

Among those indicted is Beverly Hall, the former superintendent of the Atlanta school system. She is accused of fostering an environment where test scores were more important than students' education. Under her watch, dozens of principals and teachers allegedly met behind closed doors, erasing wrong answers and substituting correct ones.

In addition to the 26 who pleaded not guilty on Friday, there are nine others who were indicted in the scandal by a grand jury in March. Judge Jerry Baxter set a trial date for all 35 of them in May 2014 and remarked that there were so many people involved, the court might need to rent an empty grocery store to have enough room for all the defendants.

Atlanta's public schools were once heralded for remarkable improvements in student achievement. They won five National Blue Ribbon Schools Awards, the federal government's highest honor, and Hall won national recognition as Superintendent of the Year in 2009.

But now Hall is free on $200,000 bail and Atlanta is associated with the largest school cheating scandal in U.S. history.

## Climate Of Cheating

Two years ago, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper reported unusual changes in test scores, with scores improving by leaps and bounds. This led to a massive investigation, published in the "Cheating our Children" investigative series. Investigators discovered widespread cheating by 200 educators in 80 percent of Atlanta's schools. In some instances, the cheating stretched over a decade.

The newspaper also investigated 605 schools across the nation that had won the Blue Ribbon Awards from 2009 to 2011. Dramatic changes in test scores were discovered for entire grades. Testing experts said those changes could not be attributed to improved teaching and were statistically impossible.

## High-Stakes Testing

The background for potential  cheating was set in the late 1980s, when states began offering teachers and principals financial incentives to improve test scores.

Then in 2001, the federal No Child Left Behind law was enacted, requiring that every third- through eighth-grader be tested annually in reading and math. Uniform national goals were set, increasing every year with all students in those grades required to be proficient in math and reading by 2014. If schools did not meet those goals, there would be serious repercussions, including being labeled a "failing" school and being taken over by the district.

To avoid negative consequences, schools everywhere began "teaching to the test" and started rating teachers based upon test scores. It was believed that good teaching was the key to a student's success, that teachers were at fault if students failed, and that those same teachers had to be held accountable. With the 2014 No Child deadline approaching, school systems were under increasing pressure to meet the goals.

In 44 Atlanta public schools, dozens of principals were found to be involved in the alleged cheating. Some schools had a culture of intimidation and retaliation. Teachers felt forced to participate in the cheating scheme or else lose their jobs, which may explain how cheating became so widespread.

Teachers not only erased incorrect answers, they also discouraged students who were not likely to test well from coming to school on the day of the test. If those students were absent, they were not required to take the test.

Justina Collins, the mother of a former Atlanta public school student, choked up at a press conference as she described how the cheating hurt her daughter. The third-grader was failing school, but got high test scores, so she was not eligible for tutoring. Today she is in ninth grade, but reading at a fifth-grade level.

"As a parent that wants the best for their child, I'm very disappointed," Collins said.

## Testing At The Expense Of All Else

Standardized testing has its critics, who argue that the trend of placing too much reliance on test scores has had ramifications aside from pushing teachers to cheat. They say it discourages experiential learning, where students gain knowledge through observation and experimentation.

Critics also charge that testing does not allow alternative methods of assessment of students who learn differently. They point out that the over-emphasis on meeting math and reading goals has led to the reduction or elimination of subjects such as music, art and drama. Many schools no longer have time for recess and have cut back on fitness and sports.

Some learning experts question whether standardized tests actually assess competency and knowledge. Do they predict success in higher education or the workplace? Can they measure the ability to innovate, to be flexible or to overcome unanticipated obstacles?

Experts say the pendulum has swung too far, with too much responsibility resting on teachers and schools. Poor achievement may be caused by lack of effort or aptitude on the student's part. And there are other variables that may affect a child's progress, such as hunger and homelessness or family dysfunction. A lack of English language proficiency at home also may be a contributing factor.

Georgia's new system under "Race to the Top" includes other measures of student progress besides testing. Teacher evaluations include observation of classes and input from students. And when standardized tests are given, the state monitors the testing process, looking for red flags such as erasures.

U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said that honesty and integrity are vitally important in an educational system and that the students of Atlanta were done a huge disservice.

For her part, Hall, the former superintendent, faces up to 45 years in prison if she is convicted.
