MINNEAPOLIS â€” Tremell Caldwell was waiting for his music teacher. Tremell is 7. He wiggled while he waited. A cello sat between his knees. The cello is a musical instrument. It looks like a big violin.

"Bows ready!" said the music teacher. The bow helps the instruments make sound. Tremell raised his bow.

Tremell likes his cello. He said "it's big and has the longest strings."

Tremell is in El Sistema Minnesota. El Sistema is an after-school program. There are 18 children in the program. Some are in first grade. Some are in second grade.

El Sistema teaches kids music. They learn how to play instruments like the violin and cello.

## In Poor Neighborhoods

The kids in El Sistema live in poor neighborhoods. When you are poor you don't have a lot of money. Music lessons and instruments cost money. El Sistema teaches music for free.

But El Sistema teaches more than just music. It teaches kids how to get along. It teaches them to work hard. It teaches them how to study, too.

Children in El Sistema are kinder. They are full of new ideas. They also read faster.

## Feel Like Somebody

El Sistema began in Venezuela. It is a country in South America. Jose Antonio Abreu started the program. He is a musician.

He says being poor is "the feeling of being nobody." Learning music can make kids feel like somebody.

His idea spread around the world. El Sistema programs are in many countries. There are around 50 programs in the United States.

## Proud Of His Hard Work

Tremell asked, "Can I go outside now?" The lesson was over. His teacher said yes.

Before Tremell left, she asked him to read a note. It's from someone who really likes El Sistema.

"I am proud of you," the note said. "Your talent amazes me." Tremell gave a big smile. Then he ran for the door.
