The study means that sea levels could rise another 4 feet within 200 years. But if humans slow down global warming, they could delay the complete disappearance of the glaciers.

Researchers had previously estimated that the cluster in the Amundsen Sea region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would last for thousands of years despite global climate change. But new studies found that the glacier collapse is underway and it's occurring far more rapidly than scientists expected.

## When Environmental Events Collide

The warming water is tied to several environmental events. This includes [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) caused by burning fossil fuels — like coal, oil and gas — and lower ozone levels that have changed wind patterns. Ozone is a gas in the atmosphere that blocks some of the sun's heat.

"There is no red button to stop this," said Eric Rignot. He is a University of California, Irvine (UCI) professor of Earth system science and the lead author of one of the studies. It was conducted with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and will be published in a journal of the American Geophysical Union.

The six glaciers have passed "the point of no return," Rignot said. That means total collapse — the melting of the glaciers — cannot be prevented. "The only question is how fast it's going to go."

## What's Under The Ice Mass

Antarctica, which surrounds the South Pole, is the largest mass of ice on the planet. It contains an estimated 80 percent of the world's fresh water. The scale of Antarctica is difficult to imagine. If you loaded all of its ice onto cargo ships and started counting them, one per second, it would take 860 years before you were finished counting.

The loss of even a portion of that ice would cause side-effects across the globe. Scientists have predicted the possibility of glacier collapse for years, but now it is confirmed.

For the UCI-JPL study, scientists used 40 years' worth of measurements. Much of it came from satellites that can measure changes on Earth's surface to within a quarter of an inch.

The data was used to measure the exact location of the glaciers' grounding lines. That is the point at which glaciers are connected to the ocean floor. It is here that ocean water meets the glaciers and causes it to melt.

From there the problems multiply, scientists said.

## Rising Seas Also Spell Trouble On Land

The more grounding lines recede, for instance, the less glaciers weigh. This lifts them farther off Earth's bedrock, which allows even more warm water to wear away at their foundations. Similarly, as the glaciers float into deeper portions of the ocean, they become even more unstable and exposed to warmer water.

In the second study, researchers at the University of Washington focused largely on the Thwaites Glacier. They were trying to pinpoint how quickly the giant Thwaites might disappear altogether. By itself, the disappearance of the Thwaites could cause global sea levels to rise 2 feet.

That big of a rise would have a chaotic impact.

Another study this year of the possible effect in Southern California, for instance, said that even a more modest sea level rise would threaten portions of the Pacific Coast Highway in California. It would endanger power plants and water treatment plants. It would also worsen the tides and storms in low-lying communities near Los Angeles, such as Venice and San Pedro.

The Washington study determined that the Thwaites could melt in as little as 200 years or as long as 1,000 years. Ian Joughin is a university glaciologist and the lead author of that study. He said that 200 years is more likely.

He said the glacier's disappearance would begin slowly and accelerate over time.

## When One Glacier Goes

The Thwaites is an important test case because it is considered an anchor for the rest of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. As goes the Thwaites, many scientists fear, so goes the rest of the ice sheet. Its disappearance would expose many more miles of grounding lines to the warming ocean water.

"You can't just remove this glacier cleanly," Joughin said. "You pull one part out, the rest will move into the" hole.

If the entire ice sheet disappeared, the global sea level could rise 15 feet.

"Eventually, this could lead to the (end) of ice across Antarctica," Rignot said.

Although there's no stopping the big melt, people shouldn't just surrender. The 800-year range for the time frame is enormous, scientists say. And computer models gave many possibilities, Joughin said. The more fossil fuels are burned, the faster the glaciers will melt and disappear, the researchers said. But the reverse is true, too.

"Eight hundred years is a long time," Joughin said.

If people cut way down on burning fossil fuels, the glaciers could take closer to 1,000 years to melt. Think of the technological advances that have occurred in the last 800 years, Joughin said. In the next 800 years, scientists could better understand how to protect coastal areas from the rising sea level, Joughin said.

"The system really is going down," Rignot said. "How fast it is going to go is critical."
