BURLINGAME, Calif. — Josiah Zayner is a 34-year-old scientist working at his kitchen table in Burlingame, California. He has dyed hair and pierced ears, and wears a T-shirt that says "Go Ninja Go." On Zayner's arm is a tattoo that says "Build Something Beautiful."  

In tiny glass containers, Zayner is cutting, pasting and stirring genes together. Genes are made of DNA, which contains instructions for how each part of the body works and is passed on from parents to children. It works the same way in all living things. It looks like he is mixing a drink. When he is done, he slides his new creations onto a refrigerator shelf next to the vegetables. 

Zayner is packaging and selling his gene-editing kit for $120. He wants everyone to be able to practice science. He says, "It's a craft. You don't have to be a genius, or go to school." The kit includes lab rules, inexpensive equipment and directions.

## From Big Labs To Kitchen Table

Some people worry about this kind of homemade science. They fear that if there are no laws, new bacteria or viruses could be released. Others are more enthusiastic. They imagine a day when anyone could create cheap drugs or clean fuels.

Moving genes from one living creature to another was once a very specialized task. Later, it was done by more scientists, but only in big labs. Three years ago, scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, invented a gene-editing tool called CRISPR. The tool is a cheap, fast and precise way to edit genetic sequences, the order of life's chemical alphabet in DNA. However, only colleges and businesses could get it.

Zayner is the first to market a simplified version of CRISPR to the public. The kit is not dangerous. Zayner's bacteria and yeast cannot do much except change color or smell, or live in unwelcoming places for a short time.

Zayner works at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), but he is leaving soon. His new plan is to work full time with his do-it-yourself science. 

## He Has Faith In Citizen Scientists

Zayner is convinced that citizen scientists can help solve society's big problems. He says, "There are so many brilliant and capable people that I want to show how they can do these things. They can change the face of the world we live in."

He takes his inspiration from the early days of personal computing. Then, the Homebrew Computer Club and other hobbyists shared what are now legendary ideas. The club was a gathering of computer hobbyists in California in the 1970s. Many members, such as Apple's Steve Jobs, later became leaders in personal computing.

Jacob Corn, a scientist at the University of California, supports Zayner's kit. Corn says that it could never be used to alter human genes, and is a good way to introduce people to the idea of editing genes. He says the kit is similar to something that a college student "might do in a basic biology lab course." 

Zayner's kit does raise concerns about dangerous gene editing being done someday without restrictions. The idea is troubling to some experts because it could be a risk to the environment and human health.

## Experts Want Stronger Rules

Because of this worry, several scientists at Stanford University in California have asked officials to create better rules for biological research. They want to make sure that a tough-to-kill bacteria or virus is not created that might escape or be released on purpose.

Dr. David Relman is a disease expert at Stanford University. He worries that the kits will make gene editing too easy. People might create dangerous experiments.

Relman wrote a report recently in a magazine for scientists. He is worried about labs that are developing new bacteria and viruses for research. For instance, some scientists are creating more contagious versions of the deadly H5N1 bird flu.

## "Guys In Garage" Seen As Risky

The report states that dangerous biological research can be done in small labs. Relman says, "I do not think that we want an unregulated, non-overseen community of freelance practitioners." Some experts wonder if it is even possible to control gene editing in animals or plants.

Hank Greely is also a Stanford University scientist. He passed along a warning at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences recently. Greely says that there are guys with college degrees working on gene editing in their garages. 

Zayner would love a garage, but says,"It's way too expensive." In his one-bedroom apartment, he mixes bacteria with DNA and other ingredients. Zayner works with the shades pulled down so neighbors do not get alarmed.
