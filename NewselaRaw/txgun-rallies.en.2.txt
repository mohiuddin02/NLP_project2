FORT WORTH, Texas â€” Texas is famous for its gun lovers. But the nation's largest gun-rights group is taking some Texans to task. The group says demonstrations advocating the legal, open carrying of weapons have grabbed headlines in the wrong way.

Some pro-gun Texans have held rallies at fast-food restaurants and home- improvement stores. Officials with the National Rifle Association say the demonstrations are "downright weird." They said they are "certainly not a practical way to go normally about your business while being prepared to defend yourself."

The NRA applauds Texas for a strong "gun culture." But leaders of the group scolded "a small number" and said that those people "have recently crossed the line from enthusiasm to downright foolishness."

## Limited Carry At The State Convention

This comes as countless Republicans are heading toward the state GOP convention in Fort Worth. Some plan to carry long guns outside the Fort Worth Convention Center.

The question of whether guns can be carried into the center during the three-day convention has been a concern. There is a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) license at the facility.

Republican Party of Texas Chairman Steve Munisteri released a statement. He told party members that "anyone carrying an openly exposed weapon will be asked to do so outside of the building."

Concealed handgun license holders will be fine. They and law enforcement officers may carry their concealed handguns inside during the convention.

Gun supporters are also encouraging people to carry black powder guns inside.

The alcoholic beverage commission says these guns are OK. They are not considered firearms under Texas law, according to a statement posted on Facebook. "Several of us will be carrying exempt black powder pistols as we educate people about the (lack of) ability to legally open carry. We can use more help."

## Maybe Not The Best Way To Go About It

The NRA's two-page statement comes in the wake of several local demonstrations. The most recent took place at a Home Depot parking lot in the Texas suburb of North Richland Hills.

Organizers have said around 150 people showed up at the event geared to promote the desire of Texans to openly carry their handguns. Donations were accepted; black powder revolvers and ammunition were among raffle prizes given out.

North Richland Hills police say they are now investigating the raffle from the event.

"There are concerns that the manner in which it was held may be in violation of state gambling (laws)," said Keith Bauman of the North Richland Hills Police Department. "At this time, we are not going into the details of the specifics of the investigation."

Open Carry Tarrant County is a gun-rights group. It made national headlines after a misunderstanding at a Jack in the Box in Fort Worth prompted a 911 call. The caller was concerned about a group of men walking around with long-barreled guns.

Another demonstration took place at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Dallas. It gained attention when managers asked customers to "not bring guns into our restaurants, unless they are authorized law enforcement."

Officials with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission have reminded Texans that long guns aren't allowed in businesses that sell alcoholic drinks. The business could lose its permit to sell drinks. Any person in violation could face criminal-trespassing charges.

## Asking People To Think Before They Carry

Open carry has become a hot political issue. Political candidates have indicated that a change in the law will be considered during the next legislative session.

As a result of the national attention, some leaders in the open-carry movement recently sent out a letter. It called on supporters to curb efforts to carry long guns into Texas businesses.

The letter asked members to "take a step back." It asked people to think about what the gun rights groups are trying to do. The letter was sent by Come and Take It Texas, Texas Carry, Gun Rights Across America and Open Carry Texas.

"We must be willing and able to recognize what works and what doesn't," the letter said.

NRA officials pointed out that they "love AR-15s and AKs as much as anybody." They also said "these sorts of semiautomatic carbines are among the most popular, fastest-selling firearms in America today."

However, they said "it can be downright scary," to some people to see the guns carried into public places. "It makes folks who might normally be perfectly open-minded about firearms feel uncomfortable and question" what pro-gun supporters are trying to do.

Several fast-food outlets have asked that customers not bring long guns into their businesses.

NRA officials say these protests are "just not neighborly, which is out of character for the big-hearted residents of Texas. Using guns merely to draw attention to yourself in public not only defies common sense, it shows a lack of consideration and manners."

They added, "That's not the Texas way. And that's certainly not the NRA way."
