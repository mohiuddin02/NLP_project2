CHICAGO, Ill. — After growing up poor in a mostly African-American neighborhood of Cincinnati, the young adults had reached their early 20s. One by one, their brains were scanned by an MRI.

For those who had been exposed to lead as toddlers, the scans revealed changes that were subtle, permanent and devastating.

The toxic metal had robbed them of gray matter. This is the substance in the brain that enables people to pay attention, regulate emotions and control impulses. Lead also had scrambled the production of white matter that transmits signals between different parts of the brain.

Scars left by lead have had significant consequences for the study participants and their communities. As children, they struggled in school more than those who had not been exposed. As teens, they committed crimes more frequently, University of Cincinnati researchers reported.

"What we found is that lead sowed the seeds of their future," said Kim Dietrich, a neuropsychologist who has been following the group of nearly 300 people since they were born in the late 1970s.

She said lead is a barrier to "normal development, making smart decisions and success."

## Lead Still A Problem

People have known for centuries that lead is poisonous, and removing it from gasoline and paint has dramatically reduced exposure for American children.

Yet research is making it clear that the toxic effects of lead are far more wide-ranging than previously known. Lingering dust from paint and deposits from old vehicle emissions continue to harm thousands of children in older industrial cities like Cincinnati and Chicago.

Early exposure harms children in ways that don't become apparent until years later. The damage ends up costing cities — and taxpayers — in the form of increased spending on health care, special education and law enforcement.

Last month, a Chicago Tribune investigation found that lead hazards are festering in the same parts of Chicago that have given the city a national reputation for violence and academic failure. In poor, crime-ridden neighborhoods like Austin, Englewood and Lawndale, more than 80 percent of the children tested in 1995 had dangerous lead levels.

Today those kids are in their early to mid-20s, the age when criminal behavior peaks.

## Lead Linked To Poor School Performance, Crime

Increasingly there is evidence of links between lead poisoning, poor school performance and crime. Some scientists are starting to focus on lead pollution as a key factor in Chicago's violence.

Robert J. Sampson is a Harvard University researcher who has been studying Chicago for more than two decades.

Sampson recently added lead data to his existing research on poverty, education and crime in Chicago neighborhoods. The results, he said, were shocking. A map of lead poisoning rates among children younger than 6 in 1995, for instance, looks very similar to a map of assault rates in 2012, when those same children were 17 to 22 years old.

He said these "astounding levels of lead poisoning" are part of the cycle of poverty.

Politicians and policymakers have yet to catch up to this line of thinking. They seem to regard lead pollution as a problem solved long ago. During the past five years, federal and state officials have sharply cut funding to screen children, inspect buildings for lead and eliminate lead hazards.

Less money has been directed at the problem. The result is that children ages 5 and younger continue to be harmed at rates up to six times the Chicago average. These children live in mostly African-American neighborhoods, according to the Tribune's analysis of city records.

## Staggering Levels Of Lead In Chicago Schoolchildren

Anne Evens is a researcher and a former chief of lead poisoning prevention at the Chicago Department of Public Health. She recently published a study that focuses on how lead is still ravaging the city years after it faded as a local and national issue.

Evens obtained the lead tests of more than 58,000 children born in the city from 1994 to 1998. She compared the results with how they performed on standardized tests in third grade.

Her study found that exposure to lead during early childhood significantly increased the chance that a student would fail reading and math tests. This was true even when controlling for other factors such as poverty, race, birth weight and the mother's education level.

What Evens found is staggering: At three-quarters of Chicago Public Schools, the average lead level of third-graders exceeded a standard established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in each year from 2003 to 2006.

## Third Grade Is A Critical Year

Why is third grade so important? That's when children begin to use reading to learn other subjects, and studies show students who fail to master reading skills during such a critical year are more likely to fall behind in later grades and drop out of high school. Dropouts are significantly more likely to end up in jail than to get a diploma.

Some teachers and reading specialists know that kids exposed to lead as toddlers are more likely to act out, have trouble staying on task and struggle to work well with classmates.

The link between childhood lead exposure and violent behavior is well-established, both in animal research and human studies. Small doses can reduce IQ. They can also cause parts of the brain to temporarily stop working, in particular the areas responsible for controlling violent behavior.

"Of all the problems that affect kids in these neighborhoods, lead is the easiest to solve," Evens said.
