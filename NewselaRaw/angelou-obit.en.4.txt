But when you read her poems, you can still hear her rich, deep voice caressing every syllable:

_Come you death, in haste, do come,_  
_My shroud of black be weaving,_  
_Quiet my heart, be deathly quiet,_  
_My true love is leaving._

"She was an extraordinary, charismatic person," Edwin Wilson said years ago. Wilson was once head of education at Wake Forest University. Angelou taught there for more than 30 years. "She had a way of bringing an audience very much to within her grasp," he said.

After Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, he asked her to read a poem when he was sworn in. It was the first poem at an inauguration in 32 years.

She called it "On the Pulse of the Morning," and in it she spoke of hope for the country's future. She also reminded listeners of two terrible moments from the past: slavery and the Trail of Tears, when Native Americans were forced out of the South and many died.

_History, despite its wrenching pain_  
_Cannot be unlived, but if freed_  
_With courage, need not be lived again._

## "Swollen-Belly Poor"

Angelou was born Marguerite Johnson in 1928 in St. Louis. She was raised by her grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas. She described her childhood as being "swollen-belly poor." At 16, she had her only child, a son. She married and divorced at least two times.

Angelou wrote poems, movies and songs. Besides writing, she was a dancer, actress, civil rights activist, streetcar conductor, Creole cook, cocktail waitress and filmmaker. She toured Europe and Africa in the 1950s as an entertainer. It was then that she started using the name Maya Angelou.

In 1969, she published her first book. "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" was a huge success. In it, she described being abused by her mother's boyfriend.

"I had to make a decision that I would tell a truth which might liberate me," Angelou said in 1994. Talking about her tough childhood helped set her free. And she hoped it might help others to set themselves free.

Many women wrote letters to her after reading "Caged Bird." It made them feel "liberated enough to tell their mothers," she said.

## She "Read Everything"

The book gave these women the strength stand up to those who abused them. They were able to say to them, "This was cruel, what you did to me," Angelou said.

She dedicated the book to her son. And she also dedicated it to "all the strong black birds of promise who defy the odds and gods and sing their songs."

After being abused, Angelou said she rarely spoke for six years. When she did, she only spoke to her brother. The experience led to her becoming a writer.

While she wasn't speaking, she "read everything." She memorized the poems of writers she admired, Angelou said in 2002.

Angelou did most of her writing in rented hotel rooms. She would take three books with her: a dictionary, a thesaurus and a Bible.

## "Love Of The Language"

In 2001 she partnered with Hallmark Cards to make greeting cards. Some other poets disagreed with her decision.

Billy Collins was the official poet of the U.S. back then. "It lowers the understanding of what poetry actually can do," he said.

Angelou said she saw it as a challenge: to simplify an inspiration into two sentences. "I have not reduced my value or respect for words or love of the language," she said. "I'm having a ball. It was exactly what I needed after 'A Song Flung Up to Heaven.'"

"A Song Flung Up to Heaven" was the sixth volume of her autobiography. It was the last volume she wrote. Published in 2002, it included memories of motherhood. It also tells of the assassinations in the 1960s of civil rights leaders Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Both were her friends.

The last sentence of that volume is the same as the first sentence of the first:

"What are you looking at me for?" she wrote. "I didn't come to stay."
