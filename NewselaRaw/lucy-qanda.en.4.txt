LOS ANGELES â€” Forty years ago this month, one of our oldest ancestors was discovered. Scientists called her Lucy. She was about 3 1/2 feet tall and walked the Earth 3.5 million years ago. Lucy's discovery changed forever how scientists studied the earliest humans.

Donald Johanson found Lucy's skeleton in the African country of Ethiopia in 1974. He and his team named her Lucy after a song by the Beatles. The song played over and over the night her bones were found.

Johanson is now the head of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. He spoke about how Lucy's discovery changed what scientists thought about early humans. He also discussed what he hopes to find next.

_Newsela has adapted the answers given by Johanson. The words are simpler and some definitions have been added._

**Q: Before Lucy, where did scientists believe humans began?**

I first began studying early humans at the beginning of the 1970s. At the time, most people thought humans came from Africa, but they became modern humans in Europe.

**Q: How did the discovery of Lucy change that?**

She completely changed the idea of where we became human. Lucy showed us that human beings began in the area of Ethiopia where she was found.

She also showed us that early humans began walking upright on two legs as early as 3.5 million years ago. This information was a big deal for scientists.

**Q: How do you know she walked upright?**

Because we had her pelvis. The pelvis is a group of bones in the hip area. Lucy's pelvis was a very rare discovery. It is very different from the pelvis of a chimp.

Lucy's body still had short legs and long arms. We see this more in animals that lived in trees. She was an important bridge between more ancient creatures and more modern creatures.

**Q: Why was upright walking an advantage in Lucy's time?**

Walking upright left the front limbs free for other tasks. With arms, they could carry food back home. They could also share the food with members of their group.

We do not know what all the benefits were. However, being able to carry things was very important. Today, there are fewer and fewer apes. In comparison, there are 8 billion humans.

**Q: How has the science of human origins continued to change since Lucy's discovery?**

When I started working, we had only six or seven different fossils. The fossils were bones from early human species. Now we have 15 or 20. We now understand that evolution was not a straight line. Not all early humans evolved to become modern humans. There were many early human species that died out.

**Q: Are there major holes in the story of our origins that you would especially like to see filled in?**

We are working to answer an important question. What are the origins of modern humans?

Humans are very different from all other animals. We have language and cooperate with each other. We are also able to learn from each other. How did we figure that out?

**Q: Anything else?**

Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, died out about 3 million years ago. Scientists think that our human ancestors began between 2.3 million and 3 million years ago. People are looking in that time period for the answer.

**Q: Is there a specific place where you think the answer might be found?**

Scientists will look in Ethiopia north of where Lucy was found. They will look in rock that is between 2.5 million and 3 million years old to find human bones.

We hopefully will find fossils of early humans. They might be able to link Lucy with more human-like ancestors. They also might look in other parts of Africa.

**Q: Some people feel that the world has been picked over, and there is nothing left to discover. Do you agree?**

There are thousands of fossils of early humans that have not really been studied. They will tell us what these early humans ate and other things about their lives.

Areas all over Africa have not been thoroughly explored. I think new discoveries will be made that will be surprising.

As I tell my students, you are only limited by your imagination.
