BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” It took a garbage crisis for the Lebanese people to get serious.

Garbage has been piling up in Beirut's streets since its main landfill was closed earlier this summer. This week, anger about the smelly trash boiled over. Thousands protested in the street against a government so unable to work together that it can't hold elections or choose a president, much less pick up the garbage.

Tiny Lebanon has not been affected much by the civil war next door in Syria. However, the Middle Eastern country could find itself plunging into chaos if further violence tears across the capital.

"It shows the Lebanese society to some extent catching up with the rest of the Arab world in terms of popular protests against the central government," said Rami Khouri. He is an analyst with the American University of Beirut.

## Lebanon Still Feeling Effects Of Civil War

In many ways, Lebanon never got over its civil war, which lasted from 1975 until 1990. Governments never improved the country's infrastructure, causing water shortages and electricity cuts even now, 25 years later.

Resentments built up and finally erupted after the government closed its main landfill July 17. Mountains of garbage piled up on the streets, prompting a protest movement that is calling itself "You Stink."

Years of putting up with an incompetent government and corrupt politicians exploded at once. The "You Stink" movement quickly picked up supporters and came up with a new solution to the garbage crisis: It demanded that the entire government quit.

Lebanon's system of government is supposed to make sure that Muslims and Christians are equally represented. However, that often leads to constant arguing among the country's politicians.

## Parliament Stuck, Unable To Select A President

The country has been without a president for more than a year, despite nearly 30 attempts by Parliament to pick a new one.

The "You Stink" protests, which began as peaceful demonstrations, turned violent this weekend. A small group of young men repeatedly tried to tear down a fence separating the crowds from a government building.

On Saturday and Sunday night, police fired tear gas and water cannons at the protesters and fought them in the streets. Gunfire could be heard in the street. Dozens of people were wounded.

On Monday, workers swept up broken glass and other remains of the violence.

"We arrived in the morning and found everything broken; chairs on the floor; everything is a mess," said Joseph Khoury, who works at a car rental agency.

## Protesters Say They Aren't To Blame For Violence

Protesters said they were not responsible for the damage.

"Those who did this do not represent the Lebanese people," said Salah Noureddine, one of a handful of people protesting Monday morning.

The "You Stink" movement says it will not back down.

"This movement has succeeded in reawakening the Lebanese," said Marwan Maarouf, who is with the group. "We will not let them make us go to sleep again."

## More Turmoil Will Mean More Strain For Country

Maarouf called for a large protest Saturday. But it risks creating even more instability for Lebanon, which is already trying to deal with a flood of Syrian war refugees.

"You Stink" canceled a planned protest Monday. However, hundreds again gathered in downtown Beirut after sunset and protested peacefully.

Lebanon's government expected more trouble and sent the Lebanese army to guard downtown Beirut. Armored vehicles were stationed on street corners.

The protest was Lebanon's largest in years, and Khouri, the analyst, said it will probably lead to some kind of change.

## "You Stink" Could Force Government To Evolve

He said if the movement grows, it will lead to a challenge of the existing system of government. "So either ... (the government) has to change or it has to become more efficient" and fair, he said.

The government has tried to respond. Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk announced the names of companies that are being hired to manage Beirut's trash, describing the process as "transparent" and a "significant achievement." The government also scheduled the next Cabinet meeting of the country's top officials earlier, saying it will meet Tuesday to discuss the trash crisis.

Activists, however, quickly said that Machnouk was just playing games.

U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon David Hale also said he was "deeply troubled" by the images of violence at the protests and the reports of injuries. He called for a thorough investigation and for restraint on all sides.

Hale met with Lebanese Prime Minister Tammam Salam. Afterward, Hale said, "Lebanon's citizens deserve to have basic services they can count upon, just as they deserve a Parliament that overcomes its divisions and elects a president."
