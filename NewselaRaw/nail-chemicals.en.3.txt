Nearly 400,000 people work in nail salons every day in the United States. Those people have to work with chemicals in the polish and glue that can be harmful to their health.

A new report last week showed that a nail salon's environment was important. A salon with better conditions would have fewer serious health problems. The workers are exposed to lots of chemicals every day in small spaces, which can be harmful. When mixed together, they can be even more dangerous. It is difficult to know how these chemicals affect the body. Current studies do not show all the possible dangers of working with the chemicals.

## There Are Many Dangers

Experts know there are many risks. Dust from filed nails can get on the skin, which causes irritation. Dusts can also be breathed in. Even just a little bit of dust can contain nasty chemicals. Workers can breathe in harmful vapors or mists from the chemicals in the salon. The toxins could get into eyes. The chemicals can also be swallowed while workers are eating or drinking.

Safety experts have made a list of all the chemicals that nail salon workers use every day. For most customers these chemicals are not dangerous. For workers who are around them day after day there is a higher level of risk. Many nail salon workers complain about breathing, skin irritations, and they have problems with muscles, bones or joints. If the air is not clean, it can be difficult to breathe.

Nail salons could help protect workers. One way is to give them safety equipment. Health experts say by wearing special gloves, workers can avoid touching some nasty chemicals. Wearing a special mask also helps. Good air quality in a nail salon is also really important.

## Here is a list of four of the most worrying nail salon chemicals:

## - Toluene

This liquid is found in crude oil, which can sometimes be dangerous to humans. It is also a common ingredient in nail polish and fingernail glue. If someone breathes in too much toluene, they might become light-headed and dizzy. Toluene could also damage their nerves, eyes, throat and lungs.

## - Formaldehyde

This chemical is used in nail polish. It is also used to make nails harder. Studies show formaldehyde can make people seriously ill. It can also harm the eyes, skin and throat, causing coughing, allergies, asthma or trouble breathing. Workers need to wear special masks to protect them from breathing in the dangerous vapors. Even in small amounts, the chemical can harm the nose and eyes. It can also damage someone's memory.

## - Dibutyl Phthalate

This chemical is often used to make plastics softer and bend more easily. It is also found in nail polish. We still do not know exactly how it affects humans over the long-term. Though we do know that it has a very bad effect on some animals.

## - Methacrylate Compounds

Ethyl methacrylate (EMA) is found in fake nails. It can be harmful for both nail salon staff and customers. It can cause allergies, asthma and skin irritation. Fake fingernails should be applied somewhere with plenty of air. Health experts say workers removing fake nails should wear safety glasses to protect their eyes. They should also wear long sleeves and gloves to protect skin from dust.

## Read Labels Carefully

It is hard to avoid using these chemicals completely. Some nail products say they are free from toluene, formaldehyde and dibutyl phthalate. Studies of some of these products, however, show that their labels are often wrong. The businesses who make the nail products might be lying.

Chemicals are not the only things nail salon workers have to worry about. They can get pains from spending the day hunched over. They can also get infections from customers. Protective masks and gloves can help keep workers safe.
