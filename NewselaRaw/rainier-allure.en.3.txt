EATONVILLE, Wash. — Mount Rainier looms large over Puget Sound. Adventurous climbers have been drawn to it for years — but its icy peak can be deadly.

Now, Rainier has claimed six more victims.

More than 14,000 feet high, Rainier is the fifth-tallest mountain in the continental United States. The glacier-covered volcano rises alone near Seattle, beckoning people who love the outdoors.

"There is a draw, but I can't explain it," said Len Throop, who has climbed Rainier many times but never reached the top. "From the first time I ever saw it, I felt a connection. Even if you can't see it, you know it's there. And it's dangerous. (Last) week is one example, and it's not even the worst."

The worst accident came in June 1981 when 11 climbers died under giant chunks of ice.

## Fell Thousands Of Feet

The six climbers who died last week included two experienced mountain guides. Both worked for Alpine Ascents International.

The six victims fell thousands of feet down a steep, icy cliff.

The names of the dead have not yet been officially released. However, Alpine Ascents said that the lead guide was Matt Hegeman. A family member identified one of the other climbers as Mark Mahaney, 26, of St. Paul, Minn.

Climbing Rainier is always hard, and never easy.

"Only 50 percent of the people who try it, make it, any given year," said mountaineering expert Martinique Grigg. "It's a tough mountain. You need to be in good physical condition, and you need to have training to be safe in the mountains. You need to know how to travel over a glacier, how to rescue your climbing partners."

Climbing Rainier requires skill, endurance and special equipment. Climbers must attach spikes to their boots to keep from sliding. They carry ice axes that help stop them if they do slip down the mountain. Often, they are tied to their climbing mates for safety.

## A Dangerous, Difficult Ridge

The route the doomed climbers took last week goes up Liberty Ridge. That route, Grigg said, "is one of the most difficult on the mountain."

Eric Linxweiler has scaled Rainier several times. Climbers on the peak, he said, hear rocks crashing down the mountain.

"We do almost all of our climbing in the middle of the night when everything is frozen," Linxweiler said. "As the days get longer, every day the snow gets softer. As you're walking uphill, you're sliding. It's much safer to be on the mountain when the mountain is frozen."

He added, "Everyone leaves at midnight or 1 a.m. when they're doing ascending work. You put a headlamp on and you go."

Mike Maude has gone up the Liberty Ridge route several times. In the past, he has both rescued climbers and helped locate the bodies of the dead.

Liberty Ridge is very steep and long, he said. "Once you get started falling, unless you can stop immediately, there's no stopping."

## "It's Just There"

Gary Harrington of Alpine Ascents said it's not clear what caused the deaths. But he said that possible problems climbers face include "rock fall, avalanche, a mixture of everything in between."

The ground search for the six climbers' bodies was called off because it was too dangerous.

"To continue searching there puts everybody at risk," Grigg said. "The sad fact (is), sometimes bodies are not recovered." If an avalanche slid over them, "they could be covered 30 to 40 feet or more."

Climbing experts said Sunday that last week's accident could make people think twice about safety. However, it probably won't keep them off Mount Rainier — the peak is just too fascinating for climbers.

"We moved here six years ago," Grigg said. "I would see that mountain and think, 'I want to climb that one day.' We talk about it as magical. You can't see it sometimes," when the weather is bad. "And then, all of a sudden, it's just there."
