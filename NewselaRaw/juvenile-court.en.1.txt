DALLAS â€” Most judges don't form personal connections with the offenders who come before the court. Judge George Ashford is different. Each Monday, he meets with minority boys in Dallas County who have gotten in trouble with the law to teach, preach and live by example.

Ashford, a black lawyer, is the judge of the Diversion Male Court (DMC), a six-month rehabilitation program for minority boys. DMC is staffed by men of color and was created in response to the racial imbalances in the juvenile justice system. Many of the young boys and girls who get in trouble with the law are black or Hispanic, while the lawyers and judges who are tasked with helping them to reform are often white.

DMC connects minority boys in Dallas to adults with whom they can identify, and who use a variety of methods to help them improve their behavior. DMC is unique in Texas, and there are only a handful of programs like it in the country. Boys who participate in DMC have been accused of everything from aggravated assault to burglary, and the program is their last chance to avoid a juvenile record.

## Emphasizing Life Lessons

More than simply telling these boys to stay out of trouble, Ashford and his team teach life lessons about accountability, respect, responsibility and empathy.

According to Dr. Terry Smith, executive director of the Dallas County Juvenile Department and the woman who started DMC, the program helps boys mature into adulthood. "These men are teaching them how to be men," she said.

University of Texas at Dallas criminologist Alex R. Piquero, a nationally recognized juvenile justice expert, said DMC has an interesting approach to helping youths who get into trouble with the law. "We should continue to experiment with new approaches and alternatives to sentencing, treatment and rehabilitation," he said.

Piquero also noted, however, that programs like DMC need to be evaluated over a long period of time in order to ensure that they are as effective as traditional court when it comes to reforming young offenders.

One mother, a volunteer minister, described DMC as "an answer to prayer." Her son is relatively new to the program. "Him getting into trouble was real hard for me. I need him to learn to follow the rules," she said. "I wish they had it when my nephew got in trouble. There wasn't anyone to show they cared."

## Know Your Manners

DMC does not sentence boys who have committed crimes with terms of detention or probation. Instead, these boys are enrolled in a multi-level program that promotes their personal growth.

Boys in DMC have to follow a number of rules that dictate how they behave, dress and carry themselves. Whether the boys are chubby-cheeked 10-year-olds barely topping 4 feet tall or gangly 16-year-olds sporting wispy chin hair, they are required to wear pants firmly belted around their hips and collared shirts that are carefully tucked in.

They are also expected to have excellent manners. "No, no, no," probation officer Herman Guerra admonishes when a boy sits down without pulling out the chair next to him for his mother. Guerra demonstrates: "Stand behind it; with both hands, pull it out."

## Helping Them To Open Up

Ashford wears a suit and tie instead of a robe when he talks to DMC boys, and he does not sit on the elevated bench where judges normally command the court. With one boy, he discusses boxing; with another, auto repair. Every conversation leads back to a life lesson.

When a small 12-year-old with glasses and a wispy voice sits down, Ashford asks what he did on the recent snow day. The boy mumbles a short answer, and Ashford persists, trying to get the boy to open up.

"How are you doing now in science?" he asks.

The boy's grades are OK. However, James Hill, a probation officer, tells the judge that other kids at the boy's school bully him.

Ashford tells the boy that because he has done everything he's been asked, he will be promoted to the next stage of the program, where he will learn new character traits, perform community service and come to court every other week.

## Program's High Expectations

When Smith decided to create DMC, she approached veteran juvenile officer Mario Love.

"I actually laughed," Love said, describing his first reaction to the idea.

He was doubtful that the program could work, and so were Ashford, Guerra and Hill.

"I'm happy to say I was proven wrong," says Love, who is now a passionate advocate for the program.

Since DMC began, 258 boys have been referred by the district attorney's office, the lawyers who normally argue for probation and detention for offenders. Some 143 enrolled in the program, and 25 more are currently under consideration.

DMC is demanding. Probation officers meet with each boy weekly to see if he is abiding by the 7 p.m. curfew and how he is doing at school. The officer also administers random drug tests. Another officer who is in charge of making sure the boy does not skip school may call the boy each morning to wake him up, and text him throughout the day to check on his whereabouts. Each boy must keep up with his school work and is tutored if necessary.

All participants are required to learn "character traits" such as trustworthiness and respect and to write a half-page journal entry every day documenting how these traits affect their behavior.

## Building Blocks Of Character

Overall, the program focuses on building character. Sometimes this requires adapting to the needs of each youth. When Love learned that a 17-year-old in the program had recently become a father, he added parenting classes to the barber classes the boy was already taking.

"We know you're here because of an offense, but we need to look at what's lacking around you and what services can we put into play to make you a better person," Love said.

According to Ashford, the program can help kids who have developed bad habits and made bad decisions to turn their lives around. He described how a youth's experience at DMC can lead to a dramatic change. "He gets some positive influences," he said. "He gets the probation officer who really shows him they are concerned about him, care about him. They get the right kind of feedback from the judge, that, you know, we're really trying to help you. Maybe some of the services kick in, the counseling addresses some issues in the home that help both him and the parent."

"Those cases are deeply satisfying," he observed.

## Uncomfortable, But Necessary Topic

Race is central to the structure and approach of DMC, and Smith recognizes that race can be an "uncomfortable topic." "Does that mean we ignore it?" she asked.

Blacks make up about 22 percent of Dallas County's juvenile population but about 44 percent of those in the county's juvenile justice system, according to the Juvenile Department. In other words, an unusually large proportion of African-American youth end up in trouble with the law. Experts call this "over-representation." Hispanic youth are slightly underrepresented, meaning that the proportion of Hispanics who enter the juvenile justice system is below average, while white youth are highly underrepresented.

Many experts say that these numbers do not necessarily mean that black and Hispanic kids commit more crimes than white kids do. Rather, minority boys may be more likely to be caught and punished for the crimes they commit because they lack the resources many whites have.

## Biases In The System

Darlene Byrne, a state district judge in Travis County who is president-elect of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, said that there are racial biases in how youths are treated in the juvenile justice system.

Experts point to the case of Ethan Couch, a white teenager who killed four people in Tarrant County two years ago while driving drunk. Couch was 16 at the time of the crash, and it was his third alcohol-related offense, yet a judge did not sentence Couch to serve jail time. It would have been very unlikely for a black teen to receive such a forgiving sentence, the experts say.

Piquero said that it's hard to know why minorities are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system, but argued that biases may not be the whole explanation. "It's real simple to look at who is in the facilities and say, 'Oh, well the system is totally biased,'" he said. "That may be true at some level or to some extent. We just don't know how much."
