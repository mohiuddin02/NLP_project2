BERKELEY, Calif. â€” Judith Lung is blind. She never learned how to throw a ball.

Now she can.

Right now, very few blind people play on college sports teams. The University of California, Berkeley, hopes to change that. This fall, it started the first college team for blind people. The sport is called goalball.

## Listen For The Ball

The game is played with a rubber ball. It has bells inside so players can hear it coming. All the players must wear dark glasses. They cannot see anything during the game. Instead, they rely on touch and hearing to get the ball into the goal.

At one game, a referee told everyone to be quiet. Silence is an important rule. The athletes need to hear what is happening on the court.

The referee rolled the ball to the team's star, Will Slason. He whipped the ball to the other end of the court. Jessica Adams slid on the floor to block the ball. It hit her chest with a thump.

## Put On Your Blinders!

Adams is the only player with full vision. Each team can have one player who is not blind. They must wear dark glasses too.

"For sure, the first time you play it's scary," Adams said.

Goalball is a rough game. There is a lot of diving and sliding. The best goalball players throw the ball up to 50 miles per hour. Players wear pads to protect their knees, hips and elbows. They don't wear face masks. They learn to guard their faces with their arms.

## Ouch! A Bloody Nose

Otherwise, they can get a bloody nose.

The team also has a dog. His name is Van Dyke. He wears a team uniform too.

Goallball was invented after World War II. The first players were soldiers hurt in the war.

Matt Grigorieff is a student at the University of California, Berkeley. He started Cal's Athletics for All. It is a group to get people with disabilities into sports. Grigorieff dreams of a college league for goalball. Blind and sighted people would play together.

"We're showing that it can be done," he said.
