Woodblock printing was developed more than 1,800 years ago in China. It is a form of printing that uses blocks of wood with raised surfaces in a pattern. Woodblock printing is like using a rubber stamp. The woodblock is covered in ink and then pressed against paper. It leaves behind a picture or words.

Not long ago, scientists discovered that the ancient printing system can be a useful tool. In today's laboratories it can be used to work with living cells.

A cell is the smallest unit of living things on Earth. Both plants and animals are made of cells.

Scientists usually use inkjet printers when working with living cells. Live cells are useful in testing new drugs or studying diseases. The inkjet printers squeeze the tiny, living cells out into patterns for lab experiments. But that system has some problems. So scientists have turned to Chinese woodblock printing.

## A Chinese Inspiration

Woodblock printing is helpful to scientists for many reasons. It makes it easier to keep cells alive during experiments.

Woodblock printing also gives scientists more choices. They can print a mixture of animal cells in many different shapes. And they can print them on just about any surface.

Inkjet printing involves squeezing fluid filled with cells. Those cells are "the ink." The cells are placed onto a surface in a pattern.

Scientists have used inkjet printing when they're trying to set down a layer of cells â€” like a layer of a cake. But it's hard to get the cells to lie flat in layers of single cells.

Inkjet printing makes it difficult to put the cells exactly where you want. It can also kill cells. Up to half may die.

So a team of scientists from Texas and Taiwan turned to Chinese woodblock printing.

The study was led by scientist Kai Zhang. He said that woodblock printing is a technology "that revolutionized the printing world."

## Designing Woodblock Stamps

The scientists designed woodblock-like stamps made out of silicone. Little hooks were placed along the sides of the stamps.

Scientists then pushed liquid filled with cells through the stamp's design. Pressure was used to suck the cell through to the other side of the stamp.

The hooks catch a single cell as it flies by. Think of the cell as a baseball and the hook as a catcher's mitt. The cell flies into the hook just like a baseball falls into a mitt.

Once a hook is filled, the other cells pass by. They fill other empty hooks.

The mold is then pressed onto a surface and then lifted away. This leaves behind a pattern of cells.

By using the silicone stamps, scientists were able to work with HeLa cancer cells. They placed the HeLa cells in organized grids.

## First Lab-Grown Cells

The HeLa cells were the first ones ever grown in a lab. They were taken from a patient named Henrietta Lacks. She later died of cancer in 1951. Scientists noticed that her cells were different. They could be kept alive and grow. Her cells have been used by scientists in experiments all around the world.

Printing the HeLa cells allows scientists to look at how cancer spreads through the body.

Neurons were also used while working with the woodblock stamps. Neurons are cells that send information to and from the brain.

Scientists placed neurons into a grid shape. Then they watched how they share information. They hope this will let them understand how brain diseases work.

The scientists call this new type of printing block-cell printing. They found that it could be done in just half an hour. Unlike inkjet printing, it doesn't kill any of the cells being used.

There are some drawbacks. Block-cell printing cannot print several layers of cells. Printing also takes longer than with an inkjet printer. But it could be cheaper, the scientists said. The materials to make each stamp's mold cost roughly $1. An inkjet cell printer can cost thousands of dollars.
