WASHINGTON â€” This summer, police in Ferguson, Missouri, used surplus U.S. military equipment during protests. They sent officers with armored vehicles, assault rifles and body armor to at times peaceful marches. Now, President Barack Obama is ordering up new rules for giving local police agencies access to such weapons.

Obama is also proposing to spend $263 million over three years to expand training and increase the use of body-worn cameras for recording police encounters with the public. The proposal includes $75 million that would help with purchasing as many as 50,000 cameras. Cameras like these might have provided more information in the deadly August shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer in Ferguson.

The president's new rules came along with the release of a new White House review that criticized the so-called "surplus" programs of the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. They found it to be a mixed-up set of rules and practices. For example, there is no clear sign that all police are properly trained and certified to use the military-grade equipment they receive.

## Reviewing Military Gear

The results of the review come a week after a grand jury in St. Louis County chose not to bring the Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson, to trial for the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. The shooting inflamed local emotions and led to unrest. It also brought attention to the use of military-grade equipment by local law enforcement officials in their response. Protests around the country and in Ferguson began again last week after the grand jury's decision.

With the report now in hand, Obama told his staff to come up with a list of military gear that has an actual civilian law enforcement purpose. This will ensure it can be sent to local police forces around the country, senior administration officials said Monday.

The new rules will also make local officials review and authorize buying small arms and all other "controlled" equipment with their communities first. Police will also have to be specially trained in their civilian use.

The rules will come within the next four months. The White House will issue an executive order to direct the Pentagon and all other federal agencies that run the surplus programs. These programs are the ones that distribute military-style equipment to police around the country.

## "Lack Of Consistency"

"What he's asking his agencies to do is add a very specific layer of accountability," said one senior administration official who is familiar with the program. "These layers of accountability aren't currently present in the program."

In Ferguson, when the police brought out military equipment it served to escalate the conflict between police and protesters angry about the shooting.

Community leaders demanded to know why the police turned out at peaceful protests with riot gear and combat equipment. In response, Obama ordered a White House review of the rules that govern the distribution of that material.

The new report identifies a "lack of consistency" in how the various federal programs are run and audited. It raises questions about whether police know how to use the military-grade equipment, the senior administration official said.

Obama discussed the report's findings and his new directive in a series of Monday meetings. He held the meetings with his Cabinet, young civil rights leaders, community leaders and police officials from around the country.

## Building Trust

At the top of the agenda was finding ways to build trust between police and communities, an aide to the president said.

Obama told his staff to write an executive order to help resolve the issue. It requires non-police officials to review and authorize the transfer of equipment, such as small arms and armored vehicles, before it can be sent to their communities.

Police forces would have to take part in extensive training before using any military surplus. Under the executive order, there would also have to be follow-up reports for any serious incidents involving the federal equipment.

In addition, Obama is setting up a task force to make recommendations for fighting crime while still building public trust. Charles H. Ramsey is the Philadelphia police commissioner. He and Laurie Robinson, former assistant attorney general for justice programs, will co-chair the panel.
