PRESCOTT, Ariz. — The horse trotted gingerly out of his silver steel trailer, each step kicking up a puff of dry field dirt. He has a fine, strong frame and a bluish stripe down his nose. He is Bruce, the beautiful chestnut-colored horse that just couldn't win.

His last, best chance is Bryce Runyan, a 25-year-old professional calf roper.

## Quick, Strong ... And Smart

Other cowboys "said he couldn't run how they wanted," Runyan said. "I saw he could run the way I wanted."

Bruce was not bold or violent enough for bronco riding, the famous rodeo event where cowboys try to stay on a bucking horse.

However, Bruce was quick and strong, and he had something those wild-eyed broncos didn't: He was smart, and in calf roping, a smart horse can win. Calf roping is a rodeo event involving a calf and a rider on a horse where the goal is for the rider to throw a loop of rope around the calf's neck, dismount the horse, then run to the calf and tie three of its legs together with a strip of "piggin' string." This is all done in seconds.

## Can A Sweet Horse Win?

Before Runyan had Bruce he had a friendly Chestnut named Maverick. Maverick was a great horse and he and Runyan won first place and $5,000 in last year's Prescott rodeo. However, Maverick was getting older and he and Runyan had grown too used to each other. This sometimes happens to rodeo horses — they know their riders so well, they over-anticipate the next move, fouling the milliseconds that make up who wins and who loses.

After trying unsuccessfully to break in two other horses Runyan found Bruce. He was a sweet horse, said the family who owned him, but no champion.

A calf roper and his horse must wait to enter the ring behind a wooden gate. After the calf runs a certain distance, the gate falls and the rider begins the chase. Sometimes a rider gets too eager and crashes through the gate, suffering a 10-second delay penalty.

## Milliseconds Count

Tenths of seconds matter: Runyan won last year by roping his first calf in 10 seconds flat. The next fastest calf roper came in at 10.70.

Runyan sat astride Bruce as the public address system crackled to life: "Here is your champion from last year, Brrrrrryce Runyan!"

CLANG! The calf spilled out of the gate, loping left, then veering to the center, slackening the line and Runyan couldn't adjust. He and Bruce blew through the gate and the crowd groaned in disappointment.

That was it. A half-second and the show, for Runyan, was over.

## "No One's Getting Rich"

Runyan thinks of growing up and leaving rodeo some day. He envisions marrying his girlfriend and ending a life that has kept him on the road for most of his 20s. He is not making a lot of money, but he is not losing a lot of money either.

"It could be a couple dollars either way," he said, grinning, "but no one's getting rich."

He has a future already set in his father's construction business, and building work is steady in the Southwest.

For now he wants to keep riding.

The cowboy has set his sights on the next rodeo a few days later, in Taylor, a town of about 4,000 in east-central Arizona with no postal delivery. Runyan has to win in Taylor, or his chances of making the National Finals Rodeo would be dim.

## A Ride To Remember

He arrived in Taylor after a four-hour drive mostly through forest. On competition night he readied his horse as a wriggly black calf pressed against the chute. A cowboy nudged it forward until CLANG!, the calf sprinted out, sand coating its legs and hooves.

Runyan clipped his legs together and Bruce exploded forward, gaining on the calf in 3.2 seconds. Runyan swooped the lasso around the calf's neck.

The shudder from the rope tensing was all Bruce needed: He knew to squat down, and Runyan slid off his right side.

Bruce reared for a moment but held the line tight. Runyan slammed the calf to the ground and whipped the piggin' string around its two forelegs and its right rear leg.

He stared up at the scoreboard, bewildered: 9.7 seconds. His fastest time ever, even better than with Maverick.

## "How About That!"

"Well, folks!" the announcer said. "How about that!"

Bruce fluttered his lips; Runyan didn't even crack a grin. A graying cowboy who had been otherwise motionless waved him over, spoke for two seconds and resumed his stony silence.

"He said, 'Good ride,'" Runyan said.

This is the way it is in rodeos. There is no showy victory lap. Just a handshake and a check, this one for $2,000.

However Runyan came away with something even more valuable. The cowboy now knows he had been right all along: Bruce wasn't a failure. He, like Runyan, only needed the right partner.
