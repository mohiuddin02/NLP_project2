RAMALLAH, West Bank — When Sari Sakakini started his new restaurant, he dreamed of opening Palestinian eateries around the world. A year later, he does not have much hope.

"I want to put Palestinian food all over the world," Sakakini said. His restaurant is named Orjuwan. "But over here, it's just putting food on the table."

## Ramallah Rejects Fancy Food

Ramallah is the center of West Bank Palestinian life. The West Bank is controlled by Israel, the country next door. In recent years, many new restaurants have opened in Ramallah. Unlike some other cities in the Middle East, though, Ramallah's food scene is quiet. People there have little money to eat out. They also prefer old-fashioned Palestinian food.

Palestinian cooks and restaurant owners are frustrated. What makes this even worse is that Israeli food has really taken off.

## In Tel Aviv, Food Is The Star

The scene is much different in Israel.

Food lovers flock to Tel Aviv, a city on Israel's coast. Last year, a food magazine called it an outstanding country for food. The Sabra brand of hummus, a spread of mashed chickpeas, is the official dip of the U.S. National Football League.

"It's very emotional for me," Sakakini said of the global love affair with Israeli food. "It's the same kitchen."

Israeli cooking mixes Palestinian flavors with Jewish cooking from around the world. Palestinians trace their cooking roots to countries around the Mediterranean Sea.

## Palestinian Chefs Make It Big In Israel

A glance at Palestinian cooks inside Israel shows how popular Palestinian food is there.

Nof Atamna-Ismaeel is an Israeli-Palestinian cook. She is a scientist who became famous when she won an Israeli cooking contest in 2014. Today she cooks at many Israeli restaurants. She often writes for Israeli food magazines.

This is all a distant dream for Palestinians living in the West Bank.

## A Menu For Survival

Peter Nasir is a Palestinian who studied computer science in Atlanta. He discovered his love of food while cooking for friends.

After his degree, he came back to Ramallah. In 2007, he opened a restaurant called Azure in his family's stone home. Nasir planned a short menu. It included local favorites, fresh vegetables and flavors from around the world. He was excited. His customers were not. His restaurant was not a success.

He had to change his menu to stay in business. He began serving typical Palestinian dishes, like hummus, as well as hamburgers.

People in Ramallah do not have much money for eating out, he pointed out. They are not interested in experimenting with new foods.

Nasir's experience shows the problems of life in Ramallah. The average Israeli earns 10 times more than the average Palestinian's pay of about $3,000.

Beyond money, Nasir's customers travel far less than Israelis. They are not as used to new things. Most Palestinians are not allowed to enter Israel or use the Tel Aviv airport. Palestinians want their own country. They have fought with Israel for a long time over the land.

Nasir can travel in Israel freely. He said his favorite restaurant is in Israel. It costs the same as a restaurant in Ramallah, he says, but the food is more interesting.

## Coming Soon — A Palestinian Cooking School

Palestinian cooking does have its fans. "The Gaza Kitchen" cookbook won praise around the world for its spicy recipes.

Palestinian chef Johnny Goric plans to open a $500,000 cooking school in Ramallah in September. It will train students in local recipes and international methods.

Sari Sakakini is excited.

Palestinian cooking is delicious, "but it has to be better presented and upgraded," Sakakini said. "We're not missing anything."
