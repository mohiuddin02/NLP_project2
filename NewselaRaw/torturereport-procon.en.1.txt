### PRO: Report gives extremists a rallying cry

WASHINGTON — Though they preside over the world's most important nation, our leaders in Washington can be shockingly oblivious to the people beyond our shores. Other nations — and extremists in those nations — watch and listen closely to whatever we say or do.

That's the only logical explanation for why Senate Intelligence Committee Democrats released such a graphic report 13 years after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It details the CIA's "enhanced interrogation" methods in the frightening days, weeks and months after that fateful day.

With its provocative detail splashed across the TV screens, front pages and websites of our media, the report will undoubtedly endanger American lives. It gives extremists one more rallying cry to attack U.S. interests and strengthen their recruiting efforts. It also forces other governments and intelligence services to show that they're keeping their distance from Uncle Sam.

## Unsavory Methods Were Known

To be clear, the report was revealing only in its raw detail of CIA activities against particular detainees. We've known for many years that the CIA used unsavory methods.

In fact, news surfaced years ago that the CIA deprived suspects of sleep, chained them to walls, threatened them with gruesome death and so on. At the time, government officials, opinion leaders and the broad public began a serious national debate over whether the United States should ever torture.

With a few exceptions, we even reached a general agreement that we should avoid anything that smacks of torture and consider employing it only in the most extreme cases. An obvious situation is when the United States faces the immediate threat of an attack that could kill hundreds, if not thousands, of people.

That's all fine years after the fact. Yet, as the Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Diane Feinstein acknowledged in the report, the days after Sept. 11  were ones of overwhelming fear that much greater attacks were coming.

In fact, Feinstein noted that, after Sept. 11, the CIA "was encouraged by political leaders and the public to do whatever it could to prevent another attack." She went on to say that the "Intelligence Committee as well often pushes intelligence agencies to act quickly in response to threats and world events."

That, by the way, is no different than how our nation's leaders have behaved at other perilous times. During the Civil War, for instance, President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, which prevents Americans from being unlawfully imprisoned. What later seems horrifying often seems vital at the time.

## Allies May Hesitate Helping U.S.

Feinstein says that she hopes the report will serve as a warning for the future. She hopes it will ensure that, even when facing national security perils, the United States never again abandons its values.

Now, the extremists of al-Qaida, Islamic State and other dangerous groups who plot every day to attack America will have one more rallying cry and recruiting tool. That means more extremists with more motivation to plot and launch more attacks against more Americans.

Now, governments and intelligence agencies with which Washington has worked regularly, whether in Europe, the Middle East, or elsewhere, will hesitate before working too closely with the United States.

That means less intelligence information from around the world will flow to Washington. Less information leaves us more open to plots, because our intelligence services need that information to prevent attacks.

America debated torture long ago. Rather than advance that debate, the committee's report is just making American deaths more likely.

### CON: U.S. had to come clean by releasing report

COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Senate Intelligence Committee's release of its report on CIA torture is a welcome step toward transparency. The methods used to wage the "war on terror" are of great interest to the public.

Despite gruesome details included in the report about what was done to detainees, the release is not likely to lead to any immediate increased risk to Americans. It is no secret that the CIA used techniques amounting to torture in its interrogations after Sept. 11, 2001.

What has raised the number of those inclined to cause harm to Americans is the torture itself, not its description in the Senate report.

## The Case Of Zubaydah

The interrogation methods had already been called torture by courts and international organizations. Last summer, the European Court of Human Rights ordered Poland to pay monetary damages to Abu Zubaydah. He was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and believed to be a member of al-Qaida, the group behind the Sept. 11 attacks. He was tortured in Poland at a "black site" the Polish government let the CIA use.

The court found that the methods used against Zubaydah were torture as it is defined by international law. The court found Poland also responsible in the torture committed by the CIA.

In the case of Zubaydah, harsh tactics including waterboarding — which creates the feeling of drowning — were used. Yet, the Senate report says it did not result in any significant information from him.

The United States has also been criticized by the U.N. Committee Against Torture. It monitors the Convention Against Torture, which we signed and are supposed to obey.

What the Senate Intelligence Committee report confirmed, although in greater detail, is only what other groups have already found.

What matters more to people in the rest of the world is our actions, not this new report.

## New Generation Of Extremists

The torture was part of an overreaction to Sept. 11 that included the mistake of invading Afghanistan.

Instead of dealing with Afghanistan's government to capture those responsible for the attacks in New York, we took over the country. Now we are trying to remove ourselves from Afghanistan. But we're leaving the country unstable, which is what let al-Qaida operate there to begin with.

The CIA torture was carried out, moreover, not only to discover threats from al-Qaida, but to prove that al-Qaida and Iraq were working together. We used this as an excuse to invade Iraq, but no such proof was ever found.

It is all these actions taken together that make us a target for a new generation of extremists. Not surprisingly, our actions are interpreted as arrogance.

Our continuing position in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians does not help. Even today, we stand practically alone in refusing to acknowledge Palestine as its own nation, and in protecting Israel in the U.N. Security Council.

It made sense to come clean on torture, in part because torture is a crime under U.S. law. The U.S. signed onto the Convention Against Torture, making torture committed anywhere in the world a crime.

## A Constitutional Responsibility

Charles Taylor, son of the former Liberian president of the same name, is currently serving a 97-year sentence in an American prison. He orchestrated torture in Liberia when he headed a government "anti-terrorism" unit under his father. Despite the crime taking place in another country, international law means he could be imprisoned here.

Regardless of whether any American official is prosecuted, the Senate had to release this report about torture. It has a Constitutional responsibility in overseeing the actions of presidents, even if these actions happened in the past. In the long term, the safety of the United States will depend on how we deal with all our international issues, not just this one.
