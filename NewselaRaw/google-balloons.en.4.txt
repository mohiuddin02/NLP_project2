DOS PALOS, Calif. â€” Google recently sent a giant helium balloon into the air. It looked like a flying jellyfish.

It soared thousands of feet above Earth. It carried high-tech radio gear and computer equipment. It also had solar panels to make energy from sunlight.

Google was conducting a strange experiment. You probably know the company for its Internet online search engine. But it is also searching for ways to get the Internet to parts of the world without service.

"This is a great, big, hard problem," said Richard DeVaul. He is a Google engineer who works on the balloons. Even Google knows the idea sounds a little crazy. The company named the experiment Project Loon.
## The Big Thing Is Power

But Google did a test in New Zealand earlier this year. Now DeVaul says it could work. Balloons could carry enough wireless equipment to get the Internet to far away parts of Asia, Africa and other places.

Now come more tests in California. The goal is to work out the answers to a bunch of questions to make the project work.

"Our main challenge right now is power," said Sameera Ponda. She is an engineer on the project. Ponda explained that the Loon team needs more information to decide how to place the solar panels and batteries.

The power equipment has to keep a balloon's radio and computers running for weeks at a time. The equipment has to work at night, too. It also has to work 12 miles or more above the Earth, where it is very cold.

Project Loon is part of Google's secretive X division. It works on ideas that seem crazy but could have a lot of success. Other projects include Google's self-driving car and the wearable computing device called Google Glass.
## Sounds Simple, But It Isn't

Google has been working on Loon for nearly two years. It only recently told everyone about it.

"Our goal is to provide Internet service to people in areas that can't afford" usual Internet lines or towers,  Ponda said. The company hopes to reach that goal "in a few years."

The idea calls for hundreds or even thousands of balloons. They will float twice as high as most jets fly, in a circle around the Earth. It may sound simple to explain. But is is really difficult to do.

The wind makes the balloons move. So Google came up with a way to raise or lower the balloons. The system lets the balloons catch the air currents needed to keep them floating just the right distance from each other. They also need to stay in line so if one floats out of range from Internet users, another will come along and take its place.

Controlling the balloons is a big math challenge, DeVaul said. So it is a good thing Google has a lot of computer experts and powerful computers, he said. Of course, Google wants more people using the Internet. The company makes most of its money by showing ads to people who use Google's online services. And it makes a LOT of money.

But Project Loon is aimed at "a very real problem," said Richard Bennett. He is an expert on the Internet and society. Two-thirds of the world cannot get to the Internet regularly, he said. They are considered below "the digital divide."
## "Harmless Science Experiment"

The idea could work, Bennett said. But who will pay for the balloon network? Google has not given many details about its plans. Bennett said Google may hope that cell phone companies and others will take up the idea if Google can show it is a money-maker.

Back at the launch site, project launch commander Bill Rogers and other members of his crew loaded their trucks. They were going to track the radio signal soon after the balloon was in the air. This balloon was made to travel only about 150 miles before returning to the ground.

Rogers planned to track it down and bring it back.  But in case someone else found it first, the plastic foam box holding its electronic gear carried a label. It said, "Harmless Science Experiment." Another provided a phone number to call.
