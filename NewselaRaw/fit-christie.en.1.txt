HACKENSACK, N.J. — William Howard Taft, the heaviest president in history, grew so tired of being ridiculed about his weight that he told his physician to put him on a diet. "No real gentleman," he noted, "weighs more than 300 pounds."

President Lyndon B. Johnson complained to staffers, "I can't button my britches." When his binge-eating got the best of him, he traded his tapioca pudding for Jell-O.

Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, was once an estimated 200 pounds overweight. Then, 21 months ago, the governor had Lap-Band surgery — a small band with a balloon inside was placed around the upper part of his stomach to limit what he could eat.

Since then, he appears to have taken off at least half of those excess pounds. Many see that weight loss as essential if the New Jersey Republican intends to run for president in 2016.

"He's lost 100 pounds, if not a little bit more, which puts him on a very good track," said Dr. Jaime Ponce, an expert on such surgeries. "The pictures are very impressive," he said, commenting on photos of Christie.

## "Looking Good, Governor"

Christie underwent Lap-Band surgery in February 2013. The procedure is often a last-ditch effort after decades of dieting.

Christie's office declined to say exactly how much weight he has lost, nor would his staff discuss his diet or workouts. Christie has said that only his physician and his wife know how much he weighs.

While he still has a significant amount to lose, the change in the governor's body is quite visible. His face is much thinner and his clothes, which used to appear tight, sometimes hang on him a bit. His recent appearances have led to talk about the new, slimmer Christie, furthering speculation about a run for the presidency. Supporters often shout words of encouragement, like "Looking good, governor."

In an interview on CBS-TV last month, Christie was asked if he felt as good as he looked. "Not yet, but I hope to," he said. "I feel much, much better than I used to feel, but the fact is I still have some work to do in that area, too, and so I've just got to keep working at it."

## Many People Face Same Weight Issues

The governor has said that the reasons for his drive to reach a healthier weight are the same as they are for many of the countless Americans who have turned to Weight Watchers, shakes, fasts and surgery: turning 50 and wanting to be around to hug the grandchildren.

However, in a nation seemingly obsessed with weight, a politician who is hefty draws attention.

"All presidents and presidential candidates in the TV age have been conscious of appearances and have to be," said political expert Larry J. Sabato. "There's a pretty good chance we'll never elect a William Howard Taft again."

Heavier political figures can face a serious obstacle: the public may believe they are not fit enough for the job.

Former White House physician Connie Mariano — a self-declared Republican and Christie fan — said last year she would like the governor to run for president. However, she said she worried that he would wind up having a heart attack or stroke and "dying in office." Christie, noting that she was not his personal physician, said, "She should shut up."

## What Voters See

At his heaviest weight two years ago when Superstorm Sandy ravaged the state, Christie spent weeks visiting sites damaged by the storm. His actions helped his favorable ratings soar above 70 percent in polls. However, Christie's weight still affected the way people viewed him.

Candidates need to persuade voters that they are able to serve.

"They need to look like the part they are running for," political expert Patsy Cisneros said. "If people don't see that person looks like that position — governor, president, senator from that state — then who are they?"

Christie might have as much as 100 more pounds to lose, experts said. Success varies with Lap-Band surgery. The people who achieve the best results follow a strict program, involving regular adjustments to the band, limiting meals to just a few ounces and regular exercise.

According to Dr. Stefanie Vaimakis, someone who makes "a real effort" can lose "1 to 2 pounds on average per week" following Lap-Band surgery. She added that it appears as if Christie has been following through.

Even a 10 percent reduction in body weight can yield benefits, Vaimakis said. Obesity — being extremely overweight — is linked to more than 40 diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis and cancer.

## Private Dining

Christie has said he works out with a personal trainer four times a week, but he rarely talks about his meals.

After confirming last year that he had the surgery, he noted that he ordered a steak one night and was full after eating just a third of it.

Christie will not let the press watch him eat. On his recent trip to Mexico, when it came time for a taco lunch, reporters and photographers were shooed away by aides once his food arrived.

At a September fundraiser in honor of Christie's birthday, former presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he had ordered a Jersey boy's favorites: lasagna, ravioli, the works. "I bought all this food and put it out in front of the table and Chris sat there and picked at a couple of pieces of lettuce," Romney said.
