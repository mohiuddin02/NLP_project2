BEIJING, China — The city of Beijing, China, has very bad air pollution. Air purifiers are machines that can help. They make the air cleaner. The Chinese government has refused to give these machines to many schools. 

Sara Zhang is a mother who lives in Beijing. She is 39 years old. At home, she tries to protect herself from pollution. She also tries to protect her two children from dirty air. Her 7-year-old son goes to a school that does not have air purifiers. The students are surrounded by dirty air.

## Parents Try To Help

Zhang and some other parents offered to give free air purifiers to the school. School leaders refused to take them though. The officials said the government had not approved the purifiers. This was frustrating for Zhang.

The parents called school leaders in Beijing. They also called people in the Chinese government.

"We got different answers from everyone who picked up the phone," Zhang said. "But everyone basically told us that it's impossible to have (air purifiers) installed."

## Breathing Bad Air Makes People Sick

December was a bad month in Beijing. The air pollution was very bad. Schools were closed across the city. Parents were angry that their children's schools did not have air purifiers. They were also angry that the Chinese government would not help fix the problem. 

China's air pollution is very unhealthy. Doctors say smog kills thousands of people each year. Smog is a mix of pollution and fog.

## Families Are Moving Away From The Smog

One woman complained about her stepdaughter's school. She said the school had not put in air purifiers. She said the smog has been so bad that she is moving her family away. They are moving to the island of Hainan. It is in southern China. The island has much cleaner air. 

"The pollution is so bad it makes life in this city practically unlivable," the woman said. "This is such a massive problem, and the government isn't solving it. So what kinds of problems is the government here to solve?"
