NEW YORK  - Athletic trainers should be on the lookout for student-athletes' mental health problems, a panel said on Wednesday.

Representatives from the National Athletic Trainers' Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other organizations said athletic trainers are in a unique position. Their closeness to college athletes makes them well-suited to reach out to troubled students.

"As an athletic trainer, we're usually right there with the student-athletes during some of their worst moments," said Timothy Neal who chaired the task force. "You have their trust."

About 30 percent of college-aged people reported having some type of mental illness during 2010 and 2011. The data comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

## When Something's Not Quite Right

Neal said he has seen everything from athletes with anxiety and eating disorders to those who are suicidal. Some students come to him for help, but in other cases he reaches out when it seems like something's not quite right.

"What I look for is someone who is acting opposite of as you know them â€“ someone who's more irritable than they normally would be, someone who's more withdrawn than they normally would be," Neal said.

When that's the case, athletic trainers should approach students and offer to refer them for counseling services at the school or in the community. It helps to already have a relationship with those services, Neal said. Trainers should talk with mental health counselors about the particular stresses facing student-athletes.

Athletic trainers should also be prepared to make an emergency referral if student-athletes are a threat to themselves or others, the task force noted. Trainers should call law enforcement if the person is violent.

Neal said he talks with student-athletes at the beginning of every season about the importance of psychological health. His aim is to reduce the embarrassment and shame associated with having a mental health problem.

## Injured Body, Injured Mind

According to Dr. Thomas L. Schwenk, it can be especially difficult to convince athletes that it's okay to have a mental illness. Schwenk is dean of the University of Nevada School of Medicine in Reno. He has studied mental illness among athletes.

"With special populations, especially populations of people who are particularly goal-oriented, particularly high achievers, particularly focused, there still is a sense of stigmatization, a sense of shame," said Schwenk.

"We still have to work really hard with special populations like student-athletes to help them understand that they get sick just like everybody else, they have mental health problems just like everybody else," He added.

According to the task force, athletes are particularly prone to developing psychological problems when they get injured and have to take time out from their sport.

"Many athletes especially at a collegiate level identify themselves as a person as an athlete," Neal said. So when they get hurt, they may start losing that identity and feel isolated.

Schwenk said athletes also have underlying mental illnesses such as depression. Symptoms don't have to stem from athletic-related stress, he pointed out. One strategy for reaching out to athletes is to frame mental health care as a way to improve their performance in their sport.

"An athlete may not be too enthused," Schwenk said, "until you say, 'This is the way you can be better.'"
