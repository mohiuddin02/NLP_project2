BERLIN, Germany — A boy with a serious face looks around a packed train station. Nearby is a little girl whose hair has not been brushed for days. Just beyond, a group of teens are clustered around a smartphone, arguing about travel. There are no adults near them.

Aid groups and governments call them "unaccompanied minors." They are children under 18 who are making a dangerous thousand-mile journey without a parent.

They come from countries in the Middle East like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. These children are only a few of the tens of thousands of migrants and refugees currently traveling across Europe. Yet, they are a special challenge to groups trying to help victims of war and persecution.

## Other Countries Strained By Flood Of Migrants

Safety is getting harder to find.

Germany is a wealthy country in Europe that many migrants are trying to reach. Germany had been letting the migrants in freely for more than a week. However, the country is now keeping some refugees from entering. German officials said this is temporary. They said that the country expects to take in as many as 1 million migrants this year.

Mazen Hassoun is a 16-year-old Syrian boy. He arrived in Berlin, the capital of Germany, this month from Mansurah in Syria. The town is near Raqqah, the headquarters of the group Islamic State. The extremist group has taken control of large parts of Syria and Iraq and has killed many people.

"My parents believed I had to get out of there before I was forced to fight" for the Islamic State group, he said. "We didn't have the money to bring the whole family, so it was decided that I would make the journey."

## Children Relax Into Old Selves — Most Of The Time

Many of the youngsters are quiet and scared when they arrive. Remarkably quickly, they recover — or appear to. On a recent day, a center in Munich was filled with happy chatter.

"They become children again," said Jutta Stiehler, who runs the center. "But at night, the ghosts come back." The children sometimes have nightmares and wet their beds, she said.

Rimas is just 9 years old. Her uncle brought her and a cousin to Germany from Syria, which is in the Middle East. She sometimes cried for her mother during the long journey, her uncle said.

## Dangerous Journey Takes A Toll On The Youngest

Abdel Rahman Koweifi, her uncle, said it sometimes broke his heart. The worst was when the two children were too scared to cry. Their journey was very dangerous. At one point their raft overturned in the sea, and they were rescued.

Aid workers help the refugees. They say that families have high hopes and the youngsters often feel intense pressure. Some families hope that the children will be able to get work and send back money. Others hope that the children will get asylum in another country, and family members will be able to join them. Asylum is given to people who would be in danger if they returned to their home countries. If someone gets asylum from another country, they are allowed to stay there legally.

Their journeys can be very dangerous. Children on their own can be attacked or robbed.

## Families Making Desperate Decisions So They Can Survive

Michael Bochenek is an expert on children's rights with Human Rights Watch in London. The children are desperate to find safety, he said. Otherwise, they would not make such a dangerous journey.

In Berlin, Koweifi was happy that he had been allowed to remain with his niece and nephew at a refugee camp. The children are able to call or text their parents at least once a day.

Koweifi started the process to get asylum. He expects it will take weeks or months before they know whether they will be allowed to stay in Germany.

Koweifi recalled the tearful goodbyes in Syria. He swore to his brothers that he would guard their children's lives with his own.

"I look at them, and it is hard to believe we are safe," he said. "And perhaps we will all be together again — maybe not so soon, but someday."
