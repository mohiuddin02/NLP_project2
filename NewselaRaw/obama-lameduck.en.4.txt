WASHINGTON â€” Barack Obama has two years left as president.

If he wants to get anything done, he will have to work with the House of Representatives and the Senate. The two groups of lawmakers form Congress.

Congress works with and against the president to form laws for the country. When Congress and the President agree, laws get passed. When they disagree, it can be hard to make changes and new laws.

President Obama's last two years look like they will be challenging. On Tuesday, Republicans won elections all over the country. Republicans form a political group. They disagree with Obama, who is a Democrat.

## Dealing With Serious Problems

Republicans were already in control of the House of Representatives. Now, Republican lawmakers will have control of the Senate, too

In the last two years of Obama's presidency, Congress will be controlled by people who do not agree with him.

Experts say the Republican victory will make it harder for Obama to deal with serious problems.

There are many of them.

The U.S. is becoming wealthier, but many people are not making more money at work. The deadly Ebola virus in the United States is scaring many people. A lot of people are worried that Obama cannot handle all of the problems at once.

Next week, Obama will fly to Asia and Australia for meetings. Meanwhile, the old Congress will return to Washington to finish its work. The new Republican-led Congress will begin in January.

## Already Thinking About 2016 Election

Senator Mitch McConnell is a Republican from Kentucky. He said that he and Obama must work together on issues they agree on. McConnell won the election on Tuesday. He was already in the Senate and gets to keep being a lawmaker.

McConnell said, "I don't expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently."

He added, "He knows I won't, either."

Many elected officials are ignoring Obama. They are starting to think about the next election for president, in 2016. Obama will be "yesterday's news," said New Hampshire State Senator Lou D'Allesandro. He is a Democrat like Obama.

D'Allesandro expects that president will not do much in his last two years. Republicans, he said, will stand in Obama's way. They will not help Obama pass any of his laws.

Many Americans have not been happy with Obama. Because of this, many people who voted for Democrats in the past voted for Republicans on Tuesday.

Still, if Obama is unpopular, so are Republicans. Joe Biden is Obama's vice president. He argued that Republicans will need to work with Obama if they want to get anything done.

## Can They Get Things Done?

Obama is "ready to compromise," he said. Biden said he thinks the Republicans might also be willing to work with Obama. People are tired of Republicans and Democrats not being able to work together, he said.

People who worked for other presidents say Obama can get things done. Many presidents served their last two years with a Congress that disagreed with them.

President Obama, like any president, wants to finish strong, said William Galston. He was a member of President Bill Clinton's government. Clinton was also a Democrat who had to work with a Republican Congress.

If Obama wants his last two years to be successful he has to figure out a way to work with Congress, said Ken Duberstein. He served as chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. Reagan, a Republican, spent the last two years of his term of office with a Democratic Congress.

"There are ways to bridge the differences," said Duberstein. "I think there is a fork in the road."
