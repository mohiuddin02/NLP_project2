ATLANTA — Things were going well for college student Javon Butts.

Most days, it went like this: Start classes at 8 a.m., finish up around noon, then head off to work. His life as a student at Kennesaw State University (KSU) was far from perfect. But he was able to handle it.

And then his car broke down.

The car wasn't just a way to get around. It was his home as well.

He's not alone, says Marcy Stidum. She runs KSU's CARE center, which helps homeless students.

## Can't Afford Housing

Most colleges have students like Butts. They attend classes each day, do their schoolwork and blend in. But when other students go home at night, they have nowhere to go. They turn to their cars, school buildings and the couches or floors of friends.

Georgia is developing a program to help its homeless students. But for now, KSU is the only Georgia college with someone like Stidum.

"People say these students aren't homeless, they are in college," said Stidum. It is true, she said, that the cost of their classes is covered. But it's the other things like housing they can't afford. They are "living in their car and starving."

Since fall 2011, the college's CARE center has helped 61 homeless students. Including Butts.

Twenty-year old Butts is a second-year student from Gainesville. He came to KSU in 2012 after transferring from a South Carolina college.

Back then Butts lived in at KSU. His home was in a building with bedrooms for students called a dorm.

## Providing Support

But before he paid the third month's rent, his mother and sister asked him for help with their bills. Butts gave them his rent money. Unable to get the money back, he got further and further behind on his rent. Eventually, he was kicked out of the dorm.

"I wanted to look out for them," he said. But, he said, he's come to realize that "you have to look out for yourself."

During the 2012–2013 school year, more than 58,150 college students nationwide said they were homeless. But the real number is probably larger. Some students living on friends' couches, for example, don't consider themselves homeless. And others are too embarrassed to say anything.

Under Georgia's new program, each college will have someone like KSU's Stidum. They will provide support for homeless students.

These days Butts keeps pretty much to himself. The less other students know about his situation, the better. He has a hotel room but can't afford it for long. With Stidum's help, he is looking for a cheaper apartment. Once he has saved up enough money he plans to move back to a KSU dorm in the fall.

People like Stidum can already be found in other states. They not only help homeless students deal with college. They also teach life skills, such as paying bills.

## "It's Embarrassing"

That type of help is aiding students like Samuel Robinson, 38. He has been homeless for more than a year.

He didn't start out that way. After graduating from high school, Robinson worked low-paying, unskilled jobs for a while. He then left small-town Georgia for better opportunities in the Atlanta area. But again he found only low-paying work. He enrolled at KSU in 2010, and was slowly working his way through school. In 2012, he lost his job.

Stidum is helping Robinson figure out how to pay off the money he still owes KSU. Robinson hopes to catch up in time to sign up for summer classes. He is still living with friends. But now he has a job again.

Like Butts, Robinson never told his family about his struggle.

"I don't want pity," he said. "It's embarrassing to be an adult and be homeless."
