As the smell of barbecuing fills the air, two teens are playing hard. The boys are leading their teams in a game of pickup football.

Alex, 18, weaves across the field, making athletic catches. In the end, though, it is 15-year-old Sammy who returns a punt to win the game. As he runs downfield, Sammy turns to the cheering sideline. His face breaks into a smile. The madness of their lives is miles away.

Alex and Sammy live in a place where people get shot at all the time. To avoid getting hurt or worse, you have to think fast and run fast. Sometimes, as Sammy tells it, escaping death takes real luck. Sammy counts three near-misses in his young life.

## YMCA Brings Soldiers And Kids Together

Alex, Sammy and the other teens are part of a new YMCA program called Urban Warriors. The program pairs kids with people who know all about surviving in dangerous places: veterans — that is, retired soldiers.

The program's first group of teens all live in a tough Chicago neighborhood: Little Village.

Chicago has more shootings and killings every year than any other large U.S. city. Some neighborhoods are especially dangerous. Among these are Little Village, Englewood and Roseland.

Eddie Bocanegra helps run the new Urban Warriors program. Living with so much danger is hard on young people, he said. Urban Warriors is one small effort to help them.

All of the teens in Urban Warriors are regularly exposed to danger. Many are involved with gangs.

## Talking About Their Stories Helps

The vets and youths in the program share "war stories." They tell of losing friends and seeing people shot at. Each week, it seems, a kid arrives with a fresh battle story.

"I've seen people get shot," said Alex, whose mind flashes back to those events. "It does … mess my head up. But I am living it every day. So, like, I guess I put up with it."

Sammy has not one, but three "war stories" to tell.

"We passed through 24th and Millard, and some dude on a bike came out and started shooting, saying, 'Where you from, where you from?' We turned real quick. We ran across real quick. I was like, 'Let's go, let's go!'"

Sammy said that was the first shooting he recalled. The next was at his high school.

"Right when I walked outside they shot someone at the corner. Then they started chasing me and shooting. … I got away. Again. That was my second time."

In the third shooting, Sammy, who is not in a gang, escaped a spray of gunfire on a porch where he was sitting. As he rushed to get away, he fell down the porch stairs and landed in a good hiding place. "I got behind a tree luckily," he said. "They didn't see me."

## It's Good When Someone Understands

Veterans and the teens have serious talks together once a week. They talk about loyalty, belonging and manhood. They talk about image — that is, about the way other people see them.

The vets said they can understand the youths on some levels.

"They always said they had to be on point or aware or careful," said veteran Richard Rivera. "We told them we can relate a lot. Except you guys are fighting for a street corner, and we are fighting for a country."

Experts have been studying Urban Warriors to figure out how much it has been helping teens. One thing is already clear, though: The teens and veterans have grown close.
