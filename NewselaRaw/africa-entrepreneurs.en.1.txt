KAMPALA, Uganda â€” Madinah Nalukenge remembers when she began selling food at a bus terminal in the Ugandan capital. It was 2004 and she had only $10 left after a failed attempt to sell bed sheets.

Now she runs a catering business that makes up to $3,000 profit per month. For Nalukenge, 34, a single mother who only finished elementary school, her business is not only a way to make a living, it's also a source of pride.

She spends her days offering mashed plantains and greasy meats to workers in downtown Kampala.

"There is a lot of money to be made here," she said recently, her apron bulging with cash. "I need to stay focused."

She has a lot of competition, though: There are more than a dozen other women operating food stalls next to hers.

## A Growing Trend

Nalukenge is part of a growing trend in Africa, where more women are running their own businesses. The amount of female [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) today would have been unthinkable just 20 or 30 years ago.

Africa now has the highest growth rate of female-run businesses in the world, according to the World Bank.

About 63 percent of women in Africa who don't work in agriculture have their own small businesses, more than twice the worldwide rate, according to World Bank data.

For these women, it is the need to make money that drives them to start their own enterprises, not necessarily available opportunities.

## Starting Out Small

Women often start by running small retail or service businesses, selling things or providing a service. But some women who are luckier or more ambitious have started businesses that now employ thousands of people. Some of these projects break stereotypes about what women can do,  physically and socially, in societies that are still largely conservative.

"Traditionally women would sit at home and wait for the man to return home with a bag of groceries. This has been changing over time as women's dependence gradually reduces," said Thomas Bwire, an economist with Uganda's central bank. In a sign of the times, he said, Ugandan women now even work at road construction sites.

In sub-Saharan Africa, there are more women than men working in the informal sector, according to the International Labor Organization. The "informal sector" refers to businesses that are generally very small and do not pay taxes.

This is different than other regions, such as South and East Asia, where self-employed women usually work in homes, doing domestic work, according to the U.N. agency.

## Mouths To Feed

The food vendors in downtown Kampala have similar reasons for entering into private business: Hungry children, unpaid rent, violent or uncooperative partners. Most of them have long been single or were recently in failed relationships, an important detail because many insist their businesses are succeeding in part because of their independence on the home front. Many of the vendors have also enrolled their children in boarding school to make more time for work.

"They don't help and they never want to help," Nalukenge said of her former partners. "Yet even the little you get they want to take away from you. I was alone when I started this business."

Economists who study developing countries note that women joining the labor force can be a powerful force for global economic growth. Giving these women credit, loans to start business, can jump-start the process.

The investment bank Goldman Sachs has urged what it called "giving credit where it is due," noting that women's "increased bargaining power has the potential to create a virtuous cycle as female spending supports the development of human capital, which in turn will fuel economic growth in the years ahead."

## Wide Credit Gap

According to the World Bank, there is a $300 billion credit gap for female-owned businesses. This means that these businesses could use $300 billion in order to grow, but no one is willing to loan it to them.

The International Finance Corp. of the World Bank launched a $600 million fund in March to finance women-owned businesses in the developing world. The fund, called the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility, aims to work with local banks to lend money to 100,000 women entrepreneurs.

An entrepreneur is a person who starts his or her own business.

Across sub-Saharan Africa, where extreme poverty is still common in many places, stories of successful women entrepreneurs are accumulating.

A Kenyan woman, Mary Okello, is celebrated for starting a school inside a three-bedroom house that has since become a prestigious group of private schools. In Rwanda, Janet Nkubana has been recognized abroad for running a handicrafts company that employs more than 3,000 women whose baskets can be purchased at Macy's. The Nigerian Adenike Ogunlesi is famous for her "Ruff 'n' Tumble" clothing line for children, a business that she first operated out of a car trunk.

## Women "Surprised Themselves"

In Uganda, where most of the food is grown locally, many women have been drawn to catering. Their food stalls are ubiquitous, seen constantly, at transport terminals and open markets. Since the women are unable to get loans from banks, they start "cooperative" groups where they pool their savings together and take turns getting loans.

Rampant poverty is pushing women to take over "core family responsibilities" from men, according to Ugandan economist Fred Muhumuza, who has been advising Uganda's government on development policy. Women who have started their own small businesses "have surprised themselves by succeeding," he said.

Nalukenge, the food vendor in downtown Kampala, said she has kept her children in school and now owns two small plots of land.

On a recent evening, as she prepared to clean up and pack her saucepans, she pondered her unlikely journey from failed seller of bed sheets to successful caterer with a long line of loyal clients.

"We spend a lot of energy here," she said. "There's no resting. But at the end of the day we get our reward."
