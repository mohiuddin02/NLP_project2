ORLANDO, Fla.â€” Fake service-dog certificates, vests and harnesses for ordinary pets are showing up all over. Supporters of the disabled say this is creating big headaches for those who truly need their canine companions.

The problem has gotten so bad that the nation's largest service-dog group launched a campaign last week. It's asking the U.S. Department of Justice to take action.

Service dogs are trained to assist people with disabilities. People know that these dogs wear harnesses or vests, said Paul Mundell of Canine Companions for Independence.

So some businesses now sell the equipment to anybody who wants it, so they can take their dogs on an airplane with them, or into a store or restaurant, he said. "It happens all the time."
## Fake Vest On A Flight ...

Mundell was on a recent flight to Orlando. He said he saw a man with a tiny dog. The man walked off their flight, removed the dog's "service animal" vest, and left the airport. "It was quite clear that he was simply using the vest to get cabin privileges," Mundell said.

Under U.S. law, any businesses, governments and others that serve the public must allow service animals to go anywhere in their building that the public can go. Questions are limited. When it's not obvious what service an animal provides, workers may only ask if the service animal is needed because of a disability. Legally, they can't ask for proof. And some say that fact is being exploited.

Florida does not punish people who claim that their dog is a service animal when it is not, said Paul Edwards. He is the president of the Florida Council of the Blind. He and some others think it is reasonable to ask a disabled person to carry proof that his or her dog is a service animal.

But, Edwards added, "The danger is that you may throw the baby out with the bathwater."

Some supporters are worried that doing so may put a burden on people with disabilities. They would have to prove their dog is a service dog. But others say that humans are already facing more hassles from all the fake vests.
## ... And In A Restaurant

"Somebody will take Fluffy with them into a restaurant, and the dog will bark or snap at someone, or poop on the floor," said Kris Baker, 63, who lives in Orlando. That causes problems when people come in with a real service dog. "We get the questions and the resentment. It's harder for us."

Sometimes people will ask how they can get a vest for their untrained dog, she said.

"This is not something that is for pets," she said. "This is an indication of training that my dog and I have been through."

Luke McGregor agrees. On a flight home from New York last week, the 48-year-old saw a woman who claimed to have an "emotional-support dog." But it whined and scratched at its cage throughout the trip. That's behavior considered unacceptable in a trained service dog.

He could do little more than roll his eyes at the scene.
## Disabled Deal With The Fallout

McGregor uses a wheelchair and CCI dog. He knows he'll be left to deal with the fallout from such stunts.

"I'm already stopped in restaurants and grocery stores" by workers who wrongly tell him he cannot bring his dog in,  McGregor said. Evenutally enough people will be upset by all of the supposed service dogs. "And we will suffer for it."

In 2011, the Department of Justice said dogs are the only legal assistance animals. Before that, some people were claiming monkeys, snakes and other creatures were helping them cope with disabilities. The department also clarified the definition of a service dog as one that is trained to assist a disabled person.

There is no law against selling vests or harnesses printed with phony service dog logos, however.

A search of eBay under "service-dog patches" shows more than 22,000 sellers. CCI.org is trying to get 10,000 people to sign a letter to the Department of Justice. The letter, or petition, says the problem needs to be stopped.
