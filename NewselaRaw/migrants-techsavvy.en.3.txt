MOLIVOS, Greece â€” Hundreds of thousands of migrants are flowing into Europe. Many are using social media and smartphone apps to guide them.

Recently, Amr Zaidah, who is from Syria, crossed the sea from Turkey to Greece. He used GPS to help steer the boat that brought him and about about 30 other migrants to shore.

"I have researched our journey for more than two months," he said.

"I used social media networks to look into where to go, who is the best smuggler to hire and what stuff we needed for the trip," Zaidah said. Through the Internet, he learned about weather forecasts and wind patterns. He found out where to get the documents that he and his friends needed to continue. He used social media for the best ways to avoid being cheated by smugglers. Zaidah and other migrants rely on smugglers to take them across the sea.

## Who Needs A Map? Use A Cellphone

Many other migrants are using social media and apps to guide their journeys.

On one Facebook group, for example, Syrians and others share the names and telephone numbers of good smugglers in Turkey. They also warn of possible problems and give other advice.

The group calls itself al-Mushantateen. It combines the Arabic words for "suitcase" and "diaspora." A diaspora is a group of people who live outside their homeland. The Facebook group also includes posts by volunteers. They offer services like calling the coast guard to rescue a boat that turns over.

Zaidah and his group already know which border points they will cross. They also know hotels they can stay in and stores where they can get warm clothing.

## Doing Research Before Journey Pays Off

The migrants are constantly on their phones. They line up outside the offices of cellphone providers in Mytilene, Greece. They buy Greek phone numbers so they can connect to Facebook and the apps they use to communicate with others. They can use these numbers through the rest of Europe.

During the sea journey, they keep their phones in plastic bags to keep them dry. They land in Lesbos, a Greek island, chanting, "Thanks be to God." The first thing they do is take their phones out and joyously hug. Then they take group selfies on the shore. They call loved ones back in Turkey, Syria or Iraq, shouting, "We arrived in Greece!"

Despite social media, Zaidah and his friends still had serious problems in Turkey.

They and nearly 50 others, including 15 children, got lost in the woods. They were looking for the boat that would smuggle them to Greece. Their Syrian guide could not speak Turkish or figure out how to work his GPS. After nearly 12 hours, they found a departure area. They discovered it was run by a different smuggler.

The other smuggler was furious and threatened them.

## But Trek Is Still Dangerous

The group finally found their own smuggler. At dawn, he made them carry heavy boxes down to the beach. They had to assemble the boat themselves. Then the smuggler left them to steer the boat themselves.

All along the migrants' route, businesses have started up. In Izmir, Turkey, shoe shops sell life jackets. People on the street sell plastic bags to keep wallets and mobile phones dry, Zaidah said. Even floaties are sold for children.

In Lesbos, Arabic signs have gone up on storefronts. The prices for bottled water have risen. For a while, some Syrians and Iraqis sold fake documents. Then, Greek officials sped up the process for giving out the real documents, which are free. This put the people who sold fake documents out of business.
